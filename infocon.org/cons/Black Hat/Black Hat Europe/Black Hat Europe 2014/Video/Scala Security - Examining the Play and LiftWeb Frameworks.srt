1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,480
good afternoon I this is

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,180
a6 that talk I am

3
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:11,080
with only a couple people here so we're
gonna

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,019
we're just going to dislike hard have so

5
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:19,630
from just before we begin the just kinda
get an idea of where

6
00:00:19,630 --> 00:00:24,320
people are how many people I in this
room happen to be like full-time scholar

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:25,269
developers or

8
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:28,500
even part-time scar developers and any
iight

9
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,570
two guys strains are you attend the
stock

10
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:34,719
I great everybody else

11
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,210
kinda enterprise security consulting
things like that so that

12
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:43,170
I am any any other 10 gentle
relationship to Scala besides I'm a

13
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,550
developer a bit or

14
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:48,090
some sort of interest in assessing our
understanding its place in enterprise

15
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:51,440
act yep

16
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,840
yep exactly great and that's

17
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:58,420
um that's what we're for all about here
is a

18
00:00:58,420 --> 00:01:05,420
setup where to go but

19
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,280
it

20
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,920
it worked before

21
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:28,920
yep share

22
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:37,820
it was his fault sleep

23
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:40,680
us okay go her Australia

24
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:43,700
um so yeah

25
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:47,560
its connects up who are we I am Eric
business

26
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:52,980
I help a run a small security team out
over new york city called include

27
00:01:52,980 --> 00:01:53,510
security

28
00:01:53,510 --> 00:01:58,180
I am basically got together a bunch of
mild hacker buddies from cops if I

29
00:01:58,180 --> 00:02:01,940
contest from back in the day and I'm
better penetration testers and

30
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:05,250
we have applications mostly for so
compelling York City companies

31
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,660
um apollo fans

32
00:02:08,660 --> 00:02:12,420
the Carol for Android work on Android

33
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,520
think yet so um

34
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:19,420
polos on the the grand jury this
research

35
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:23,690
I am just kinda helping out presented I
also

36
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:26,960
we had a two interns help us out with
%uh the code that will be covering up

37
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,510
the ants

38
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:32,260
I'm so when I wants a meal thank you
very much and then the other hours

39
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:35,690
us the Canaima Stewart I outta

40
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:39,030
a middle of nowhere Michigan I'll

41
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:42,430
okay so a

42
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,630
yet

43
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:50,709
okay some slides got through I

44
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:56,100
I'll so what are we doing a scholar sows
Scala is essentially

45
00:02:56,100 --> 00:03:00,320
so scholars functional and
object-oriented

46
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:03,489
what's another for paradigm language

47
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:07,989
it the important point that is compiled
down to Java bytecode

48
00:03:07,989 --> 00:03:11,340
excuse on JVM sets Kenny Perry have an
existing

49
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:14,360
infrastructure Minister %um I am

50
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,180
the webapps there so intense like doggy

51
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,769
and all the same kinda there's a problem
there as

52
00:03:21,769 --> 00:03:24,739
and the when the main thing that they
out about scars that really strong

53
00:03:24,739 --> 00:03:25,300
typing

54
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:28,739
and was on functional stuff has I but

55
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:31,810
you have to use the type system
correctly but if you do

56
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:34,860
they can catch some air yeah and the

57
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,160
you know historically scholars about
ten-years-old

58
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:41,600
I but the web frameworks are still
pretty

59
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:45,410
immature reminds me of Java in the early
to mid 2000's

60
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:48,430
with the kinda struts one kinda thing so

61
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:50,240
there still

62
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,090
just as they're creating the the
framework so I only have we also need to

63
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:55,520
throw that in a throw that in

64
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:59,270
so they're still not quite totally
mature but they're still pretty good for

65
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:02,930
for where the they are I

66
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:07,510
so what a what a scholar in web
applications look like so here's a an

67
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:09,040
example play ap

68
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,780
I just some very basic hello world one
so on the top you've got what the view

69
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,560
looks like

70
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,020
I you know you've got the at references
to

71
00:04:17,020 --> 00:04:20,230
to show where the variables are in the
fuel/air

72
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:23,450
I and you have a route that essentially
maps

73
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:26,800
a type 2 class ands I

74
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,800
the typing their really helps out a lot
from security obviously

75
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,340
I'm in other languages PHP or what have
you

76
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:38,290
are you going to have to taken the input
from the

77
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:42,610
to get requests cast it as an int if you
remember the castle residents

78
00:04:42,610 --> 00:04:46,550
I come up with the effective coating
policies and patterns to

79
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,960
to ensure that that's always what you do
and everybody

80
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:55,140
adheres to it I'm but this is much
simpler you you can define types

81
00:04:55,140 --> 00:04:58,280
and sub out: data should types pretty
nice

82
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,240
um know when you're creating a

83
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,910
play up for example it has kind of some
auto generation

84
00:05:05,910 --> 00:05:10,340
a type type things very similar to how
when you create a Ruby on Rails app

85
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:14,860
got a whole directory structure it

86
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:19,130
up to this is the problem that these two
were switched I gotta see you guys

87
00:05:19,130 --> 00:05:22,230
on where we're hoping that you guys are
mostly penetration testers

88
00:05:22,230 --> 00:05:26,480
a scholar dads and what will you getting
out this are

89
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:29,500
the coverage other four topics freight
so

90
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:33,320
and we're just briefly gonna go over
like what scholar ap stack is something

91
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,120
we've actually just got over that so

92
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:39,630
that site then we're going over the last
top 10 and the main thing here's a in

93
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,400
the white paper that we created for the
stock

94
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:44,550
is just a buncha patterns an anti
patterns freid so

95
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:48,330
I'm here's the good thing that you do
his the the bad behavior here's the good

96
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:49,070
behavior

97
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:52,260
I thing going through all that so this
is really

98
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,440
ideally I could see this as hey I'm a
penetration tester

99
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,500
and I'm bouts to you an app I that
scholar I've never done a Skype before

100
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:03,390
what are the patterns I'm looking for
what things I need to some

101
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:07,570
ethically I look for in the code I look
for the config files

102
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:11,030
stuff like that the white paper has a
lot more views

103
00:06:11,030 --> 00:06:14,100
I you notice all these good patterns all
these bad patterns

104
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,600
we we can obviously go over all them in
the talks so we're just gonna hit

105
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,960
some other more interesting ones and
then we have to you a

106
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,180
to code a to Pisa coder to code

107
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:28,440
coding project so should say that we're
gonna release probably tomorrow

108
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,900
um wall just a quick demo them today I
am

109
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:38,620
it so we're just gonna dive into all of
top 10 South

110
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:43,860
for those who are intimately familiar
with the of stopped and just kinda not

111
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,240
like pretend you have heard the stuff
before I am

112
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:50,680
for everybody else this may be some

113
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:55,340
love it in your fridge so

114
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,730
with went out this or where I'll never

115
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:02,540
and the nice thing about is if used
properly his knee

116
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:05,850
think the API that they want to use

117
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:10,210
a and carrots here inquiries directing a
primary squares

118
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:15,410
a there are some guys is because they
made it very flexible for developers

119
00:07:15,410 --> 00:07:18,470
so its don't use

120
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:22,030
the in raw or the party API that

121
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:25,410
using wrong and a check for this a

122
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:28,720
there's a parameter that things with in
rotates

123
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,000
call have valid in this SQL are it
doesn't actually

124
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,780
check anything it's just kinda the sort
of a

125
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,750
on faith thing for developers to say
yeah I've actually validate this SQL

126
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:44,520
so this is kinda funny so I privatize
crazy guys know

127
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,340
prevents equal injection pray I so
dynamic where is

128
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,460
rock where is that's where you cannot
see congestion problems so the

129
00:07:51,460 --> 00:07:52,660
developers at the list with

130
00:07:52,660 --> 00:07:56,540
framework said okay every time we're
gonna have some sort of brought sequel

131
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,160
query

132
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:00,880
have a um somebody signs off on it you
know kinda like

133
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,760
OpenBSD two people have to check on
everything that gets checked in I'm so

134
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,930
they created this

135
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:10,200
I have validated the sequel and you have
to put your literally put your name

136
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:13,960
on it I wanted to say that you have a
look at this eagle on that it's OK

137
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:18,680
so if you're auditing I a list app I
would just grab for that

138
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:22,840
hey look to see all the places where
that guy has done Ross people and

139
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:26,420
perhaps he just put his name their her
name there and did not validate the

140
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:26,920
sequel

141
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:30,660
um and more often than not that's that's
the case

142
00:08:30,660 --> 00:08:33,950
I cuz it %um folks are gonna do this

143
00:08:33,950 --> 00:08:37,800
when i when they think that primary
squares are preventing them from doing

144
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:40,000
things like a highly dynamic

145
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,340
I am where's chains were close chains
and things like that

146
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:48,400
at

147
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:51,970
here's a couple other gotchas and and
with webOS

148
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:55,440
a sequel air and by the way that this
fall here

149
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:58,930
if let's just their hands up speak out
if

150
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:03,540
the if you have questions on for will
make it a discussion in covering

151
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:07,100
cover the topics in the things that you
guys are interested in I

152
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:10,170
so here's a mother got this right so
you've got various

153
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:13,180
unsafe functions and object calls I am

154
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:17,990
the not not all these have that little
primary talked about

155
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:20,990
so if you let so these if you're

156
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:24,140
if you're just doing kind of the
Semantic Analysis & Co these are the

157
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,380
same so you're looking for

158
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:29,730
I you're looking for calls to these guys
and looking for those parameters

159
00:09:29,730 --> 00:09:33,650
a within those method calls and an
object's instantiations

160
00:09:33,650 --> 00:09:36,980
um and then on the right we've got

161
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:41,300
the safer options the the more correct
way of doing it that I wont bite you in

162
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,770
the butt for a sequel I

163
00:09:42,770 --> 00:09:48,050
effing there

164
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:51,960
cool a beso and Scala play which is the
other friend Mark

165
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:55,230
I'm they have the an arm R&R I

166
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:59,830
RM which also the tix acquires internet
cameras cars

167
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:03,960
I'll but you can you can actually

168
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:07,610
you can also do raw string formatting
and bypass all the checks for this

169
00:10:07,610 --> 00:10:08,200
feature

170
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:13,160
the they let developers basically you
know have whatever the versatility they

171
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,650
want so

172
00:10:14,650 --> 00:10:18,910
if you notice on this pattern here just
taking scholars string

173
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:22,770
I'm putting in arm parameters into the

174
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:28,170
first person s in that and that I D and
just Graham them showing in there

175
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:31,230
and that more for slow

176
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:35,780
a single injection yeah and I notice
that we just kind of jumped in without

177
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:37,720
addressing the frameworks as a whole

178
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:42,590
so obviously there's multiple frameworks
for every language

179
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:46,320
a in scholars like case the two most
popular are left and play

180
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:50,020
so that's why we're here covering these
two I am

181
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:53,890
as far as the future goes I we found

182
00:10:53,890 --> 00:10:57,160
that play is seems to be more popular

183
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:00,850
ands lift seems to be be being
maintained less and less

184
00:11:00,850 --> 00:11:04,040
I I'm will cover at the towards the end

185
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,420
kind of where they compare against each
other but

186
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:10,490
I wouldn't be surprised if two years
from now like everyone's doing play and

187
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:12,210
not many people are doing with because

188
00:11:12,210 --> 00:11:16,140
the just the amount of developer
activity we saw on the project has just

189
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:18,570
decreased in the last year and a half on
left

190
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:23,300
and increase significantly on play I so
just little context for those of you

191
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:24,710
that don't do the

192
00:11:24,710 --> 00:11:27,770
these kinds of remarks in your
day-to-day um

193
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:31,950
but yeah so when talking about sequel
injection in particular

194
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:34,790
these are in layers to a dorm

195
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:38,030
and the Mozilla mapper I am

196
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:42,330
are basically you're go two ways of
doing this you can not use and/or and

197
00:11:42,330 --> 00:11:43,940
where do I see for yourself

198
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:47,080
big she's gonna shoot yourself in the
foot every time the

199
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:51,060
your not going to you're gonna forget to
validate input you're not gonna match

200
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,230
single quotes up

201
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:56,460
I used or am there players they're there
to be safe Center to help you

202
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:00,080
I it

203
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:03,700
so on other on other topics have
injections

204
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:07,020
a besides sequel injection said

205
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,150
just like any other language you have

206
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:13,910
data flows and in the web out great so
you can have to manage action XPath

207
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,660
induction held up injection et cetera

208
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:19,000
a luckily for for

209
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:22,830
the a the penetration tester Security
Auditor what have you

210
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:26,630
it's pretty simple to find his I'm just
gonna grab through

211
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:31,160
looking for imports a process and then
I'm similar to mph Pierre

212
00:12:31,160 --> 00:12:34,810
her pearl how they have tactics execute
commands

213
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:38,630
as you go through on these guys have
this exclamation mark

214
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,780
so it's really small and you might miss
it if you just casually browsing and her

215
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,220
bf to know what to look for

216
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:47,660
on you have to look for the import
process and then also the exclamation

217
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:49,260
mark on

218
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:54,859
so

219
00:12:54,859 --> 00:12:57,869
and so

220
00:12:57,869 --> 00:13:02,639
left is kinda nice and has a bunch
features are you bake 10 pins simply

221
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:03,729
because it seems to me

222
00:13:03,729 --> 00:13:07,689
mormon enterprise our entire framework
on its got

223
00:13:07,689 --> 00:13:11,129
these a this the a budget classes

224
00:13:11,129 --> 00:13:14,809
call in the mega pro user the names came

225
00:13:14,809 --> 00:13:18,039
and there are any built-in and you can
use them

226
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:21,399
and they'll store names emails passwords
and

227
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:26,579
to use management for you 'em survey
sickly

228
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:30,189
a one thing to keep in mind is that

229
00:13:30,189 --> 00:13:33,220
you can shoot yourself in the foot if
you go out anyway

230
00:13:33,220 --> 00:13:36,849
a which is say in this particular case

231
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:40,029
there's a liner notes use it at Scala

232
00:13:40,029 --> 00:13:43,519
if you change the is destroyed session
on login

233
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,339
to false year not going to be renewing
the sessions

234
00:13:47,339 --> 00:13:50,519
unsuccessful login so you can get
session fixation our

235
00:13:50,519 --> 00:13:55,239
'em so again pattern to look for in the
code base

236
00:13:55,239 --> 00:13:59,519
is to see if they actually using the
approach user API

237
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:04,499
I am just by seeing if their regular
classes for their users

238
00:14:04,499 --> 00:14:08,429
a.m. are inheriting cool

239
00:14:08,429 --> 00:14:14,139
a and also clay play doesn't handle
users as much as lieth does

240
00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:19,059
on lift actually tries to handle a lot
more things for you then played us

241
00:14:19,059 --> 00:14:22,929
on so from that perspective list kinda
controls

242
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:26,429
user management a lot more than played
us iron

243
00:14:26,429 --> 00:14:31,859
and and the the left guys really expels
that as a feature that they go on and on

244
00:14:31,859 --> 00:14:32,579
about how

245
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:35,859
you know you don't have to worry about
the stuff and to some degree

246
00:14:35,859 --> 00:14:39,720
you don't know makes a pretty nice I
would love to see play have more about

247
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,759
stuff available

248
00:14:40,759 --> 00:14:45,769
I okay so play though does have this
interesting thing with the SIS

249
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:49,199
the session cookies right so very
similar to an eight-speed on that how

250
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:49,609
you have

251
00:14:49,609 --> 00:14:52,999
you stay and various other I'm kinda MVC
frameworks

252
00:14:52,999 --> 00:14:56,489
I am and play you they have the session
cookies

253
00:14:56,489 --> 00:15:01,579
I am a with they have an application
secret on the configuration politician

254
00:15:01,579 --> 00:15:02,109
dot com

255
00:15:02,109 --> 00:15:04,630
and that secret kinda

256
00:15:04,630 --> 00:15:07,860
does a the signing with it

257
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:11,310
yeah size with a so that they'll do it
right signing on that

258
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,340
and they hit by the fall there's no
session timeouts

259
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:18,720
so something look out for their I the
two types of cookies

260
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,240
and yet it's cookies and session cookie
flocking

261
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,280
flash has nothing to do with Adobe it
basically

262
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:29,530
means that supposed to it temporary
value value from a calculation answers

263
00:15:29,530 --> 00:15:30,790
to hang out temporarily

264
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:33,900
the key thing is that Flash cookies

265
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:37,930
are not signed at all so you can Nick
and you can't answer them

266
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:41,290
so don't put access leveller important
state

267
00:15:41,290 --> 00:15:44,470
in the fact that yes so a little
different

268
00:15:44,470 --> 00:15:48,490
for my how is be done that has a h-back
foundation there

269
00:15:48,490 --> 00:15:51,830
I am so there's some good patterns a

270
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:56,830
how to use that at the bottom alright so

271
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,930
getting on to cross is getting
everybody's favorite thing

272
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:04,780
a so lift and play actually do this

273
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:08,850
pretty well on and I think you're seeing
kinda the same here they

274
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:12,890
by default do have pretty good patterns
I'm for security

275
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:16,440
their arse a lot of gotchas and

276
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:21,720
will leave a show you a ISO a couple
people left for the people remaining in

277
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,240
the couple sides will have a

278
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:27,510
one build configuration 10:00 this thing
that will go over that we reported

279
00:16:27,510 --> 00:16:31,180
the today I'm so

280
00:16:31,180 --> 00:16:34,910
well we'll go over that an activator in
a couple sites but I'm

281
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:39,240
back to this cross-site scripting a

282
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:42,900
so in lift they really get the notion I
love

283
00:16:42,900 --> 00:16:46,930
a you first the you you're supposed to
keep everything on the view

284
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:50,610
completely separate from a any live
logic whatsoever

285
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:55,320
and when you're doing that kinda stuff
lift has this notion hav

286
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:58,069
I what's that the DOM rendering

287
00:16:58,069 --> 00:17:00,949
stuff as a name for the

288
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:04,480
the diamond ring thing that does it
keeps ticking on the server side to keep

289
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,189
the whole

290
00:17:05,189 --> 00:17:08,480
I instanceof the DOM so that it can the

291
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:12,089
generated and then just push it out all
at once and that's really awesome

292
00:17:12,089 --> 00:17:14,459
because if you have the whole thing
there

293
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:18,069
then you can analyze it and prevent
things like ross is good thing for the

294
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:18,669
most part

295
00:17:18,669 --> 00:17:23,799
I so that makes a really nice patterns
perspective all you have to do is keep

296
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:24,169
your

297
00:17:24,169 --> 00:17:28,100
your view exactly how they they tell you
and you just never have cross escaping

298
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:28,590
problem

299
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:33,029
I'm to ain't anything

300
00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:36,049
so what does this look like

301
00:17:36,049 --> 00:17:39,490
on the top you have a a list web a
template

302
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:43,049
so it's kinda have these a XML nodes a

303
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:47,600
tags: what have you Nana hairs the
server side code

304
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:53,440
that spits it out so and then

305
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,399
what you get is on the bottom this gets
rendered to the screen doesn't get

306
00:17:57,399 --> 00:17:58,600
executed gets rendered

307
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,679
it's just naturally encoded as part of
it so

308
00:18:01,679 --> 00:18:04,740
as part of the types there it's just saw
it's actually code

309
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:08,159
and play

310
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:11,529
the user's these the template they call

311
00:18:11,529 --> 00:18:17,149
world template this escapes a use its
not sketch for him quite might fall

312
00:18:17,149 --> 00:18:20,850
but they are again like this flexible

313
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:24,289
jeans and a key thing in both these
frameworks a

314
00:18:24,289 --> 00:18:28,139
where if you actions

315
00:18:28,139 --> 00:18:31,580
look there's two ways actually turn off
the skipping and one of them is you can

316
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,740
turn it off in the template

317
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:36,059
so this is the template own right here

318
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:39,360
and it as you can see it a sinner a
message

319
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:42,850
from the user and it displays a GN this

320
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:46,409
HTML template directive

321
00:18:46,409 --> 00:18:49,450
this turns of the issue me

322
00:18:49,450 --> 00:18:53,100
so if you have any message to comes in
here that Scott

323
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:53,920
you know

324
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:58,310
no season but it will just get a easy
thing to do

325
00:18:58,310 --> 00:19:01,500
for auditing a player is just so Reptar
for that

326
00:19:01,500 --> 00:19:04,790
so crap that's our HTML through your
whole

327
00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:10,160
fuel/air and find where they screwed up
and then also from the defensive side

328
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:13,800
if the plays part if you're still see I
am

329
00:19:13,800 --> 00:19:17,360
it's really easy to just do a check in
hook a or maybe a nightly

330
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:21,080
I'm run and just do a basic semantic
analysis I

331
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:24,660
you've got your set love as she males
are you know are safe

332
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:28,370
and then you just have it alert you
every night when there's something that

333
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:29,240
you know is not safe

334
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:32,430
and that way you in and you can sleep
well at night knowing that

335
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:35,530
the ones you've signed off on a good and
then anything

336
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:39,010
on the nightly other on the nineteen you
know that semantic analysis

337
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:42,530
it'll kick out to you so you can sleep
well at night that you won't have

338
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:43,660
process scripting problems

339
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:47,370
there's another way to screw it up so
that you can also check for

340
00:19:47,370 --> 00:19:50,860
say at this and this is the other way on
this is actually

341
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:54,020
on screen at the code a so near garissa

342
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:58,180
regardless in the template a.m. if you
go and

343
00:19:58,180 --> 00:20:01,970
in output things as text HTML they won't
use the template system and just

344
00:20:01,970 --> 00:20:05,470
no go ahead and but stuff out to

345
00:20:05,470 --> 00:20:08,590
the browser yet so stick to the tall
templating

346
00:20:08,590 --> 00:20:12,690
and you might want to do this if you
just like pushing out raw bytes for

347
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:17,030
for download or streaming something in
real time I'm so there's there's a flame

348
00:20:17,030 --> 00:20:17,940
need for this

349
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:21,240
I and that's why it's there abuts

350
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:24,910
as he can also grab for this kind of
pattern a

351
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:28,390
you know look for as and and see

352
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:31,890
what kinda MIME types there up putting
so

353
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:36,110
the internet here years actually I'm
using the type system for you

354
00:20:36,110 --> 00:20:39,140
an example he's in a bad system for you
so

355
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:42,760
a you go and play here a bank account
and it takes a number

356
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:47,420
and this one and skull let you are

357
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:50,630
play will let you the specify the type

358
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:55,980
for that parameter can't so the upside
to this is if someone tries to

359
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,990
do this essay collection or

360
00:20:58,990 --> 00:21:02,140
Bali a single injection into that
parameter

361
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:05,400
the across a script for president what I
yeah

362
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,000
that to cover so in a in a throwing
error

363
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:12,550
okay iran is care direct object
references

364
00:21:12,550 --> 00:21:16,130
a very very straightforward here its its
just like

365
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:19,530
pretty much every other language at your
standard sources in your sayings

366
00:21:19,530 --> 00:21:22,810
I am the with

367
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:28,030
with the some Platero I'm talkin to
myself play does have one feature makes

368
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:28,960
this kinda stuff

369
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:32,130
easier above from left him play you have

370
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:36,310
pretty standard problems I'm with a
direct object references

371
00:21:36,310 --> 00:21:39,390
um in play though

372
00:21:39,390 --> 00:21:43,140
you have the concept of security traits
which are pretty cool

373
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:46,220
so security traits are kind of I

374
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:49,980
like typing a your execution of code

375
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:54,500
so you can say re: um this code here

376
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:57,680
has to have this straight and you can
find traits dynamically

377
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,660
around and then once you define a trade
for a scenario

378
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:06,780
I it's just always a factor that
scenario so I can say I every time I

379
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:10,570
access this object or something the
street has to be here

380
00:22:10,570 --> 00:22:13,720
and the trade is checking for a a user
role

381
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:18,270
or something of that nature so traits
and play make authorization checks

382
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:22,780
a lot easier I which help for preventing
things like this

383
00:22:22,780 --> 00:22:27,070
right so there's no presuming that user
input here in the bad pattern

384
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:30,480
is imminent you know there's no single
injection there but you can still have

385
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,070
direct object reference and access other
accounts

386
00:22:33,070 --> 00:22:37,260
I'm but once you create a security trait
for the account owner

387
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:40,270
then you tie that to to the access

388
00:22:40,270 --> 00:22:44,840
that object and you're good to

389
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:48,340
use of two you still have to create the
traits properly

390
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:51,840
for it she don't do the checks in the
traits rate and

391
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:57,370
the trees aren't doing anything to help
you and moving onto

392
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:01,050
misconfiguration so when you turn both
these things on there they're kinda in

393
00:23:01,050 --> 00:23:01,990
developer mode

394
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:05,150
and there's lotsa for both their
messages they give you

395
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:08,750
a in certain cases they hit the sack
traces I am

396
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:12,400
you presence screenshots his fall other
basically

397
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:17,060
what it's doing there is we're trying to
we're trying to do across a script on a

398
00:23:17,060 --> 00:23:17,690
route

399
00:23:17,690 --> 00:23:21,620
I it's expecting an integer and it's
just spitting out like a

400
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:24,900
that route still good but here's all the
other routes what are you just try any

401
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,480
of his other routes and here's the types
that they're all expecting

402
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,650
why don't you just trial the types in
all the routes go for it

403
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:36,730
I'll K

404
00:23:36,730 --> 00:23:40,570
so as

405
00:23:40,570 --> 00:23:43,640
short time about it the yes so

406
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:47,210
basically there's a one in the on the

407
00:23:47,210 --> 00:23:50,400
key things I got this on I and so on

408
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,530
play users for their main configuration
file on something called application dot

409
00:23:54,530 --> 00:23:54,880
com

410
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:58,850
I it's made by this is like the plague
company is called tight a thing

411
00:23:58,850 --> 00:24:03,850
and a they have this format which is
kind of a human oriented format so you

412
00:24:03,850 --> 00:24:04,320
can do

413
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:09,200
chase on properties file or however what
however you want to basically make

414
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,390
I'm hierarchy on occasions the config
file you can stick it in there

415
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:18,110
I one of the important items in this can
take follows an application that secret

416
00:24:18,110 --> 00:24:22,399
I which I if you leave it in there it
stay static

417
00:24:22,399 --> 00:24:25,529
so when you restart the app it's always
going to be the same thing

418
00:24:25,529 --> 00:24:29,379
so he ever leaves open source code I
don't know like if your Roku

419
00:24:29,379 --> 00:24:33,289
making dead center job a play I'm you
don't want to embed application secret

420
00:24:33,289 --> 00:24:34,440
in their you want to

421
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:38,759
have the user created dynamically I or
else you end up with this which is what

422
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:39,779
people deployed

423
00:24:39,779 --> 00:24:43,700
and when they're trying did use a play
to connect to Amazon

424
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:47,019
s3 issue for roku on there has static

425
00:24:47,019 --> 00:24:50,659
application secret so now you know
everybody's up paciencia and less that

426
00:24:50,659 --> 00:24:51,759
that developer

427
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:55,970
goes in changes the app secret which
they're not gonna do cuz they forget

428
00:24:55,970 --> 00:24:59,320
or they just don't consider that as
their grabbing this library to use in

429
00:24:59,320 --> 00:24:59,789
their app

430
00:24:59,789 --> 00:25:03,879
I'm so something interesting to think
about is looking to the dependencies if

431
00:25:03,879 --> 00:25:04,419
you're out

432
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:08,049
and saying I what open source defenses
are there

433
00:25:08,049 --> 00:25:11,330
on and what problems to have in those
dependencies like

434
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:15,080
a heart for the configuration secrets
and things like that I

435
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,759
so yep that's the I guess that's a0
there something like you can just get on

436
00:25:18,759 --> 00:25:20,850
github search traffic fish in that
secret

437
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:25,179
and scholar files are installed projects
and you'll find other people's hard

438
00:25:25,179 --> 00:25:25,669
coded

439
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:29,759
application secrets a company's site
push out code like that

440
00:25:29,759 --> 00:25:33,080
okay

441
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:36,519
and lifts the main config files called
but Scala

442
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:39,750
um clarinet whatever

443
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:42,960
22 yes so lift

444
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,159
the the default environmentalist iOS
developer mode

445
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:51,070
I they also have a test mode when you're
in developer motor test load

446
00:25:51,070 --> 00:25:54,830
I everything everything is available up

447
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:59,190
nice a so everything is available
meaning

448
00:25:59,190 --> 00:26:03,659
he gives you full error messages for
stock traces oppose the other

449
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:07,429
things that it does in developer mode
same Napoli is the same FAA

450
00:26:07,429 --> 00:26:10,730
but the comment yeah associate not is

451
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:15,149
the not just kinda routing layer a site
map in lift is

452
00:26:15,149 --> 00:26:18,559
basically you're kinda before ako later
access control air

453
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:22,970
that defines all the ways somebody can
access

454
00:26:22,970 --> 00:26:24,460
URL's in your

455
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:27,720
%uh left out and I can get very simple
such as

456
00:26:27,720 --> 00:26:31,270
if they hit this URL like in a rout
style then

457
00:26:31,270 --> 00:26:34,920
great then they they access this URL

458
00:26:34,920 --> 00:26:38,020
working a very complex a if they have
this role

459
00:26:38,020 --> 00:26:41,940
if it's between this time and this time
and all these other constraints that

460
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,620
allow that

461
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:46,510
in there so on lift a it's a very very
strong

462
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:50,120
authorization system I and disabling
that

463
00:26:50,120 --> 00:26:53,130
authorization system the weakens the app

464
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:57,200
so deftly look in the butt scholar file
and see if they disabled site map

465
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:01,800
I cuz if they did they're gonna screw up
a lot to site map gives them a lot

466
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:06,460
um yeah oh the other thing is the

467
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:10,290
the but we haven't talked about the will
cover the CSRF good in the sack

468
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:15,770
but it helps list by the fall protect
against the SRS if you deploy anything

469
00:27:15,770 --> 00:27:16,570
in tests were

470
00:27:16,570 --> 00:27:20,320
or developer mode its gonna stop that
protection so

471
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:23,950
basically never deploy and test
developer but make sure your device

472
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:27,580
people insure that it's impossible to
ever deploy something

473
00:27:27,580 --> 00:27:31,679
on the Internet contest to develop
promote has a few if you leave it open

474
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,750
you're gonna get screwed the

475
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:39,450
so one other things if you use the
default and

476
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:43,809
API's for end users and left is

477
00:27:43,809 --> 00:27:46,880
list stores the passwords be entered
into the

478
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,290
into the database B&B crypt I

479
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:54,030
and what it does is it goes okay on year
rushing user

480
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:57,340
you the password okay I'm in the crib
that and

481
00:27:57,340 --> 00:28:00,540
repent and be cynical onto that
trendiness

482
00:28:00,540 --> 00:28:04,100
01 things though is that move does check
to see

483
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:09,860
both passed without a database I if it
doesn't start with a be semi colon it's

484
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,230
an issue with the sha-1 hash

485
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:15,430
and sanitary it like so so basically
older systems you might see sha-1

486
00:28:15,430 --> 00:28:18,920
past passwords said and said be yeah
that's our main takeaway

487
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:23,230
is a for auditing and older left out
look look at the password hashes

488
00:28:23,230 --> 00:28:26,870
a this if it's not a black box if it's a
great box and just check if they have

489
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,650
the old ashes or the new hampshire's

490
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:31,700
that the old houses see if you can get
them to migrating users

491
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:36,270
call cool things to lift geyser a lot
more proactive about security and they

492
00:28:36,270 --> 00:28:40,060
they really think about it a lot more
than anybody else's car community

493
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:43,540
I'm so one thing that thinking about is

494
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:49,300
sensitive data in your right so you have
credit cards coming in Europe %eh i &&

495
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:53,890
PIII and things like that what about a
filtering layer that automatically looks

496
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:55,100
for that sensitive data

497
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:58,560
and you there the nullifies it or

498
00:28:58,560 --> 00:29:02,400
sanitizes in some manner so that's
something they're adding to the next

499
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:03,210
version of live

500
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:06,270
left the version 3 and

501
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:09,750
then they also have this object
lifestyle call back mechanism where

502
00:29:09,750 --> 00:29:12,810
almost like a triggering like fashion
like it when you are

503
00:29:12,810 --> 00:29:16,920
access this object or when you modify
the subject you can register call backs

504
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:20,390
so for that you can do kind of column
level one row level on corruption

505
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:23,889
databases

506
00:29:23,889 --> 00:29:27,009
play says forget that stuff you guys
deal with it

507
00:29:27,009 --> 00:29:31,479
so

508
00:29:31,479 --> 00:29:35,219
so I kinda okay so basically

509
00:29:35,219 --> 00:29:38,369
the same app Phillip its kinda really
complex but the

510
00:29:38,369 --> 00:29:42,039
take away from it is that you can set
really really fine grain access rules

511
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:46,259
on you can say oh yes this person in the
course be logged in

512
00:29:46,259 --> 00:29:50,229
are them this authentication role and
it's between this time a day and I'll

513
00:29:50,229 --> 00:29:55,169
yeah I'm unsure yes so what about the
partial function yes

514
00:29:55,169 --> 00:30:00,109
so basically other developers a go ahead
and the right

515
00:30:00,109 --> 00:30:03,349
the logic for mapping the

516
00:30:03,349 --> 00:30:06,759
requests to resources the partial
functions

517
00:30:06,759 --> 00:30:09,830
and basically you can still call backs

518
00:30:09,830 --> 00:30:13,119
and they're all stuck in this giant
think there's a queue

519
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:16,460
and whenever something comes up

520
00:30:16,460 --> 00:30:20,159
a request comes up they look to the
Stephen Siller who handles that

521
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:23,629
and it's not handle its its not served
up so

522
00:30:23,629 --> 00:30:27,309
its effectively had like a whitelist
cool

523
00:30:27,309 --> 00:30:30,690
your plan doesn't

524
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:34,099
have that but yeah place not down with
the authorization larisa

525
00:30:34,099 --> 00:30:38,229
they kinda let let you besides beside
the security traits

526
00:30:38,229 --> 00:30:42,359
and they don't really have a
full-featured authorization layer is

527
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:47,119
that anything like the site map that's
built in site map kinda does more for

528
00:30:47,119 --> 00:30:47,599
you

529
00:30:47,599 --> 00:30:52,509
I am play with this cutie trades gives
you more

530
00:30:52,509 --> 00:30:55,519
expressiveness and lets you do more I

531
00:30:55,519 --> 00:30:58,849
there's this thing called deadbolt which
the everyone's moving to

532
00:30:58,849 --> 00:31:02,070
a that kinda this have more
full-featured think

533
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:05,489
a closer to site map I'll

534
00:31:05,489 --> 00:31:09,539
so deadbolt is a is it like a third
party

535
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:12,729
dan stop are to play itself at so

536
00:31:12,729 --> 00:31:16,190
across as creepy crossover request
forgery so

537
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:20,099
one in the and 10 things that happened
doesn't affect

538
00:31:20,099 --> 00:31:24,320
as the way lift is engineered is that
all the form elements

539
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,870
names and such get replaced by these
goods and

540
00:31:27,870 --> 00:31:31,159
the goods change per session this is and
wall

541
00:31:31,159 --> 00:31:34,990
and some in the parliament the end a
that parts here

542
00:31:34,990 --> 00:31:38,100
you can see that our pilot was actually
change within the session

543
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:41,960
so when we say good we just mean like
what but the format looks like it's not

544
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:42,620
really a

545
00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:46,789
ok good in like Microsoft world is a
fully random number that's usually like

546
00:31:46,789 --> 00:31:49,159
a 128 that's random numbers something
like that

547
00:31:49,159 --> 00:31:53,529
so we're not talking it fully random
number on some ovett is randomize

548
00:31:53,529 --> 00:31:57,610
so the highlighted yellow part is the
randomized partner session session

549
00:31:57,610 --> 00:32:02,190
okay so happen that is based on your
session and I think thirty that's a bit

550
00:32:02,190 --> 00:32:06,740
is based on this particular request and
that's built into Howell

551
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:11,620
lift operates so it kinda takes the hold
on rendering layer away from you in this

552
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:13,210
part is that they added this

553
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:16,759
randomization into the inputs and when
they take that

554
00:32:16,759 --> 00:32:21,159
player away from you I'm they actually
give you something which is this crosses

555
00:32:21,159 --> 00:32:25,549
request forgery protection and that's
built into all the stops

556
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:31,590
which is pretty nice time so you're
short %uh some sort of cross site

557
00:32:31,590 --> 00:32:32,990
scripting combination attack

558
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:36,559
and short a them screwing up with the
random number generator

559
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:39,690
and you're going to be you're gonna be
covered with CSR

560
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:45,160
on a list that I'm play so play has

561
00:32:45,160 --> 00:32:49,860
if a CSRF as well a and take away from
your summation it's turned on there's

562
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,780
two ways you can do and you informally

563
00:32:51,780 --> 00:32:56,630
a which is rapper in that role template
ensure the CSR token value is added to

564
00:32:56,630 --> 00:32:57,170
request

565
00:32:57,170 --> 00:33:01,030
I or you can use the libras the call CSR

566
00:33:01,030 --> 00:33:05,840
checked yes sir a token whenever you get
to it whenever and plans being executed

567
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:09,940
up so really simple just Graham through
if you're

568
00:33:09,940 --> 00:33:13,200
auditing enough to play out grab you
find these things and

569
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:18,280
you'll find where they're doing it
correctly or incorrectly pay

570
00:33:18,280 --> 00:33:22,590
this is the fun part the funding I both
playing left the

571
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:26,420
basically leave all components a a
dependency is

572
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:29,910
up to you on the common bill systems

573
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:33,300
RSPT skull built all an activator

574
00:33:33,300 --> 00:33:36,780
I so whateva include security
researchers

575
00:33:36,780 --> 00:33:41,380
he was doing a buncha closure Clojure on
research and he found

576
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:45,380
that the closer built all up

577
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:49,860
would pull all its a dependencies the
jar files just pull it over a stupid

578
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:54,480
so would go out the sauna taper maven
.org whatever paul the jar files over

579
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,200
HTTP

580
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,370
but wait wait wait he also pulled the
shy one

581
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:02,630
and the md5 hashes okay great so they're
checking shy 1 and the sides but yes but

582
00:34:02,630 --> 00:34:05,320
it's all or a shitty P so it does man in
the middle

583
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:09,740
the jar and the the shy one hash it's
literally call shop one-dot tax

584
00:34:09,740 --> 00:34:14,919
man milk or both upon and you just given
the sha-1 tax file

585
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:18,310
a for your shot one of your backdoor jar
file

586
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:22,320
I'm so we created a proof of concept at
this and how they're running

587
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:25,960
so if anybody on your local network was
running skull built

588
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:29,770
I'm so this was the one we were approve
concert photos for closure

589
00:34:29,770 --> 00:34:33,419
then was running the clothes are built
all on a local network it without

590
00:34:33,419 --> 00:34:36,480
are man in the middle and run a Java
-jar

591
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:39,600
file on your system as as its compiler

592
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:45,279
on we found the same kinds of problems
also existed in SB see an activator in

593
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,110
Scala world

594
00:34:46,110 --> 00:34:49,160
so SPT I Bowl

595
00:34:49,160 --> 00:34:52,160
up and I duke I do give these products
projects credit

596
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:55,870
SBT an activator both actively at the
same time that the closure

597
00:34:55,870 --> 00:34:59,390
thing was released I IMAX baseman they
both

598
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:02,850
actively said guys we should take a look
at this an artful

599
00:35:02,850 --> 00:35:06,860
SPT went through and took all the issues
P away from the whole

600
00:35:06,860 --> 00:35:10,720
a the whole torso that SPS so great SPT
got it right

601
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,970
I'm activator the tried to do that

602
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:17,540
but they did not get everywhere so we
found

603
00:35:17,540 --> 00:35:21,400
um many instances whether pulling
templates where they're pulling

604
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,450
ID configs and I think intakes the

605
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:27,740
you if you control and I V can take you
can control the box essentially during

606
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:28,280
the build

607
00:35:28,280 --> 00:35:32,480
so I'm I think I fixed templates and
also some jars

608
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:36,100
this still pull down I'll race you to be
so they tried to fix it

609
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:39,240
on they didn't quite get it and so

610
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:42,540
this morning we reported that against
them I'm

611
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:46,130
so hopefully now though will fix it
right I

612
00:35:46,130 --> 00:35:50,120
so yeah if you guys have activator look
out for that patch

613
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,400
for the two scholar does please tell the
skull people I'm

614
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:56,770
I look out for the upcoming patch
hopefully on

615
00:35:56,770 --> 00:36:00,690
go get this problem like completely a
eliminated from skull

616
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:04,880
hum that patterns in good patterns

617
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,610
a pretty simple in your in years SPT

618
00:36:08,610 --> 00:36:12,940
which is your cell bill talkin take file
just use https

619
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:16,580
and now another that pattern I should
mention

620
00:36:16,580 --> 00:36:21,030
is a disabling SSL tax so you can screw
this up

621
00:36:21,030 --> 00:36:24,210
oily if you'd and people to do this
issue

622
00:36:24,210 --> 00:36:27,830
have so i've seen a developer do this

623
00:36:27,830 --> 00:36:30,870
wherein they have kinda

624
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:34,320
a a system that doesn't mean the middle
checking at the

625
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:37,350
corporate lehrer for all SSL certs

626
00:36:37,350 --> 00:36:40,980
so they have man in the middle
everything and

627
00:36:40,980 --> 00:36:44,280
Blue Coat use to do this they weren't
you

628
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:48,000
in the middle of the SSL certs and
they've monitor all your traffic

629
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,550
so sometimes if you have that sort of
system in place

630
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:54,620
people just say I'm getting off the
stiff hairs on my bills I'm just going

631
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:55,480
to save all

632
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:01,880
as a soul-searching so never do that

633
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:04,250
okay so with look you can do

634
00:37:04,250 --> 00:37:07,680
rewrites and the

635
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:12,070
with you give me access via the redirect
to

636
00:37:12,070 --> 00:37:15,820
the API call so the key thing about this

637
00:37:15,820 --> 00:37:19,010
is don't allow track user input to go
into

638
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:22,190
this you always want to have a static
route

639
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:25,420
when have on some sort of waitlist

640
00:37:25,420 --> 00:37:29,970
here to make sure they only directly
things actually wanted a

641
00:37:29,970 --> 00:37:33,530
guys Dayton good

642
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:36,860
rectitude to external URL was actually
added

643
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:40,230
and arm a in an earlier version

644
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:43,540
list when they complain that you could
be directed externally

645
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:47,110
so they decided tonight decide to say
that he put in a protocol

646
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:50,600
a in the redirect target

647
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:54,020
you got you can lifestyle the

648
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:57,550
okay and and and play a

649
00:37:57,550 --> 00:38:00,940
there's more ways to shoot yourself in
the foot and play I

650
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:04,120
but the the main way is a just doing

651
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:07,460
the redirect a let me think about the
whole thing

652
00:38:07,460 --> 00:38:11,420
no well hit

653
00:38:11,420 --> 00:38:14,920
up there okay there are other certain
and so the man the myth

654
00:38:14,920 --> 00:38:17,890
mainly this yourself in the foot is let
use a controllable implicates the

655
00:38:17,890 --> 00:38:18,490
redirect

656
00:38:18,490 --> 00:38:21,780
on if they control the the base schema

657
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:25,180
and and the site then you can use that

658
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:29,290
up you know this lottery director taxes
because help attack a law

659
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:32,590
the basic attack is obviously fishing I
am

660
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:36,500
but your home a coffin your ghost writer
showed us that redirects can be used to

661
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:37,630
bypass a loss of

662
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:41,320
authentication so that's why these
things really matter and why I feel they

663
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:43,220
have a place in the whole of top 10

664
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:46,230
is a these redirects can can

665
00:38:46,230 --> 00:38:49,760
up we kinda screw-up of systems I

666
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:53,800
so just if you're auditing an upgrade
through four see other

667
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,750
move permanently temporary crept through
for those

668
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:00,720
and the simply dismiss the canal system
to find where people screw that up

669
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,930
I'm well I do wanna jump back

670
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:08,570
to a nine per second I something that I
haven't seen

671
00:39:08,570 --> 00:39:12,080
in the Scala world that I have seen and
many other worlds

672
00:39:12,080 --> 00:39:15,990
is a like the Ruby world for instance
there's

673
00:39:15,990 --> 00:39:19,500
in the real world there's lotsa projects
out there that automatically look at

674
00:39:19,500 --> 00:39:20,260
your jams

675
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:23,690
look for security updates for Jen's and
then

676
00:39:23,690 --> 00:39:27,300
a look at you on those security updates
as far as I know there's nothing out

677
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:27,910
there

678
00:39:27,910 --> 00:39:31,790
commonly use in the open source world in
the Scala world that does a similar

679
00:39:31,790 --> 00:39:32,210
thing

680
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:35,370
now mind you scholar world is much
smaller world

681
00:39:35,370 --> 00:39:39,020
and then Ruby on Rails but that would be
something that would

682
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:42,620
a my opinionated a lot easier to just
handle

683
00:39:42,620 --> 00:39:46,720
you dependencies and security upon
abilities I'm so

684
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:51,690
she has won a cut-up thanks okay

685
00:39:51,690 --> 00:39:55,060
so with that we've kinda cover the of
top 10

686
00:39:55,060 --> 00:39:58,620
with we touch on each one and your
thoughts and a loss

687
00:39:58,620 --> 00:40:01,750
of the Los a top-10 and

688
00:40:01,750 --> 00:40:04,810
the give you a couple patterns if you
want to get like

689
00:40:04,810 --> 00:40:08,230
into the nitty gritty and you're gonna
be doing a penthouse with this get our

690
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:09,830
white paper after this talk is

691
00:40:09,830 --> 00:40:13,820
done and I get whatever what happens it
up and we'll all go through anything get

692
00:40:13,820 --> 00:40:15,430
more fine-grained with the patterns

693
00:40:15,430 --> 00:40:17,810
you can just use that as kind of a
chichi when you're doing your

694
00:40:17,810 --> 00:40:18,520
assessments

695
00:40:18,520 --> 00:40:22,430
I'm next thing which is kinda wrap up
with a

696
00:40:22,430 --> 00:40:26,570
cool things about each one so one cool
thing that I really like him play

697
00:40:26,570 --> 00:40:30,590
is on they have a cryptographically
sound equality i

698
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:35,490
comparison operator so on something has
been really hot the last year so

699
00:40:35,490 --> 00:40:38,550
is a mistakes when using I'm

700
00:40:38,550 --> 00:40:42,110
Eagle people's for comparison I'm when
you're comparing secrets or

701
00:40:42,110 --> 00:40:43,250
authentication tokens

702
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:46,400
I'm so it's been proven that you can do

703
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:50,060
a ton requests and find my for
differences in the per character

704
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:53,370
comparison on the underlying I kind of
like

705
00:40:53,370 --> 00:40:57,640
bit by a I memory comparisons so

706
00:40:57,640 --> 00:41:00,210
play was on that shit

707
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:04,240
and they said all right we're gonna make
a a timing agnostic

708
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:08,150
comparison I'm so that's just one drink
or think

709
00:41:08,150 --> 00:41:15,150
they like to play one random cool thing
that I like about lift is the whole

710
00:41:15,390 --> 00:41:16,500
notion of site map

711
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:22,280
and the is it's like spring securities
bait into application is just

712
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:25,730
integrated into your application site
map is available for use

713
00:41:25,730 --> 00:41:29,300
and I recommend everyone that's making a
list a

714
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:32,740
news site map I am its

715
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:36,160
it's just everything you need for
authorization checks all the way the

716
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:37,540
routing and what have you

717
00:41:37,540 --> 00:41:41,170
okay so in general

718
00:41:41,170 --> 00:41:46,300
covering the first play yes question
I'll

719
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:49,670
on it that's yes sorry and enough for
that that slipped

720
00:41:49,670 --> 00:41:54,280
site map is the future left on this
crypto sound operator is in play

721
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:58,270
at so in general left first play

722
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:01,570
and they're both pretty good compared to

723
00:42:01,570 --> 00:42:05,580
a lot of other a web app remarks in
other languages they give you a lot

724
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:09,859
love a release it to false I am so
there's a pretty

725
00:42:09,859 --> 00:42:14,130
pretty nice I you really have to go out
of your way to shoot yourself in the

726
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:14,770
foot tease

727
00:42:14,770 --> 00:42:18,470
a to use that when using I am

728
00:42:18,470 --> 00:42:21,849
but they still do is leave some room to
shoot yourself in your for

729
00:42:21,849 --> 00:42:25,400
as we've seen we just want to do. all a
lot about 10

730
00:42:25,400 --> 00:42:29,050
uncovered at least one gotcha and
everyone and

731
00:42:29,050 --> 00:42:33,690
one thing I would love to see is there's
nothing for data Scala code

732
00:42:33,690 --> 00:42:36,690
that parses it and as a static analysis
other

733
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:39,700
that lets you track control closer data
flows I'm

734
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:43,230
basically I G all you're doing is a
penetration test right now is basic

735
00:42:43,230 --> 00:42:45,000
semantic analysis scrapping to

736
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,170
looking for patterns and that's it love
to see

737
00:42:48,170 --> 00:42:52,770
I static analysis framework us so we can
just write the rules for it

738
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:57,560
I with a static code analyzer as opposed
to just kind of crap in through here and

739
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:58,170
there

740
00:42:58,170 --> 00:42:58,480
and

741
00:42:58,480 --> 00:43:01,500
the hoping that we find everything I so

742
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:05,690
woo when it when we are the app's we
love static code analysis were heavy

743
00:43:05,690 --> 00:43:08,860
heavy users of commercial and open
source static analysis tools

744
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:12,970
I feel that um too many penetration
testing firms are they're poking around

745
00:43:12,970 --> 00:43:13,820
in doing by

746
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:18,160
art stuff and it's just inefficient you
really need a good statically analyzer

747
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:22,470
and %uh the people that know how to use
it behind it I'm to be efficient

748
00:43:22,470 --> 00:43:26,850
and the be comprehensive penetration
testing I

749
00:43:26,850 --> 00:43:30,940
so that is my main takeaway let them
play both pretty damn good

750
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:35,610
I I wish they had a static analyzer
that's another thing I want your site

751
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:36,060
thanks

752
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:39,350
okay so now to the code

753
00:43:39,350 --> 00:43:42,400
that were dropping his party this it
seems to me either

754
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:47,140
any black people other timer for us no
five minutes

755
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:50,670
ask today was a bunch of other sites
finance

756
00:43:50,670 --> 00:43:54,230
service I request order this is Nana
lost

757
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:57,300
a loss top 10 but I we're gonna cover it
a

758
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,330
basically home and stay I love the stake
in there sorry

759
00:44:00,330 --> 00:44:04,290
I that was a joke was not supposed to be
there

760
00:44:04,290 --> 00:44:10,070
um okay service I request forgery is a
problem skull world as well

761
00:44:10,070 --> 00:44:13,900
regardless if using play or left
basically

762
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:18,190
what the issue here is is user control
input reaches an issue 2p

763
00:44:18,190 --> 00:44:21,630
client call in your application it so
you go

764
00:44:21,630 --> 00:44:24,810
and you're out is a quiet and request a

765
00:44:24,810 --> 00:44:29,370
something the most typical use case here
is you have a user profile pic

766
00:44:29,370 --> 00:44:32,970
and you want to give them the URL where
they can just grab the user profile pic

767
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:34,280
from somewhere else on the Internet

768
00:44:34,280 --> 00:44:38,530
like right click Facebook CD and drop
that into

769
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:42,500
I there in you your app just nicely grab
the URL

770
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:46,560
grabs the pic in puts it as part of the
profile pic so

771
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:52,810
when you're doing that um what if I
don't specify my facebook profile pic

772
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:53,920
wanna by specifying

773
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:58,840
internal on server like that has your
sauna type repositories up

774
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:02,130
lives on 10 dogs you're down 1.1 and

775
00:45:02,130 --> 00:45:05,420
maybe I use knowledge of the internal
systems or maybe I just brute force the

776
00:45:05,420 --> 00:45:07,930
address space is the 1922 the 172

777
00:45:07,930 --> 00:45:12,070
the 10 dot I before so all those outer
space is and I find where internal

778
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:12,790
things are

779
00:45:12,790 --> 00:45:15,820
I can port scan them I can do various

780
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:19,670
attacks proxy to you I'm and things like
that

781
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:22,960
so this is clearly a pretty bad thing

782
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:26,810
I and I'll share to a funny little story
I'm

783
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:30,170
when I was signing up for the arse a
conference this year I

784
00:45:30,170 --> 00:45:33,530
I was no checking out and the

785
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:37,280
they give you a PDF and a look at the
the checkout

786
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:40,600
URL and and its a URL in the URL

787
00:45:40,600 --> 00:45:43,900
and I was like wait a minute they
wouldn't be yes so

788
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:48,300
they wear using an internal middle tier
server to generate the receipts

789
00:45:48,300 --> 00:45:51,609
after you sign up for our sake
conference and then after they generated

790
00:45:51,609 --> 00:45:52,400
the receipts

791
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,530
and they a spat out the PDF through the
web app where

792
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:59,990
so they didn't internal call if you just
change the URL to

793
00:45:59,990 --> 00:46:04,830
other internal things or things out on
the internet was straight SSRS on-site

794
00:46:04,830 --> 00:46:09,160
called are saves QT conference told them
a you guys have the security

795
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:11,070
vulnerability they fixed it there

796
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:14,990
they're very gracious about it and i
cant believe nobody else

797
00:46:14,990 --> 00:46:18,540
compact every single person I signed up
for our essay look

798
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:22,619
at that URL and did not find that attack
or did not tell her say about it

799
00:46:22,619 --> 00:46:25,820
I am so

800
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:30,780
yeah well we created was on there's this
guy I

801
00:46:30,780 --> 00:46:34,340
finite as handle he created this call
libraries

802
00:46:34,340 --> 00:46:39,030
safe call safe for all on is an issue to
be quiet library

803
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:42,630
for rapper library around kroll for PHP

804
00:46:42,630 --> 00:46:45,700
now but we look at that and we like
that's great

805
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:48,840
does all her clients all the time we're
trying to give them this general

806
00:46:48,840 --> 00:46:49,560
guidance up

807
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:53,100
well you should look for 10 dot on 172
died and you should prevent DNS

808
00:46:53,100 --> 00:46:57,570
rebinding attacks in 302 redirect
attacks against you guys to SSRS

809
00:46:57,570 --> 00:46:59,500
gorgeous getting like a up

810
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,920
pages have advice on how they should
protect against this but

811
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:05,950
as a security practitioners and

812
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:06,750
like that's

813
00:47:06,750 --> 00:47:10,420
horrible you don't want the fenders said
you give them two pages of advice on how

814
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:13,410
to prevent something you want to get in
the library that they can call

815
00:47:13,410 --> 00:47:17,720
so that's why we created for skull we
create an anti SSRS library

816
00:47:17,720 --> 00:47:21,420
and modeled on finite citro a

817
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:25,860
so we call it the issues behind scholar
live a free from any server-side request

818
00:47:25,860 --> 00:47:27,160
forgery or through the

819
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:31,330
for short and so not good at naming
things so we just call it

820
00:47:31,330 --> 00:47:35,980
and yes sir flip I'm it's so

821
00:47:35,980 --> 00:47:39,030
modeled on finance and the were

822
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:42,920
the whole purpose of this is we just
want to be able to give our clients

823
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:46,230
okay use this you know don't try and
like

824
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:50,110
implement this crap on your own and this
is something that I feel should be baked

825
00:47:50,110 --> 00:47:50,890
into

826
00:47:50,890 --> 00:47:55,610
a the issue be clients not just in Scala
but and and various other languages

827
00:47:55,610 --> 00:48:00,490
I you don't want to be avoidable deaths
are a build this protection into your

828
00:48:00,490 --> 00:48:05,230
should be client libraries I'm at the
play and lift framework level they may

829
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:08,520
be able to do something like this they
may be able to bring that in an added

830
00:48:08,520 --> 00:48:10,290
into the framework I would love to see
that

831
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:15,300
and but that's generally kind of the
concept

832
00:48:15,300 --> 00:48:19,160
I yet so we're gonna

833
00:48:19,160 --> 00:48:22,960
we're gonna release the code for this
probably tomorrow I'm really tired right

834
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:23,610
now so

835
00:48:23,610 --> 00:48:28,520
will get to a two hour I just follow us
on Twitter at include security or just

836
00:48:28,520 --> 00:48:30,730
follow some get hard if you want that
code

837
00:48:30,730 --> 00:48:35,190
and low early start tomorrow so sale
here helped out with the

838
00:48:35,190 --> 00:48:38,430
lacquered I am

839
00:48:38,430 --> 00:48:41,470
the other PC code

840
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:44,950
cialis at prototypes a very quickly

841
00:48:44,950 --> 00:48:48,900
um the if anyone is a go I understand
but

842
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:53,020
cool just cover this a couple minutes up
we created the South Cobb latter

843
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:55,609
so we're doing scholars assessments and

844
00:48:55,609 --> 00:48:59,230
we just wanted to have a happy hour
forward to practice our attacks against

845
00:48:59,230 --> 00:48:59,940
collapse

846
00:48:59,940 --> 00:49:03,160
so blabber I was written by

847
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:06,390
whatever intern Stewart and it's
basically a happy hour

848
00:49:06,390 --> 00:49:09,720
it's a very simple play-framework out I

849
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:13,700
and it's really good for testing out
dynamic testing tools

850
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:18,030
and you can use it for the interview
evening interviewing people

851
00:49:18,030 --> 00:49:22,299
hey can you hack this if you can and
this is a very very basic

852
00:49:22,299 --> 00:49:25,940
on application and is a very very basic

853
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:29,180
obvious vulnerabilities so has while

854
00:49:29,180 --> 00:49:32,349
least one that you to the law OWASP top
10 it

855
00:49:32,349 --> 00:49:36,180
that we discover all the bad patterns so
we just went over they're all in there

856
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:39,200
on and blabber is a

857
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:43,400
you can tell by the logo it's a Twitter
clone so it's like a little micro blog

858
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:44,430
blogging service

859
00:49:44,430 --> 00:49:48,680
and we spent a millions of dollars
creating logos

860
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:53,470
a like Hartley guys I yeah

861
00:49:53,470 --> 00:49:57,000
so what else okay

862
00:49:57,000 --> 00:50:02,059
so yeah if you're an expert a everything
in this presentation and imply vers

863
00:50:02,059 --> 00:50:02,609
already

864
00:50:02,609 --> 00:50:07,200
a you already know this stuff but the
way you might use it as a

865
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:10,579
the way we do it is I just had to
compete with your friends so she began

866
00:50:10,579 --> 00:50:11,599
to a speedrun

867
00:50:11,599 --> 00:50:14,770
and get all the the attacks

868
00:50:14,770 --> 00:50:19,130
and see how fast you can do it for you
can be 30 minutes

869
00:50:19,130 --> 00:50:24,700
right knee have your job I um

870
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:27,650
yeah and well also push that

871
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:31,240
tomorrow I just wanna whenever we get to
it

872
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:36,150
I so blabber I please don't ever
deployed on the Internet

873
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:40,420
it's just four holes on but it's fun

874
00:50:40,420 --> 00:50:44,190
as a pen tester to just go through and
look for these things just get a little

875
00:50:44,190 --> 00:50:45,780
practice and I'm in a micro

876
00:50:45,780 --> 00:50:49,480
a micro-level I'm so when you get out
there and you see these ups

877
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:54,250
now a1 the question I get from people
who donate when they saw this topic is

878
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:57,270
hey you know the Scala getting hot who's
using it right now

879
00:50:57,270 --> 00:51:01,670
so on there are be companies out there
like Foursquare LinkedIn

880
00:51:01,670 --> 00:51:05,420
use a lot of Scala I believe foursquare
users lift

881
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:10,920
and the not in use and LinkedIn users
play so

882
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:14,470
there are big companies out there using
this stuff and

883
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:18,030
its its getting more and more popular in
the startup world

884
00:51:18,030 --> 00:51:21,520
so we do we do a lot of work with
startups a

885
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:25,350
so we see all sorts a interior in

886
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:30,340
in inside the middle tear applications
ringo and scholar and things like that

887
00:51:30,340 --> 00:51:33,610
and same we're seeing more and more so

888
00:51:33,610 --> 00:51:37,840
with with these frameworks being is as
secure as they are

889
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:42,820
that's good um but you know with what
we've shown you so far hopefully

890
00:51:42,820 --> 00:51:47,510
you cannot find some of the gotchas a
here some

891
00:51:47,510 --> 00:51:50,620
future is to explore a more

892
00:51:50,620 --> 00:51:53,730
build issues love to see static code
analysis

893
00:51:53,730 --> 00:51:59,200
I violation of type safety permissions
so here's a really cool concept and you

894
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:00,520
seen this in PHP

895
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:04,000
up throughout the years is type
confusion right so

896
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:08,050
somehow you can convince the app that
one type is another type

897
00:52:08,050 --> 00:52:11,930
and through how you structure the URL
maybe it's an array and it looks like

898
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:14,700
this and wallets casting into something
else

899
00:52:14,700 --> 00:52:18,440
it screws up and now it thinks it's a
different type and through that you can

900
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:22,050
a get past security boundaries I

901
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:25,480
so for the research that will be doing
and we highly

902
00:52:25,480 --> 00:52:26,520
heard you guys to do

903
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:29,760
is is looking for issues like that in
the

904
00:52:29,760 --> 00:52:33,810
the scholar runtime: itself that can be
exploited through this web frameworks

905
00:52:33,810 --> 00:52:37,240
I also I'll Another Earth

906
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:40,850
thing that's part of our scholars the
the framework our cup

907
00:52:40,850 --> 00:52:44,150
and the the concept the futures which is
kinda like an

908
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:47,930
a synchronised pattern where you say I i
have this variable

909
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:51,710
who and food doesn't exist yet so let's
say foo is a

910
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:55,390
up a call to two it should be client
library call

911
00:52:55,390 --> 00:53:00,120
so as that request is happening you know
I've got that latency

912
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:03,710
to go out on the web and pull that down
and populate a variable through

913
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:07,030
on I can still process other things a
synchronously

914
00:53:07,030 --> 00:53:10,430
and so that's what futures are about
with all these futures and often

915
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:11,020
everything

916
00:53:11,020 --> 00:53:15,550
you're gonna have synchronization issues
I so

917
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:18,970
we're going to be looking at more
synchronization issues with these things

918
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:22,090
if you guys have any cool findings
patterns

919
00:53:22,090 --> 00:53:25,330
on where people really screw up these
things with our computers would love to

920
00:53:25,330 --> 00:53:25,900
hear about it

921
00:53:25,900 --> 00:53:29,450
and I think with that we're all done

922
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:32,720
so thank you for attending and hopefully
learn just

923
00:53:32,720 --> 00:53:35,370
one thing about something %ah
