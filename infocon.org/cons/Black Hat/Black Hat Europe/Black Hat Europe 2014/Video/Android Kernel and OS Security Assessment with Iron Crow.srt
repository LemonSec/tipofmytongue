1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:03,220
money only one so

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:07,170
what we have today a is an idea that
many of you in this room

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,469
especially if you look in product
security teams would have tied up at

4
00:00:10,469 --> 00:00:11,790
some point in time when the other

5
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:15,929
we'll be talking about when their
abilities not in the court

6
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:18,930
in the way you ship the court so

7
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:22,519
saw these bugs can be so simple that
that make you wonder about

8
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:25,930
the STL and the security validation that
goes on behind them

9
00:00:25,930 --> 00:00:29,480
and on the other hand something can be
so complex

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,250
that they may be and I feel are starkly
our security

11
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:38,290
Union best I can securely deliver it so
it will take a few examples today what

12
00:00:38,290 --> 00:00:40,809
kind of security miss configurations
that we have seen

13
00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:43,920
you're working with a different product
teams and

14
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:47,000
will also propose a solution

15
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,149
an idea that we have and catching these
kind of security problems this kind of

16
00:00:51,149 --> 00:00:52,250
configuration problems

17
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:55,829
clearly and up how he won't make the
world a better place to be

18
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:00,340
we had land for a demo but unfortunately
we don't have to go pro today here

19
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:05,439
so will be showing you how though the
out application note how it only works

20
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:06,680
thru screenshots that

21
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:11,369
if any appears really interested just
come talk to us after our presentation

22
00:01:11,369 --> 00:01:14,610
you've got a couple of the ice is here
with us today and

23
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:17,680
and we'll be able to give you an of what
we have

24
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,009
I so before we get into the details

25
00:01:22,009 --> 00:01:25,110
a a really quick introduction my name is
month

26
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:28,119
spent about a decade and security
industry

27
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:31,880
and I look for Intel I minutes of the

28
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,340
Android security assessment of what's
that I also manage for the product

29
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:39,850
security teams to develop new security
solutions on top 100

30
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:42,909
and before my job I can tell I look for

31
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:46,340
bomb and for some Microsystems bring
peace out

32
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:51,710
investing security stuff basically and
Michael presented today he is a cat

33
00:01:51,710 --> 00:01:54,330
cell I joined in the last year

34
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:57,750
and I used to work with cement in the
security assessment team

35
00:01:57,750 --> 00:02:01,840
now I'm a hill overlooking is a research
engineer in there are two sides

36
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,060
my major interests on data mining
machine learning and data bases

37
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:09,310
and this this work was done when during
my stay at Inter

38
00:02:09,310 --> 00:02:13,400
thats so

39
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,170
let's get down to business let's talk
about the easy books first

40
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:20,190
made so so think about us 90 already
have

41
00:02:20,190 --> 00:02:23,900
I'll and development team someone has
was riding in your featured on

42
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:28,830
on Android and think about a a situation
where they want to

43
00:02:28,830 --> 00:02:32,050
make several applications slated to
applications

44
00:02:32,050 --> 00:02:36,700
acts the same file on the endocrine
system community defile maybe

45
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:39,780
right to the fight for whatever reason
and we meet this happens

46
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:44,700
and there can be many ways to release
all this from a security point a few

47
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,209
the easy solution would be to just two
SCH 1666 0777

48
00:02:49,209 --> 00:02:52,300
and that looks great and

49
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,030
think about a similar example from a
process point a few that's a

50
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:59,360
you are I am writing an application
right in your service or not

51
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,430
an app and you want to use more
privileges than what your standard

52
00:03:04,430 --> 00:03:09,709
Android service and third parties and
risk and have what you do in that case

53
00:03:09,709 --> 00:03:13,489
just make an application a system app or
on your service first

54
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:17,910
with the system user ID on Android and
then lemme everything looks perfectly

55
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:18,360
well

56
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,500
but you need to remember that the system
user ID is

57
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:26,320
sort of a pseudo super use it has a lot
of privileges so if

58
00:03:26,320 --> 00:03:29,940
if things can go wrong in implementation
if you have a bug January

59
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:33,290
you really the leasing a conduit that
for

60
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:36,550
privilege escalation a system and I can
get really nasty

61
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:40,840
it the simple bugs the sewer line
includes they happen

62
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:44,030
every day every other day when you have
a min you're working with large teams

63
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:45,030
working on Android

64
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:49,769
on elephant iPhone and things can get a
bit more complicated

65
00:03:49,769 --> 00:03:52,980
it arm said you any fights

66
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:56,450
is a kind I feel it did these are hard
to get laid

67
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:00,900
and you learn in security 11 that gonna
be really careful in the way you set the

68
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,420
bed

69
00:04:01,420 --> 00:04:02,510
the EU

70
00:04:02,510 --> 00:04:05,739
no understand that he'll use it. the
effective use it.

71
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:09,379
when you need to drop the privileges
when you need to gain them and so on

72
00:04:09,379 --> 00:04:13,079
he's can be complicated and if you look
at the

73
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:17,750
Android security best practices document
has a bunch of should not and must not

74
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:21,600
in Ward and this lady section for a
really good reason

75
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,020
and also though the Android CD is still
sweet we just reject issue said the bet

76
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:28,280
on some of these flights

77
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:35,280
also pretty good reason I

78
00:04:35,539 --> 00:04:39,400
and things can get even darker

79
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:42,850
people know that said your defense and
that he will you shouldn't use them if

80
00:04:42,850 --> 00:04:44,419
you don't know what you're doing it on

81
00:04:44,419 --> 00:04:49,500
so an alternative is a a bit more
fine-grained alternative is to use the

82
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:51,130
Pasig fi capabilities

83
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:54,650
is a 100% understand sometimes you need
to know

84
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:58,449
how you configure them how you send them
how you in headed them and so on

85
00:04:58,449 --> 00:05:02,699
and what's worse is that sometimes you
lose your sense of complacency that you

86
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:02,990
re

87
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:06,479
using secure alternative let some of
these

88
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:09,900
capabilities a pretty complex right if
you look at the list of the

89
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:14,530
of caps that Pasig allows you to do
there are some of them that have a

90
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,280
really long list of attributes

91
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,940
that that give you an application or Dr
you execute a bit

92
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:23,669
the kind of privileges that almost makes
them said you hate me

93
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:28,150
right so if you've configured them well
if you're if you're using them as if you

94
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:28,960
know and do

95
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,160
you know drop the privileges and and use
them effectively then then that is great

96
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,020
but then

97
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,419
she don't do it it's kinda said he was
in sheep's clothing and

98
00:05:38,419 --> 00:05:42,090
and limit the side near the cellular
problems try to the first

99
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:45,760
headline that you see our up that its
happen a couple of years ago

100
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:50,449
many simple bugged to direct a nice man
device fine basically had was rightly

101
00:05:50,449 --> 00:05:51,289
conditions

102
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:56,240
on something devices that gives you an
average joe shmoe application yard your

103
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,340
Facebook you are

104
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:01,010
you are Angry Birds complete access to
the US fiscal ninety

105
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:05,130
3 you wonder how that UN got in there
but that was on production for internet

106
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:05,550
was

107
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:08,770
disclose publicly and and

108
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:12,360
the capabilities like I said he said
much harder but not without problems

109
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:16,550
either the second headline again a true
story this happened something several

110
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:17,630
years ago but

111
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:21,590
improper use of the capabilities
actually let go to compromise

112
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:24,260
on several Linux machines

113
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,800
so though the statement that man is a
security program not a security program

114
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,350
that's actually frontier so

115
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:32,790
from has keynote at the new york
security summit last year

116
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:36,310
so that there was a really interesting
don't say that that played

117
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:39,470
and I just kinda motivation for us to
think about what kind of problems

118
00:06:39,470 --> 00:06:43,320
can come out of security and you know
you defy capabilities

119
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:48,110
I so far so good so we've been talking
about wanting to be sacked mostly

120
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:51,990
result from all you know from a
particular feature it's got a container

121
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:54,210
isolated to one feature that you're
developing

122
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:58,870
I'd so maybe you have infinite time and
resources and money you can have

123
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:02,790
months of penetration testing done maybe
catch these kind of you know

124
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:07,639
was huge monash use process permissions
said you ID's capabilities what have you

125
00:07:07,639 --> 00:07:10,960
you also seen cases where I'll

126
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,720
a team probably it's not very security
said security a mat

127
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,330
can interviews wanna be decent things
that are completely unrelated to that

128
00:07:18,330 --> 00:07:19,070
called

129
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:22,770
so on the

130
00:07:22,770 --> 00:07:26,190
on the eye at 32 architecture on on on
the Intel architecture that they do with

131
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:26,880
anything

132
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:30,039
you have the the ability to the

133
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:33,700
two runs just forward programs if you
enable be the physical act as extensions

134
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,910
HOSA you have a team that's working on

135
00:07:36,910 --> 00:07:41,180
on on a 32-bit platform and for some
reason may be that messing with 32-bit

136
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,840
and 64-bit go together

137
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,580
things are working well the need to be
like something and the

138
00:07:46,580 --> 00:07:50,550
goal of P the physical address
extensions and everything looks for help

139
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:54,660
you know sometimes months control before
you realize what has gone wrong and

140
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,440
and usually you get this push back from
though from development team saying

141
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,639
everything is working well what you want
to change anything an interesting case

142
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,610
here is that

143
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:07,580
on on the x86 architecture that the

144
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:10,620
the non executed will feature NX bit

145
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:13,690
is actually said 21 in the 63rd bed

146
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:17,539
and be stable entry so you see what I
did there

147
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:22,360
so if you're burning of PE you do not
have a 63rd bed any more impatiently

148
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,870
which means that you've kind of an ex
and you've suddenly left the platform

149
00:08:25,870 --> 00:08:26,870
that you too cutie or

150
00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:31,640
true stories again I

151
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:35,039
swam trying to say here is that if you
look at these examples these are not

152
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,180
been on bugs

153
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:39,310
in in your implementation is not your
average before flow some point any

154
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:39,969
differences

155
00:08:39,969 --> 00:08:44,050
so the same things these are the cases
where you at your shipping something you

156
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:47,050
are configuring something and then
you're introducing on the release of

157
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,850
them really simple things can go bad

158
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:53,790
and what we feel is that these classes
the one that really should be called

159
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:57,290
quickly and efficiently and for that we
are proposing

160
00:08:57,290 --> 00:09:01,360
a to I'll an idea really at this point
callers I don't grow

161
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,920
and on this is what we have I'm gonna
gonna go to a kill to explain what

162
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:07,850
people can do today

163
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:10,900
soap

164
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,990
everyone so the idea behind

165
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:17,270
as someone has already mentioned is that
the these up

166
00:09:17,270 --> 00:09:20,440
the blue ones that you see thing you
made but

167
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:23,510
sorry

168
00:09:23,510 --> 00:09:26,590
at so the idea behind this is that the

169
00:09:26,590 --> 00:09:29,790
you can see the blue mother there which
actually point

170
00:09:29,790 --> 00:09:33,850
about the features that someone was
mentioning so start with an expected to

171
00:09:33,850 --> 00:09:34,730
the December thing

172
00:09:34,730 --> 00:09:37,800
say this but actually trays to

173
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,300
you know the the it's a technology using
the CPU to

174
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:45,040
mock separate different areas of memory
as

175
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,320
I did the store code our data so and in

176
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,920
in that case and operating system can
actually try to mock

177
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,570
these regions which contain just a date
out to be non-executive it

178
00:09:55,570 --> 00:09:59,310
so the idea here is that any

179
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:02,310
it actually tries to prevent the
classical buffer overflow whatever it is

180
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:02,690
that the

181
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:04,940
that could actually occur and the

182
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:08,350
heavy you know it we actually implement
the check

183
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:12,700
here at two levels so the first level is
that we try to take the Brock

184
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:17,340
if to see that way there the operating
system has the capability to

185
00:10:17,340 --> 00:10:21,190
Inc you know in a bit and the annex or
not and at the second level what we do

186
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:21,620
is

187
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:25,670
and we actually try to execute code from
the data pages and we receive a memory

188
00:10:25,670 --> 00:10:26,610
access location

189
00:10:26,610 --> 00:10:30,160
this stating that be have an exit Jake

190
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,260
there this moving to the second level
with me we have this

191
00:10:33,260 --> 00:10:36,280
map in IDR so this is a Condo doing a
move which

192
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:40,040
actually defines the minimum address
minimum bushels

193
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:43,240
at this pace where a program could a map
to

194
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,950
so the the interesting thing here is
that if this is

195
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:51,060
actually the used to avoid the corner
the

196
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:54,600
null pointer dereference attacks that
could there that could be there so

197
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,880
the idea here is that if the amendment
added value is not set the proper limit

198
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:02,640
so what could happen is that a you know
a hacker auto

199
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,690
malicious user can place the you know
strategically place accord

200
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:10,340
I do at this point in the night and then
it could actually lead

201
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:14,320
to you know system crashes or even
privilege escalation Aug maybe it

202
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,330
an Internet good execution then move
into this capability is part which is

203
00:11:18,330 --> 00:11:21,460
I meeting I guess is the most
interesting part of it too

204
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:24,460
because these these really are

205
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:28,730
you know I as as I feel these people
don't really know about how to configure

206
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,030
them how to use them

207
00:11:30,030 --> 00:11:33,910
how that an edit it and stuff and these
are actually implemented

208
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:37,100
he's not actually you know placed to see
that in Athens

209
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:40,890
just not you you just don't use it you a
deal programs you say that

210
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:44,600
I will define a you know just to make
sure the privilege of lestat

211
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,070
and still at least privileges so

212
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:51,690
what we do here is that you know you
have these different kind of

213
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:53,820
capabilities Lake upset you I D

214
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,910
cap deco a raid Kapsis admin

215
00:11:56,910 --> 00:12:00,820
so these capabilities actually if you
take a union of all these capabilities

216
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:01,860
you become Ruth

217
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:06,230
so what exit in just 18 they just
thinking here is that

218
00:12:06,230 --> 00:12:09,880
you have these different capabilities
and people don't know how to use it

219
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:13,190
so you that should be a tool which is
able to scan the whole

220
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,389
file system

221
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:18,139
and this see what kind of capabilities
anyway for the slightest

222
00:12:18,139 --> 00:12:22,680
so the interesting thing is they're that
if you have caps a queue ID

223
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:26,029
capability associated with your file
then it can perform

224
00:12:26,029 --> 00:12:29,550
any kind of the you know any kind of set
to 80

225
00:12:29,550 --> 00:12:33,320
the you know changes second map to any
arbitrary said you 80s

226
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:37,190
then instead and more moving to got back
or I'd

227
00:12:37,190 --> 00:12:40,279
what could happen is that so this into
this can

228
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:44,540
actually bypass the read write and
execute permission text

229
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:48,010
and you can probably right to a place
which is not you know where you're not a

230
00:12:48,010 --> 00:12:49,019
place to do that

231
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:53,010
moving forward I mentioned something
about the capability by Kapsis

232
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:56,990
admin what could happen here is that the
they have a long list of things

233
00:12:56,990 --> 00:13:01,350
what of you know a file if it has that
capability could do

234
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:04,410
so after a capability that said as the

235
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:08,899
security a extended attributes with the
fight so what could happen is that

236
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:12,399
if a fight has this gap sysadmin
capability

237
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:15,620
it good actually change this extended
attribute as well

238
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:19,190
so the interesting thing that would see
here is that finally

239
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:22,620
one can actually right in again any
capability

240
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,680
if it has the caps as admin capability
so

241
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,769
moving ahead I cool also does this kind
the other

242
00:13:28,769 --> 00:13:32,949
takes on the left where we have me check
for worried about fires which can

243
00:13:32,949 --> 00:13:36,300
actually and lOL Anyway whether it is
like what happened with the

244
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,310
something it's a nice little bitty then
you have

245
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:43,380
check for sent you a defiance you also
have checked for people is processed

246
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,850
so heavy mean that you should have a
whitelist

247
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:51,149
the sea which all process that actually
allowed to execute as an older system

248
00:13:51,149 --> 00:13:54,310
so and we also have plans to add

249
00:13:54,310 --> 00:13:57,589
these other checks which are you know
they're in yellow would probably as a

250
00:13:57,589 --> 00:14:01,860
second version of this dude where we
want to check for come by 10 flights

251
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:02,350
again

252
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:05,440
going by what Android recommends we have
the

253
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:09,140
you know the edge the it's the rendition
says that you should have

254
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:12,269
level of the your interest level

255
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:15,670
have a level of source for the vacation
with the court estate protector

256
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:18,870
to the slack should be enable when you
combine this code

257
00:14:18,870 --> 00:14:22,620
and then we also want to check for
certain networking later checks

258
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,620
so a what do we want to hear

259
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:29,510
is that we have we need to do is: which
is probably an enduring

260
00:14:29,510 --> 00:14:33,430
Ohno development with and then the other
thing is that you

261
00:14:33,430 --> 00:14:36,730
you want to configure your whiteness
intelligently to the white lace would be

262
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:37,730
the one which actually

263
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:41,330
won't raise a flag if it you know if
exists on any of these

264
00:14:41,330 --> 00:14:45,540
the you know features that we talked
about so a whitelist could be configured

265
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:48,890
also by a and OEM or a lender yes to see
that

266
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:52,970
what which thing that actually allowed
in which are not and the

267
00:14:52,970 --> 00:14:56,400
third thing is that we we also have
flexibility that you can

268
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,450
I the right as an app or maybe an
automated tool

269
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:03,760
integrated toward stardom I did security
assessment the people do

270
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:08,990
so a I'm very sorry again that we don't
have a demo but I'll probably point out

271
00:15:08,990 --> 00:15:10,680
the features from this late

272
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,760
so the you know be checked for the
expected

273
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:17,050
it's an A and able to knock we check for
the

274
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:20,930
Emma Pinedo value if it's set to a
proper limit and

275
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:24,760
then the though colored ones are here
actually that thinks you're talking

276
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:27,250
about so these can actually change with
the weightless

277
00:15:27,250 --> 00:15:30,790
so we have actually implemented the late
little while later if I is here

278
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:34,500
in this for this particular snapshot and
you see that the

279
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:37,820
there are certain was identified as
which you know which

280
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:41,350
are allowed in which are not allowed so
by this so with the demo you can

281
00:15:41,350 --> 00:15:42,120
actually see the

282
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,700
we also list the files which are there
so

283
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:48,750
the these are probably the way later
with science and we have added this to

284
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:49,630
ignore list

285
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:53,930
as of now and apart from that this again
we have checks for all the set to 85

286
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:57,700
its capabilities processes running as a
router system and then

287
00:15:57,700 --> 00:16:01,120
the we see that for the fight everybody
is the interesting thing that Android

288
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:01,730
allows

289
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:04,920
the run as utility to have these
capabilities

290
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:07,940
and again this this this could be a part
of the waitlist

291
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:12,110
so and kinda late this month for the
next late

292
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:15,180
thanks yet so again

293
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:18,510
if you're at all interested in seeing
this too a home and

294
00:16:18,510 --> 00:16:19,910
in in in a in

295
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:22,820
with with you know nice you've got a
couple of devices here so feel free to

296
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,810
just come and talk to us after the
presentation

297
00:16:24,810 --> 00:16:28,360
arm its okay so %uh proposal really is
that

298
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:31,840
here and there is a is a complex piece
of machinery to you have %um

299
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,400
we too many entities have no the Linux
kernel you into a USB

300
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:41,050
in the BSP vendors like Indo you have
the only ends and AM in the list before

301
00:16:41,050 --> 00:16:44,170
actually give the device to in the hands
of the consumer

302
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:48,930
and each of these guys and more and more
cortando before the cat

303
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:53,190
and any Android space everyone talks
about ATM the time to market

304
00:16:53,190 --> 00:16:57,140
so one really has that has the time that
mean that in the months to you in weeks

305
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:57,970
to do

306
00:16:57,970 --> 00:17:02,040
a thorough penetration testing or call
the views on security configuration

307
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:02,590
reviews

308
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:07,520
over and over again it's disgraceful I K
so what we feel is that

309
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:11,020
a good teachers I don't grow or a
framework such as I don't grow should be

310
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:11,640
made

311
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,220
a an inevitable to it it should be made
as part of your

312
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:20,300
on getting radio you to exit criteria
when you're saying that your platform is

313
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:24,180
is ready on its production quality and
and we should not often we in

314
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,520
so we think that this something like
this would be

315
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:32,270
very useful dalian sentiment was nbsp
vendors and if you really think about it

316
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:35,450
many of these bugs are gone and make
Linux not

317
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:40,640
not necessarily to Android although we
have customized is to Android so

318
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:43,740
we've seen some interest in on people
who work on

319
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:47,240
online on startup solutions and global
financial even distributions

320
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:51,080
that I did on you know a value-added
applications and double the corner

321
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:54,300
cause needless to say a security
assessment teams

322
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:58,560
troll to be interested in this I in in
using this and making sure that day

323
