1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:04,009
so hello everyone thought but I was
thought my public

2
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:09,000
today so my public today is a WebKit and
we'll ask you are not

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:13,130
and the ship I'll

4
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:16,619
let me introduce an agenda also first
play i well

5
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:20,820
describe the a WebKit background and
also

6
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,340
because the reason play a lot of stick
with officials and the exploitation

7
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:26,869
mitigation has been introduced

8
00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:30,869
I will also talk about them and the the
most important thing is

9
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:35,930
I well are released and that this close
the details of the EQ song and the full

10
00:00:35,930 --> 00:00:39,260
1303 which I among yep

11
00:00:39,260 --> 00:00:43,600
a which kinky me presents being pulled
along to a song and the 4p

12
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,579
and also I will give some suggestions to
What Katie

13
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:51,239
so on the agenda is that better a longer
so

14
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,980
I make local longer they expect a %uh
sorry for that

15
00:00:54,980 --> 00:00:58,430
and I hope for that it will not make you
hungry

16
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:02,660
yet so I'll first a on myself
introduction

17
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:06,770
so um i Marchi a security researcher at
kinky

18
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:11,170
and of course I'm not black hats and
also I specialize staying

19
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:15,080
brawls the exploitation including are or
chrome

20
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:18,820
suffering a I E flash Accenture and also

21
00:01:18,820 --> 00:01:21,860
on the wing of kill King Kong event

22
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:25,259
why he is some about untold 2003 us

23
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:30,140
Tucson on the 30 and another is point
along to a song on forty

24
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:33,290
pointing are Mac OS suffering category

25
00:01:33,290 --> 00:01:36,710
so close to let me should ask the

26
00:01:36,710 --> 00:01:38,960
the injured after the a

27
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,410
introduce the WebKit so

28
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:46,440
a because everyone no sweat que tal out
it is the most %uh popular

29
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,780
I'll web a rendering engine seeing the
world

30
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:54,080
saw was the only thing that's a though
we need to take care of

31
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,110
is on the I'm not to call the russians
of

32
00:01:57,110 --> 00:02:00,680
a WebKit why is that trunk and another
is branch

33
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,240
so the trunk I'll usually introducing
new features and eight hits

34
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,550
upgraded updated and then we frequently
maybe

35
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:11,720
on it well you should just sit a lot of
new features in one single day

36
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:15,720
and I'll for the branch it is used up I
saw highway

37
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,570
product which is on are released the
rushing so it a while P

38
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:26,450
updated less frequently and also a
WebKit allow walk along with such as:

39
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:27,080
changing

40
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,310
eyes on me %eh all NTSC which

41
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,670
I'll author on had purse to

42
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:37,060
I'll to do some are some at Saints

43
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:44,019
which is called for the exploiter so are
currently in WebKit issues the end well

44
00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:45,209
we have brown's last

45
00:02:45,209 --> 00:02:49,140
of some TCI occasion all more follow-up
vacations

46
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:53,120
and usually a single pock um if it's

47
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,560
heaney I'll extreme other situation

48
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,890
it made its joy all of them and

49
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:05,260
historical issues we have some the less
issues which happened

50
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:08,360
I'll frequently us all the most famous

51
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:12,320
in incident happened a.m. la fiesta

52
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,400
Allah a character issues which well

53
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,519
are make under I last six a pic asians

54
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:23,310
a a crash immediately and it also impact
us some russians of

55
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:27,100
are Mac OS and also we have the USS

56
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,180
you XSS universal access s

57
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,720
vulnerability selection a meekly
information to chill hacker

58
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,720
and also are the most to I

59
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:40,880
some PR any I'll some the arm

60
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,590
longer replicate is of cost and remote
code execution

61
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:49,050
so it has to logically issues also the
memory corruption issues

62
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:53,330
but sup logical issues Picasa and then
Lewis law

63
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:57,650
and more restricts according to Bill
McAnally them it almost extinct

64
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:00,990
but for them memory corruption issue it
well keep

65
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,430
X 15 for a long time and but

66
00:04:04,430 --> 00:04:08,170
it is also a possible to to use it on to
Paul hope

67
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:12,280
I'll a to pull the whole day life so
latest my major

68
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:16,420
are focused in this presentation and

69
00:04:16,420 --> 00:04:21,420
on memory crop she issues I have seen in
a category such as keep a low flow

70
00:04:21,420 --> 00:04:26,180
title confusion and the UF but a on you
will find that teens are

71
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:30,050
all public you can only find a a very VI

72
00:04:30,050 --> 00:04:34,870
real cases of WebKit exploitation are
some of them are JSC

73
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:38,100
exploitation but to a WebKit 6
PlayStation

74
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:43,140
it's not very a pie too many us all a
typical example is Neil star

75
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:46,660
point along to a song and the stuff 13
which he'll start hyper

76
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:50,390
come fishing line ability to poems are
latest to a

77
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,600
a krummel at up or chrome broza

78
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,070
and also Zara picking pièce a chrome

79
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:00,240
exploiting on Linux 64-bit

80
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,960
which is very I'll very excited ninety
and

81
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,949
ugh the reason why a and even play that
is not too many

82
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:13,979
public exploits for WebKit Solon

83
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:17,270
because let kids introduce some new
features and

84
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:20,449
exploitation cation occasions and all
sold some

85
00:05:20,449 --> 00:05:24,810
other vendors like Google a joined-up
moon probe on to help

86
00:05:24,810 --> 00:05:28,520
other to improve the security of La the
web kick it

87
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,099
which will make web Kate exploitation
really really a

88
00:05:32,099 --> 00:05:35,669
my heart soul %uh the first to on

89
00:05:35,669 --> 00:05:39,319
a concept is a he Katrina week which is
so similar

90
00:05:39,319 --> 00:05:43,090
concept with the IAEA isolate heap so it
well put

91
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:46,440
all those are frequently update hits
I'll

92
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,900
up Jess leticia colleague some players
lend object

93
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:53,430
hustle land opposite oh well be updated

94
00:05:53,430 --> 00:05:56,870
when's that layout treaty if changes

95
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,710
so it is updated a very frequently and
that the cuddy

96
00:06:00,710 --> 00:06:04,879
our cases I'll are based on what a lot
of fun inc.'s it

97
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:11,310
contributes for are more than 90 percent
I'll let kitty left soul you may need to

98
00:06:11,310 --> 00:06:14,580
to find a general way to exploit on are
the heap

99
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,940
I mean a otherwise those three ash well
be wasted

100
00:06:17,940 --> 00:06:22,060
are so little entirely now will be
created

101
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:25,310
are for each document when the document
is created

102
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:29,319
and internally it amendment and a single

103
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:32,409
linked list with the net a planter

104
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:35,589
are to a killed %uh some other

105
00:06:35,589 --> 00:06:38,900
approx but just all those free list

106
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:42,319
solo it also use the a lot

107
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:47,159
paying for stuff alt a mechanic
somewhere allocating to amend object

108
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:51,770
so from the %uh exploit host neal are
you just need to all those lights

109
00:06:51,770 --> 00:06:57,050
the next pointer to a controlled offer
and then hi to allocate I'll trend of

110
00:06:57,050 --> 00:06:58,490
gentle with the stem size

111
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:02,099
so that for the you look in children up
of a well be returned it to the

112
00:07:02,099 --> 00:07:05,419
to use a and a you can leaks on the
table

113
00:07:05,419 --> 00:07:09,400
and achieve AsIII that's fallen his
history

114
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,600
butanol RN da linha has found

115
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,000
hasn't which is the next point is:
exhort

116
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,010
by a random value which almost to Lake

117
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:22,530
killed all the exploits buying on
rendering a

118
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:26,500
and also are but but this only applies

119
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:30,020
for to on the web hits up branch

120
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:33,320
in the trunk that is no line and I mean
I

121
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,190
concept so you can still exploits some
sort party went well

122
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,520
the law all on some applications way

123
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:44,360
with salts are are trained on me not
being implemented

124
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:47,790
and the second one is that she seem a
Canon

125
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:52,790
I like I I E and Firefox you can just
hope all the cheesy punching

126
00:07:52,790 --> 00:07:55,880
by some hot art interface

127
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,330
days no such interfacing GC although
some

128
00:07:59,330 --> 00:08:03,360
are secretive researchers like a are
telling me not are finding some way

129
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,090
chill

130
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:07,190
are you saw are number heap I E

131
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:10,650
previously to Chico a cheesy

132
00:08:10,650 --> 00:08:14,660
on nowadays Ahsan the function cracked
all back on page A can

133
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:20,010
in and watch a good in the function and
the hands on my body lice it hadn't may

134
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:21,520
be easier because some

135
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,600
Rd the sauce is not enough sometimes

136
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,919
and a full on the PC and Mac um

137
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,560
on the Mac platform it is hard evening
you you you stop all the memory

138
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:37,990
it why not take us that shitty so for
the pocahontas so forget barking puff

139
00:08:37,990 --> 00:08:38,490
puff pass

140
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:42,580
it is very easy you can just tell are a
comp out in the cold

141
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:45,670
to modify on the Add to some are some
are

142
00:08:45,670 --> 00:08:51,180
colder to explicitly takers are certain
that she see which is possible but it

143
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:51,740
only

144
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:55,660
a posh chill I'll for fall ninety
packing pappas

145
00:08:55,660 --> 00:08:59,820
I in the real world it is not feasible
and

146
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:04,459
I'll even play endi its he hissed a
project for their lil

147
00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:08,959
a block she publish it away chill argues
that he play all T

148
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,420
without GC he himself down memory and as
and do some

149
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:13,820
I

150
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:17,210
some %uh saying she wants to do under he
can take her

151
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:20,390
%uh he can 3.2 of our a chill

152
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:23,720
under then I'll put up %uh reliable

153
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,640
object to that that to that whole week
which is 11 good and that can be a bit

154
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,350
use that you are too little mopey most
of the heap

155
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:36,490
OSHA issues however that's not enough in
some cases

156
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:40,700
under are sometimes it will not meet a
need for the exploiters

157
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,000
so are today I want to introduce a new
technology called

158
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,170
RJs can chill week which I want to
deflate and of course a estar I is not a

159
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:50,590
very

160
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:54,170
idol of the technology but on different
are platform

161
00:09:54,170 --> 00:09:57,520
a stop %ah London my level is he

162
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,980
are not for them for the employees ISL s
and %ah

163
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:05,840
asai is a week because of La do I LD
Shana cash

164
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:10,380
so which means alza modulus she %uh send
our base

165
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,990
high and low on a Mac OS the Asti

166
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:18,800
much stronger are because each module
has sought independent has

167
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,770
killing dependent a salon for that a top
and the wild for the text

168
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:26,120
which indicates that's if he'll a nikola

169
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:31,520
me cable Italian and to mean that he'll
defeat a SLR because you have to leak

170
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:35,790
another place to which is subject to
base so that you can perform well

171
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:40,960
unblock and also DP is not sound manly

172
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:44,300
I'll of the technology it is implemented
by

173
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:48,250
on almost all the platforms are and

174
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:51,890
The Last Alliance trust in the box
source in the box

175
00:10:51,890 --> 00:10:55,530
yeah is are regarded as the last playoff
protection

176
00:10:55,530 --> 00:10:59,020
which limited the scope of luck exploit
her to kill some

177
00:10:59,020 --> 00:11:02,060
bad things under it has many

178
00:11:02,060 --> 00:11:06,589
a sandbox type soul and historic a
typical example is the IPO sandbox

179
00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:10,290
the enjoyed a sandbox as well as some
third-party

180
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,480
case and box

181
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,860
I'll is a typical example is some crumbs
and sandbox

182
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:21,339
so also you have I'll learn nowadays in
London late EPS

183
00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:26,850
are naked 64-bit are so lucky people in
some place on Mac OS

184
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:30,910
and the latest iPhone and iPad a
platform

185
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:35,310
and in the future I believe to enjoy the
platform will use the native a

186
00:11:35,310 --> 00:11:38,480
r6 careful ATP which indicates that sir

187
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,630
heap spraying pepper spraying is not in
any effective

188
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:45,920
and that you have to walk around this
issue

189
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,399
on maybe you can try to avoid heaps
break

190
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:52,950
spraying so law

191
00:11:52,950 --> 00:11:56,190
because the exploitation all web browser
us

192
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:59,430
arm he especially WebKit abrazos

193
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:02,769
it's very difficult so I quiet select
end of

194
00:12:02,769 --> 00:12:06,820
among their ability dependent
exploitation which means

195
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:10,040
you need to in mentality scholar some
art

196
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:13,470
exploitation long a tech techniques

197
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:17,360
a week which only apply to chill one
specific liability

198
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,839
and on both attack techniques may not be
very useful

199
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,070
are to apply to other liabilities
buttons are

200
00:12:25,070 --> 00:12:28,130
are master methodology to

201
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:31,149
discolored those are those methods

202
00:12:31,149 --> 00:12:36,060
is very useful so on now I well

203
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:39,110
I'll talk about a kiss topic we share
some point along

204
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:41,790
are just under fourteen Sahari I

205
00:12:41,790 --> 00:12:46,590
com so forth to is someone who believe
he so as we know that she and she can

206
00:12:46,590 --> 00:12:47,120
now

207
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:51,910
we have a CSS we have flour a concept
called a CSS selectors

208
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:55,340
which you can define a are some last CSS
selectors

209
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:58,650
are and applies also element into some
tax

210
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:01,850
so here you can feel a cold on

211
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:05,910
I define the two RCS CSS selectors

212
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:09,280
and the memory it was she last saw her
thirty-two

213
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:13,570
up fights and each fall %uh 16 but a 16
byte

214
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:17,120
and I T because I create a chill so it
is so 32

215
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,240
and then the CSS

216
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,720
director Lester can be near take which
means you can use laws

217
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,790
%uh get matched the CSS loss panchen and

218
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:31,200
to change its %uh detector tester
property

219
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:35,470
so he in this example I'd choose the
text that you want

220
00:13:35,470 --> 00:13:40,020
our CSS select us which means even
memory you can see that's

221
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:43,290
another offer is al Qaeda under this con

222
00:13:43,290 --> 00:13:46,710
it his say a 16-bit 16 packed

223
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:49,800
because it has only one

224
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,810
element however

225
00:13:52,810 --> 00:13:55,870
on when some are fun cheese 'cause done

226
00:13:55,870 --> 00:13:59,630
ourselves value of the Elector index is
still one

227
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:03,060
so why me for a second our second the
CSS

228
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:06,260
select and now a element which means

229
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:10,840
because Nole I'll you only have one CSS
selector element

230
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:14,050
but the index is one which means you may
achieve

231
00:14:14,050 --> 00:14:19,530
%ah art of Andre access yes only in the

232
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:23,080
punching a CSS selector specificity

233
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:27,670
you can see that say a as a senator
index is a pointer to

234
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:30,760
up the the on memory which in

235
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:36,060
does not belong to the CSS it's an actor
high and low %uh

236
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:39,460
if you recall the name of cellphone
Chanyeol may

237
00:14:39,460 --> 00:14:42,930
nursing classes I'll fun she only has 00
p.m.

238
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:46,589
we cannot all be right butter maybe well
not scrapped

239
00:14:46,589 --> 00:14:49,920
so a deep look of less CSS selector

240
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,470
structure indicates thats this fun the

241
00:14:53,470 --> 00:14:58,959
the this element to contest to are a
five-point a lot why is that big

242
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,430
be the 21 better value which is %uh

243
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:05,990
aligned the two eight bytes and followed
by our

244
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:09,149
eight bytes pointer soul

245
00:15:09,149 --> 00:15:14,050
if we check so I'll call the floor
cheerfully we can see that CE some cases

246
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:18,290
all delight can be achieved about to it
is very restrictive

247
00:15:18,290 --> 00:15:22,690
itttt has to Posada lot of checks to
Nichi

248
00:15:22,690 --> 00:15:25,950
the to achieve one bit a

249
00:15:25,950 --> 00:15:29,740
light so you can see the answer yeah
this is %uh

250
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:32,880
21 up but Bates value

251
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,980
and he'll have to meet her all those

252
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:40,000
I'll conditions well for them pulled up
foot I'll

253
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,529
third cue the fifth bids must that be

254
00:15:43,529 --> 00:15:46,730
while Luol there'll there'll or
something like that

255
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:51,180
and all the skull like a conditions is
it achieved

256
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:54,270
then that value can be our does a

257
00:15:54,270 --> 00:15:57,950
eighth upbeat can be changed the strong
gentle 21

258
00:15:57,950 --> 00:16:01,470
that someone ability so what

259
00:16:01,470 --> 00:16:04,750
week we can do we can possibly are

260
00:16:04,750 --> 00:16:08,440
a chew some up chase first it ensures

261
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:11,850
a value of as a low export a 20 X

262
00:16:11,850 --> 00:16:15,320
see there'll this seems to be pulled

263
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:18,709
although we have some other um the

264
00:16:18,709 --> 00:16:22,230
possible options they are lots lots the

265
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:25,970
useful and also the %ah some other
restrictions

266
00:16:25,970 --> 00:16:29,130
AFLCI employees for that sell I'll

267
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:32,160
value %uh the la offset

268
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,360
8 must and not to be I so that they'll
all valid point about

269
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:39,860
but says the issue can play he'll it s
the

270
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:44,510
arm other 64-bit %uh he has brain is
very difficult to so

271
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:47,959
you can also put I'll Mary Valley the
pointer

272
00:16:47,959 --> 00:16:52,250
up just her after that be its value
which is difficult

273
00:16:52,250 --> 00:16:54,920
so well we r is that

274
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:58,510
we have well they restrict him one bit
right achieved

275
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:01,520
so on now we should consider

276
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,660
what to overwrite so the first to
obscene

277
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:08,390
now the first pic and Kenny Kate is of
course that operate

278
00:17:08,390 --> 00:17:11,690
PF string implement so we can see that's

279
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:17,520
it a contest that she does %uh somehow
feels like a lot and ref count

280
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,780
on so you can maybe our change in the
ref

281
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:24,550
ref com to francie X's Forte there no
export hit you that

282
00:17:24,550 --> 00:17:27,620
they relax fee that'll which is not a
Pitre

283
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:30,860
useful because if you can changes that
allow you to a smaller

284
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:34,510
was the flow value then oz object can be

285
00:17:34,510 --> 00:17:38,230
read a earlier which is good but say
feel

286
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:42,860
make a to a larger number it is not
useful and also

287
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:45,970
you can choose about you make a lot and
then speaker

288
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:49,330
which is felt good plan was the amnesty
is all

289
00:17:49,330 --> 00:17:52,560
are it's the Haisla arm

290
00:17:52,560 --> 00:17:56,800
four bytes positions so it is in not
possible and in this case

291
00:17:56,800 --> 00:18:01,399
so the next to candidates should be that
loops

292
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:04,860
TF a rate of a so look at its are

293
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:08,370
structure so it case I'll and ref
comment

294
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:13,370
followed by a and eight how which is
sought real of football but of a pointer

295
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:18,310
are pointing to a buffer and the the
next to is the last price of

296
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:23,110
love other stuff I self-love offer under
the last play is that any

297
00:18:23,110 --> 00:18:26,990
first to deal which others are but a
rebuttal really is

298
00:18:26,990 --> 00:18:31,470
a donde that not that I real well be
assigned otherwise it is settled

299
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:34,810
which is quite good so

300
00:18:34,810 --> 00:18:38,140
a we can see when nope %uh rebuttal do
is unsigned

301
00:18:38,140 --> 00:18:41,590
then the memory layout his likeness so

302
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:45,140
Anders on I'll false fielder is there'll

303
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:48,840
because no law a great battle view is on
and highlight if

304
00:18:48,840 --> 00:18:52,410
others I'll a grip of a really is as
under: denzel

305
00:18:52,410 --> 00:18:57,190
laws of us to love you all love you are
applying to show the PR value

306
00:18:57,190 --> 00:19:00,600
pointer so

307
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,810
I'll let me only if one size la overall

308
00:19:03,810 --> 00:19:08,460
exploitation stretched the strategy so
fault of course we need to achieve

309
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:12,030
one beat solar I'll be right and then we
can

310
00:19:12,030 --> 00:19:15,220
achieve love because we change in the
last five hits

311
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:20,010
from fourteen to large you see there'll
so we can achieve additional a

312
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:23,770
they were ex- eighty bite right which is
quite good

313
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:27,720
and then we we tried tied to are achieve
the a

314
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:30,730
I a doubly on the final day weekend are

315
00:19:30,730 --> 00:19:34,310
achieve remote code execution so

316
00:19:34,310 --> 00:19:37,330
away we construct her this kind of

317
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:41,460
are on memory layout so it would contest
to chunk

318
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:46,530
why is that they were explanted chunk
wish %uh you have flood a bottle

319
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:50,490
I read offer lighter I if you from UPI

320
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:55,200
behind the was a in front of the CSS
selector away

321
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:58,480
wish you can use a tattoo a chief the
whole delights

322
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,730
and then you have a lot of with a
relaxed 40

323
00:20:01,730 --> 00:20:04,890
chunk we she is told us some a break

324
00:20:04,890 --> 00:20:08,050
up I rape of a cause I will buffer

325
00:20:08,050 --> 00:20:11,480
and the following bio I'll web key

326
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:15,470
I'll with a wet cloth jet which has
slowly table

327
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:18,520
so that you can lead to that three TV
cable the

328
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:21,540
alt to chill defeats the ASL

329
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:25,010
high and low something we talk

330
00:20:25,010 --> 00:20:29,380
fault if you do this memory layout
immediately you can't see lots of the

331
00:20:29,380 --> 00:20:30,010
process

332
00:20:30,010 --> 00:20:33,740
it crashed this it it because just of so
that's our

333
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:38,180
one beats right CIA stuff loop that
local well talus

334
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:44,190
a guest to the whole CSS lift until you
find it is lost to a CSS least

335
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:49,040
the CSS selector list so you can see
that it he is tough

336
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:53,680
upbeat which is called the as the is
lasting past history

337
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:59,770
which is its 18th bit if this bit is set
to one then it means some

338
00:20:59,770 --> 00:21:01,720
nozzle after on

339
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:05,830
CSS selector is a access to so it will
create a loop

340
00:21:05,830 --> 00:21:09,480
allies it well keeping are two talus are

341
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:12,780
and kill other the the process

342
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:17,750
is crashed so are less adjust to the
memory layout

343
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:21,610
we can put another are a buffer which
has

344
00:21:21,610 --> 00:21:25,180
love our fights they relax planned he
saw lent

345
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:28,920
I'll behind the thats there no extra 40

346
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,220
I would offer which indicates thats any

347
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:35,810
I'll is lost to inhabit history %uh is
set

348
00:21:35,810 --> 00:21:39,860
so that's a as a process will not crash
if the

349
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:42,910
always that's a wheel well of course

350
00:21:42,910 --> 00:21:45,990
I'll call some byproduct it well half

351
00:21:45,990 --> 00:21:50,670
%uh additionally additional up on his
own and chunk

352
00:21:50,670 --> 00:21:55,000
a lot of that all of those of us and of
course those

353
00:21:55,000 --> 00:22:00,060
of us will not be wasted k to just
before to avoid the process crash

354
00:22:00,060 --> 00:22:03,580
he can use those speaking of us the to
stall out to touch it

355
00:22:03,580 --> 00:22:06,840
late on so on the

356
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:10,030
problem here is that's I'll what which

357
00:22:10,030 --> 00:22:13,200
are there no export he wet cough shit to
choose

358
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,580
because lately swept girl with key wet
wet clutch it will be used at Uniqlo the

359
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,300
table

360
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:23,980
so love costs you also need to leaks out
now

361
00:22:23,980 --> 00:22:30,030
another base cause that text to base so
all you need to have some

362
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:33,090
are candidate soul %uh a typical

363
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:36,220
I'll case is that you need to half

364
00:22:36,220 --> 00:22:39,660
thats a object containing a/v cable

365
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:43,690
as well as some vector element so that
you can

366
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:47,900
I'll put a plane touches that some
better to vida some

367
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:52,700
are that it took to achieve layoff so
lucky to candidates %uh

368
00:22:52,700 --> 00:22:55,710
a foreign place html-link: element

369
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:59,430
as SVG cather element and the source
populist

370
00:22:59,430 --> 00:23:04,740
essential butthole are now offline is
there a X 40 so that's not a good option

371
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:08,680
so we have a look option choose that
weekend maybe

372
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:13,539
puts is nuts to the two faces why is to
put up Jeter just

373
00:23:13,539 --> 00:23:16,619
having our the table %uh objects

374
00:23:16,619 --> 00:23:21,509
into that memory and then try to free it
after we framed

375
00:23:21,509 --> 00:23:25,029
Reitz weekend put another object
containing

376
00:23:25,029 --> 00:23:30,279
a meeting our needs for example we can
put a a rape of a deal

377
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:33,519
I into that memory so that we can
achieve

378
00:23:33,519 --> 00:23:36,929
AI and AW so are

379
00:23:36,929 --> 00:23:40,639
/url at well I will introduce such as:
can sure the free

380
00:23:40,639 --> 00:23:43,929
sowwy some are are some up Jess

381
00:23:43,929 --> 00:23:47,330
of wet weather WebKit we has the thats
because %uh

382
00:23:47,330 --> 00:23:50,429
object can be allocated a few

383
00:23:50,429 --> 00:23:53,499
Astatula are property of that state s

384
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:56,739
I JS object and the

385
00:23:56,739 --> 00:24:00,519
you can free it up I just %uh I'm fits
that the

386
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:03,570
that value so a typical example is star

387
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:07,700
our web call number: input type so you
can see that a fleet

388
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,820
we set for each type 2 number it well
locate

389
00:24:10,820 --> 00:24:15,729
letter X 40 up bites memory and if we
make a TSSAA

390
00:24:15,729 --> 00:24:20,809
now it well be freed so I call this kind
of object to test potential

391
00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:24,089
me and AA in the WebKit you can all a

392
00:24:24,089 --> 00:24:28,469
and find a lot of such objets by up by
such in the patterns

393
00:24:28,469 --> 00:24:32,239
which is quite good so

394
00:24:32,239 --> 00:24:35,879
I let's adjust her memory layout solely
in the

395
00:24:35,879 --> 00:24:39,599
little extra up on the chunk a week no
we we just to put a

396
00:24:39,599 --> 00:24:43,759
as usual and also I into their export a
chunk

397
00:24:43,759 --> 00:24:47,099
we put so that's a %uh that a number
ending and the

398
00:24:47,099 --> 00:24:50,549
number input type %uh eating from awful

399
00:24:50,549 --> 00:24:55,070
was %uh overflow the buffer thought and
then we we just the free it

400
00:24:55,070 --> 00:24:59,339
after only three its we feel it with a
ir a battlefield

401
00:24:59,339 --> 00:25:04,619
so that we can achieve that AI and AW so

402
00:25:04,619 --> 00:25:07,719
off so well with those techniques

403
00:25:07,719 --> 00:25:10,969
create we can just are make that a

404
00:25:10,969 --> 00:25:15,509
on the eight hundred and he s the are
cold approved primitive

405
00:25:15,509 --> 00:25:18,809
so are

406
00:25:18,809 --> 00:25:21,809
the next topic is a hallway

407
00:25:21,809 --> 00:25:25,369
each huh tight you love lloyd's thats
heap spraying

408
00:25:25,369 --> 00:25:28,539
UTM because of laws 64bits

409
00:25:28,539 --> 00:25:33,159
platform soul with the AA on the AT&T
this it can be

410
00:25:33,159 --> 00:25:36,519
really really easy we had just to put on
the table

411
00:25:36,519 --> 00:25:40,070
%uh as Sun n based address

412
00:25:40,070 --> 00:25:44,719
and then we can achieve AR to veto that
content of the table

413
00:25:44,719 --> 00:25:47,789
so after leading the Continental me
table

414
00:25:47,789 --> 00:25:50,480
weekend eats that text her the

415
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,240
another session base so that we can
construct

416
00:25:53,240 --> 00:25:57,549
out P and then I'll a weekend I'll with
the

417
00:25:57,549 --> 00:26:02,720
a of weekend no laws are address of
knots are there to explain his Holland

418
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,130
offer

419
00:26:03,130 --> 00:26:06,140
so that we can put our show called into
that offer

420
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:09,210
and a change on the table archer that
after

421
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:13,350
so that we can achieve la obviously I'll
call to access

422
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:19,410
ok I'll code execution without keep
straight another no problem here is that

423
00:26:19,410 --> 00:26:22,559
whole weekend eloise about how peace
because

424
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:27,070
out his is not an Emmy a stable it'll
rely song washing lot

425
00:26:27,070 --> 00:26:30,120
so are less I'll look

426
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:33,720
at Salon are not handed them off with a
WebKit arm

427
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:39,010
64-bit so you can see that %uh upon love
process Krishi

428
00:26:39,010 --> 00:26:42,370
I'll 128 and megabytes

429
00:26:42,370 --> 00:26:46,309
J I keep a patient will be allocated and
you can see that

430
00:26:46,309 --> 00:26:50,880
well you can find address here is quite
a different

431
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:54,429
well from I'll address is likely images
address

432
00:26:54,429 --> 00:26:57,990
although he had pressed the address is
quite a different

433
00:26:57,990 --> 00:27:01,730
soul he if he got his anyway

434
00:27:01,730 --> 00:27:05,000
floss to such that the memory

435
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,940
to find a lot such as I G page %uh but
by some slots

436
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:13,030
a methods so that we can award to the
Hopi

437
00:27:13,030 --> 00:27:16,540
the actually you can see are me

438
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:19,830
each da scrip the Dallas could call
module

439
00:27:19,830 --> 00:27:22,990
that is the think single cause the spot
of

440
00:27:22,990 --> 00:27:28,679
are fixed excludable memory pool a wish
you well pointed shoes thats GigE page

441
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:33,290
which is part quote on the the he'll you
now have the solution which is you can

442
00:27:33,290 --> 00:27:34,010
point to

443
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:37,040
just to our use the offset

444
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:40,160
%uh because does of are some specific

445
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:40,840
%uh

446
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:44,559
me a WebKit watching that offset a well
be fixed

447
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:48,840
which is very good play employees in
this case you can just to use of that

448
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:55,230
so 8388 which his stuff offset of love
points choose our

449
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:59,870
start of a RJ cheap or but so this is a
very dirty a solution

450
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:03,070
and the out a friend to a washing of
WebKit thats

451
00:28:03,070 --> 00:28:06,279
upset well be different soul

452
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:12,899
%uh we weekend on well we we can find
some more who are smart away chill final

453
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:13,840
hehe page

454
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,129
up by looking at the source code when a

455
00:28:17,129 --> 00:28:23,090
RJG pages allocated so we can find that
has some meaning like it just to %uh

456
00:28:23,090 --> 00:28:27,169
allocated are very mean and I'm a value
and they do some shift

457
00:28:27,169 --> 00:28:30,419
so you can see is %uh highest some bass

458
00:28:30,419 --> 00:28:33,509
are always little and the the lower a

459
00:28:33,509 --> 00:28:36,759
least %uh time keep pace always there'll

460
00:28:36,759 --> 00:28:41,129
and the it has a minimum value and a
adult mask feet long the value

461
00:28:41,129 --> 00:28:44,470
and the and the red-hot hiya

462
00:28:44,470 --> 00:28:48,879
can't candy aisle ok it even allow deal
which can be

463
00:28:48,879 --> 00:28:51,999
only he you want I'll they'll chill 46

464
00:28:51,999 --> 00:28:57,990
8 ACE we which means it can be divided
by Judy

465
00:28:57,990 --> 00:29:02,899
so with that pattern we can do our
Italian a script for such a such that a

466
00:29:02,899 --> 00:29:03,710
memory

467
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:08,029
so that %uh finally we can find lots to
education without any improper

468
00:29:08,029 --> 00:29:13,940
so of slots we can get so-called
exclusion

469
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:17,299
so of let me summarize the WebKit
exploit

470
00:29:17,299 --> 00:29:22,210
saws the day this I'll kind of unrelated
case can in Patong

471
00:29:22,210 --> 00:29:26,440
all our web Kate a ATP so it is very
dangerous

472
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:30,110
hi my you may need to have different
exploitation

473
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:34,909
techniques on different product
platforms that means you how to

474
00:29:34,909 --> 00:29:39,460
a be very familiar always saw our web
que sauce

475
00:29:39,460 --> 00:29:43,090
so-called as well a slight exploitation
station nasa

476
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:48,600
so are after we have this case starting
we should

477
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,960
art a fun Daltile Mary %uh

478
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:55,980
find all slowly so why it can be
exploited so that we can give

479
00:29:55,980 --> 00:29:59,370
lucky ours are the suggestions to the
vendor

480
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:03,409
so love the first to are suggesting to

481
00:30:03,409 --> 00:30:06,610
I hope is that you can Allport a lot of

482
00:30:06,610 --> 00:30:10,159
are frequently used objects are to

483
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:14,960
he pollyanna just like a are chrome I
think I'll fly composer

484
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,820
the type attire a wealthy put at a v8

485
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:23,360
a cheap under but saying last the hymie
it is not so

486
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,250
well maybe we can do that and also we we
need to enable as a memory allocation

487
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:29,649
penalize beijing

488
00:30:29,649 --> 00:30:34,820
Solon especially for some small memory
allocation because the currently

489
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:39,260
cuz I'll is all wet wet kit and a chest
feels that he's going to lock

490
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:42,490
which in it's not title London a

491
00:30:42,490 --> 00:30:46,559
you feel %uh okay to the memory for the
specific size

492
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:49,620
then %uh the memory well be contacted
pave

493
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:52,960
and also I on upscale

494
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:55,970
because I introduced the ledge as
control for me

495
00:30:55,970 --> 00:30:59,250
both I'll of shit is quite put the
butter

496
00:30:59,250 --> 00:31:03,269
it he may a maybe a tool for late fall
exploiter

497
00:31:03,269 --> 00:31:06,330
chill are to craft a memory layout

498
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:09,620
chill achieve that he falsely which is
really bad

499
00:31:09,620 --> 00:31:13,100
so all maybe we can recusal

500
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:17,320
number up of objects which school with
such as: control free

501
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:22,429
a feature and also we of course need to
make that CIT page a hot

502
00:31:22,429 --> 00:31:26,970
how the two guess especially for the
sixty a 64-bit

503
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:32,970
so loved I suggest change your Apple and
Google because they both on maintains a

504
00:31:32,970 --> 00:31:34,000
court of law

505
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,019
after the loss a WebKit so I'll

506
00:31:37,019 --> 00:31:40,500
always I can see some arc a secret
handshakes

507
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,980
applied that you some cold a branch
about it will not speak

508
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:47,929
a pilot you all the call the branch
which we all need less on our time

509
00:31:47,929 --> 00:31:48,570
window

510
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:52,879
for hackers to exploit and of course

511
00:31:52,879 --> 00:31:56,419
I'll choose from OS only M&A us some
hope

512
00:31:56,419 --> 00:32:02,059
ATT lenders my suggestion is that you
have you need to upgrade to the web case

513
00:32:02,059 --> 00:32:05,230
a low sheen and the web case I'll like a
road race

514
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:09,710
frequently to avoid just on base being
exploited by some

515
00:32:09,710 --> 00:32:13,350
eighty GIs of a long time which is
really that bad

516
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:18,129
so are also law which has do exploits
that with him

517
00:32:18,129 --> 00:32:21,720
I have to a on UNAIDS that's it he s

518
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:25,230
the best and the most I think he'll
rendering engine in the world

519
00:32:25,230 --> 00:32:29,529
soul are whitten with my research I need
to stand

520
00:32:29,529 --> 00:32:32,620
%uh the following persons who helped me
a lot

521
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:36,879
doing my research thanks a lot and

522
00:32:36,879 --> 00:32:40,429
us yet %uh that's all for my public and
it has chase

523
00:32:40,429 --> 00:32:41,190
its
