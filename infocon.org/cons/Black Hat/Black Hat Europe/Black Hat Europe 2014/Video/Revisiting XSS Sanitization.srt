popularity

40
00:02:25,069 --> 00:02:28,519
that's why they are so many so

41
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:31,859
normally cites his visit to Canada as a
part of these things

42
00:02:31,859 --> 00:02:35,470
form post most sites are reform

43
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:39,069
will you can post something you can book
your question you can on certain

44
00:02:39,069 --> 00:02:43,170
or private messaging if you are logged
in user then you can send a private

45
00:02:43,170 --> 00:02:45,019

46
00:02:45,019 --> 00:02:49,079

47
00:02:49,079 --> 00:02:52,299
support the goats commence

48
00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:55,760
signature creation actually this
signature

49
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,230
has nothing to do with the can't go
signature this is a signature that

50
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,060
normally you

51
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,519
used who you are basically so

52
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:08,639
this in the pacific editor of Magento
commerce return to go much is a very

53
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,600
popular gomer e-commerce platform

54
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:14,510
it's an eBay company basically you can
see if the

55
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:17,720
this was available on their forum on
their message at every year

56
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:22,630
I come to this leader but if you want to
bore something you can make that

57
00:03:22,630 --> 00:03:26,200
text bored with the help of this be but
then with the help of I E

58
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:29,829
underlined court cord you can email

59
00:03:29,829 --> 00:03:34,640
so so many options you when you can do
some styling also

60
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:35,910
like sightings in

61
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:40,560
color so but it is not a necessity that
visit again he does are only available

62
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,069
in the form of the buttons

63
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:45,930
they may be available in the form of
some particular text or form

64
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:49,520
but to go for my phone number and in the
pacific 82 have pleaded prostitution

65
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:53,190
if you want before settling on this
student ossetian form

66
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:56,930
you have to alright the move the link in
skin records

67
00:03:56,930 --> 00:04:00,870
and then in just want that in pieces you
can you can mention a link

68
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:04,880
and to determine our committee legally
can look into a link estimate based

69
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:08,380
so this is the busy weekend leader or

70
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:12,450
that is right now in use on and his own
on this seller

71
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:17,040
central form and on the air Kindle
direct publishing forum

72
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,660
for example on these two forms if you
want to Boston

73
00:04:20,660 --> 00:04:24,560
image you have to mentioned image URL

74
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,180
in who mocks of exclamation then there
was a good leader we got here okay

75
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,220
if they do not do much to fix the
mission this is I'll

76
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,760
image URL this is the Pacific editor of
Yahoo email

77
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:42,240
these are the top sites was fukt does

78
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,430
to the rock towed back to visit Katie

79
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:50,210
for example Fulop this is a visiting can
either be a swingy cutie

80
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:54,080
so see so many options you can even
embed a video you can look

81
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:58,169
image link hope popular Dec

82
00:04:58,169 --> 00:05:01,479
Pacific eighty Days Inn so lost a min a

83
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:05,070
I'll find a bug it through a lot a dick
time to help you told me

84
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:10,229
that initially we have or 5,000 owners
but last week I was discussing this with

85
00:05:10,229 --> 00:05:10,900
the developer

86
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:14,380
and he told me that right now there are
40,000 old norse

87
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:19,330
of this misery Katie Did so imagine all
the forty thousand for example we take a

88
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:20,050
less number

89
00:05:20,050 --> 00:05:24,270
imagine haha the site so using this was
a picky eater and if you exercise this

90
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:25,320
wasn't a good leader

91
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:30,150
certainly the excess impact will be on
all the sites that are using this third

92
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:31,330
body was a big eighty did

93
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:34,650
so this is the visibility to buy jive

94
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:38,770
a very popular visitor get either
according to the statistics you can find

95
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:39,500
a whole

96
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,910
list of sites on this URL they claim
that they have millions of using

97
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:47,620
I don't know this is the visiting Katie
don't

98
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:48,700
tiny MC soul

99
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:51,950
many options boarded air leak underlined
justify so

100
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:55,450
let's see what we can do with the
specific eighty does

101
00:05:55,450 --> 00:05:59,890
according to Tinian see they claim that
there visiting any days in using

102
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,590
Microsoft Oracle

103
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:05,140
jive is also using some weird there was
a good leader

104
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:08,560
Facebook and on this you are you can
find a huge list

105
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,710
so this is a CK

106
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:15,380
visit again he did and the popular
visitor gate he did so they're doing

107
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:15,730
better

108
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:20,230
ahead on their website that during the
development of CKD then we had consumed

109
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:25,760
a beer how n455 cups of coffee so during
the development of visibility don't so

110
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,510
they had consumed at the moment of
coffee

111
00:06:27,510 --> 00:06:30,610
yup and then there is everybody did this

112
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,870
and he did it has been delayed by a
single person name i think is eso

113
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:37,050
it sounds like a Chinese but the
popularity

114
00:06:37,050 --> 00:06:40,110
I'm more focused on the popularity

115
00:06:40,110 --> 00:06:43,310
so right now the specific and he did is
in used on

116
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:46,560
in c.net seen it lost

117
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,140
dying I checked people it is Lexar 110
website

118
00:06:51,140 --> 00:06:54,480
out of all the site in the world the
ranking is 110

119
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,490
is so popular to see that for mister
normally reused loss

120
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:02,960
general questions so this was a big
eighty Days Inn use on that

121
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,370
/url seen it forms cross-site scripting

122
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:11,830
I believe low more so don't use this
technique oh so the noonday noble cause

123
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,100
I describing a will not get into the New
Deal

124
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:20,080
so just take on me so this is it a go
via focus on scripting

125
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,400
because I'm new here it is not going
anywhere

126
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:27,590
it was there is there any will be there
right now when I am talking to you

127
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:30,730
exile crispy

128
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:34,100
out of 100 top sites are not able to
cross site scripting

129
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:38,250
right now when we are talking if someone
wants to see

130
00:07:38,250 --> 00:07:42,080
a elect one on 50 top sites he can bring
me

131
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,950
after the doc I can show all dialects so

132
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:49,780
crossing disturbing is basically an
epidemic so despite we have 15 years of

133
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,880
mitigation efforts

134
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,270
it was first discovered 15 years ago so
far it is the a

135
00:07:55,270 --> 00:08:00,120
and unfortunately and the moment

136
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:00,770
first

137
00:08:00,770 --> 00:08:05,129
the old of top 100 sites are gonna but
to weaken Nord

138
00:08:05,129 --> 00:08:08,259
mitigate so far cost side scripting

139
00:08:08,259 --> 00:08:11,979
for details I would I would recommend
you to look at

140
00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:16,940
my slight state on any public the force
when is basically got some disturbing my

141
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,629
love very secure code

142
00:08:18,629 --> 00:08:23,970
index late last year here at are and I
center I was the here at I dot SAE

143
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:24,550
Europe

144
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:27,599
it during the web seminar represented
the slide

145
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:32,459
so NN in the slide you will see all top
sites that I I was able to XSS

146
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:36,669
and the second one is on breaking pitch
be the last and a few months ago I

147
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:38,610
presented the set laps a spin

148
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:43,250
so all PHP based /xs:annotation reviews
are broken I broke all of them

149
00:08:43,250 --> 00:08:47,100
so you can you can see all the
information so they are online

150
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:51,649
so lets the stock with the tale of one
thousand dollar

151
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:55,720
bone be that I was awarded by Magento
commerce

152
00:08:55,720 --> 00:09:01,120
and I broke the reason we can you do two
months ago

153
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,160
Majin bu head officially launched a
backbone people down

154
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:09,089
and according to their program the
maximum payout for cross-site scripting

155
00:09:09,089 --> 00:09:12,829
in the 30-year loan application is one
thousand dollar so they wanted me one

156
00:09:12,829 --> 00:09:13,529
thousand dollar

157
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:17,010
its not only a one thousand dollar where
the right no

158
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:20,339
the effect the visit we can eat it

159
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:23,790
on their farm has been busy but

160
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:26,570
I am the reason for this soul

161
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:30,830
any was handcuffed

162
00:09:30,830 --> 00:09:36,170
so it has been disabled and since last
three months it is disabled

163
00:09:36,170 --> 00:09:39,760
sold so far they don't follow the
solution because

164
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,790
they contacted me after fixing some
issue

165
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,790
there too sharpy's look at our record

166
00:09:45,790 --> 00:09:49,120
and mmm I brought the Corning so

167
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,440
so far they don't find any third-party
solution you can check on this URL

168
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:57,570
and I

169
00:09:57,570 --> 00:10:03,420
did and the effect in this is not a form
for the sake of our look in the number

170
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:04,050
of users

171
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:07,850
this farm has is so popular form

172
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:13,140
I'll and here is some statistics

173
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:17,230
the most visitors ever was 10280 cell

174
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:21,660
only in June well it means that so many
people are using this form

175
00:10:21,660 --> 00:10:25,030
and right now the posting is disabled

176
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:29,860
just because of Pacific 82 so imagine
that number of affected users on this

177
00:10:29,860 --> 00:10:30,720
was a good leader

178
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:34,090
so this was the Pacific any that I short
on the only slight

179
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:37,380
so it is every read what

180
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,820
every via Bennett was there it was
everywhere it was

181
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:45,410
on the farm boasting it was on when you
want to send a private message

182
00:10:45,410 --> 00:10:49,320
so missed the text area you can write

183
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:53,270
anything and if you want to make your
text more you will simply click on that

184
00:10:53,270 --> 00:10:53,860
button

185
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:57,380
italics or this is how let's start by
setting

186
00:10:57,380 --> 00:11:02,680
how it works on the left hand side

187
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,020
this is the same text of specific a
leader

188
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:09,850
if if you want to make a text border
with a particular size in with a

189
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:10,800
particular color

190
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,290
and if you will a stock-picking on
different but and the same text looks

191
00:11:14,290 --> 00:11:14,830
like that

192
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:18,610
be fighting this must be for phone size

193
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:21,840
girl a reason do we want to make the
next we'll hear size

194
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:25,350
so these a particular sent back and
effect appears like that

195
00:11:25,350 --> 00:11:29,950
is bordered Alex but in Delhi because
these are the St will be a switch Beck

196
00:11:29,950 --> 00:11:30,610
said he does

197
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:33,840
if you look in the source code you will
see this light

198
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,590
mortgage-backed the despair

199
00:11:36,590 --> 00:11:39,990
and that has been created with the style
for NDSi 16

200
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:44,650
with style color:blue so actually nasty
man we are getting this

201
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:48,260
but visiting a leader for the user to
have a back XPS

202
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:51,470
you can simply be because he was honored
to be your best email but

203
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:54,950
actually and if you look at the source
cool you you're getting this line

204
00:11:54,950 --> 00:12:00,660
just a quick test district is the X is
suspected I

205
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,290
Troy dick just eg do in the backseat yup

206
00:12:04,290 --> 00:12:09,150
any I receive this output it does not
work because they are properly including

207
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:09,700
everything

208
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:14,330
but one thing I noticed to see here in
the back to these document or cookie

209
00:12:14,330 --> 00:12:18,290
they have converted this document or
cookie into the world removed

210
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:22,140
this so removed %uh

211
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:28,380
by looking at removed I talk some think
that

212
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:32,100
they are using this one so

213
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:36,110
they're using corning I don't CA
securityclass

214
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:40,080
because is the coordinator is one of the
most popular PHP framework

215
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:45,040
its definition LED if their phone book
who mind don't go keyword in that back

216
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:47,040
richter they can would this work in blue

217
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,400
removed so I realize that they are using
coordinator also they have a protection

218
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:53,780
also for the coordinator

219
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:57,630
okay what is good and I don't what is
most popular framework

220
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:02,670
second most-watched php project and the
highest number of folks on

221
00:13:02,670 --> 00:13:06,690
neps report to check on YouTube this is
back popular coordinator

222
00:13:06,690 --> 00:13:11,140
according to this site this number of
web sites are using CodeIgniter

223
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:17,010
I had some time to look at Gordon died
on this URL you can find five unique

224
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:18,760
bypasses of coordinator

225
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,800
they all have been fixed but if someone
wants to learn you can see

226
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,120
okay that's come back to visit getting

227
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:29,920
ok so this is not this a hardened let's
start breaking it

228
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,240
so this is how I make the text board

229
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:37,540
okay of a you know from the penis like
that this

230
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:40,670
be in that particular form has been
converted into a ball

231
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:43,690
dag ok I park let's dry

232
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:47,330
on most awkward so many basic thing
let's try one mo solar

233
00:13:47,330 --> 00:13:49,320
maybe it will work okay

234
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:53,420
I've been working director here be

235
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:56,790
slash onmouseover and everything the
same

236
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:01,350
here myspace and I wanted to see what is
the behavior of

237
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:07,130
their visit to Canada as it is I'd you
can see there is no all boarded and has

238
00:14:07,130 --> 00:14:08,070
been created

239
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:11,760
it means that this will not work in

240
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,800
nothing happens so this thing going

241
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,770
I cannot Texas with decked thing okay

242
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:23,520
if you remember you can post the URL be
back but the group's index URL

243
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:27,380
in this a legitimate URL it we can look
into a URL with

244
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:31,290
a href okay I can what did this URL

245
00:14:31,290 --> 00:14:34,740
which we just supposed line normal use
the supposed to end at initiative URL

246
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:36,240
but I am NOT a normal user

247
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:40,490
so I entered a job I skip you I and I
entered I get are you a decade

248
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:44,520
Dec you are a beast LA escape education
but see what is the behavior

249
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:47,680
they have removed the word JavaScript

250
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:51,410
because coordinator was there it is
skating how does

251
00:14:51,410 --> 00:14:55,880
get stopping and and the same time they
have offended HTTP colon

252
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:59,930
Italy's this is not going to work

253
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:03,250
if you will up and if you will force

254
00:15:03,250 --> 00:15:07,040
the URL to start with an STD be it will
not work you cannot execute JavaScript

255
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,750
in a similar manner they have appended
STD be hearing back to you and I

256
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:14,840
it means that this also does not work
okay had to step

257
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:17,920
one can find a style

258
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,210
well when can been this color byu okay

259
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:24,610
why couldn't you why not use I E based

260
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:27,790
dynamic expression I E based

261
00:15:27,790 --> 00:15:31,120
Joe I skipped dynamics passion with the
help of with

262
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,600
expression electron see nothing has been
changed

263
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:40,210
except the BU has been can readily I i'm
HHW into wrecked expression elect when

264
00:15:40,210 --> 00:15:43,420
again see the problem

265
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:48,830
expression got removed because court
denied is there

266
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:53,870
or denied it every step is causing
problems but I had bypasses I know

267
00:15:53,870 --> 00:16:00,870
up so here you see another problem

268
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:05,210
in order to bypass coordinator

269
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:09,320
because they're removing the one
expression

270
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:14,480
with the help of removed these are very
or take that has been discussed on this

271
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:19,950
hackers foreign policy slackers if you
use a multi-line comment inside the

272
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:20,950
white expression

273
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:23,970
the this number feeling coming basically
you see

274
00:16:23,970 --> 00:16:27,350
multi-line coming in title one
expression I E

275
00:16:27,350 --> 00:16:30,660
or liberals are simply ignores it and

276
00:16:30,660 --> 00:16:33,960
and the same time you can bypass the
goodnight

277
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:38,040
because they're only looking at the
light expression this is not an

278
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:38,690
expression

279
00:16:38,690 --> 00:16:42,760
this is expr E went modeling comment

280
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,640
so it amuses me this technique and if
you look at that is a

281
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:50,680
in court feet now there is no removed

282
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:54,320
it means what I am sending I am getting
back any

283
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,320
I E I you simply me ignore it but the
problem

284
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,410
this would expression can

285
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:06,110
only work if it is a value of a style

286
00:17:06,110 --> 00:17:09,390
when the problem I discussed the problem
on the next slide

287
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:14,839
hit the problem is that CSS who only
work if we have a property name

288
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:18,089
and a value but here you see day this

289
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:23,189
stay dead this is a property name CSS
parser realize you need is a property

290
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:26,900
colette it's simply a but experts

291
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:32,210
it will not work the problem is the
color I want to get rid of this property

292
00:17:32,210 --> 00:17:36,010
in order to make the CSS work because I
want to assign the value with

293
00:17:36,010 --> 00:17:39,040
expression bluestein so that it will
work

294
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:43,330
the problem the question I had how to
get rid of colour

295
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:48,040
mix idid came to my mind I want to break
this was a big a leader

296
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:51,360
okay let's use by tag

297
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:56,980
previously I was using style a duplex to
spy tagged in the allowed for Mick

298
00:17:56,980 --> 00:18:02,160
no a seat red

299
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,380
the style if I change this size and
color

300
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:09,350
simply remove it and I use the style and
use with expression

301
00:18:09,350 --> 00:18:10,210
internally

302
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:14,250
becomes this one expand

303
00:18:14,250 --> 00:18:19,280
gloss with expression it seems that it
will but but the problem

304
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,900
before you stylin dynamically did you
need an

305
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:27,550
acute called class will get the value
looks fine

306
00:18:27,550 --> 00:18:30,830
it issue work but if we need style here

307
00:18:30,830 --> 00:18:35,290
here we have a class so the next problem
how to get rid of this class

308
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:39,020
okay but but

309
00:18:39,020 --> 00:18:43,900
I am getting the value of what I walk
but the problem how to get rid of this

310
00:18:43,900 --> 00:18:47,850
so I part okay less you spied one more
time here

311
00:18:47,850 --> 00:18:51,580
style is equipped with style and then
expression okay wall

312
00:18:51,580 --> 00:18:54,710
then realized did in the style beer

313
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:57,940
and there is a value but now

314
00:18:57,940 --> 00:19:01,150
another problem glossed is he going to
do

315
00:19:01,150 --> 00:19:04,350
the whole value now the only thing left

316
00:19:04,350 --> 00:19:07,440
if I will jumbotron this class

317
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,910
I can i hella very good assignment I can

318
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:14,270
executive job I skipped okay simply

319
00:19:14,270 --> 00:19:17,940
in order to break and that you don't
excuse EE course now

320
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,160
I use double quotes okay see if I

321
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:24,170
is he going to do w courtside what
happen internally

322
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:27,610
hey you see gloss a key wood has been
closed

323
00:19:27,610 --> 00:19:31,670
with an empty value and now this tiny
has a value

324
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:35,520
that I wants so on the next page

325
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:38,960
we have a Nexus S in ordered

326
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:44,050
I E N Roses it works but then the next
question I ask myself

327
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:49,600
who cares about ADA sorry

328
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:52,520
okay let's try to make it work in a
modern browser

329
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:56,030
his the final actor

330
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:59,230
in the red line be. style

331
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:03,380
double course on my also what using this
technique

332
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:06,990
because I know how they are working this
with this flaw

333
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:10,010
I was able to elect cookie

334
00:20:10,010 --> 00:20:15,280
a so maybe cooking so now if to look at
the size of the cooking

335
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,460
it be added to I XSS this in Morden

336
00:20:18,460 --> 00:20:21,580
chrome browser and

337
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:25,960
and the sad thing the PHP session ID

338
00:20:25,960 --> 00:20:29,720
is not I should be only to

339
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:33,380
while what as an attack I can do

340
00:20:33,380 --> 00:20:37,220
another thing I fall on their form if

341
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:40,690
you to form a more detailed there is a
particular batch

342
00:20:40,690 --> 00:20:43,790
the assigned to a particular bad hey
this guy's a forum for reader

343
00:20:43,790 --> 00:20:47,350
idealized if someone who forwarded that

344
00:20:47,350 --> 00:20:50,380
it amusing he has more privileges as
compared to me

345
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:54,220
and imagine PHP session ID cookie is not
session only

346
00:20:54,220 --> 00:20:58,940
I can simply send a message I can simply
X 338 the cookie

347
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,940
and lobby on behalf of an administrator

348
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:06,920
disaster but I will recommend you

349
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:10,679
I did a short write-up so the item is
available here so everything is online

350
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:11,929
you can read the writeup

351
00:21:11,929 --> 00:21:16,520
from that so let's this is the China
Study of one thousand dollar but but

352
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,370
dole X identify some common injection
point because

353
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:22,500
I was using different pics at a single
place a

354
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:27,230
but there is something common you can
use and anyone can use

355
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:30,940
so these are the common injection by
specifically does has

356
00:21:30,940 --> 00:21:34,450
in my experience on my research I fall

357
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:38,390
almost all visit and he doesn't allow
you to insert an image

358
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:41,470
allow you to insert the URL

359
00:21:41,470 --> 00:21:44,690
allow us to set some at the most like ID
like gloss

360
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:48,970
they also allow you to upload a file or
upload a video

361
00:21:48,970 --> 00:21:52,800
these are the common injection bikes
that I as an attacker can use

362
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,860
now I will present for each injection
point

363
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:59,180
there is a particular methodology that
you can follow excess

364
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:02,310
any was a big 82 so let's start with the
first one

365
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:06,260
how to attack insert image feature

366
00:22:06,260 --> 00:22:09,340
this is attack richter one

367
00:22:09,340 --> 00:22:12,380
so

368
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:16,920
I ask from you what is a special in this
URL

369
00:22:16,920 --> 00:22:22,460
just look at the UN tried to identify
use your phone to anything interesting

370
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:23,560
this URL

371
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:30,030
anyone who would like to tell

372
00:22:30,030 --> 00:22:34,560
anything interesting in this you and you
fall access is big on it I actually I

373
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,390
have no money so it's a free domain

374
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:39,700
psychotic successfully don't so but

375
00:22:39,700 --> 00:22:42,780
but they do the same thing by looking at
this URL

376
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:48,820
you follow this URL has Dec

377
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:53,700
back much characteristics Westway it's a
valid URL

378
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,750
all browser will render dick is an image

379
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:00,970
all Bros a return date it's a
value-added second

380
00:23:00,970 --> 00:23:04,060
in case of explicit decoding

381
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:09,870
on the server side this URL will help
you in breaking the connection will help

382
00:23:09,870 --> 00:23:10,410
you in

383
00:23:10,410 --> 00:23:13,670
executing JavaScript tag case

384
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:19,080
if imagine there is no explicit decoding
even then this UN will help I will show

385
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:19,400
you

386
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:22,740
I will give you for each case I will
show you a Nexus S

387
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:26,560
and the this is the URL for the sake of
URL

388
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:31,430
this URL it has a lot of is stuff inside
it and the last one s we do best

389
00:23:31,430 --> 00:23:35,520
dollars to prosecution because if you
look at the URL is basically an

390
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:39,580
image 5 got SVG send us for you find
after question my Juno is

391
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:44,230
cutie but I would go there's nothing
browsers simply boat look at it so

392
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:47,940
you can simply execute whatever you want
now let's talk

393
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:52,780
okay plus 20 explicit be going case for
example if you produce you are going to

394
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,900
some web application

395
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,580
and when

396
00:23:54,580 --> 00:23:57,830
but I like me because I'm not a
developer they

397
00:23:57,830 --> 00:24:02,159
I bring some explicit decoding what
happened if

398
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:06,240
you will be gore disperse 122 it will
begin what did you do

399
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,000
W Court and this person it going to do
will be converted into

400
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,450
double coat and then after decoding
application

401
00:24:15,450 --> 00:24:19,450
sends back to the United the browser any
in the browser this will be a part of

402
00:24:19,450 --> 00:24:24,169
images source: attribute emit source has
a double course I don't it means that

403
00:24:24,169 --> 00:24:24,460
the

404
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:28,809
this first a Belcourt after this
excessive will simply break

405
00:24:28,809 --> 00:24:32,100
the source acting rude and dollar skip
can be executed

406
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:37,919
now show you an example X up thereof is
a big adidas sock-b_ you can create your

407
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:38,960
own porn bot

408
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:44,220
so I don't know you can see that or not
but

409
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:48,830
if you look at closely on this a
screenshot it is stops

410
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:54,149
XSS NW courts break everything because
the developers are being explicit

411
00:24:54,149 --> 00:24:54,769
decoding

412
00:24:54,769 --> 00:24:58,620
this issue has been fixed I reported
this to them and here you see

413
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:02,799
allowed one almost over that works this
is the URL

414
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,880
you can use to attack insert image
feature use this URL

415
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:10,710
more need to use a genuine URL for any
me this is also Jen when you are

416
00:25:10,710 --> 00:25:14,750
but this will help you in executing an
exorcist okay

417
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:18,840
this short right if you can read this
okay I use the same URL

418
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:22,299
in order to XSS get up model rear

419
00:25:22,299 --> 00:25:26,760
I was able to execute s 3G based
exorcist and

420
00:25:26,760 --> 00:25:29,980
this 500-point means 500 US dollar

421
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:34,080
this is not a point so they avoided me
five hundred years daughter

422
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,720
because Reed St San SVG image so the
application

423
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:41,010
execuse the JavaScript that is inside

424
00:25:41,010 --> 00:25:45,280
SVG so I would recommend you the stock
by my view

425
00:25:45,280 --> 00:25:48,880
so many awesome talk to you you you can
find it on this link

426
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,120
the same URL

427
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,330
that one attack vector I also exorcist

428
00:25:55,330 --> 00:25:59,390
and his own silence and Berlin Amazon
Kindle publishing phone right now

429
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:05,210
XSS is alive but the F-sixteen a sense
the previously it was a stored XSS

430
00:26:05,210 --> 00:26:08,970
but now it appears only in preview now
it's a self picture but previously it

431
00:26:08,970 --> 00:26:09,890
was stored XSS

432
00:26:09,890 --> 00:26:13,250
but is it is still alive if if you
remember

433
00:26:13,250 --> 00:26:16,460
a from the only slight EM is on if

434
00:26:16,460 --> 00:26:19,540
in there was a big eater if you want to
place an image in your message

435
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:23,240
you have to play as the image you are a
in between the marks of exclamation

436
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:27,710
just like that stock market on
television than image URL and then close

437
00:26:27,710 --> 00:26:28,799
mocks have a clear mission

438
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:32,600
internally they will be treated like
that image source: %um goes here

439
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,150
ok this is this is live you can't

440
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:39,280
check use this URL on Amazone socit

441
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:43,309
because in that gives their developers
are not winning any explicit decoding

442
00:26:43,309 --> 00:26:43,780
see

443
00:26:43,780 --> 00:26:48,340
but an apron to do with it but in that
case of a question mark

444
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:51,970
in the US I had double court so that
double gourd a hot body double course

445
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:53,570
and they forgot to and quartered

446
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:56,820
is that's why it BX

447
00:26:56,820 --> 00:27:00,410
and almost get executed so this is a

448
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:06,309
a Nexus S on Amazon Kindle visibility to
second

449
00:27:06,309 --> 00:27:10,700
if be if sites allow your visit to
Canada allow you to insert an image

450
00:27:10,700 --> 00:27:15,880
then the second attack what do you can
use is this one

451
00:27:15,880 --> 00:27:20,410
service agreed that are you are a beast
the job I skip execution

452
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:23,460
in combination with SPG an external but

453
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:26,780
this is only useful if

454
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:31,669
site will dynamically up and

455
00:27:31,669 --> 00:27:35,010
or add anchor tag intact I'll image tag

456
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:38,669
any it appears often for example

457
00:27:38,669 --> 00:27:42,640
if you go to put at and you upload your
image then

458
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,500
pewter dynamically generate an anchor
dad and blessed

459
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:49,580
angered I don't worry mister ed so it
makes

460
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:52,809
image in the form of you and then this
happens I think

461
00:27:52,809 --> 00:27:56,090
6 out of 10 cases sites dynamically at
anchor tag

462
00:27:56,090 --> 00:27:57,320
and they borrowed this

463
00:27:57,320 --> 00:28:00,490
same URL that you use for the image and
they take it

464
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:04,130
s such for that a href so

465
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:07,159
I exorcist jive

466
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:10,730
because they are using they are

467
00:28:10,730 --> 00:28:15,090
trying to have an anchor tag anonymous
source so I excesses there is a bigger

468
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:15,529
leader

469
00:28:15,529 --> 00:28:21,149
another potential attack vector but this
has been no fixing water Firefox

470
00:28:21,149 --> 00:28:24,580
I this you can use in to

471
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:28,720
a dos Firefox if you will use this fact
but this has been fixed now

472
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:32,279
let how to attack attributes

473
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:35,659
because was a big eater also allow you

474
00:28:35,659 --> 00:28:39,120
to set these attributes if you want to
have a particular image

475
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:42,289
for example somehow image gone then you
can also

476
00:28:42,289 --> 00:28:46,289
set a value of an art I native text for
the image if

477
00:28:46,289 --> 00:28:49,899
images doc not available on that
particular URL

478
00:28:49,899 --> 00:28:53,129
to be other Aquino stepped you can

479
00:28:53,129 --> 00:28:56,889
said any visible a leader how to attack
it

480
00:28:56,889 --> 00:29:01,559
is a three-step process just hang this
shop on your wall

481
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:04,889
it 3x Asus anything

482
00:29:04,889 --> 00:29:09,039
in case of Aki Bergen decks only I am
talking only about

483
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:13,889
actor who can text on my wall I had

484
00:29:13,889 --> 00:29:18,009
n different jostling that so the first
one

485
00:29:18,009 --> 00:29:23,159
look at the situation for example if
visibility days allow you to set an

486
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:23,740
attribute

487
00:29:23,740 --> 00:29:29,269
that internally they have possible forms
I don't the dams are using double course

488
00:29:29,269 --> 00:29:34,019
I know they will be using single court
here as an example I'm using class

489
00:29:34,019 --> 00:29:37,899
but it can be any attribute okay the
first back what they would be

490
00:29:37,899 --> 00:29:41,570
double course on mouse or double course
I'll ever in because you're not sure

491
00:29:41,570 --> 00:29:45,250
the dams are using single cordoba course
book on legal issue 15

492
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:48,789
so the first step is a hey you see the
both the locals

493
00:29:48,789 --> 00:29:53,100
it looks across all browsers the second
one if they're using single go to list

494
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:54,679
our decorative a single course

495
00:29:54,679 --> 00:29:58,240
and the tired one is specific to all I E
browsers

496
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:03,080
is a back tickle the are you pieces back
big as a valid separate you can use it

497
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:06,340
this only specific to all our emails
they said three step process

498
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:09,799
leader I will show you how you can make
a solution also

499
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:10,790
by following the

500
00:30:10,790 --> 00:30:14,460
methodology it's that simple when I will
present the solution which is basically

501
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:16,100
an because I would show you later

502
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:19,510
so I exorcist the

503
00:30:19,510 --> 00:30:24,180
yeah yes yes yes yes

504
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:28,690
yes yes it is AP use any missed you will
be assignment

505
00:30:28,690 --> 00:30:33,170
its specific to all extra for
extradition yup so

506
00:30:33,170 --> 00:30:37,530
I exorcist Yahoo emails visiting Katie
Did with the help of this

507
00:30:37,530 --> 00:30:41,790
attack methodology three-step process
and Yahoo

508
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:44,930
fix this issue so back take

509
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:48,400
is back because every year to move US
test for good to

510
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:52,140
and go to properly control back
beginning if in the record to have a

511
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:55,140
particular mutation BS assignment or in
st. Mel

512
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:58,750
you can simply exploited so for example
on guitar

513
00:30:58,750 --> 00:31:03,030
did this not agree to this is a utility
that that is created by my USD 15

514
00:31:03,030 --> 00:31:08,030
it's a big don't so if you see inc.'s on
condition are getting good

515
00:31:08,030 --> 00:31:13,300
no need to use double quotes just inside
the Belcourt use back because on data

516
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:17,530
elect one it will work in order to your
browser if there is any in st. Louis

517
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:21,750
assignment with the help of this trick I
excess get up

518
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:26,220
and this is the reply of get up the
valley did my finding but unfortunately

519
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:29,560
the a I was not aborted anyone be

520
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:33,490
because this had that we are not
supporting I he said when I eat

521
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:38,760
it means that day baeza excesses there
but they are not supporting this broza

522
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:42,960
to lead him into the pacific a reader to
look in the number of heights they are

523
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:43,450
using

524
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:46,910
so a fair usually if to suggest to
capture this ki chudai

525
00:31:46,910 --> 00:31:50,720
so there is a huge number aside are you
using this was a good leader

526
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:54,940
so this is the error I reported this
back to be a success in this site and

527
00:31:54,940 --> 00:31:55,780
has a reply

528
00:31:55,780 --> 00:32:00,190
I X is this tiny MCA find the bug has
been fixed

529
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:03,850
so now let's attack lil

530
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:08,420
encircling Fisher visit again he does

531
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:11,700

interface when you get under UN

534
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:24,080
here URL are explain display or by Dell
and then you can select

535
00:32:24,080 --> 00:32:29,159
to target is the same window what up for
a new window this is a bit of

536
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:32,360
please follow this golf you can access

537
00:32:32,360 --> 00:32:35,380
any reason we can eat at a saudi BBBB

538
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:38,799
taxes are treatable but the slides are
online everything you can check it

539
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:42,330
but I I tell you in the first step it up

540
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:45,380
bullying Joe West Kirby issue I dow
escape

541
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:48,750
call it a leg when and the day I have
been here on

542
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:53,340
obfuscated JavaScript you I and use a
crossbow was able to view it

543
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:58,429
but in the second step C I obfuscated
the word JavaScript wind

544
00:32:58,429 --> 00:33:03,320
this morning lower cases because if
Daves are using some regular expression

545
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:06,659
and if I go to heaven have an I use flag

546
00:33:06,659 --> 00:33:11,380
foreign law and upper keys that book
scare so it means that you can then big

547
00:33:11,380 --> 00:33:12,179
difference that

548
00:33:12,179 --> 00:33:16,130
using this and at the same time instead
of using a small bed and kisses

549
00:33:16,130 --> 00:33:20,600
I and Gordon the parent is wind in
UN-guarded fall

550
00:33:20,600 --> 00:33:23,919
in the tightest epics available to staff
basically the time to step

551
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:28,460
are used extremist 5 encoding inside the
word JavaScript find somebody does a

552
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:28,850
good

553
00:33:28,850 --> 00:33:32,460
they have a production is JavaScript and
they are looking at this morning kisses

554
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,279
lower cases

555
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:36,350
but they often forgotten that one can
use a

556
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:41,480
Ange dab and new line basically be
rescued five including inside the word

557
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:43,919
JavaScript and this works

558
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:49,090
what more can you can notice if best
step in where can I am using html5

559
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:49,820
including

560
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,880
it means hexane Gordon

561
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:56,460
and decimal including bill out so what
because they also starred with

562
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:59,909
and percent sign so just for the best
case I have here an

563
00:33:59,909 --> 00:34:04,049
testify when gordy as a bottle for two
separate so that I miss you and I and

564
00:34:04,049 --> 00:34:05,029
the light last one

565
00:34:05,029 --> 00:34:08,240
is VBScript that is specific to IU
browser

566
00:34:08,240 --> 00:34:12,450
but now stocks counting the Pacific and
eat it next start coding it

567
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:17,109
is a free text books I exercise this
wasn't being any different type of

568
00:34:17,109 --> 00:34:18,450
dollars compusa

569
00:34:18,450 --> 00:34:21,550
and who is using three decks walks

570
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:25,300
iPhone Department of Defense USA

571
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:28,909
HP Microsoft so they are using

572
00:34:28,909 --> 00:34:33,999
so this free text books Kennedy don't
use

573
00:34:33,999 --> 00:34:37,109
again with the help of UN see dollars
compusa

574
00:34:37,109 --> 00:34:41,309
is very popular in Chinese ancient China
Sea nations

575
00:34:41,309 --> 00:34:44,539
cities so there is a huge list of sites
available on this URL

576
00:34:44,539 --> 00:34:48,619
PSPs has Gmail added

577
00:34:48,619 --> 00:34:52,009
one more thing I have noticed these Bros
the specific and he does not

578
00:34:52,009 --> 00:34:55,139
languages specific someone in GQ you
some money

579
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:59,130
ASP someone in PHP so with the help of
same methodology you can access if any

580
00:34:59,130 --> 00:34:59,980
was a good leader

581
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:04,210
to look at the featured why I'm to hold
microsoft office in the form of is if

582
00:35:04,210 --> 00:35:04,730

589
00:35:26,359 --> 00:35:30,890
you access to debate you make 10,000
customers wondering but

unless they will objective is a good
leader again dollars keep you and I just

591
00:35:35,489 --> 00:35:36,529

00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:49,490
bebe leadership the execute you ready
seriously they have a dedicated team

612
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:54,190
the added up the other guys who had
started already implementing CSP

613
00:36:54,190 --> 00:36:57,900
so next exorcist there was a big 82

614
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,380
if you remember from the early flight

615
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:04,710
if you want to have a link on Twitter
form

616
00:37:04,710 --> 00:37:09,190
it should be like that the name of the
link will be in

617
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:12,420
Schenecker in this more apparent this is

618
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:17,049
there will be a URL okay so

619
00:37:17,049 --> 00:37:21,490
it me if you will write Tudor in smart
bet this is true to your top

620
00:37:21,490 --> 00:37:24,849
it will be internally can work to do to
anchor tag with a href

621
00:37:24,849 --> 00:37:27,890
that reward this value and this student
both

622
00:37:27,890 --> 00:37:31,299
here make sense okay now

623
00:37:31,299 --> 00:37:34,390
remember the methodology stocks applying
it

624
00:37:34,390 --> 00:37:40,250
the first step the first step was simply
JavaScript allowed one

625
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:43,859
but it does not work can someone
identify why

626
00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:47,150
because their system

627
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:51,849
suppose if there is a closing parent is
is ok it done

628
00:37:51,849 --> 00:37:54,930
URL finished hit you see this

629
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:59,609
elect one disclosing parent this is so
in order to execute a function

630
00:37:59,609 --> 00:38:02,980
I need a closing balances but they're
system as you know K

631
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:06,910
know you are going so internally it has
been going to look into this

632
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:11,329
here you see the pattern pieces missing
it means the first step 3:

633
00:38:11,329 --> 00:38:16,609
it is not necessary that you can use the
step-by-step to

634
00:38:16,609 --> 00:38:19,779
these more number on the steps you can't
use any order

635
00:38:19,779 --> 00:38:23,849
okay next Lex convert this

636
00:38:23,849 --> 00:38:26,660
bed and this is an action plan html5
including

637
00:38:26,660 --> 00:38:30,849
bed and el boton and iPod means

638
00:38:30,849 --> 00:38:34,019
right Prentice's but see

639
00:38:34,019 --> 00:38:37,640
miss and has been converted into what
amber Sen

640
00:38:37,640 --> 00:38:40,710
it means that there is encoding the at
might

641
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:45,089
another step for you okay no problem the
third step

642
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:48,819
I encoded

643
00:38:48,819 --> 00:38:52,619
this bed and his into a URL encoded fall

644
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:57,160
and apes seems there is nothing wrong
here

645
00:38:57,160 --> 00:39:00,559
so payable we have a Nexus S

646
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:05,279
in greater translation for him and it
took me 10 minutes

647
00:39:05,279 --> 00:39:09,779
when I started looking at it do took me
10 minutes to see what they're doing and

648
00:39:09,779 --> 00:39:11,059
then I started applying it

649
00:39:11,059 --> 00:39:15,470
so now it has been fixed this issue has
been fixed after fix

650
00:39:15,470 --> 00:39:21,359
NBN will then need did this guy is from
british security team he replied 208

651
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:26,329
damn third-party libraries it means that
they are using some sort of third-party

652
00:39:26,329 --> 00:39:26,980
library

653
00:39:26,980 --> 00:39:30,789
in as a visiting a leader then a
question right wall

654
00:39:30,789 --> 00:39:34,420
mister body Larry it was mondale okay

655
00:39:34,420 --> 00:39:37,630
I go to my don't IIIx is mugged on also

656
00:39:37,630 --> 00:39:43,369
with the same URL sorry send you an
attempt has been made to make

657
00:39:43,369 --> 00:39:46,559
martone standard so there is a short
story but

658
00:39:46,559 --> 00:39:52,690
but the some a some defense has been
daughter of this model he said okay

659
00:39:52,690 --> 00:39:56,150
it should not be marked down should be
something else so then they going to

660
00:39:56,150 --> 00:39:59,839
Coleman Mach don't know yet WTC is
trying to make it didn't up

661
00:39:59,839 --> 00:40:03,069
standard amado no visibility to standard

662
00:40:03,069 --> 00:40:06,839
so you can be this way top and that this
is my favorite

663
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:11,410
how to a textile because everybody does
allow you to set in style also

664
00:40:11,410 --> 00:40:15,349
for example this now this is the

665
00:40:15,349 --> 00:40:20,049
this is a screenshot from seeking and he
did verdi members have consumed 88,000

666
00:40:20,049 --> 00:40:21,109
cup of coffee's

667
00:40:21,109 --> 00:40:24,509
so and if you want to make a link

668
00:40:24,509 --> 00:40:27,759
then in the end boss tab the allow you

669
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:30,849
you gonna style also you BI

670
00:40:30,849 --> 00:40:34,150
asking you talking you gonna style it up
link

671
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:37,790
okay we decided

672
00:40:37,790 --> 00:40:41,170
soap does follow these golf

673
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:44,740
that you decided not to charge for the
sake of charts

674
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:48,190
with Apple's the Sharks I real I'm going
to show you in five minutes and

675
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:52,960
unbreakable solution and how many
attempts I will assure you

676
00:40:52,960 --> 00:40:58,160
so this is the fourth step process the
first one is simple with expression

677
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:58,820
allowed one

678
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:02,500
the second step VI use the might be
linked to mention side the word

679
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:04,570
expression pretty feed expression for
dinner

680
00:41:04,570 --> 00:41:07,930
in the police dept just for the
proof-of-concept

681
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:12,780
I have shown a net hex encoding decimal
including will also work

682
00:41:12,780 --> 00:41:16,070
but estimates i've including will not
work because this you

683
00:41:16,070 --> 00:41:19,210
only supporting all rouser estimate five

684
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:22,700
accordingly working models and the last
witness

685
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:26,430
escaping CS escaping so it's a four step
process

686
00:41:26,430 --> 00:41:31,550
an East deck much complete after playing
this for step you can see you can't you

687
00:41:31,550 --> 00:41:32,890
can't simply say

688
00:41:32,890 --> 00:41:36,570
okay guy there is a nexus on there is no
excess

689
00:41:36,570 --> 00:41:40,930
the problem is how do I was discussing
with everything good with my colleague

690
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:41,300
here

691
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:45,620
the problem with the developers order
with the vendor string beans that

692
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:49,140
when to stop when to stop testing

693
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:54,100
will days an injection point how we can
be how we can given guarantee

694
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:58,070
okay this injection punishes secure
follow the Sharks

695
00:41:58,070 --> 00:42:02,940
it really it will help you in designing
and pick up a solution

696
00:42:02,940 --> 00:42:07,190
so a the question arises this diet

697
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:11,560
best ls command section watch in your
browser but he said you saw this Tweet a

698
00:42:11,560 --> 00:42:12,970
very interesting point by this guy

699
00:42:12,970 --> 00:42:17,000
I year traffic on BBC News very low and
then work day

700
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:21,830
lunchtime many because many popular I
don't need me that people are still

701
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:22,810
using ie8

702
00:42:22,810 --> 00:42:26,650
old roses and a salir so using this
attack methodology

703
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:30,220
I exorcist EB this is the Nexus S live
mixes

704
00:42:30,220 --> 00:42:35,470
on email so that's why I hide the URL so
so that you can receive it is but

705
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:39,090
they are using some Sekt did was
illegally days then and I

706
00:42:39,090 --> 00:42:42,410
access is this was a good leader with
the help of a style

707
00:42:42,410 --> 00:42:45,610
methodology you ordered from ebay a goat

708
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:49,060
recently

709
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:50,410
so my publishing has been blocked

710
00:42:50,410 --> 00:42:53,740
they don't allow me to publish okay

711
00:42:53,740 --> 00:42:58,410
with Apple same methodology AX is a
spine EMC this bug has been fixed also

712
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:01,990
another injection point I just

713
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:05,480
weekly move because I want to focus for
the line the last fifteen years i've

714
00:43:05,480 --> 00:43:06,090
focus

715
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:09,290
on the solution who end up being black
adjustable breaking

716
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:12,360
everyone is making everything so I want
to

717
00:43:12,360 --> 00:43:15,760
show you something that is unbreakable
so attacking

718
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,810
insert added uploads visiting canada
also allow you to upload file

719
00:43:20,810 --> 00:43:25,020
will give I so the Fed Ex order

720
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:28,900
usually defense looks like that you they
will say you okay okay guys grab a fine

721
00:43:28,900 --> 00:43:29,320
air

722
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:32,580
or death name of I'll end of it. it
quite uploaded

723
00:43:32,580 --> 00:43:35,890
okay we'll elect so in that case

724
00:43:35,890 --> 00:43:39,400
in this city doctor visit again you
don't I simply me in the finals annexes

725
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:40,040
a selector

726
00:43:40,040 --> 00:43:43,590
gone the excesses who is using it out
there

727
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:47,650
you can find a whole list on this URL
yeah

728
00:43:47,650 --> 00:43:51,610
be a lonely to operate a fine but the
former project dubbed many did you find

729
00:43:51,610 --> 00:43:52,370
this fight I

730
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:55,910
flash is always there so I uploaded
flash file

731
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:59,760
in inside a flash file is the Nexus S
rector

732
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,530
so hairy it in got executed in the site

733
00:44:03,530 --> 00:44:07,930
I show you an example how many popular
you did that has forty thousand dollars

734
00:44:07,930 --> 00:44:08,570
for a lot

735
00:44:08,570 --> 00:44:12,280
it has been accessed without the flash
file here you see

736
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:15,630
the flash fight got executed in that
context

737
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:19,900
of the site and you do not follow up and
hey you see this is

738
00:44:19,900 --> 00:44:23,240
bought SWF file I important issue

739
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:27,590
and now the fixes like that if you up
with a flash file

740
00:44:27,590 --> 00:44:31,830
browser will ask you guys you want to
download this home for file or not

741
00:44:31,830 --> 00:44:36,720
to defect this should basically lost and
the last year the other side by people

742
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:40,310
escort extort gone they have a visit to
get he did I excess this would have a

743
00:44:40,310 --> 00:44:41,060
flash file

744
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:44,650
and I was awarded one thousand dollar
for this bug but now the site is

745
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:45,420
decommissioned

746
00:44:45,420 --> 00:44:49,210
extort com is no more so another

747
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:52,380
feature visibility to provide you in
that video

748
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:55,540
ok if I A by why so many reject embodied
by

749
00:44:55,540 --> 00:44:59,050
there are visiting anytime used to be
just discussed

750
00:44:59,050 --> 00:45:02,100
or some options I would show you later
so

751
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:05,320
this is the user interface will visit
again you don't if they allow you to use

752
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:06,360
it and I did you

753
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:10,260
I did you can embed are you evita made
you court

754
00:45:10,260 --> 00:45:14,440
I did you can your YouTube URL this the
YouTube gourd

755
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:18,930
if you go to you any YouTube video and
go to share you can borrow this

756
00:45:18,930 --> 00:45:22,340
gore you do blue lights for every video
big goal

757
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:25,720
simply a ban on motorway in the same
boat

758
00:45:25,720 --> 00:45:28,740
alleged court that YouTube right just

759
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:32,600
at on most orders in object in a bag tag

760
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:36,520
mean that with this technique I excesses
adapted visiting Katie Did

761
00:45:36,520 --> 00:45:40,750
recently just because I i a

762
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:43,790
I'm I want to have us many good example
for this stock

763
00:45:43,790 --> 00:45:47,200
so last week I was on Microsoft I don't
know why

764
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:51,000
but I X is it so

765
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:54,570
I XSS basically there isn't a good
leader

766
00:45:54,570 --> 00:45:57,590
that they are using this is the visiting
Kenny did they have

767
00:45:57,590 --> 00:46:01,160
the of me to upload a file okay you guys
allow me to predict

768
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:04,560
I applauding a flash file of

769
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:08,030
8 has been exorcist and of

770
00:46:08,030 --> 00:46:11,620
the fix is ready investing this is the
fix at the moment

771
00:46:11,620 --> 00:46:15,910
many sources not available

772
00:46:15,910 --> 00:46:20,200
right now they are working on fixing
that you cannot uses it to get it done

773
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:21,980
especially that one should I D anymore

774
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:26,410
still they are working on pics the
questions

775
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:31,170
why almost on visiting Katie does I
would marry but but like to first unread

776
00:46:31,170 --> 00:46:32,030
post comments

777
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:36,440
I was going to miss him to bring these
books will be available and get out the

778
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:37,550
UN buffet hey

779
00:46:37,550 --> 00:46:41,660
all we are supposed to this
functionality this submission should be

780
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:42,900
handled on the server side

781
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:48,090
okay another dev said when you're going
to save disk contents

782
00:46:48,090 --> 00:46:51,340
it's not our responsibility we are that
as we are provide your

783
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:54,650
visiting a leader security is not our
problem okay

784
00:46:54,650 --> 00:46:58,480
so I got so many commence of same time

785
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:03,930
it's not our fight okay been who's fault

786
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:07,400
reason this is the reason so many
visibility daughter but many but

787
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:10,430
crossword of responsibility plus
laziness

788
00:47:10,430 --> 00:47:14,349
because develop a love is everybody to
think that the developer of the

789
00:47:14,349 --> 00:47:15,099
Summerside

790
00:47:15,099 --> 00:47:19,529
mistakes as you and the developers are
set aside to let me tell you let you

791
00:47:19,529 --> 00:47:19,869
guys

792
00:47:19,869 --> 00:47:22,869
that can be bought over there getting
use it

793
00:47:22,869 --> 00:47:26,220
gone nor sanitation is there

794
00:47:26,220 --> 00:47:29,559
so iPod these are the two main reasons

795
00:47:29,559 --> 00:47:33,670
okay and a freaking selects prison
unbreakable further

796
00:47:33,670 --> 00:47:37,109
what unbreakable I E I hope the Internet
to

797
00:47:37,109 --> 00:47:41,220
is working here Yap some

798
00:47:41,220 --> 00:47:44,309
aiight last few months ago and also
challenge on puter

799
00:47:44,309 --> 00:47:48,369
it's a one thousand dollar challenge if
someone is gonna big this week I will

800
00:47:48,369 --> 00:47:50,010
give you a one thousand US dollar

801
00:47:50,010 --> 00:47:53,690
and the output of this week a reflection
different context

802
00:47:53,690 --> 00:47:57,799
and noon this is interesting

803
00:47:57,799 --> 00:48:03,690
these are logs these analogues of reader

804
00:48:03,690 --> 00:48:06,579
when people are trying to attack my
freezer they don't know that I am

805
00:48:06,579 --> 00:48:07,549
recording everything

806
00:48:07,549 --> 00:48:09,099
I

807
00:48:09,099 --> 00:48:13,469
I am regarding the IP they're dying day
8 everything I've been to go under

808
00:48:13,469 --> 00:48:16,900
so if I may ask you to give me a secret

809
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:20,689
vector human not giving but if I will
allow the challenger Mitt reuter

810
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:21,469
navigated

811
00:48:21,469 --> 00:48:26,140
the same thing happen so this is the
biggest collection of X's vector

812
00:48:26,140 --> 00:48:29,719
let's see how many BR tonight no I'll

813
00:48:29,719 --> 00:48:33,119
let's search for catch this look at the
counter

814
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:36,169
think

815
00:48:36,169 --> 00:48:43,169
up

816
00:49:08,439 --> 00:49:08,799
yeah

817
00:49:08,799 --> 00:49:13,890
it news analysis yeah it's still so
right now the Companies Act

818
00:49:13,890 --> 00:49:18,789
82,000 so on my challenge 82,000 attack
attempts are being made

819
00:49:18,789 --> 00:49:22,419
and north and was able to bypass my free
to so

820
00:49:22,419 --> 00:49:25,369
I he's the biggest collection not you
are absolutely right how many are

821
00:49:25,369 --> 00:49:25,969
duplicates

822
00:49:25,969 --> 00:49:30,819
because I can see in the logs people are
using automated call the scanners

823
00:49:30,819 --> 00:49:34,689
blindly bring everything scanners are
basically

824
00:49:34,689 --> 00:49:38,650
going out building scanners don't like
in my experience

825
00:49:38,650 --> 00:49:42,809
so next

826
00:49:42,809 --> 00:49:47,439
we discuss the this is available on this
URL if you will surely break it I carry

827
00:49:47,439 --> 00:49:48,609
I can give you an award

828
00:49:48,609 --> 00:49:51,699
just destroyed so that I we also get
your secret

829
00:49:51,699 --> 00:49:55,439
so the solutions

830
00:49:55,439 --> 00:49:59,669
before presenting a solution and we
still we have some time left:

831
00:49:59,669 --> 00:50:03,429
the solutions all are simple after you
have what I break them

832
00:50:03,429 --> 00:50:06,929
this is a very good thing but the
problem of do you have what I read them

833
00:50:06,929 --> 00:50:10,599
and before after you have to do a lot of
work so

834
00:50:10,599 --> 00:50:15,449
how do give a protection against LSQ
execution why acting rude I had shown

835
00:50:15,449 --> 00:50:15,819
you

836
00:50:15,819 --> 00:50:20,339
a choc the first shot made this a
three-step process remember this shock

837
00:50:20,339 --> 00:50:23,789
this is Trista process the how the
production sugar look like

838
00:50:23,789 --> 00:50:26,799
which would be literally right sugar
look like medicine but

839
00:50:26,799 --> 00:50:30,529
if I may ask you just by looking at this
golf

840
00:50:30,529 --> 00:50:34,409
what you will do how you will design a
frequent

841
00:50:34,409 --> 00:50:38,390
what any any when would like to suggest
anything

842
00:50:38,390 --> 00:50:42,959
yeah

843
00:50:42,959 --> 00:50:46,019
okay let's see the the solution

844
00:50:46,019 --> 00:50:50,039
in PHP but you can what do you do a job
escape or anything anything which

845
00:50:50,039 --> 00:50:53,979
top if you look closely look at this
golf

846
00:50:53,979 --> 00:50:57,100
the attack vector show

847
00:50:57,100 --> 00:51:02,640
should stocks I this stock the double
course identity stocks with Signal Corps

848
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:06,090
I did his socks with back so what I am
doing here

849
00:51:06,090 --> 00:51:10,430
so for me there are only TV bad
characters

850
00:51:10,430 --> 00:51:13,850
if ivory control only these three
characters

851
00:51:13,850 --> 00:51:17,270
no one can bring that people can text

852
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:20,310
I experienced this in my challenge

853
00:51:20,310 --> 00:51:25,060
my challenge I am only can bring these
characters no one was able to access it

854
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:28,400
so here I have conducted these

855
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:32,400
three connectors into that encoded form
which is harmless to the browser

856
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:36,220
where you can read it here anywhere you
can write anything yet you can write

857
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:42,230
removed you can write pay we catch
erector you can make anything here

858
00:51:42,230 --> 00:51:45,350
but just just keep in mind just gunboat

859
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:50,360
fee correct does but not for the whole
site only for this particular injection

860
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:50,800
bite

861
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:56,900
which is court at remote injection point
what effect that they will use including

862
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:01,010
this is obvious question that you guys
are thinking okay let's see a demo

863
00:52:01,010 --> 00:52:04,210
see

864
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:07,550
business in a euphoric you can text
these a div class

865
00:52:07,550 --> 00:52:11,720
injection by here and here it's a play
hardcore double course

866
00:52:11,720 --> 00:52:15,650
you see it's a decimal in going to do
because I pride in going to break

867
00:52:15,650 --> 00:52:19,230
the context I tried hex encoding I tried

868
00:52:19,230 --> 00:52:22,490
UN going so different I'm so I'm going
out there so

869
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:26,700
how many of you think how many unless we
will get so here you see

870
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:30,400
no wonder because and Gordon will not
help you the only

871
00:52:30,400 --> 00:52:34,210
lead when we get then you will use a
hard-coded W course

872
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:37,410
here you see not on this is the only a
lead we will get

873
00:52:37,410 --> 00:52:41,040
either way there will be no wonder it
because and Gordon will not help

874
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,770
attacker to break the context I left
unless

875
00:52:43,770 --> 00:52:47,700
Devils are doing experts should be
putting on the server side

876
00:52:47,700 --> 00:52:51,130
border dude explicit be going their
decade cannot

877
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:55,100
excess you at least in this case so

878
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:58,610
let's move on this is the protection
against a style

879
00:52:58,610 --> 00:53:01,680
to remember this for the four-step
process so

880
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:05,970
host simple the production is I just
can't all six characters

881
00:53:05,970 --> 00:53:10,220
W course single course a small bed and
kisses

882
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:14,060
we need early in order to execute a
function up

883
00:53:14,060 --> 00:53:19,660
backslash be in PHP is very good we need
for backslashes in order to control one

884
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:20,300
backslash

885
00:53:20,300 --> 00:53:23,960
so left then and and

886
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:27,660
can someone identify why I am
controlling this

887
00:53:27,660 --> 00:53:31,640
angler bracket can someone

888
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:35,200
identify why the yeah

889
00:53:35,200 --> 00:53:39,790
he is sick if you mean look at the golf
here the example is strongest I actually

890
00:53:39,790 --> 00:53:42,570
looked but maybe dams are using is tight
bag

891
00:53:42,570 --> 00:53:46,099
then attack again break best I had a but

892
00:53:46,099 --> 00:53:50,940
in order to write as tight and he has to
use this angle bracket simply

893
00:53:50,940 --> 00:53:53,980
encoding will not work unless you as we
do expect to be going

894
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:57,660
so these are the some questions that you
might think after looking at this

895
00:53:57,660 --> 00:53:59,420
protection so they are available here

896
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:04,109
so another beauty of this solution

897
00:54:04,109 --> 00:54:07,460
because I am only controlling six
characters

898
00:54:07,460 --> 00:54:11,359
now seen that one page excess gone

899
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:15,050
but at the same time imagine we are
sitting in a busy weekend he did we want

900
00:54:15,050 --> 00:54:16,800
to use it with style something also

901
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:20,140
somehow letter styles seep in my example

902
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:23,800
these all styles I allowed because

903
00:54:23,800 --> 00:54:27,570
in in auto mode CSS styling double cord
is not be at

904
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:32,460
a small bed and kisses in our dear I am
only controlling the harmful and could

905
00:54:32,460 --> 00:54:32,880
be's

906
00:54:32,880 --> 00:54:36,320
so it means that you can use this
protection

907
00:54:36,320 --> 00:54:39,780
if you want to do it by visiting canada
and you can also use allow user

908
00:54:39,780 --> 00:54:44,369
this time this is supposed to do this
weekend he does best functionality

909
00:54:44,369 --> 00:54:47,910
in order to protect JavaScript execution

910
00:54:47,910 --> 00:54:53,369
I had a simple regular expression next
force you to enter a URL that

911
00:54:53,369 --> 00:54:57,920
only starts with an HTTP risky PS in
that way you cannot execute JavaScript

912
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:02,500
so another des moines want to show you
this is

913
00:55:02,500 --> 00:55:07,000
another free day I develops and two
years ago

914
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:12,010
and that freed a sport of March security
find one yes dear called sect

915
00:55:12,010 --> 00:55:16,520
so this movie is based on a great
expression any only allows you to

916
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:19,859
inputs in by tax for example

917
00:55:19,859 --> 00:55:24,180
here I had a text file

918
00:55:24,180 --> 00:55:27,560
so Chris East simple

919
00:55:27,560 --> 00:55:31,400
harmless Tax Board are very least
unordered list

920
00:55:31,400 --> 00:55:34,930
this is supposed to be a Pacific eighty
different reality you can only bode

921
00:55:34,930 --> 00:55:35,490
italic

922
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:39,570
and if you will summitted so they are
here they are oil

923
00:55:39,570 --> 00:55:43,570
allowed but as soon as you tried for
example

924
00:55:43,570 --> 00:55:47,920
on mouseover you want

925
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:52,240
to be a smart guy so

926
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:55,750
you a message free to ask Ashley rector
try hard

927
00:55:55,750 --> 00:55:58,930
so it will not allow any JavaScript
execution

928
00:55:58,930 --> 00:56:02,610
and since last three years part of more
security and so far we have no

929
00:56:02,610 --> 00:56:04,150
complaints people are using it

930
00:56:04,150 --> 00:56:07,990
any according to my information more
security and more than million it's

931
00:56:07,990 --> 00:56:08,520
delicious

932
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:14,240
they're using my free to so

933
00:56:14,240 --> 00:56:17,420
some general guidelines I'm

934
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:20,550
just conclude if you're a developer

935
00:56:20,550 --> 00:56:24,840
and if you want to include her body was
educated please use SDP only cookies

936
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:28,360
so the JavaScript cannot access the
cookie in case of a Nexus S

937
00:56:28,360 --> 00:56:33,190
use ICM sandbox sandbox does not allowed
to ask you but you can

938
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:37,090
you can have some sort of flexibility so
you can confine you can

939
00:56:37,090 --> 00:56:39,990
some limit the privileges of the tech
back to contend with the help of ice

940
00:56:39,990 --> 00:56:41,290
cream sandbox use it

941
00:56:41,290 --> 00:56:45,840
he was good and security policy %uh very
good solution by Mozilla

942
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:50,190
but keep in mind on me who did without
on 15 line 179

943
00:56:50,190 --> 00:56:54,950
UAL otherwise between not help you I we
conclude

944
00:56:54,950 --> 00:56:58,450
this mislead this the slipping away

945
00:56:58,450 --> 00:57:02,710
normal people should not need to know on
can about mark-up

946
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:06,000
more just want to make the words bald
italic

947
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,440
or at some bullets an image that's
enough this

948
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:12,810
if you want to make a Pacific and you
don't just follow this tweet

949
00:57:12,810 --> 00:57:16,650
because normal people don't know the
crazy stuff that you are providing

950
00:57:16,650 --> 00:57:21,500
when it makes this ice one day but
Facebook is ready smart

951
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:24,800
there was nobody there is just bored
italic

952
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:28,560
and the line number list book called
perfect

953
00:57:28,560 --> 00:57:34,109
this is I don't use the supposed to you

954
00:57:34,109 --> 00:57:37,079
and the final mom goes great for techies

955
00:57:37,079 --> 00:57:41,619
but what difference it often aspects
those six don't have to spend two years

956
00:57:41,619 --> 00:57:43,910
creating a visit to get the dough that
actually works

957
00:57:43,910 --> 00:57:47,780
so missing any dulles

958
00:57:47,780 --> 00:57:51,170
basically flawed so so many for issues
are there

959
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:55,109
I only focus on exorcist still there are
some injection bike that I i

960
00:57:55,109 --> 00:57:58,780
in-focus for example drag-and-drop or
buchanan's

961
00:57:58,780 --> 00:58:03,520
lot of features idea but the basics that
a common

962
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:06,660
injection Bice I explored here and

963
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:13,660
except for my son %ah

964
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:24,240
any percent yes yes

965
00:58:35,459 --> 00:58:38,380
yes it yeah it's a very good person

966
00:58:38,380 --> 00:58:41,969
basically the guys asking that what
about chrome

967
00:58:41,969 --> 00:58:46,109
baby excess production group has in
excess is already done I he also has an

968
00:58:46,109 --> 00:58:47,349
excess is free to the groove

969
00:58:47,349 --> 00:58:51,029
help your against reflected XSS but

970
00:58:51,029 --> 00:58:55,650
if you look closely see very busy
weekend he does already in use

971
00:58:55,650 --> 00:58:59,390
dead whose in forum posting they're
using messaging

972
00:58:59,390 --> 00:59:03,619
it to me is that access invisible
anybody is more dangerous

973
00:59:03,619 --> 00:59:07,739
because is store Nexus S East implicit

974
00:59:07,739 --> 00:59:11,839
that is going to be viewed by the other
users it's not somewhat

975
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:16,150
in guess I've reflected XSS if I am an
attacker and you are a victim

976
00:59:16,150 --> 00:59:20,019
I had to pick you I there to visit my
page or click something

977
00:59:20,019 --> 00:59:23,150
in fact yes xn store texas has

978
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:28,259
excesses in misery can be done
nine-day-old a hundred times this one

979
00:59:28,259 --> 00:59:28,859
texas

980
00:59:28,859 --> 00:59:33,589
and which is very dangerous because you
weren't supposed to see the form

981
00:59:33,589 --> 00:59:36,679
you're simply look in the form boasting

982
00:59:36,679 --> 00:59:40,169
but you don't know eta has injected LSQ

983
00:59:40,169 --> 00:59:44,150
so he can do whatever you want to do
effect last year

984
00:59:44,150 --> 00:59:49,439
who form has been hacked with the help
of XSS one was Apple developer and one

985
00:59:49,439 --> 00:59:49,880
was

986
00:59:49,880 --> 00:59:53,459
I you bundle ya to form shorthand

987
00:59:53,459 --> 00:59:58,209
the same technique has been used excess
was found by a decade in their forms

988
00:59:58,209 --> 01:00:01,349
then he steal the session cookie of the
administrator

989
01:00:01,349 --> 01:00:05,069
and then he lobbied on behalf of
administrator changed everything

990
01:00:05,069 --> 01:00:09,089
Soest no hint that

991
01:00:09,089 --> 01:00:14,169
this week any dissents a in browser for
doesn't normally board

992
01:00:14,169 --> 01:00:20,680
PA tande you heard it soul

993
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:23,500
and you're the so everything's on link
slight hamstring

994
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:28,210
and

995
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:31,320
mean peace in

996
01:00:31,320 --> 01:00:35,450
purely not to blacklist because in guess
a few other feeder

997
01:00:35,450 --> 01:00:39,880
is a whitelist I am forcing you

998
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:43,090
to enter a URL that is stocks with a
sturdy be

999
01:00:43,090 --> 01:00:46,950
STBs on FTP sup Mike list he

1000
01:00:46,950 --> 01:00:51,880
for be up for this for the siding yeah
it's a blacklist would blackness best

1001
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:56,920
only on six characters and if it's a
challenge also open challenge alan is

1002
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:57,510
there

1003
01:00:57,510 --> 01:01:03,650
so my

1004
01:01:03,650 --> 01:01:08,200
but but but but yes yes yes yes

1005
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:13,110
but back take also think

1006
01:01:13,110 --> 01:01:16,120
that espy any context attack methodology
works in

1007
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:19,730
or your browser's back does not bugging
or your browser

1008
01:01:19,730 --> 01:01:23,160
which both in modern Firefox right now
so

1009
01:01:23,160 --> 01:01:27,030
so also you have to think like that so
so far it's

1010
01:01:27,030 --> 01:01:30,730
unbreakable any with my XPS of

1011
01:01:30,730 --> 01:01:35,630
having finding X is in thousands of
upside I don't mind me

1012
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:38,640
that's why and also challenged maybe
someone North Ave

1013
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:45,640
but so fun or and I should show you the
log up

1014
01:01:56,670 --> 01:02:01,019
yeah buddy but didn't but didn't in then
be mines lot of user interaction

1015
01:02:01,019 --> 01:02:04,719
with that you don't need any user
interaction but

1016
01:02:04,719 --> 01:02:09,890
yeah I do that I'm using in my other
research user do whatever you want to do

1017
01:02:09,890 --> 01:02:15,640
so so he said it's a different ballgame
if you use every click everything in

1018
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,630
truth I don't think you can even click
on it

1019
01:02:17,630 --> 01:02:22,249
top soul

1020
01:02:22,249 --> 01:02:23,469
thank you very much thanks guys
