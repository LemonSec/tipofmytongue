1
00:00:00,269 --> 00:00:03,699
all right we're gonna get started here
so welcome to

2
00:00:03,699 --> 00:00:09,320
a talk about fake net a

3
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,250
so I guess we could start by introducing
ourselves a a man's make sikorsky

4
00:00:13,250 --> 00:00:19,220
I I've the worked for a company called
many in for about seven years

5
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:23,100
recently %uh pot acquired by company
called fire I there I found it a team

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:23,930
called the

7
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:26,930
the flare just fire labs have answer
saying

8
00:00:26,930 --> 00:00:30,980
team we just recently put on a challenge
they may do that at the flare tripped

9
00:00:30,980 --> 00:00:31,960
plan challenge

10
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:35,590
couple people now no way to the plan
challenge

11
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:39,430
I was like a sort of like a binary
puzzles

12
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:43,460
on you can still access them on flair
dash on da comp and

13
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,129
Susa series opposing download and play
around with I N

14
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:50,910
and a also a wrote a book

15
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,010
called practical are now says with my co
author here

16
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:58,449
and yawning imparted that writing a book
we we realize there was kinda the gap

17
00:00:58,449 --> 00:01:02,579
offer tools and that's kind of why we
created the tool

18
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:06,020
a a fake that on Andy

19
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:10,210
on introduced up G the

20
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:13,810
the books in English as well I'm not
sure I put afar lingers on their

21
00:01:13,810 --> 00:01:17,780
I'm but many owning I work for Google
our conversation security

22
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:22,470
I but for that it was an essay for years
now learn represent yourself

23
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:28,420
one and I'm based in New York City and
he's based in Seattle

24
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:33,189
missus I think think the first time
we've presented together so

25
00:01:33,189 --> 00:01:36,390
so outline for talk whats

26
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:39,640
where we can actually cover today I'm
were actually spaced a

27
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:44,149
with an hour before lunch and an hour
after lunch we're going to separate into

28
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:46,329
two halves the first half is going to be
like

29
00:01:46,329 --> 00:01:50,390
lecturing and demo ing and the second
half is going to be actually the hands

30
00:01:50,390 --> 00:01:53,180
on where you can actually use state that
dual add

31
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:56,530
and although real at the end that our so
two halves

32
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:00,909
first half is not hands-on second half
his hands on so after launch gonna get

33
00:02:00,909 --> 00:02:01,600
hands-on

34
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,200
that's when you gonna he's what we're
passing out we have six USB keys

35
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:10,459
going around the room being copied when
I can actually use the stuff on those

36
00:02:10,459 --> 00:02:13,490
keys until we come back from lunch was
like two o'clock saying a lot

37
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:17,990
time to copy those keys I nikki has a
for

38
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:22,310
a VM on it units VMware so you're gonna
need to install the and where if you

39
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:22,990
don't have it

40
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:26,930
you download a free trial VMware
Workstation from their website

41
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:31,240
as a 30-day trial but it'll easily get
you through the class today

42
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:36,050
on so anyway what we're in a cover is

43
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:39,110
they cover everything onto sec yeah and
if you have the

44
00:02:39,110 --> 00:02:42,820
if you finish copying the USB key put up
in the air

45
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:45,820
somebody else who wants to copy it will
come grab it from you

46
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,090
and that'll be the protocol rather than
keep running up here Lee

47
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:52,410
keep getting interrupted with it so to
keep the circulating

48
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,740
keep copying and then I everybody will
have it so that way when we come back

49
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,670
after lunch

50
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:02,620
you know it be able to get hands-on
which will be fun the M's not available

51
00:03:02,620 --> 00:03:03,250
online now

52
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:08,080
just passing out here we r you are a we
will have taken it available for

53
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,040
download but it's a this is for
educational purposes so

54
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,080
should you should remove the end after
at the end of the workshop

55
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:22,080
question

56
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,140
so anyway what we recovered the talk
today when talk about now on the network

57
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:33,140
introducing it or think that talk about
how we

58
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,690
wife taking the network is very
important for an hour now sis their own

59
00:03:36,690 --> 00:03:36,940
dick

60
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:40,540
talk about fake at all its features how
to set up how to use it

61
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:45,590
I and the how it's implemented see can
understand how it works

62
00:03:45,590 --> 00:03:49,140
under the hood and I will talk about the
new features that were really saying

63
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,019
and how you can use on and thats the lab
that we're gonna

64
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:57,090
cover after lunch which will be hands-on
portion the class will show you

65
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,340
you know take it through all the
different features a fake net and

66
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,379
and demonstrate he whites useful in

67
00:04:03,379 --> 00:04:10,379
complications from our now sis cell

68
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:14,590
background but now where on the network

69
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:18,579
now on the network likes to hide in
plain sight they want to avoid being

70
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:19,479
detected

71
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:25,080
by by you right I'm so their goal is
there gonna try and blend in as much as

72
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:25,690
they can

73
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:29,039
and they're going to use a variety of
tactics to your cell they're gonna do

74
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:29,970
that by

75
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:34,580
either using protocol security use on an
occasion yeah we still see some custom

76
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,340
binary protocols but it's more rare

77
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:39,919
lot more often they're going to use
protocols that you already I have a

78
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:40,510
network

79
00:04:40,510 --> 00:04:44,070
so example this is you know attackers
like

80
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:47,190
popular protocols HCP HCPs

81
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:51,680
DNS you know anything that you have all
over your network

82
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,280
they're just gonna try and sleep in with
that because there's just too much

83
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:55,110
traffic free

84
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:59,070
keep up with and therefore they're gonna
try n I applied in with that

85
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:03,669
you know IRC is to be a popular Mauer
protocol then people started eliminating

86
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:04,630
it on their network

87
00:05:04,630 --> 00:05:08,110
when they start eliminating on their
network you know I'm our stop teasing

88
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:08,780
arce

89
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:12,139
right so we push the attackers to go

90
00:05:12,139 --> 00:05:16,090
you know into a protocol that that we
allow on our network

91
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:19,940
that's where the ago

92
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:23,860
and so very calmly Mauer early as you
get closer class things like that

93
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:26,919
and the and so

94
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:30,340
yeah also attackers like to use existing
infrastructure

95
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:34,330
so you know rather than have dedicated
server for

96
00:05:34,330 --> 00:05:37,539
further now serving up there but no
matter their Mauer or whatever

97
00:05:37,539 --> 00:05:40,650
it's very easy to stake out right they
can see id

98
00:05:40,650 --> 00:05:43,860
find a domain name: you get blacklisted
on

99
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:47,509
that infrastructure kid to be caught so
easily

100
00:05:47,509 --> 00:05:50,550
so what they like to do is you know use

101
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:54,190
infrastructure that's already out there
compromise somebody else's web server

102
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:58,449
and you know serve an hour up that way
on

103
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:02,270
posso client issue to be king

104
00:06:02,270 --> 00:06:05,449
is very popular now right because they
somehow get run

105
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:08,669
on yours on inside your network and

106
00:06:08,669 --> 00:06:12,819
on a call their connections out down
from within your network and because

107
00:06:12,819 --> 00:06:16,500
and because they're doing that the
attacker actually makes a very difficult

108
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:18,199
and to know where they are on your
network

109
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:22,000
you know maybe some may be exploited
somebody with a word doc me 100 days

110
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,530
that

111
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:26,050
that came out this past Tuesday you know
where da came into them in

112
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:29,830
you know their compromise but attackers
really know who they compromised or

113
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:30,789
where on the network

114
00:06:30,789 --> 00:06:33,919
and so won the first things in our all
do is

115
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,159
speaking from inside the network and say
hey this is where I am on the network

116
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:38,340
this machine I'm on

117
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:41,349
but and and that type of information

118
00:06:41,349 --> 00:06:45,409
very often understanding how that
initial peak an initial profile is

119
00:06:45,409 --> 00:06:46,690
passed out by then our

120
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:51,250
I is a useful to get network signatures
and things like that for a given

121
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:55,409
peace in our sup

122
00:06:55,409 --> 00:06:59,050
the old why do we care to take the
network when and where

123
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:03,050
doing our now sis well we want to track
them our

124
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:07,279
to thinking it's everything's fine right
we don't want to think that it's on a

125
00:07:07,279 --> 00:07:08,699
system that we're analyzing

126
00:07:08,699 --> 00:07:12,250
the thanks that might behave differently
might lead itself

127
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,789
might just act differently so we we
don't realize what it's true

128
00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:16,800
functionality is

129
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,840
also also very commonly Mauer will check

130
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,349
for hate to have an IP address but I
have an IP address why am I gonna go

131
00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:24,219
over the network

132
00:07:24,219 --> 00:07:28,420
I should me it legally myself or
something along those lines

133
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:31,610
also now often go to let's say you know

134
00:07:31,610 --> 00:07:35,430
cool dot com first and say am I getting
a page back from Google

135
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:38,900
if I am and i know im connect the
internet now managing my bad

136
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:39,640
functionality

137
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:43,530
therefore for not tricking them out
where to thinking it's connected to the

138
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:44,080
Internet

139
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,480
and has an IP address then in an hour
might

140
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:51,130
just term itself so wanna keep them our

141
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:54,440
running as as much as possible so I keep
it telling

142
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:58,740
running as and that gives us as much
indicators as possible

143
00:07:58,740 --> 00:08:02,160
so our goal we're doing our analysis
that tease out all the indicators you

144
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,550
can

145
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:05,940
this means a hoe space indicators are
not in

146
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,440
network these indicators two signatures
we can use to

147
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:13,750
identified an hour right and

148
00:08:13,750 --> 00:08:16,550
the more that the now runs more
likelihood we're going to get the

149
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,640
signatures at

150
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:21,140
and so therefore by taking the network
for able to

151
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:24,920
keep the code running as long as
possible right so if that now is

152
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:28,070
requesting web pages we want to get web
pages so that it keeps

153
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:33,020
doing other things I part iv: a huge
downfall sandboxes in general

154
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:36,640
for a now ours some forms in our
analysis

155
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:42,250
unlike dynamic analysis I is you don't
get the full code code coverage because

156
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:47,900
you know only a portion love what will
execute within an hour actually runs

157
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:51,130
but by by faking network maybe we can
get additional coverage

158
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,460
so but a good reasons why we want to be
faking the network

159
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:58,080
cell

160
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,800
what existing tools are there out there
other than take right so

161
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,250
or reading chapter 3 the book which is
that basic dynamic analysis

162
00:09:06,250 --> 00:09:09,420
so before you get too you know inside a
fighter pro our

163
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:14,320
are looking at assembly code you know
when you're just using tools we

164
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,980
we didn't spine to any the tools for
networking were easy to use

165
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:22,390
on and they're just seem to be a gap in
the field as far as

166
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:26,680
you know why is there no simple tool to
use on Windows for on for this so

167
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,520
what we did was we went through and and
surveyed all the tourist tools so

168
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:35,270
now back in the day when I started doing
our now says there is like tools like

169
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:39,370
the safety and ass just a very a simple
tool that came with the

170
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:41,040
now code analyst pack

171
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,119
I you install the local machine and

172
00:09:44,119 --> 00:09:47,999
think there's key in Staunton year

173
00:09:47,999 --> 00:09:51,879
local machine in it it just response to
DNS requests got a little gooey

174
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:55,629
on and it you know just listens on port
53

175
00:09:55,629 --> 00:09:59,290
Rick returns whatever sorry say most
most the time this is a former love

176
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:03,179
a the local host so

177
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:07,110
is what's 18s looks like it's not a very
impressive gooey

178
00:10:07,110 --> 00:10:10,939
and it was pretty buggy a crash in a lot
and was kinda frustrating years

179
00:10:10,939 --> 00:10:14,399
if anybody's is the prime know that on
and that

180
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:17,660
it all they really do miss the units
right locally and you had a lake

181
00:10:17,660 --> 00:10:19,069
reconfigure all your settings

182
00:10:19,069 --> 00:10:22,970
so if you wanted to you know you have to
set your DNS server locally so that they

183
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:24,339
can this work because

184
00:10:24,339 --> 00:10:28,389
at three listening on port 53 if you're
running at all get the point there other

185
00:10:28,389 --> 00:10:29,279
DNS tools

186
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,059
that came out a Like a Pirate Day and

187
00:10:33,059 --> 00:10:37,069
and also fake taking a search party at
the the rednecks

188
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:41,509
distribution but and then everybody just
had their own python script for

189
00:10:41,509 --> 00:10:45,419
for doing DNS and so but like I said
it's

190
00:10:45,419 --> 00:10:48,429
there's only really sporting DNS and I

191
00:10:48,429 --> 00:10:53,629
there was a lot of features to those
tools horse's neck at you all know

192
00:10:53,629 --> 00:10:57,049
when a cat is for the Swiss Army knife
%uh

193
00:10:57,049 --> 00:11:01,439
networking and so to play along with
around with that way we can listen

194
00:11:01,439 --> 00:11:05,029
in this example we see their is you're
listening on port 80

195
00:11:05,029 --> 00:11:08,160
but its raw it's difficult to use you
gonna have to

196
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:13,149
on you know depending on what traffic is
coming and you're gonna have to you

197
00:11:13,149 --> 00:11:16,259
scripted up to be able to respond in a
proper way to an hour

198
00:11:16,259 --> 00:11:19,850
and so you know no other infrastructure
built around that

199
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:23,629
answer the best tool that was out there
was I netzarim

200
00:11:23,629 --> 00:11:29,189
I that Sam is a still available to Linux
basically any download it for free

201
00:11:29,189 --> 00:11:32,549
but and emulate all the common services
so

202
00:11:32,549 --> 00:11:35,850
HDPE you know cell FTP all these
different

203
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:40,309
services already there and it serves up
what its can

204
00:11:40,309 --> 00:11:44,249
it's fully configurable you could go and
manipulate as much as you want I

205
00:11:44,249 --> 00:11:47,610
but you know there's assembly required
rates like you

206
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:51,559
you have to have personally a tub
separate bien so if you had if you do a

207
00:11:51,559 --> 00:11:54,000
lot of your now are now sits inside
Windows

208
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,260
which dealing with when does now we're
going to be doing doing it now sits

209
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,270
inside Windows

210
00:11:58,270 --> 00:12:01,750
their four-year when those VM's gonna
have to be connected here

211
00:12:01,750 --> 00:12:06,140
a I nets and 1x p.m. and you're gonna
have to create networking are you up to

212
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:09,380
create a route between them and also

213
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:12,570
if DNS is going to be going out to this
I name server:

214
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:16,570
i'd and its answer for you can have the
set DNS inside your Windows box to go to

215
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:16,890
that

216
00:12:16,890 --> 00:12:20,630
this machine I'm also if the

217
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:25,080
if Mauer goes directly to an IP address
rather than to be an ass first

218
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:28,650
Iran to a problem that they don't have
routing set up properly rakes not gonna

219
00:12:28,650 --> 00:12:29,580
know that

220
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:33,820
oh this IP address you go straight i det
Sen so it just requires a lot of work

221
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,330
gonna get things going

222
00:12:35,330 --> 00:12:39,090
with China 10 but once you have it up
and running

223
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:42,750
it's pretty flexible and what it can can
do for you but this is what I'm talking

224
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:43,330
about

225
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,340
flight if they've kinda complicated
setup to get it working

226
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:50,290
me the two virtual machines he'd have
DNS redirecting

227
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:53,490
and then I to access the services inside
if

228
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:57,180
I netcent so just kind of like a whole
bunch of things if the workaround

229
00:12:57,180 --> 00:13:01,520
I'm to get to work and that was really
all there was

230
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,830
there wasn't a lot love you know tools
out there for faking the network from

231
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:06,750
our now says

232
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:09,950
that's what I came up with a a soft and
here

233
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:15,390
them all

234
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:18,430
so sign up

235
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:23,620
thanks on so we can all think net and
what are our goals

236
00:13:23,620 --> 00:13:27,230
on the number one priority that we had
when designing this on with its

237
00:13:27,230 --> 00:13:31,080
simple to run on so there are a lot of
other do a lot of things to talk about

238
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:31,580
them

239
00:13:31,580 --> 00:13:34,610
but they were kind of a pain in the ass
on I know for me

240
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:38,370
at the time I wasn't doing now in office
all the time I was doing here

241
00:13:38,370 --> 00:13:43,370
for their income dabbling cell to have a
to our setup time to do an hour now sis

242
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:47,670
or have a machine dedicated to do it in
the army spent today saying it up

243
00:13:47,670 --> 00:13:51,790
was kind of a lot effort just doing our
house once a week or once a month so I

244
00:13:51,790 --> 00:13:53,340
wanted something that you can just
download

245
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:56,550
run do now sis move on on

246
00:13:56,550 --> 00:14:00,580
only easy to configure even it even open
configuration is required for most

247
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,520
things

248
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:06,180
get fairly powerful on own cover the
most popular also

249
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,220
if you look at on it said

250
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:11,329
am I did some covers more protocols in
there certainly if you set up to the end

251
00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:15,589
you can certainly add more protocol have
a better set up with before Sam box but

252
00:14:15,589 --> 00:14:20,079
recover the most want nah covers
ninety-five percent now where

253
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:23,819
I a lot of what's left is using a custom
park also nothing is really %uh solve

254
00:14:23,819 --> 00:14:24,509
that problem

255
00:14:24,509 --> 00:14:28,959
I wanted to run right on the Windows VM
there's a downside to that right that

256
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,779
the malwares running running the same
place them our is which

257
00:14:31,779 --> 00:14:35,949
isn't always great as an architect you
Mallorca system compromise so

258
00:14:35,949 --> 00:14:40,360
fairly that I think that doesn't see it
are by far the trade-offs

259
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,709
what we're still pretty good at that you
have another VM each my right there

260
00:14:43,709 --> 00:14:47,139
I do wanna make sure you can contract

261
00:14:47,139 --> 00:14:50,550
all the networking operation so if you
look at think DNS

262
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:55,160
or using a DNS on their way than our
doesn't hit against that so

263
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:58,569
now it doesn't do it in Apopka then fake
ass doesn't see

264
00:14:58,569 --> 00:15:02,600
obviously and that sometimes tonight at
San goes too hard could address

265
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:06,339
unless you really stop your routing very
well you're not actually gonna see it

266
00:15:06,339 --> 00:15:11,670
and respond to questions for higher
class on its M idle air service provider

267
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:12,220
which

268
00:15:12,220 --> 00:15:15,620
I I'm your most you're probably not
familiar with because it wasn't very

269
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,290
popular Microsoft com

270
00:15:17,290 --> 00:15:20,970
but to preach and thank I wanna sporty
cap captures

271
00:15:20,970 --> 00:15:25,189
on 21 things about Windows you can't do
a pick-up capture on

272
00:15:25,189 --> 00:15:28,809
local on a local adapter on so if you've
ever tried it out

273
00:15:28,809 --> 00:15:32,089
Wireshark won't do it for you on so I
wanna have something that would she do

274
00:15:32,089 --> 00:15:32,500
that

275
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:36,680
on want to make an extensible and have
an easy way to make a somewhat

276
00:15:36,680 --> 00:15:39,430
complicated web server I'm summary right
Apache

277
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:43,740
but something that looks Michael the
relative web server so now the phone

278
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,399
usage

279
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,569
I'm so basically here's an example arm

280
00:15:47,569 --> 00:15:51,660
and repairs were imposed for a bike the
bleeding edge you know unstable

281
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,569
version which is kinda what make that
2.0 is is that think when you schedule

282
00:15:55,569 --> 00:15:57,800
this we were hoping to have a stable
release by now but

283
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,769
you know by busy in bucks I here's a
look like

284
00:16:01,769 --> 00:16:05,250
on peacefully most like yeah I will post
a link again later

285
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:09,750
so it puts things in brackets on their
short messages from fake net so them our

286
00:16:09,750 --> 00:16:10,519
runs

287
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:14,240
it doesn t ask where you see that has
domain name

288
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,209
I thank all the calls get I

289
00:16:17,209 --> 00:16:19,740
on a chip you request it shows you the
request

290
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:23,139
it shows you the user agent it shows you
the other headers options

291
00:16:23,139 --> 00:16:27,709
I'm so you know already kinda get some
decent indicators for the Ballarat you

292
00:16:27,709 --> 00:16:29,000
know what i mean that's using

293
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:32,000
you know user agent using which is often
a good

294
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:36,949
a good teacher and all you really had to
do was run our run big net and then

295
00:16:36,949 --> 00:16:37,699
running our

296
00:16:37,699 --> 00:16:41,240
I what happened actually download the
file so

297
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,540
sometimes mauro go out and download a
file and then do something with that

298
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,110
pile

299
00:16:45,110 --> 00:16:49,379
total downer PTI world on something so
we want to make sure we actually send it

300
00:16:49,379 --> 00:16:51,060
a file that looks reasonable

301
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:54,370
so let's say download the PI and then
use you know

302
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:57,600
Parsons that starts tonight you can see
what it does with it I'm so here's an

303
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,300
example if it asks for a PDF

304
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:03,860
I get it I so in this case you see that
you see the two main request

305
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:07,179
you see the GET request iran actually
response

306
00:17:07,179 --> 00:17:10,380
and then on the bottom you actually see
on Adobe

307
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:13,380
somehow dubious is notified that a

308
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:17,610
PF has been open in Adobe dozens or call
back CC as last year just see the

309
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:18,289
malware

310
00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:21,579
are you thinking at work for everything
on the system I'm so you will see

311
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:25,730
regular network traffic what about a
program that the downloader

312
00:17:25,730 --> 00:17:28,750
arm so again like I said whatever

313
00:17:28,750 --> 00:17:32,020
file is downloaded we try to make it
match what the problem is expected

314
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:36,220
so here's an example where I'm our went
out didn't get request

315
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:39,520
and if you look the governor quest is
for txt

316
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,730
so when it calls I get request for an
EXE

317
00:17:42,730 --> 00:17:45,960
we pass a battle working executed or
because we want to see what it does

318
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:49,559
I and what they were executed more it's
or that many programs just as a pop-up

319
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:53,570
so from our was something that went out
to website Dallas TX intranet

320
00:17:53,570 --> 00:17:57,220
you now figure that out now Todd it's
not a pretty common hour functionality

321
00:17:57,220 --> 00:17:57,610
its

322
00:17:57,610 --> 00:18:00,740
not super difficult to figure that out
otherwise

323
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:04,390
in other ways but if you want to connect
and network is actually pretty easy way

324
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:07,270
to do it nick is a back no matter
whether it's a task for whatever path

325
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,490
whatever wherever goes

326
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:13,740
it's gonna pass by sexe sometime a
little bit but the implementation

327
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:17,590
on soul air service providers are this
interesting thing windows

328
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:21,090
arm that basically allows you to cook

329
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:24,880
all went top bunk shit out so it was
kinda done

330
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,290
I'm not sure the reason Mike something
probably for filters and prop

331
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:32,240
season other things like that I'm but
every time anything that you insight

332
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,250
makes a call

333
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:36,910
you actually look through the install
LFP when Zach service providers

334
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:40,650
and I'll call and and it will let them
make any arbitrary changes to that

335
00:18:40,650 --> 00:18:41,880
network last

336
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,330
on so it became fairly common not super
number fairly come from our use this

337
00:18:46,330 --> 00:18:51,220
on now a lot of which in approx used it
but Mallorcan you to sort of Jack

338
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:52,020
packets

339
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:56,690
or manipulate packets or scan packets
security products use it easier for

340
00:18:56,690 --> 00:18:58,610
filtering it for quality service

341
00:18:58,610 --> 00:19:02,050
no reason we can't use it to and then we
set up

342
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:05,250
so initial well a laser fires we have

343
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:08,680
on network listeners that sorta are just
looking for traffic up

344
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:14,250
and responding out to a proper protocol
up so how does it work

345
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:18,280
there's a DLL they got a mouthy floated
every single one thought process

346
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,820
think that to install that wind sock
that when Sokolowski provider

347
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:26,860
there's a registry artifacts that and
there's a

348
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:30,040
USB stick in the front but Im still
looking for one I

349
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,970
and then here's actually all the
functions that you get to hook it's

350
00:19:32,970 --> 00:19:34,540
quite a long list it's pretty much

351
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:39,850
everything useful that you never wanna
hook in a network so

352
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:43,030
13 14 hour traffic can be redirected
we've done something intriguing that we

353
00:19:43,030 --> 00:19:45,790
actually need to respond to it so what
listeners have implemented

354
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:51,050
on to listeners be due to shipping UPA
she came in you I think he would do

355
00:19:51,050 --> 00:19:55,160
the dummy listener I'm so that I mean
this introduces listens and responds at

356
00:19:55,160 --> 00:19:56,080
every single port

357
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:59,240
on and assorted things that puts the
output

358
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:02,660
I'm wanting things about listing for the
dummy listeners you can actually listen

359
00:20:02,660 --> 00:20:03,820
every port on Windows

360
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:07,650
if you just try to call are you don't
find listen on every port

361
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:10,720
you're not gonna you know to succeed on
eventually what to say

362
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,710
you can't do that it'll rhyme meri
resources and in a crash arm so how this

363
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:15,270
works is

364
00:20:15,270 --> 00:20:19,430
because speak at able to hook every
single call wanna see the call out on

365
00:20:19,430 --> 00:20:20,040
poor

366
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:23,290
while it be you know it blocks on that
call

367
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:26,780
its way to a while and then while that
while that hollers block it opens a

368
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,880
socket another threat

369
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:31,420
so was soon as you start to try to your
address

370
00:20:31,420 --> 00:20:34,560
them over before and listen to it used
in ass

371
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:39,500
there's a CBS unlawful Python extensions

372
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:43,049
set up so there really isn't any such
just kickin run but there is things that

373
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:43,870
you can

374
00:20:43,870 --> 00:20:47,270
I do to change its all talk about some
other files and how they're laid out

375
00:20:47,270 --> 00:20:48,220
what their purposes

376
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:51,880
so there's a default file directory and
that does pretty much what it looks like

377
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:52,510
it does

378
00:20:52,510 --> 00:20:56,340
on those are the file that will get sent
so there's a PT happen next people or

379
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,549
nation of I'll

380
00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:00,780
when you get a request for any those
extensions that will get sent

381
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:03,990
on so you can help file for fake net you
run think that

382
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:07,750
you open your browser and you could any
URL and it down with internal and the

383
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:10,090
default HTML suffered a politician up
I'll

384
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:14,640
is is the help file there's extensions
Directory reading for all your tensions

385
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:18,419
I comes as one example extension to make
that clear to show you how to work how

386
00:21:18,419 --> 00:21:18,970
to do it

387
00:21:18,970 --> 00:21:22,330
other to configure file on like I said
its

388
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:26,090
you need to configure it but there are a
lot a lot of options just because

389
00:21:26,090 --> 00:21:29,840
depending on our that a lot of things
you might want to do tax allies an hour

390
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,470
on their certificates %uh that p.m. file

391
00:21:33,470 --> 00:21:37,620
arm so when you can issue PS request I

392
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:41,190
you need to provide some services to get
solution the certificate that provides

393
00:21:41,190 --> 00:21:45,120
and the reason why it can be useful
thing is sometimes now we're actually

394
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:45,860
check

395
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:49,340
the thing should have been provided by
the fire so

396
00:21:49,340 --> 00:21:54,100
if you the pumping private server choose
me so if Mauer has gone all the way to

397
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:54,750
actually

398
00:21:54,750 --> 00:21:57,880
break the chain code into them our you
really don't know what happened now our

399
00:21:57,880 --> 00:22:00,240
certificate right you don't have the
attack risk manager told

400
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:04,309
she can't do anything but now writers
are usually pretty lazy

401
00:22:04,309 --> 00:22:07,900
and the use the OS is that signature
verification things so what you can do

402
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:08,570
is you can

403
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:12,490
an insert here that you sign I with your
own CA

404
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:16,559
with your own signing certificate that
you adhere trust you root rot on Windows

405
00:22:16,559 --> 00:22:20,049
she can actually a ride you know good
sign signatures to mao in it that's

406
00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:20,750
looking for that

407
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:24,450
and then there's the WFP deal out which
is what size being injected

408
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:28,690
running you double click on it

409
00:22:28,690 --> 00:22:32,510
a couple things that you do that I
butterworth

410
00:22:32,510 --> 00:22:36,000
they're worth mentioning is you have
networking activity of some sort so if

411
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:36,690
your VM

412
00:22:36,690 --> 00:22:40,380
has to have had a network adapter that
connected window the fact that the

413
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:44,390
physical network isn't connected you
actually can you've been talking all

414
00:22:44,390 --> 00:22:47,570
and then every time you fall in Virginia
after review I'm

415
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:48,920
that kinda annoying

416
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,760
are a better programmer you would have
to deal with that but I'm not

417
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:53,340
unexplained

418
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:57,670
I'll yeah how you in the end we run as
host only mode

419
00:22:57,670 --> 00:23:01,490
so family-owned saw snow snow actually
happen allowing traffic are given IP

420
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:03,270
address again like that but it just has
to be

421
00:23:03,270 --> 00:23:06,960
connected interconnected state wishing
to run a two-minute

422
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:10,630
I I talk to other people on that same
problem mucho

423
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:15,870
the she said I

424
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:19,960
so configuration um so figure actually
will reconstruct

425
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:23,500
packer capture after that you can open
in Wireshark or some other tools

426
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:28,000
arm open up its not an actual standard
pack capture so

427
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:32,240
it's not a capture a the network a pack
it's going prosto wire

428
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,690
I as I said earlier windows won't let
you when P cap does not support local

429
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:37,270
adapter

430
00:23:37,270 --> 00:23:41,290
arm for reasons that are complicating
deal with Windows internals and not an

431
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:41,870
interesting

432
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:45,110
arm but I still wanna have a packet
capture so

433
00:23:45,110 --> 00:23:48,280
being that figure is one of the two
sides to every single

434
00:23:48,280 --> 00:23:52,400
I and everything connection being made
it knows it sees every packet

435
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:56,400
so there's less are be reconstructed
packet capture it's definitely different

436
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,730
your nose differences like there's no
Ethernet frame

437
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:01,919
is never actually may not even a wire
arm

438
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:07,720
I also you know out into something that
it confuses people but I still think the

439
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:08,870
usability trade-off

440
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:12,200
if there's SSL traffic in the packet
capture

441
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:15,480
I just showed that you could dress up
sealing a packet capture and you

442
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,940
thinking oh this view the actual exact
bites but

443
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:21,559
so is not the actual exact life because
I stripped of the other cell layer

444
00:24:21,559 --> 00:24:25,679
arm but for me that's just much easier
cuz you wanna see the actual day a young

445
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:29,440
maybe you care about the SSR hires I in
which case you can turn that feature of

446
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:32,919
I'm but normally it on and now you get
the on

447
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:37,179
you could be uninterrupted traffic and
then there's a sort of the options are

448
00:24:37,179 --> 00:24:40,610
high specify whether you wanna are on
what you like the file name to be an end

449
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:44,169
it automatically creates a new file name
with the date and time for each capture

450
00:24:44,169 --> 00:24:47,480
are you as as the show as a show you for
the

451
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:51,890
the output is ASCII taxed so I've seen
you do this if you want to do something

452
00:24:51,890 --> 00:24:52,990
you saw the binary data

453
00:24:52,990 --> 00:24:56,669
the so-called invasive options the lawn
that use Alice P

454
00:24:56,669 --> 00:24:59,410
on the reason I saw him out is because

455
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:03,280
up there a there they almost 40 minutes
XP right now

456
00:25:03,280 --> 00:25:06,830
so don't because I asked him is
deprecated so all the other features

457
00:25:06,830 --> 00:25:07,930
work on all asses

458
00:25:07,930 --> 00:25:11,040
and if this goes wrong if there's a bug
in SR problem with this

459
00:25:11,040 --> 00:25:14,310
it's this works for system cell unlike
the turn of on developing

460
00:25:14,310 --> 00:25:18,480
another officer director i ke redirect
all traffic

461
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,890
that means even if something doesn't do
the Masterclass it'll redirected

462
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:25,380
to bake at so if something goes out
let's say

463
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:28,860
let's say there's an hour out there that
our checks to make sure that the US

464
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,330
response

465
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:33,170
isn't to 127 001 so

466
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:36,790
if you look at big teen ass how that
worked as you would set your

467
00:25:36,790 --> 00:25:39,850
yes listener to always responded what
local host as the

468
00:25:39,850 --> 00:25:43,330
DNS server with her huge 17 after local
host

469
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:47,010
an hour we detect that protect the US
response to global house and say

470
00:25:47,010 --> 00:25:50,320
while not running a real environment now
that's not unreasonable recently you

471
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,480
never did you ask where you can get
low-cost back

472
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,690
my real power so when prime I'm so we'll
what this feature is watching actually

473
00:25:56,690 --> 00:25:57,950
make your DNS response

474
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:01,060
people to something else own when the
now does the US request you cannot

475
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,630
respond with 9.2

476
00:26:02,630 --> 00:26:06,360
3.4 an hour actually call out to 9.2
three or four

477
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:10,550
but you directed anyway think that so we
think it will redirect it after an hour

478
00:26:10,550 --> 00:26:11,070
does that

479
00:26:11,070 --> 00:26:14,580
arm but only for a matter fares

480
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,600
other federal even try to listen every
single core on Windows

481
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:21,870
are you not gonna you know it's not
working I have a bad time us know if

482
00:26:21,870 --> 00:26:24,660
something at a port scan and I open up
every single port to see what traffic

483
00:26:24,660 --> 00:26:26,080
that is when she crashed so

484
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:29,280
I set to soar my father's a hundred maps
but you can change that

485
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:34,290
yes options it automatically modifies
your local DNS setting

486
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:38,550
much are not too and then there's a new
option in my pocket later

487
00:26:38,550 --> 00:26:43,080
output options do you want to dump the
cheapos lobs so

488
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:46,510
from our doesn t see post you want to
bump up the plot if you do where should

489
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:47,220
you put it

490
00:26:47,220 --> 00:26:51,450
when you wanna holler file on and help
our process lasting and post response

491
00:26:51,450 --> 00:26:55,150
listener these are all the time so opera
cause you can listen to

492
00:26:55,150 --> 00:26:59,110
are then you can have responded with the
appropriate the form header

493
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:02,770
packets president of listeners there's
supe

494
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:06,730
there's raw which essentially just send
out just distress displays the bites and

495
00:27:06,730 --> 00:27:07,760
does

496
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:11,430
act doesn't actually sending traffic
back there's nothing P listener

497
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:15,120
Anderson I thought extension 1 I and
comes with an S&P listener

498
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:19,210
just for as an example some pizza
appreciable protocol so the Pythons the

499
00:27:19,210 --> 00:27:21,310
Python extension that only about 50
lines and

500
00:27:21,310 --> 00:27:24,740
covers most the protocol and also works
with https

501
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:28,010
arm how about homelessness work
basically

502
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:31,210
yet right to function just right and a
function that can do nothing

503
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:34,730
but you can't call when you when you run
and the after a new connection function

504
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:36,210
so whenever there's new connection

505
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:39,910
because a Python script you that you
call send and receive data

506
00:27:39,910 --> 00:27:43,860
um whenever you wanna send and receive
data to the other side so it's it's

507
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:44,800
super useful

508
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:49,690
me doing now it has sort of custom
coatings are custom okay

509
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:52,790
I'm so fame I'll 10 things that we
thought was pretty cool

510
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:55,850
you can I know you told me that when
botnet an hour start looking for you

511
00:27:55,850 --> 00:28:00,330
I'm so this is a us from from a blue
coat security advisory

512
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:04,760
up with the push to botnet I Pinoy rated
with a cat to do now says

513
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:09,810
any notice that the after doing a bunch
of completely random looking

514
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:13,600
out very responses ClearQuest I would
actually try to

515
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,650
make an SMTP connection to practical now
enough with a calm

516
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:20,040
which is sort of I went to the website
for the book which seemed a little

517
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:20,710
strange

518
00:28:20,710 --> 00:28:24,930
arm in fact we had to that we probably
wouldn't have noticed this arm

519
00:28:24,930 --> 00:28:28,090
but that's because I was looking for
fake that if you want nothing net

520
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:32,340
many see that actually uses different
differences and I actually know how

521
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:35,890
defected taken at we probably could
figure that out making

522
00:28:35,890 --> 00:28:39,580
Western but we feel like that the talk
on arrival we see that starting bonnets

523
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:40,170
140

524
00:28:40,170 --> 00:28:44,180
and that promise I me to think that yeah
it was just looking for a big night

525
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:49,370
XE so it's not like to be hard-pressed
to get around Arts on a path back to

526
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:52,540
Mike to talk about new features

527
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:57,720
group

528
00:28:57,720 --> 00:29:04,720
one up

529
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:13,200
the new tools finally news when now or
authors actually care about it

530
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:16,270
on so the

531
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:19,430
this is we've all we've all got wrapped
up so far

532
00:29:19,430 --> 00:29:23,940
in to help take networks and also sort
all the features that we've had out

533
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:24,340
there

534
00:29:24,340 --> 00:29:28,290
on but now we're going to release some
new features and we'll talk about the

535
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:31,290
so

536
00:29:31,290 --> 00:29:34,770
a the first one cuz process logging

537
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:39,790
so this is a pretty huge feature because
now you can find out the exact name in

538
00:29:39,790 --> 00:29:40,710
the process

539
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:45,650
as well as the PID I for the connection
that actually happening

540
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:48,810
so for example if now where you know

541
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:52,380
Iran election that now is just
inexcusable and it goes out than ever

542
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:55,630
you're like oh yeah okay assume that
that's what's doing the connection

543
00:29:55,630 --> 00:30:00,050
but that may not actually be true might
actually be injecting into a process

544
00:30:00,050 --> 00:30:01,940
that's injecting into a process

545
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:05,330
that eventually beacons out the network

546
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:08,790
and you often want to know is an hour
analyst well which

547
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:12,210
process is responsible for talking over
the network right

548
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:15,410
you think about how something like
poison ivy works is that

549
00:30:15,410 --> 00:30:20,350
it injects and into a process that India
and ends up injecting into Internet

550
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:21,120
Explorer

551
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,250
and that's what actually goes out in
with using this process like be able to

552
00:30:25,250 --> 00:30:26,340
see that very quickly

553
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:30,090
be able to target that process and say
all right there something more going on

554
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:33,200
with an hour it's doing some type of
process and action I need to figure out

555
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,690
I had a track that down make sure I
don't miss that in mind that Nextel

556
00:30:36,690 --> 00:30:37,310
sister

557
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:41,080
but I'll tell you where it's connecting
to this example you see it now

558
00:30:41,080 --> 00:30:44,850
says port 80 on so

559
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:47,990
me to pinpoint the process and it's just
an it's just an

560
00:30:47,990 --> 00:30:51,640
out option inside the config file that
we showed you earlier

561
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:55,460
rate just process log in yes or no and
then it shows that

562
00:30:55,460 --> 00:31:00,130
specifically logs for different things
but so you ready for this and to

563
00:31:00,130 --> 00:31:03,360
so that you know power does the NS ill

564
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:07,510
you catch that with the send to and then
if they do something over port 80 like

565
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,430
HTP

566
00:31:08,430 --> 00:31:12,210
will catch up with the connect also any
sockets that occurred on our crates that

567
00:31:12,210 --> 00:31:13,530
will also be caught lot

568
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:17,030
but the process name as well as when
they close down the socket

569
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:24,030
Saniya to a quick demo here

570
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,720
a star by launching take that

571
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,890
and I will just make sure runs by go to
website

572
00:31:32,890 --> 00:31:36,070
went to Microsoft icon looks like and it
served up the fake net

573
00:31:36,070 --> 00:31:39,890
help while we see it here there is a get
requests

574
00:31:39,890 --> 00:31:46,890
DNS for query for Microsoft dot com
taking clothes take that

575
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,990
can go into are settings for faith that

576
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:55,910
on the VM inside a CTools take that too

577
00:31:55,910 --> 00:32:00,810
is where we're going to be looking today
we can open up the configuration file

578
00:32:00,810 --> 00:32:04,950
and

579
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:08,540
inside the configuration file we just
wanna

580
00:32:08,540 --> 00:32:13,980
tests on these new features first this
process liking

581
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:19,560
process logging will

582
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:24,990
will happen now when I run think that
hopefully and when I go to Internet

583
00:32:24,990 --> 00:32:25,730
Explorer

584
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:30,100
and I can go to a web page like Google

585
00:32:30,100 --> 00:32:34,120
acecomm and I'll see that it

586
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:39,280
it requested a Google Doc calm here and
then it also says Internet Explorer

587
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:43,140
connected via over low-cost because
that's where

588
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:47,490
I'm listening but to port 80 and

589
00:32:47,490 --> 00:32:50,690
and appeared above Internet Explorer
1664

590
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:54,250
and of course that's make sense because
I wanted to Internet Explorer and

591
00:32:54,250 --> 00:32:55,640
eyebrows to that website

592
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:59,750
so make sense that they look at what so
that's just me

593
00:32:59,750 --> 00:33:05,610
process logging in action

594
00:33:05,610 --> 00:33:08,370
are the next option a new feature that
we had it

595
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:12,910
cuz this was pretty exciting is the bud
break point and so this enables you to

596
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:14,150
cause an exception

597
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:17,260
on purpose homeland there's connection
that occurs

598
00:33:17,260 --> 00:33:20,470
%uh so this enables us to trace

599
00:33:20,470 --> 00:33:24,240
exactly the source other malicious
action so we can break

600
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:28,470
break when the connection happens and of
course really need to

601
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:32,260
Center causing exception inside the
process where

602
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:35,730
basically in a crash if we don't handle
exception therefore we need to set just

603
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:36,590
in time butter

604
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:40,350
so for example already about to set as
your just in time to bugger

605
00:33:40,350 --> 00:33:43,240
that way when you have this feature
turned on the process doesn't crash

606
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,250
instead it all

607
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:47,980
break inside your debugger and about a
girl actually handle the exception and

608
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,200
POS excuse that

609
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:52,310
at a nice place re you do things like

610
00:33:52,310 --> 00:33:56,330
trace the call stack in a voter that's
one example %uh

611
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:59,340
and see where the code is coming from T
make the call to connect

612
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:02,830
on and that's this is a quick way for us
to get

613
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:06,420
Street echoed so not only are we going
to be able to love the process in which

614
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:07,580
process running in

615
00:34:07,580 --> 00:34:12,350
but here we can actually break inside
that process so let's say that no matter

616
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:12,919
our

617
00:34:12,919 --> 00:34:16,260
I you know is one to figure out what
code is

618
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:19,270
you know where the now where's the code
connecting out maybe they're smart the

619
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:21,419
station in their tickets the obfuscated

620
00:34:21,419 --> 00:34:25,120
and use wanna see is that the record is
what's happening around that code

621
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:29,200
is a good future use for that another
option is let's save our

622
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:33,320
injection lol code into a process and
that shell code is

623
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:38,110
is unravels itself on through a bunch
about this cation eventually

624
00:34:38,110 --> 00:34:42,429
it resolves all the function names and
all the imports that actually wants a

625
00:34:42,429 --> 00:34:43,250
call out to

626
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:48,399
finally than our the shellcode does it
connect your break inside that shellcode

627
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:51,669
you could then go to that show code dump
it all out and analyzed

628
00:34:51,669 --> 00:34:56,220
so very quick way for you to go from
from Matt running our

629
00:34:56,220 --> 00:34:59,280
to extracting the shellcode you norm

630
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:02,450
normally that the way you'd have to do
it is either you know set a breakpoint

631
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:04,870
where the shellcode injections happening

632
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:08,870
may be dumped out that way even then you
still have to then manually take the

633
00:35:08,870 --> 00:35:09,720
shellcode

634
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:13,420
and unravel it to get to the you know
whatever comes our happening

635
00:35:13,420 --> 00:35:16,740
here that now at the shell total be
completely unraveled

636
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:18,740
you be able to dump it out that way

637
00:35:18,740 --> 00:35:21,910
so much much faster way to be able to to
get your answers

638
00:35:21,910 --> 00:35:26,130
and it specifically Paz's

639
00:35:26,130 --> 00:35:30,580
on way to connect happens so not the
creation of a socket nothing like that

640
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:32,420
just wanna connect happens that are
gonna

641
00:35:32,420 --> 00:35:37,530
apart this is a

642
00:35:37,530 --> 00:35:40,890
under the in the configuration is under
and basic option

643
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:44,330
and for connection break into said it
yes or no

644
00:35:44,330 --> 00:35:49,330
so its demo the bud

645
00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:54,530
breakpoint feature and I'm gonna close
my browser here

646
00:35:54,530 --> 00:35:57,820
and I'm gonna close a fake at sense

647
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:03,220
I am reconfiguring so

648
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:06,850
inside the configuration I'm just gonna
change the connection break

649
00:36:06,850 --> 00:36:13,850
to yes

650
00:36:14,220 --> 00:36:20,739
then I will rerun take a nap and one
thing I think that is you gotta realize

651
00:36:20,739 --> 00:36:23,470
is that any networking that happens on
your machine

652
00:36:23,470 --> 00:36:26,930
think that's gonna catch it that's why
we're seeing liked your Windows machines

653
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:27,640
are pretty chatty

654
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,880
right there's no BIOS all this crap that
they're always doing

655
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,160
and so yes be CEOs may never connection
big surprise

656
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:37,309
happens all time but they mess gonna
catch ex are gonna catch everything

657
00:36:37,309 --> 00:36:38,089
that's happening

658
00:36:38,089 --> 00:36:42,829
so one day I'll be careful love is to
not confuse yourself as to what's that

659
00:36:42,829 --> 00:36:43,470
our

660
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:46,769
activity versus not so this might
require you do

661
00:36:46,769 --> 00:36:50,269
be rerun think that a few different
times just to make sure that you know we

662
00:36:50,269 --> 00:36:51,119
have a run now earn

663
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:55,390
yet so we know that pay that SEC house
is not related to an hour

664
00:36:55,390 --> 00:37:02,390
on but it is something you gotta be
aware of sorry like I ve ever use it to

665
00:37:02,569 --> 00:37:03,559
like Procter Mon

666
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:07,329
right near you're monitoring our you
know it

667
00:37:07,329 --> 00:37:10,989
it logs 100000 events you to sift
through those events

668
00:37:10,989 --> 00:37:14,009
same kind of thing happens on the
network slot less offense that on a

669
00:37:14,009 --> 00:37:20,059
all this is called into an apartment
case so

670
00:37:20,059 --> 00:37:23,160
running a thick net and then a minute

671
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:27,749
go onto the Z Drive which is where I'm
our s seen our

672
00:37:27,749 --> 00:37:30,890
and the first on a run is web server

673
00:37:30,890 --> 00:37:35,700
but we have to do one thing before we do
that we have to set our just in time to

674
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:37,660
bugger right because I just run our

675
00:37:37,660 --> 00:37:40,920
it connects out we're gonna crash cuz I
handling that exception

676
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:44,150
so we have to go inside a a are tools

677
00:37:44,150 --> 00:37:47,969
on this example images can use Ali so
all set

678
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:51,039
just in time to fucking I'll

679
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:54,329
made Ali are just in time to voter we
had done

680
00:37:54,329 --> 00:37:58,569
close it out now it's the only cause an
exception

681
00:37:58,569 --> 00:38:03,219
are the buggers gonna pop up for us so
we run a web server

682
00:38:03,219 --> 00:38:06,609
and but

683
00:38:06,609 --> 00:38:11,599
depositors you know right when I connect
was about to happen inside that process

684
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:16,239
when side the exception here so we just
had a step a few times

685
00:38:16,239 --> 00:38:20,140
to get back to where that a where the
code broke

686
00:38:20,140 --> 00:38:23,390
and then we can do a

687
00:38:23,390 --> 00:38:27,220
take a look at our call stack

688
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:29,290
and if we observe the call stack

689
00:38:29,290 --> 00:38:33,520
before connect called a call you know
inside Windows I called you know

690
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,750
I'll what 2030 functions

691
00:38:36,750 --> 00:38:40,230
inside when the when I NetLibrary before
the cactus finally made

692
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:43,240
on depending on how high a level

693
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,370
function call you make than our makes
arm

694
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:50,890
it could take a while before the connect
happens down the road but candidate X

695
00:38:50,890 --> 00:38:53,020
gonna happen in order for that
connection to go out

696
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:56,880
when we look at this call stack here we
see something very interesting we see

697
00:38:56,880 --> 00:39:01,780
internet open URL thats maybe within our
call to be able to

698
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:06,090
I to get there and then we can says we
have a call stack here

699
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:09,680
just double click to go that that place
inside the call stack

700
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:16,680
sorry

701
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:25,560
think and and so this is where the code

702
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:28,940
did the call for connect and we see
things like

703
00:39:28,940 --> 00:39:32,760
you know we see internet open URL
internet open Internet read file

704
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:36,280
is are all I said I've API's that are
very commonly used to

705
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:40,370
you know download web page also internet
open is used for setting the user-agent

706
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:44,310
and in this now worst-case their user
agent was internet surfer there

707
00:39:44,310 --> 00:39:47,820
so you know a lotta code we can analyze

708
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:50,400
around rate with connection happened
because we were able to break at that

709
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,010
spot

710
00:39:51,010 --> 00:39:54,690
rate than an hour to the connection we
didn't do any disassembly or anything

711
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:57,060
like that we're right at the code
location won and lost

712
00:39:57,060 --> 00:40:01,420
so that's though web server that example

713
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:08,420
and web server

714
00:40:08,930 --> 00:40:15,420
looks like it went out to custom bike
photos dot com next example I want to do

715
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:22,420
is de moda di XE here so

716
00:40:27,030 --> 00:40:28,350
so it looks like it broke

717
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:31,420
inside of Cal so de moda di XE was an
hour I run

718
00:40:31,420 --> 00:40:36,560
ran but brokencyde cap so clearly them
hours doing something

719
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:40,230
like watching a calculator we gotta
figure out what that is

720
00:40:40,230 --> 00:40:45,510
cell you are a couple steps to get back
to the code

721
00:40:45,510 --> 00:40:49,020
we take a look at our call stack that
really

722
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:53,090
get us back anywhere it's still inside a
when i net what happened here is

723
00:40:53,090 --> 00:40:56,510
I yeltsin scalp is up we can probably
guess that

724
00:40:56,510 --> 00:41:00,340
some type of process injects happening
in an hour started Cal

725
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:04,060
and injected into it shoukat when that
happens

726
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:07,520
and eventually a call to connect
happened it's possible that the call

727
00:41:07,520 --> 00:41:08,860
stack reassembly

728
00:41:08,860 --> 00:41:12,700
insider to bugger got screwed up it's
possible that a thread was created

729
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,970
and therefore the call stack can be
traced back because it's

730
00:41:15,970 --> 00:41:19,130
you waiting for that dreaded and iight

731
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:22,280
there's a variety of reasons that you
know this call

732
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:25,350
a the call stack tracing

733
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:30,010
might not work like it did in the case
of Webster so we need another

734
00:41:30,010 --> 00:41:34,120
another way of doing this well we can do
is say well at the show could injected

735
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:35,530
there's gonna be a read/write X

736
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:39,910
a execute section inside memory pull up
the memory map inside a

737
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:44,120
all the debug and we see one of those
right here course

738
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:48,110
that means that this section is likely
to be our shellcode

739
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:51,120
which means if our show code is doing
the connect

740
00:41:51,120 --> 00:41:55,130
which it is rates through some API call
I

741
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:58,130
its when the code is done connecting

742
00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:01,590
its gonna come back to this code so one
thing we could do is we could celebrate

743
00:42:01,590 --> 00:42:02,600
an access

744
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:06,120
which will break next time yet
instruction pointer

745
00:42:06,120 --> 00:42:10,930
is running inside this memory section so
he said a break on access their

746
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:17,930
and we can hit play

747
00:42:19,660 --> 00:42:24,050
media to play can again

748
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:27,290
his breaking on the Dover out there ia

749
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:30,720
so sometimes it breaks a few times but
eventually

750
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,040
since the breakup are finally a break on
access broke

751
00:42:34,040 --> 00:42:38,150
and now we're sitting inside our
shellcode and you can

752
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:41,420
scroll up and realize that

753
00:42:41,420 --> 00:42:44,840
you know hey this call well right now it
shows it as

754
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,940
eat EDP -74 you know some location

755
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:52,250
on the stack but that call was
responsible for

756
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:55,690
other network connectivity that occurred
also

757
00:42:55,690 --> 00:43:01,960
let me just fix the window here inside
of since I change the display settings

758
00:43:01,960 --> 00:43:06,220
also when we look at the stack right
with the show Curtis there's a buncha

759
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:07,630
ASCII on the stack

760
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:10,690
get a good view it that ASCII down and
say

761
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:16,250
0 all looks like it goes to a practical
matter now says dot com we see that and

762
00:43:16,250 --> 00:43:19,450
test that JK to go to fake net

763
00:43:19,450 --> 00:43:24,530
that make sense because we see we
received the ash tree for a practical

764
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:25,690
matter now Starcom

765
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:29,030
and also it to get request four tests
such a sec

766
00:43:29,030 --> 00:43:32,150
so make sense that we did we would see
those trains right here in memory

767
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:35,230
also in this example I put a a contrived

768
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:38,600
it in key and you can see that that's
you know just a

769
00:43:38,600 --> 00:43:42,550
that's a dinky that you would look up
just the simple example

770
00:43:42,550 --> 00:43:49,550
but it gives you a sense for for might
actually be occurring

771
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:58,280
so couple different options for how we
can get back to our Code

772
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:02,099
one separate when it hit right to break
an access on the shellcode

773
00:44:02,099 --> 00:44:09,099
we could do a stack trace depending on
how the code is working

774
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:18,530
so another feature that was added a stop
in a service

775
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:21,650
this stops the DNS cache service in
Windows

776
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:25,470
from also known as the S client what
happens in

777
00:44:25,470 --> 00:44:28,800
in Windows is you know where logging
process rate

778
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,890
we were like in which processes doing
the connection

779
00:44:31,890 --> 00:44:36,220
the issue with that is iOS and Windows
your browser doesn't actually do the DS

780
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:37,400
refresh your browser

781
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:42,050
like Internet Explorer Mozilla they do
not go over port 53 to do

782
00:44:42,050 --> 00:44:46,300
the connection now our people know that
what actually happens is

783
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:50,020
it talks to a service and windows and
that services what does the connection

784
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:51,070
on port 53

785
00:44:51,070 --> 00:44:54,550
on your behalf so therefore for fake net

786
00:44:54,550 --> 00:44:58,600
if you want you know to be logging the
proper process name for who

787
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:03,369
whose actually responsible the DNS
request you have to turn off the service

788
00:45:03,369 --> 00:45:06,869
okay so example that

789
00:45:06,869 --> 00:45:10,600
on yet so example that is

790
00:45:10,600 --> 00:45:14,190
you know you turn on the server this
feature stop DNS client service

791
00:45:14,190 --> 00:45:17,460
and we'll see if the difference so

792
00:45:17,460 --> 00:45:24,460
when you go back just demo that real
quick

793
00:45:27,010 --> 00:45:28,650
so let's go inside a fake that

794
00:45:28,650 --> 00:45:35,650
as close down think that first at two

795
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:43,900
configuration file let's turn off the
connection break

796
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:48,230
so stop breaking on the connection and
then let's turn on the

797
00:45:48,230 --> 00:45:51,490
stop the UNESCO client service to yes

798
00:45:51,490 --> 00:45:58,490
don't recommend stopping critical
Windows services

799
00:45:58,950 --> 00:46:03,369
on all occasions but hurt so that it is
useful to get you the information you

800
00:46:03,369 --> 00:46:03,950
wanna get

801
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:10,950
but that's why it's an option in the
configuration so

802
00:46:11,910 --> 00:46:15,090
run think net and if I

803
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:20,770
just open up our are a a web browser
here

804
00:46:20,770 --> 00:46:24,560
will see that now this time I'll

805
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,430
it we actually see Internet Explorer
connecting out over

806
00:46:28,430 --> 00:46:35,430
port 53 to do their quest

807
00:46:36,589 --> 00:46:40,330
should probably a and after a bit
machine get service back up to show you

808
00:46:40,330 --> 00:46:40,980
the opposite

809
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:45,480
but the opposite is and I which I showed
the first was that

810
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,849
your browser doesn't connect on port 53
so that doesn't get lot

811
00:46:48,849 --> 00:46:53,070
rate so this is a good way to if you
want to figure out

812
00:46:53,070 --> 00:46:56,230
which processes actually responsible for
the DNS request

813
00:46:56,230 --> 00:47:03,230
you're going to have to turn on a
teacher make sense

814
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:12,380
post response I got this feature quest
buy it from a lot of people

815
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:16,170
I is that an hour of in all do a post
bite

816
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:20,280
actually think that date is gonna come
back from that post

817
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:23,980
almost basin almost like a find her
place for instead of doing that request

818
00:47:23,980 --> 00:47:27,700
they're just doing taking get out
putting a posted and their server on the

819
00:47:27,700 --> 00:47:28,960
other end is custom

820
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:32,990
so it doesn't you know a normal web
server will react a certain way to

821
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:33,850
oppose request

822
00:47:33,850 --> 00:47:37,380
but an hour you know operated

823
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:40,520
a you know server make you know

824
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:44,790
just act like its a get instead of a
post and that's actually very common in

825
00:47:44,790 --> 00:47:45,290
our

826
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:48,800
and so common I go on a quest for an
added in this feature

827
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:51,990
and so this option is your post response

828
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:55,070
return TSR now and that'll basically
just say

829
00:47:55,070 --> 00:47:58,490
okay if you do a post to an HTML file
will

830
00:47:58,490 --> 00:48:01,550
will give them an HTML file back they do
a post to

831
00:48:01,550 --> 00:48:05,440
JK that's possible that we get the
midget take back

832
00:48:05,440 --> 00:48:09,190
and it's the same serve concept how we
work with gets requests

833
00:48:09,190 --> 00:48:13,660
just the post but you have the option to
turn it on so if you realize

834
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:17,220
your own sake net and you see an hour
does the first thing it does is a POST

835
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:17,810
request

836
00:48:17,810 --> 00:48:21,920
what I do then is go back and turn this
feature on and say

837
00:48:21,920 --> 00:48:25,690
okay let's try and service something
back maybe we get an hour do more stuff

838
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:32,690
I could depending on how the power
operates that might actually work

839
00:48:32,980 --> 00:48:35,750
also is the most common user error

840
00:48:35,750 --> 00:48:39,450
is that you don't have a an IP address
or a proper network

841
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:42,510
interface setup on your system for
example

842
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:45,930
in VMware you don't have that connected
box checked

843
00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:49,099
I and so if you don't have that
connected box checked

844
00:48:49,099 --> 00:48:52,410
you're gonna you can't run brought her
into a problem because there can be no

845
00:48:52,410 --> 00:48:57,549
a network interface and so therefore we
detect if you have an IP address or not

846
00:48:57,549 --> 00:49:00,819
I also I just recommend having an IP
address

847
00:49:00,819 --> 00:49:04,859
period because not not just as take that
needed network connectivity

848
00:49:04,859 --> 00:49:09,200
by Mauer needed as well so him our
analysis might not

849
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,660
go as well anyway regardless if using
take that or not

850
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:16,359
so always make sure that that checked
connected box

851
00:49:16,359 --> 00:49:19,660
I is on whatever virtualization software
you use

852
00:49:19,660 --> 00:49:23,079
a nice thing about the and where is it

853
00:49:23,079 --> 00:49:26,569
in our automatically has DHCP and
Candice serbia tonight the address and

854
00:49:26,569 --> 00:49:27,880
write the worry about it just

855
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:32,849
check the box get-go are

856
00:49:32,849 --> 00:49:37,359
I additional nine useful changes I is we
have a sexy new icon

857
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:43,230
and L they cite you happy that a yes

858
00:49:43,230 --> 00:49:46,559
debate about the logo I

859
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:49,760
by anyway but there's also a lot about
Texas I'll

860
00:49:49,760 --> 00:49:53,640
we lotta you know issues over overtime
finally funny putting out a new version

861
00:49:53,640 --> 00:49:54,109
I

862
00:49:54,109 --> 00:49:57,930
at she has been two years it's been
about two years opposed to now

863
00:49:57,930 --> 00:50:01,140
I me. he added: additional the fall
files

864
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:04,390
just because you know what what are the
most common files they're getting solved

865
00:50:04,390 --> 00:50:08,609
served up to start serving up like that
happen icons a few others

866
00:50:08,609 --> 00:50:12,839
on the hit list here on so not
superficial changes but

867
00:50:12,839 --> 00:50:17,400
you know the way you know you to list
tool as good as it has an iPod or not

868
00:50:17,400 --> 00:50:18,700
right doesn't have an icon

869
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:21,710
its it's like or the story itself

870
00:50:21,710 --> 00:50:24,930
me that um what's what's next for our
for the tool development

871
00:50:24,930 --> 00:50:28,890
on you know next we rest are focusing on

872
00:50:28,890 --> 00:50:31,930
Windows a wfp

873
00:50:31,930 --> 00:50:34,990
support so you know Ellis Peter
deprecated

874
00:50:34,990 --> 00:50:38,190
up McKenney said earlier that all still
runs

875
00:50:38,190 --> 00:50:42,099
on Windows seven opened as a such as
limited in on all these different

876
00:50:42,099 --> 00:50:42,809
features

877
00:50:42,809 --> 00:50:45,610
for example the the bud break point

878
00:50:45,610 --> 00:50:49,390
won't hit and sewer or going to focus
our attention to Nexus

879
00:50:49,390 --> 00:50:52,800
getting this working in Windows 8 with
all the features I

880
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:55,890
but we have to move from LSP to the
windows filtering platform

881
00:50:55,890 --> 00:50:59,660
I'll windows decided to you change the
way they

882
00:50:59,660 --> 00:51:02,760
they do these things and so with to rate
a completely new

883
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:07,560
on male we have that complete change the
way we do are hooking

884
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:10,560
essentially right to be able to gather
all this information

885
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:14,210
and sell that's a

886
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:18,820
over focused on next also

887
00:51:18,820 --> 00:51:21,880
like to thank us Friday people a

888
00:51:21,880 --> 00:51:27,170
sky as Sebastian he he wrote like a
little wiki page on how to use take that

889
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:31,060
a a lot of people have access than I i
rip some stuff out for this presentation

890
00:51:31,060 --> 00:51:32,780
from his work is also

891
00:51:32,780 --> 00:51:36,300
his documentation on our toes so much
better than our documentation that I

892
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:40,110
that I'm going to copy and paste from it
a lot as I thank him for that

893
00:51:40,110 --> 00:51:43,540
a and William Richard helped out writing
some %uh the demos and

894
00:51:43,540 --> 00:51:46,910
and the latter the workshop as well I
could download the code

895
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:50,030
leading-edge version of a cat to we have
not done

896
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:53,370
official public release edit that's
going to happen next couple weeks here

897
00:51:53,370 --> 00:51:57,570
just fixing a couple more about on that
we have teased out

898
00:51:57,570 --> 00:52:02,120
give the attesting a and so that but you
can download echoed

899
00:52:02,120 --> 00:52:06,160
from that link their just just put in
Dropbox a good sport down real quick

900
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:10,700
sup

901
