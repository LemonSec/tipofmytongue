1
00:00:00,089 --> 00:00:03,570
hello everyone mine s rice I'll

2
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:06,740
thank you to be here and it's my
pleasure to be here

3
00:00:06,740 --> 00:00:10,349
kid announced the session yes our power
in pairs

4
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:14,509
how 15 same template reviewed over 100

5
00:00:14,509 --> 00:00:18,980
I use after free bond be a tease paresis
the

6
00:00:18,980 --> 00:00:24,560
named of the fighting strategy we use
our first

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,250
I would like to apologise start are poor
cannot be here today because of the size

8
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:29,939
shoe

9
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:33,950
and serious a little bit introduction
about us

10
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:37,309
boys say member of Phi Phi 7

11
00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:40,989
he discovered biamby which is before on

12
00:00:40,989 --> 00:00:44,530
Windows office Adobe Reader sash

13
00:00:44,530 --> 00:00:48,050
and other powerful and me

14
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:52,530
minus rice and major focus on Windows
center no

15
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:59,530
now where and exploited detection on

16
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:04,140
this picture is from the chorus VDB and

17
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:07,460
restarted restarted try to find

18
00:01:07,460 --> 00:01:12,010
are you buying beauties Wiese fussing
around 1 year ago

19
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:18,049
and you can see from his picture of this
picture is number of the

20
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:21,689
RC discard disclosed bipartite networks

21
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:25,259
this start growing after we began our

22
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:30,720
are you buying beauty hunting for in the
very beginning we thank you for the

23
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:33,930
result of the CVV number can reach like
dozens

24
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:37,700
will be very happy but in the end it's
reached

25
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,880
over 70 like a pesky Eskimo kiss core

26
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,530
so we are very excited today we would
like to share the

27
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:50,479
on far as a strategy reused and how we
did it

28
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,590
in detail okay

29
00:01:55,590 --> 00:02:00,200
arm fussing are for many people are it's
simply

30
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:04,220
testing techniques you run a lot of
Santos

31
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:07,780
on a larger of on our lot

32
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:12,880
number of Machinists and hope you
couldn't generate some useful dumps

33
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:16,500
and try to find upon beauty are no stops

34
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,600
on this concept this high-level concept
are correct

35
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:25,190
I shiny overlooks menisci then details
so fucing

36
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:29,030
on hardest the most important factor

37
00:02:29,030 --> 00:02:32,160
of us in we think it is not machine

38
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,310
we think it is not how long we spend
outsourcing

39
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:38,560
because we don't have 200 000 C hundred
machinists

40
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,640
we don't have five year or ten years to
do for seeing

41
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:44,880
so we think the core problem of us in

42
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:48,300
use how to generate high quality test
cases

43
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,900
affectively high quality test case

44
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,620
use are less garbage and more useful
crash

45
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:00,530
more about ability so

46
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,860
are we want sure we would like to attack
this problem but first of all

47
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,220
we need to arsov one thing how to
describe

48
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,690
away page for a test for a case
generation purpose

49
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:15,799
you know there are many many things on a
webpage like

50
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:20,680
attribute tax so we ask ourself a
question

51
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,310
arm is it possible to kiss I one

52
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:28,739
way page template that can describe and
cover most cases

53
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:33,690
the value of this universal tempted to
start

54
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:37,910
it came greatly reduce the complexity of
test case generation

55
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:41,760
so we study

56
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,440
many 0 de santos we studied the
repricing repays just

57
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:51,870
every study admitted yukio cease and we
conclude that

58
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,780
most of the way pages with Internet
Explorer viability this

59
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:02,780
can be described a slow following
templates in the beginning of templates

60
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:07,500
we have are compatible Meditech
competitor

61
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:13,150
comfortable men are tafreeh.com are
indicates Chris reassuring of lively

62
00:04:13,150 --> 00:04:17,560
you like the way page to render us are
like

63
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,780
I E Fife you relates i7 I

64
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:25,060
%eh I night they are slightly different
between each version

65
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:28,990
they re half CSS part

66
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:32,110
CSS described lookin for matching

67
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:37,400
of a webpage there we have script
function

68
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:40,860
here we use JavaScript it can
dynamically

69
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:44,810
change the web page content we also code
is part

70
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:48,620
dynamic part in and

71
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,880
aren't in it and we have said part Chris
use

72
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,970
HTML are you sure the word

73
00:04:54,970 --> 00:05:00,080
Hong assign are one function front
Biosci functions from the dynamic power

74
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,860
to revenge of lestat part on

75
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:08,470
now here we go cya foss 0 3 I'm loudly
then

76
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:13,500
so are 50 can be triggered

77
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:18,110
quick while his page loading so

78
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:22,530
this is set this SLA tempted I can cover
ninety nine percent of the cases

79
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:26,850
are theoretically we can't discover

80
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:30,200
almost every by be a cheap buy this
template

81
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:34,880
but in fact it is impossible because
companies shanks potion

82
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,960
how long it would taste you

83
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,870
enumerates only combination of the HTML
class JavaScript

84
00:05:42,870 --> 00:05:46,150
class CSS pass comfortable information

85
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:49,220
of it will take long long long long time

86
00:05:49,220 --> 00:05:53,050
so adding some randomness

87
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:59,440
this approach to solve this problem some
random missus necessary to help

88
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,610
arts to come shark test cases start this
nearly impossible to conceive

89
00:06:04,610 --> 00:06:08,270
are because where page got his

90
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,970
are you can see if maybe already tested
I did you read

91
00:06:11,970 --> 00:06:15,970
riches release no problem

92
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:19,020
but slenderness also has some drawbacks

93
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,090
of

94
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:26,060
week there are this a two-point of the

95
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:30,960
true problem so horrendous the first one
is horrendous all random

96
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:35,580
does it repeat for if a random ass is no
good

97
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:38,640
sometimes we were generated deprecated

98
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:41,740
test cases sorry this waste of time

99
00:06:41,740 --> 00:06:44,900
they we also noticed that we have

100
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:49,690
an array of rushing actress suma from a
share snow is committing similar test

101
00:06:49,690 --> 00:06:50,370
cases

102
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:53,670
all the same test cases the show so

103
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:57,620
another waste of time the second problem
this

104
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:01,390
home we cannot track to the
relationships but his statement

105
00:07:01,390 --> 00:07:04,800
if we simply generate test cases

106
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,750
randomly the statement those
relationships between each statement

107
00:07:08,750 --> 00:07:13,690
some nice very weak some Castle Court SK
speak our garbage

108
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:17,620
so we would like to enhance the
relationship

109
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:21,210
but in a statement win we want to kite

110
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:24,430
the randomness we need directions

111
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:28,120
but how to do it how-to guide

112
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:32,360
the readiness I'll one day

113
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,500
wasn't happen and this experience defies

114
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:40,850
an idea how to guide the randomness one
day boss wife

115
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:43,920
ask him to retire her broke iPhone
screen

116
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,240
okay ice you know boys a great hiker

117
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:50,780
so is a good package is very good so he
should be no problem

118
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:54,410
no sweat okay he almost did it

119
00:07:54,410 --> 00:07:57,700
but after he pulled the he replaced the
screen

120
00:07:57,700 --> 00:08:01,700
we found two more screws on the table
those screws

121
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,980
serbian side the iPhone by there on a
table so something goes wrong

122
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:10,230
and return around we found we can I
found the camera

123
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:13,310
k rice missing and the

124
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:17,600
were saying yes this iPhone is that we
cannot turn down

125
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:21,390
right

126
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:23,400
so are we learn from this story

127
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:26,880
things learned from this experience

128
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,730
maybe engineers are not good as we party
thinks

129
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:34,080
just maybe Swiss and

130
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,600
maybe engineer smits mass text taking
things apart

131
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:42,300
like onto thinks and maybe engineer

132
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,090
snake my state's putting things back
together like

133
00:08:46,090 --> 00:08:50,850
reduce something and most part and the
rethink

134
00:08:50,850 --> 00:08:54,540
this assumption property also applies to
the are used in years

135
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:58,040
okay so we have a very rough idea

136
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:01,550
aren't trying to do something there and
do something

137
00:09:01,550 --> 00:09:05,560
so maybe there's some reference where
she goes on reference the issue

138
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:10,060
use after free issue or maybe which had
to redo something

139
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:14,930
we can trigger some issues okay

140
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:21,930
up

141
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:24,270
bites describe this idea

142
00:09:24,270 --> 00:09:27,420
the flow chart on

143
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:32,150
the first stage we do something first
the second stage

144
00:09:32,150 --> 00:09:36,090
we do something else randomly and in
final stage

145
00:09:36,090 --> 00:09:39,750
reduces we do something contrary to the
first stage

146
00:09:39,750 --> 00:09:42,890
or we can you visualize

147
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:46,970
Statehouse to evaluate then where do
something house

148
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:49,990
and in a final stage read

149
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:54,540
assigned at bat said us to rather be
okay

150
00:09:54,540 --> 00:10:01,540
because it is idea pair West we have
this idea we started to appear at all

151
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:06,350
Prosser the first version of officer

152
00:10:06,350 --> 00:10:09,710
actually are we do it's very easy you're
very easy way

153
00:10:09,710 --> 00:10:12,830
on there are three objects

154
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:16,440
can text your comments sq commies I only

155
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,320
week a serious comment on three
different kinds of objects

156
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,800
the first ones document and selection

157
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:28,339
and wrench object became risk your
comments on the subject

158
00:10:28,339 --> 00:10:32,360
that is cue it onto comment that's it

159
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:35,500
there are many many interesting are

160
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:39,020
come and we can try like we copy some
seen thing and do

161
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:42,940
it do something then we undo your trash

162
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:47,930
regions are about 10 then onto and

163
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:54,160
very effectively before we found chance
30s with and the second

164
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,589
the second thing we tried as a pair
strategy is

165
00:10:57,589 --> 00:11:04,170
we try to manipulate content are hearsay
very simple example

166
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:07,660
for us we safer in their attacks to have
a rival

167
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,070
then we clear the contents of this mess
or

168
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:14,440
are rights reset and history cream
everything

169
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:18,570
then we assigned to content back to
really no tax

170
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:21,640
this is just a reason party I many

171
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:28,380
other ways to menu many people a content
and this mass also very effective

172
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:33,690
could miss the first version and
naturally we would like to expand this

173
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:34,410
idea

174
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:37,730
pair this concept you like to take

175
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,250
are one more step so we have a second
version

176
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:45,690
of other we simply ran through the
horseback

177
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:49,830
MSDN and picket pick up interest in
property and method

178
00:11:49,830 --> 00:11:54,570
property that part on we are signed a
property respeto a

179
00:11:54,570 --> 00:12:00,020
think a science respecter be that some
pair or masur we go science we spare me

180
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:00,570
to a

181
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:04,529
then Perry to be that's another pair or

182
00:12:04,529 --> 00:12:07,920
are to Mathur that we encounter
resistance

183
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:11,279
all thats Messerli and Massa be

184
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,779
that's a third pair because Actos pair
as safe it

185
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:18,910
interlaced and randomly pick on pair

186
00:12:18,910 --> 00:12:23,399
farthest and put it into a template and
feel arrest part

187
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:27,899
friend indeed right so

188
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:31,220
this enhancement also doing well

189
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:35,120
then released and

190
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,470
all pair further we have third

191
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:44,170
Russian third generation of repair and
in this version:

192
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:47,230
this are we have we divided pair

193
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:53,709
into four different types the first so
honestly

194
00:12:53,709 --> 00:12:57,829
explicit parents on this pair is very
straightforward

195
00:12:57,829 --> 00:13:01,160
just do something on I

196
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:04,450
or switch to OFF or assigned to write
her a better be

197
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:07,790
or Cordina Mathur very straightforward

198
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:11,070
and the second type of various

199
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:16,000
during this apparently City which means
which I too many pay something that

200
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:19,990
maybe did not define respect but also
very important file

201
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:24,040
page loading page rendered something
like don't relationship

202
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:29,670
retrench we swap the parent-child
already out two pages

203
00:13:29,670 --> 00:13:36,670
Wiese we never k between those two pages
that's also a pair concept

204
00:13:36,699 --> 00:13:40,179
on okay the third type of Paris hi
preparing

205
00:13:40,179 --> 00:13:43,420
I we spend this type up a real

206
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:47,239
are in detail later now force why yes

207
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:50,949
pair in combination we simply are mixed
and

208
00:13:50,949 --> 00:13:54,199
altogether and use multiple pairings

209
00:13:54,199 --> 00:14:00,619
per page okay

210
00:14:00,619 --> 00:14:04,040
are I wrote expand ish different types

211
00:14:04,040 --> 00:14:07,049
in detail and if you if you are a few
example

212
00:14:07,049 --> 00:14:10,639
for X Bissett pairing like I said

213
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:14,079
are we doing something to retrench
something very straightforward

214
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:17,889
for example here we are for a da start
our display

215
00:14:17,889 --> 00:14:24,089
we change it from block too long block
niece we're in 30 subject I say

216
00:14:24,089 --> 00:14:27,279
block element then we change it to know

217
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:30,779
no meese do not render its it began

218
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:33,859
it becomes invisible so hitch we r

219
00:14:33,859 --> 00:14:38,989
release some said we'll that brosser try
to reduce some said this is a pair

220
00:14:38,989 --> 00:14:43,720
this is an example for the property
okayed

221
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:48,129
and example for Mathur yes are to
MassArt doing contrary things

222
00:14:48,129 --> 00:14:51,829
like be the focus then be after work and
focus

223
00:14:51,829 --> 00:14:55,100
then we call be doppler and then be

224
00:14:55,100 --> 00:15:01,290
we loose the focus and come and

225
00:15:01,290 --> 00:15:05,360
comments I'm very interested of

226
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,910
here the first example yes week indent
an object

227
00:15:08,910 --> 00:15:14,379
Larry out dent lobster or we can select
ok.

228
00:15:14,379 --> 00:15:17,600
weekend SQS electro

229
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:21,309
then we Sqn on select rich

230
00:15:21,309 --> 00:15:28,309
that bro so very busy K and the last
example for explicit Paris we

231
00:15:28,389 --> 00:15:31,850
are registered to a different purpose
event

232
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:35,189
by Corey courageous on focusing and
focus I'll

233
00:15:35,189 --> 00:15:39,439
and doing something different in issued
and this inner

234
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:44,509
K

235
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:46,239
are the following is a bowl

236
00:15:46,239 --> 00:15:49,859
are all patched or fixed by the
Microsoft

237
00:15:49,859 --> 00:15:53,499
and this example or are not reported by

238
00:15:53,499 --> 00:15:57,439
us so I think you should be okay to
present here

239
00:15:57,439 --> 00:16:00,809
okay that's half a lot here and the

240
00:16:00,809 --> 00:16:04,459
the pair here we use is focusing and
focus all

241
00:16:04,459 --> 00:16:07,850
on this script is very simple

242
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:11,129
in this line we art

243
00:16:11,129 --> 00:16:15,129
Co a focus so focus searing

244
00:16:15,129 --> 00:16:21,709
focusing will be invoked and you folks
in we keep create a new body object and

245
00:16:21,709 --> 00:16:22,419
replace

246
00:16:22,419 --> 00:16:26,859
the old one so while the old one be
replaced

247
00:16:26,859 --> 00:16:31,939
the focus so we'll be triggered and we
will discuss your document our right to

248
00:16:31,939 --> 00:16:38,939
clearly document content okay here's
another example

249
00:16:41,379 --> 00:16:45,209
the pair we use here yes indent and out
dent

250
00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:49,089
to move object are first

251
00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:53,789
here we have a list here instead it par
we have a list

252
00:16:53,789 --> 00:16:57,949
here and we have about 10 here and we

253
00:16:57,949 --> 00:17:02,160
theory on low we r I invoke dysfunction
and during this function

254
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,679
asleep North your first really skewed

255
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:10,449
indent an issue dance actually where
trigger leon resize event

256
00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:14,610
and during this event will this curious
how dense

257
00:17:14,610 --> 00:17:18,709
then we could hear this object 00

258
00:17:18,709 --> 00:17:22,669
daughter tax creates 20 if for some
reason

259
00:17:22,669 --> 00:17:27,610
are this on resize will be triggered
several times

260
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:30,809
Kosair reference.com the issue and in
the end

261
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:37,809
while we just curious electoral okay

262
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,770
up

263
00:17:44,770 --> 00:17:47,789
on now I would like to talk about
implicit parent

264
00:17:47,789 --> 00:17:53,159
increase the Perrys niece return to menu
page something about this

265
00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:58,090
not property not masur not attribute
also very important for a page

266
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:01,789
something like a content I already

267
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:06,539
we already have a reason poor became a
new plates contact 30 in attacks

268
00:18:06,539 --> 00:18:09,690
or sorority document our rights we say
empty string

269
00:18:09,690 --> 00:18:12,740
another impressive parent yes

270
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:17,020
are and ukulele the Don relation like we
can swap

271
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:20,250
the parent no than child now weekend a
panda note

272
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:24,400
applied elements on remove child

273
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,460
down many many things can do to can do

274
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:30,690
or we can change the way page Statehouse

275
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:33,929
weekend never catered from page eight
remember

276
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:38,250
to pitch be use our window dynamic it we
say you I'll

277
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:41,559
or arm through location dice reference

278
00:18:41,559 --> 00:18:45,360
to another page K

279
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:50,780
are that simplicity Perry we use here
you switch and Judy

280
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:55,330
Don relations here started strongly

281
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:59,390
stepped parts we have a table here the
ides ph1

282
00:18:59,390 --> 00:19:03,830
they we half a pH 2 mph 3 bh3 said he d

283
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:08,390
them very simple we simply use

284
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:13,120
ish want to apply in a min to change the
pitched three pick on a parent of a

285
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:13,990
bitch 1

286
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:20,990
and she got a problem okay

287
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:23,529
the are

288
00:19:23,529 --> 00:19:26,210
cert types of Perry's hype repair its

289
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:29,230
are we know

290
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:32,799
we found out that if we only fussing in
a dynamic parts

291
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,440
it or only we Stone Trey only on a
country

292
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:41,519
then we were only find by a beard he
related to dynamic Park so in order to

293
00:19:41,519 --> 00:19:42,950
increase the coverage

294
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:49,559
we need to add the static part so all of
us so we are also covered East etc

295
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:52,559
said of Rosson are something like

296
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:56,470
we we r sigh at review had studied parts
randomly

297
00:19:56,470 --> 00:20:00,499
and then we change that attributes in a
dynamic part

298
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:04,320
are reach me sweet ranch one thing

299
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:10,450
from two different part this concept can
also use

300
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:15,249
back are we change your property with
just a man then there's her we change it

301
00:20:15,249 --> 00:20:18,749
again we semester the show so change

302
00:20:18,749 --> 00:20:22,330
wanting from two different part all

303
00:20:22,330 --> 00:20:29,330
so that's the meaning of hybrid parry K

304
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:34,510
this is an example first retrench and
attributes: recess statement

305
00:20:34,510 --> 00:20:37,860
then we change it again Reese

306
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:41,050
are clear attribute we simply just clear
it

307
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:45,710
here's another example

308
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:49,220
the pair here yes are we Sat

309
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:54,560
contacted for edit about a true he said
parts then we change it to force

310
00:20:54,560 --> 00:20:58,270
in a dynamic part on

311
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:02,590
here said are we have a table here and
caption

312
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:06,000
and the reload

313
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:09,090
we were you scared disc your comments
select 0

314
00:21:09,090 --> 00:21:12,890
here and this select 0 where trigger

315
00:21:12,890 --> 00:21:18,800
set apart on select Start which we are
creating the dinner HTML of

316
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:24,170
cicchetti TTT are clearly urged him out
here

317
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:27,490
they hurry

318
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:34,490
aren't you say crack garbage chute to
force trigger a problem

319
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:39,470
K on this exam whole the pair yes are

320
00:21:39,470 --> 00:21:43,049
reissue risk your comment obvious cue

321
00:21:43,049 --> 00:21:47,370
I select first Mathur then risk your
comment to unselect

322
00:21:47,370 --> 00:21:51,190
K on this example

323
00:21:51,190 --> 00:21:54,799
railways is cure select the word she
girly

324
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,039
on select events year you can call back
here

325
00:21:58,039 --> 00:22:01,450
and bh2 will try to swap a note

326
00:22:01,450 --> 00:22:04,740
and this section where trigger pH 0

327
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,049
on poverty trench then we

328
00:22:08,049 --> 00:22:11,260
is curator on said Act and sugary your
if

329
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:16,960
problem K

330
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:21,950
the last one you saw pairing combination
which me sweetie come by

331
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:25,720
Marco Paris altogether in one

332
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:32,720
our templates here we consider pair here

333
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:38,650
is our style are here we have to quit
charge to style

334
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:41,789
here and we are signing now to style
here first

335
00:22:41,789 --> 00:22:46,210
ASCO sororities are example

336
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:49,360
he stepped part we have performed here

337
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:53,169
the ID spish 0 all

338
00:22:53,169 --> 00:22:56,190
and we said bh1 its style

339
00:22:56,190 --> 00:23:01,700
to overflow equal to visible later in
the tank

340
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:05,990
dynamic part first retrench DPH want us
to the overflow

341
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:11,090
2020 from these about 2020 then we
change the pH 0

342
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:18,090
da Cyrus R display to know fish mashed
do not render the subject and this one

343
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,780
will trigger a

344
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:25,770
hungry sites you then then are we risk
your document our bodies I remove child

345
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:29,159
to remove the pH 0 mess up be4

346
00:23:29,159 --> 00:23:35,480
come true vision

347
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:39,929
K are so how we construct the

348
00:23:39,929 --> 00:23:46,200
test cases all so we build a list of
pairs

349
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:49,650
explicit interesting hybrid income
banish in Paris

350
00:23:49,650 --> 00:23:53,700
now list then we are rental in use

351
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:58,960
randomly you sir despairs into a
template bike

352
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:02,380
if we feel here and here to use our
attempt a statement

353
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:07,210
day we use 31st statement pop art poss
possibly slifer statements

354
00:24:07,210 --> 00:24:10,400
my nose mask means the second statement
here

355
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:14,419
or your we feel we need a

356
00:24:14,419 --> 00:24:18,250
set it apart and dynamic part pairing

357
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:23,020
and we were you sir here and here this

358
00:24:23,020 --> 00:24:26,690
how we deal with a template so

359
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:33,690
let's see a demo how he looks like

360
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:42,790
all

361
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:46,390
hisself templates

362
00:24:46,390 --> 00:24:50,630
the beginning we care for us compatible
information here

363
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:54,780
and angry half our CSS part

364
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,800
and later on we care on

365
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:01,090
randomly choose randomly registered

366
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:06,510
event here every came so early pretty
fine pair here

367
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:11,330
and try to trigger your aunt later also
we

368
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:15,020
generate all we were generous dead are
here

369
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:20,280
and assign it to be so I D and you can
call back

370
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:27,280
is are also generated here hope

371
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,790
pair come come here

372
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:36,010
configuration file from here you can see
the pair number

373
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:39,770
we yeah guide the rent and this

374
00:25:39,770 --> 00:25:43,090
I we got there and then to render the
change the

375
00:25:43,090 --> 00:25:46,140
direction party

376
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:50,910
fraum right to left to left to right
this suffer simple

377
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:55,710
and we have many many here okay

378
00:25:55,710 --> 00:26:02,710
let's run the program

379
00:26:11,890 --> 00:26:14,780
on so this is how it looks like while
fighting

380
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:18,360
okay

381
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:25,360
that's it

382
00:26:31,809 --> 00:26:32,129
a

383
00:26:32,129 --> 00:26:36,210
are can our

384
00:26:36,210 --> 00:26:39,879
I would like to talk about the
implementation detail

385
00:26:39,879 --> 00:26:44,450
we don't use any script we don't have we
don't use Ruby

386
00:26:44,450 --> 00:26:47,450
we don't use I some of all

387
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:52,729
are you politicians saying see and the

388
00:26:52,729 --> 00:26:56,509
we hopped 20 VM's and one master server

389
00:26:56,509 --> 00:26:59,879
15 BMC is for routine fussing

390
00:26:59,879 --> 00:27:04,190
ever file free then is for
experimentation because we always have

391
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:05,019
no idea

392
00:27:05,019 --> 00:27:09,609
or your parents we would like to try
we're on almost

393
00:27:09,609 --> 00:27:13,089
experimentation Jens are

394
00:27:13,089 --> 00:27:16,219
we have for a so-called

395
00:27:16,219 --> 00:27:21,940
1,000,000 simple rules if a new idea if
we have a new idea we'll run its

396
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:25,830
if after one media Santos serious not
see interest in

397
00:27:25,830 --> 00:27:29,469
week we didn't find anything interesting
then we'll stop

398
00:27:29,469 --> 00:27:34,749
probably lots direction this wrong and
probably that module we try to fosse's

399
00:27:34,749 --> 00:27:35,749
very robust

400
00:27:35,749 --> 00:27:41,619
so this all wrong one media rule and we
have one master server

401
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:47,019
to collect and analyze all the result on

402
00:27:47,019 --> 00:27:51,609
okay we were in a bow to your four page
here verification farley

403
00:27:51,609 --> 00:27:55,249
so we you be much easier to get the
crash

404
00:27:55,249 --> 00:27:59,009
and all once crash

405
00:27:59,009 --> 00:28:02,210
we were safe the where page immediate
City

406
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:05,830
and we also safely crash dump are

407
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:09,739
at the same time and 13 Richard

408
00:28:09,739 --> 00:28:14,039
sir thing to do is we were trying to
repeat reproduce a crash again and local

409
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:17,909
because because are there are many
because for a crash

410
00:28:17,909 --> 00:28:21,869
so if you were crash again we think it
is very stable

411
00:28:21,869 --> 00:28:24,940
so we were up slow this simple

412
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:30,239
along with the crash dump to a server
and server were safe low some

413
00:28:30,239 --> 00:28:33,729
Santos and dumps according to a crash
dump a crash

414
00:28:33,729 --> 00:28:35,630
address

415
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:41,159
so oh the are Tomsk Russia this address
will be safe under sent folder

416
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:44,870
we own in it too I'll look at 2003

417
00:28:44,870 --> 00:28:48,809
then we can are de Turquie Katelyn

418
00:28:48,809 --> 00:28:52,240
then we know if it is worse to are

419
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:59,240
go deep to look for other okay

420
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:06,690
here's the result so far we have two 8.1
million crashes Santos

421
00:29:06,690 --> 00:29:10,179
and awe yeah

422
00:29:10,179 --> 00:29:15,179
over 400 unique crisis on

423
00:29:15,179 --> 00:29:18,210
they'll 150 we think

424
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:23,779
exploitable box and quiet there four
hundred and it crashes spot only if

425
00:29:23,779 --> 00:29:27,870
150 score the box on sound truck crashed

426
00:29:27,870 --> 00:29:31,399
they are not exploitable and sound truck
several crashes

427
00:29:31,399 --> 00:29:37,169
may point to it the central costs so we
think it out should this should be 150

428
00:29:37,169 --> 00:29:41,200
exploitable box and we already report

429
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,260
106 box three Microsoft

430
00:29:44,260 --> 00:29:47,399
five are considered duplicated and

431
00:29:47,399 --> 00:29:52,610
force rejected so far we got 71

432
00:29:52,610 --> 00:29:56,010
sinise and

433
00:29:56,010 --> 00:30:03,010
this city attracting from are you 62 are
you Devon

434
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:06,899
K short on

435
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:12,330
so far we only charge are you on by we
think may be crawling and so far

436
00:30:12,330 --> 00:30:15,620
Safari I was to try and PDF

437
00:30:15,620 --> 00:30:19,070
p weekend was a wrong flash draw
scrutiny

438
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:23,450
PDF so maybe we can also use pair too
fast the PDF

439
00:30:23,450 --> 00:30:26,799
a flush freshly care on ActionScript

440
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:30,080
so maybe pair can also help are

441
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:37,080
fasten be suppressed

442
00:30:37,779 --> 00:30:41,230
okay we would like to thank all
dermatology

443
00:30:41,230 --> 00:30:44,350
and or she provide are many viable

444
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:48,500
on laudable information and Antoni

445
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:53,120
helpfully wall pricing structure okay

446
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:59,520
so Q&A its

447
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:06,520
3 up

448
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:13,399
this history up

449
00:31:13,399 --> 00:31:18,130
are the question is do I publish we'll
we're I publish my coat equip

450
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:21,890
all but probably not probably not

451
00:31:21,890 --> 00:31:25,049
and if actually are if you

452
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:29,390
useless encode probably you will find
the sandbox a sauce

453
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:32,789
yes so yes yes

454
00:31:32,789 --> 00:31:37,510
so we think is a better approach is our
you understand our concept you

455
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:38,529
understand our

456
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:41,690
strategy and maybe you can add you on
idea

457
00:31:41,690 --> 00:31:45,260
into its and you can't maybe you can
find you bach group

458
00:31:45,260 --> 00:31:48,380
yeah with for trawler teen on or

459
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:52,640
are yeah I we'll we the first time we be
without flaws

460
00:31:52,640 --> 00:31:55,669
Prosser we don't look our crossfire sir

461
00:31:55,669 --> 00:31:59,590
we don't look grinder because we don't
want to do something like Glenn

462
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:02,750
we don't want a fact idea I thought so
we

463
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:06,330
argued all home things from scratch

464
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:10,120
so I was adjusted arm you can take the
idea and imperial

465
00:32:10,120 --> 00:32:12,820
beauty your own father

466
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:18,779
this up

467
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:22,440
okay to question yes are I'll

468
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:27,789
quasi-colony use after free box I found
and communist we found a few top of

469
00:32:27,789 --> 00:32:28,760
reeboks

470
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:32,250
other issue and also for box are you
serve to free

471
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:35,640
and type confucian this for

472
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:42,640
okay

473
00:32:56,770 --> 00:32:59,770
so the question is are I will

474
00:32:59,770 --> 00:33:04,010
are will isolated and a memory
protection

475
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:07,750
