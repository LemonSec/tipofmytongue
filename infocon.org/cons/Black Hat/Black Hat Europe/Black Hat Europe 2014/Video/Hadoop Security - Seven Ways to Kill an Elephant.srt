1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,510
so my name's Dhabi outnumber my twitter
handle same as my name it's really long

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:05,240
to prevent people from tweeting too much

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:10,330
I'm the senior director trust at UMC and
I'm gonna talk today about to do

4
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:10,969
security

5
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:15,530
so only have a couple introductions
first told about myself

6
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:19,470
so from 94 to 2004 did a whole bunch a
different security stuff candidates

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:21,340
myself but I've been doing this for
twenty years

8
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:25,300
ands it was really interesting but I ran
into space on the slide

9
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,170
so in 2004 early start working in a
bunch a different histories

10
00:00:29,170 --> 00:00:32,890
like job now so it was interesting
because they're putting robots on the

11
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,329
planets and had a daughter really cool
stuff with the robot sensing and

12
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:40,760
the working around data work in
astronomy a bit before that West Marine

13
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:41,300
was a

14
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:44,610
a large retail company that with huge
amounts of customer data on protecting

15
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:46,329
that Yahoo of course we had

16
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:50,079
billions of devices which a billion
users when I worked there and had to

17
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:53,120
work I was in charge of security on
mobile devices on digital home

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:54,090
television's

19
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:57,600
that sort of thing we put in a lot of
data begi maybe her to be GI

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,530
a Barclays Global Investors it was the
world's largest trust fund manager two

21
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:02,370
trillion dollars

22
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,689
I wanna business and the crisis well got
bought turning to Blackrock

23
00:01:05,689 --> 00:01:09,290
after the big mortgage crisis but in the
time I was working there they sucked in

24
00:01:09,290 --> 00:01:09,939
more

25
00:01:09,939 --> 00:01:13,409
ailich dated anybody in the head which a
PhD is that sat in mind

26
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:16,880
the trends and quantitative analysis to
figure out where the market would go

27
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,600
so all we did was basically build big
did environments for them to

28
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:24,250
predicts how not to go to business which
didn't work and then

29
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:28,189
2008 or dark side resin charger
compliance are it so the tools that

30
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:30,659
allow people to be completed by looking
at all of their

31
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:35,170
a continuous monitoring data 2009 S one
of my own company called flying penguin

32
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:38,409
there and after a few years before him
she acquired min 20 13

33
00:01:38,409 --> 00:01:42,689
I'm so there's no is flying penguin
because my company but I'd been running

34
00:01:42,689 --> 00:01:43,630
that for about to

35
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:47,500
I just almost 20 years since 95 I wrote
a book called securing virtual

36
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,450
environments which may be really
ambitious I thought while I can

37
00:01:50,450 --> 00:01:55,220
a lesser worker their salvation in 99
and so by 2012 I thought I just tell

38
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:57,149
people what I learned how to make secure

39
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:01,630
or cloud environments I'm secure how to
make a virtual that environment secure

40
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:04,950
and I wonder right securing big data
with the ambition

41
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:08,950
for my first book and Wiley is my
publisher the kinda suggested I continue

42
00:02:08,950 --> 00:02:09,899
on and I realized

43
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:12,500
pretty soon after starting at that even
though I had a lotta back

44
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,420
round in these Big Data Systems you can
secure big data so the talk is about

45
00:02:16,420 --> 00:02:17,060
today

46
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,300
I'm trying to be a brutally honest
because I feel like a lotta

47
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:20,330
distributions

48
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:23,340
I'm being distribution companies they
want to sell you on this technology

49
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:26,980
the same way PC manufacturers want to
sell you on distributed computing in the

50
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:27,490
eighties

51
00:02:27,490 --> 00:02:31,510
sore right around like a maturity scale
1988 89 PCs

52
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:35,880
where he connected to the Internet your
pretty much done so it's their gap thing

53
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:36,610
at the eighties

54
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:39,400
we're talking about with Hadoop again
and I want to avoid summer the same

55
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:41,600
mistakes I'm trying to put in
perspective love

56
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:44,920
if we're honest about this we can start
to fix some other major issues with

57
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:45,430
Hadoop

58
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:48,650
you talk to a distribution company and
I'll tell you pay

59
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:51,750
we're doing great things which is true
they're making changes but

60
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:55,930
reality is quite different iight so

61
00:02:55,930 --> 00:02:59,170
this is basically what I do is director
trust people ask you are funny title

62
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:02,720
what's my job really what I do is try to
help people understand how to create

63
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,720
trusted systems

64
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,270
and for me it's boiled down to three
things after year so

65
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:10,820
going around the world talking to people
all companies all sizes are trying to

66
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:13,520
find ways to get more transparency so
people can see

67
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:17,000
the risks they have a trailer help build
relevant tools

68
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,200
so like my virtualization book was
basically saying a lot of these old

69
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:22,150
concepts are good but you need new tools

70
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:24,980
API's are more important than ever
management consoles more important than

71
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:25,310
ever

72
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:28,610
so use the right tool for the job fire
also do you much good

73
00:03:28,610 --> 00:03:32,250
if you can see into the networks behind
the virtualization layer saving big data

74
00:03:32,250 --> 00:03:35,049
have a firewall around your big date
environment all the risk is inside it

75
00:03:35,049 --> 00:03:36,180
doesn't matter if I'll

76
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:39,390
really and the resilience is seems to
matter more than

77
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:43,170
ever before so people just don't trust
systems that they go down

78
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:47,610
people expect an always-on always ready
always accessible environment so that's

79
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:48,650
pretty much what I do

80
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:52,299
and I always run into this dilemma now
which I call the Sam Jackson audience

81
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:52,820
dilemma

82
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:57,510
so basically breaks down to two parts
and you're either a one more time error

83
00:03:57,510 --> 00:03:58,040
or an

84
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,400
option every no talking about alright so
when wertheimer's are

85
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,390
stop talking about big data one more
time I'm sick of hearing about this are

86
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:08,730
you know everything there is to know

87
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:12,190
just give me the really hard core
technical details not get out here

88
00:04:12,190 --> 00:04:16,150
the others are Abydos movie this another
sage action movie

89
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:19,709
are obscure 96 ish

90
00:04:19,709 --> 00:04:23,500
way says he already knows we make an
assumption to make an asset me an option

91
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:28,220
so the ideas either like don't make any
assumptions tell me everything

92
00:04:28,220 --> 00:04:32,120
explain to me how MapReduce works or I
know everything and it's like hard in

93
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:32,389
the

94
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:35,780
Big Data world so how many people here
run Hadoop environments themselves have

95
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,220
set up and run had given by matts

96
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,910
today okay just couple people and how
many people have

97
00:04:40,910 --> 00:04:44,569
successfully entered a Hadoop
environments will set up use did

98
00:04:44,569 --> 00:04:47,650
run a job few people get

99
00:04:47,650 --> 00:04:51,569
so I commit to any assumptions I do have
a ton to slide so I have like a hundred

100
00:04:51,569 --> 00:04:54,889
slides and it does not include how
MapReduce work so as a quick

101
00:04:54,889 --> 00:04:59,159
intro basically with MapReduce does the
way the concept of Hadoop

102
00:04:59,159 --> 00:05:02,710
is just distributed computing its to
make jobs easier

103
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:05,810
by reducing the load to individual
components

104
00:05:05,810 --> 00:05:09,270
so if each one of these rows for example
was a resource

105
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:12,240
I would ask the person on the end of the
row to count the number of people on the

106
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,199
road with glasses

107
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:16,190
that I would go through and say all the
people the into the road give me your

108
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:16,539
account

109
00:05:16,539 --> 00:05:20,120
that's it so I've now basically map this
whole audience

110
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:24,150
in two rows and the nasty each had a bro
to give me the count which saves me a

111
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:26,580
lot of time even better I can ask the
person the for the row

112
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:31,310
to map although counts from the head of
the line so now I've just got to people

113
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:33,650
to talk to the give me the results from
this entire audience

114
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:37,190
make sense that's MapReduce right that's
a dupe

115
00:05:37,190 --> 00:05:42,150
so let me tell you a little bit more
about where it came from so 1996

116
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:46,310
there there's a guy talking about how he
could take a 24 no bail of cluster

117
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:49,659
and he could make the equivalent with
sixty thousand dollars

118
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:53,960
over a ten million dollar supercomputer
this was the genesis of Hadoop this is

119
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,310
where it came from beta of

120
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:58,849
and was called Babel because in the bear
wolf poem

121
00:05:58,849 --> 00:06:02,020
this old Celtic poem here the poll
actually says

122
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:05,690
the translation I think its Danish 30
men's have to the grass but his hand

123
00:06:05,690 --> 00:06:09,340
so Mayo of was so powerful he could do

124
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:13,159
about 30 men's work by himself that's
the whole idea right so it's been

125
00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:16,620
coopted quite a bit by cool and a lot of
other people try to take credit for

126
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:21,870
what to do biz I'm really by 2006 became
open so that really matter

127
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:25,330
where it came from but the Genesis is
people trying to do great things with

128
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:26,169
little bit money

129
00:06:26,169 --> 00:06:29,909
and so today we don't talk about the
same way

130
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:31,750
a beer at what rate used to mean we're
done

131
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:35,650
array of inexpensive disks right now its
independent disks because no one cares

132
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:37,520
they're inexpensive all the stern
expensive

133
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:41,160
same thing with a dupe its low latency
fault tolerance and scalability

134
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,180
no one talks about how cheap it is
anymore because all distributed

135
00:06:44,180 --> 00:06:45,260
computing is cheap

136
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:48,640
essentially we've been in a race to the
bottom and commoditization

137
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,510
helps so we're looking for low latency
fault tolerance capability what I'm here

138
00:06:52,510 --> 00:06:53,740
to talk to you about today

139
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:57,830
is how there's latency there's a lot of
faults and it doesn't really scale well

140
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,730
because I've limitations a lot a risk

141
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:03,400
like like building premature you build a
castle wall you can scale much

142
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,480
because this is your town is outside the
castle wall yet to build another castle

143
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:06,910
wall

144
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:10,060
and another in he cities today up twenty
million people

145
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:13,090
can't be sustained by the castle model
right so

146
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:16,840
that's where the problems running into
alright so here's today our data like

147
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,610
definition

148
00:07:17,610 --> 00:07:20,900
we're moving away from big data as a
term in towards data Lake

149
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:25,140
the ideas you have streams a date all
pooling into this thing and do analysis

150
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:29,620
I i don't like the 3v definition which
car to keep up with in 2001

151
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:33,230
mostly cuz I'm not a huge fan to garner
but also because I've been trying to

152
00:07:33,230 --> 00:07:35,900
stick the fourth be in for a couple
years and no one let me

153
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:38,900
so the 43 for me is more ability and

154
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,460
it just didn't make a lot of sense to
people I was trying to say that if you

155
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:43,400
have so much data it becomes vulnerable

156
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:46,860
that then you know you have big data so
now I think it's more popular to be

157
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,200
called re identification

158
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:52,160
which is a give so much data you can be
ratified then you have big data

159
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,200
so for example you tell people you can't
have a zip code

160
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,350
in your data because that sensitive or
birth date that's for its been proven

161
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,890
that about eighty percent of the time
you can read into by people who have

162
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:03,280
just one little data point

163
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,140
beyond if you have three total but you
have one that sensitive so you put your

164
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:07,930
zip code

165
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:11,520
or your postcode whatever you call it
where you live and

166
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,630
they knew it also have in that data set
the name a doctor

167
00:08:14,630 --> 00:08:18,700
so near the doctor of course is somebody
who works at a parts

168
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,840
particular zip code erred postcode so I
can really identify people bite

169
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:27,130
figure out where the doctor works right
so now if I know your doctor I can just

170
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:29,620
simply one step away with another
dataset figure out

171
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:32,930
the same thing you're trying prevent me
from knowing so I add enough data bases

172
00:08:32,930 --> 00:08:36,360
enough data sources at some point I can
read and if I you

173
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,959
and that's one big data becomes big data
because you have that we had an occasion

174
00:08:39,959 --> 00:08:41,490
issue I called the four R's

175
00:08:41,490 --> 00:08:44,630
I came up with that on Talk Like a
Pirate Day so

176
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:49,110
that's not just by coincidence so by
2017

177
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:52,720
prediction is why most people it's gonna
be the norm for data management because

178
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,529
I can't monetization like it's becoming
less expensive a day to Lake its

179
00:08:56,529 --> 00:08:59,440
consolidated who doesn't want
centralized and cheap

180
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:03,209
by just this is the future of technology
and so let me give you a couple call

181
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:05,930
examples of this go through this quickly
that I'm working on just give you a

182
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:06,540
sense

183
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:10,459
how powerful big date is becoming I'm
working on a clear water projects where

184
00:09:10,459 --> 00:09:11,670
fifth the water and the

185
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:14,810
in the world the the water that's
freshwater

186
00:09:14,810 --> 00:09:17,910
company Amazon it turns out that a lot
has been polluted by things like

187
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:18,750
petroleum

188
00:09:18,750 --> 00:09:23,310
and digging so if we could put sensors
out there who can map all the places in

189
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:26,399
the Amazon that water has been
contaminated and we can monitor and then

190
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,750
restore the quality the water

191
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,570
we can make a huge impact on how do you
do that you have to put sensors in the

192
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:31,140
jungle

193
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:34,360
and you have to within 24 hours test the
water cuz the water degradation

194
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:37,390
and with the port in to keep it safe
because a lot of pressure points for

195
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:38,019
people to

196
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:41,579
corrupts the results right people want
to make sure that your results don't say

197
00:09:41,579 --> 00:09:42,760
what you think they should say

198
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,570
so it's an example I'm here's an example
above a group that's trying to reduce

199
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:47,440
orphanages

200
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,440
I work for the recently not directly but
indirectly

201
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,010
other trying to figure out why there so
many orphans that still have parents

202
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:57,500
I like at the parents become more
sustainable families and so we need to

203
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,640
put sensors out again very politically
charged

204
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:04,519
subject so how do I collect data in
remote villages about so orphanages have

205
00:10:04,519 --> 00:10:08,310
volunteers so it's like a distributed
problem above data collection to solve a

206
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:08,860
major

207
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:12,100
risk issue and I'm actually interested
in this i love you know you know but a

208
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:15,730
lot orphans end up doing strange things
like a suicide combat like suicide

209
00:10:15,730 --> 00:10:17,269
bombing missions in the end up getting

210
00:10:17,269 --> 00:10:20,760
recruited into military conflict and
strange things we wanna get

211
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:23,610
the level of organs down by
understanding why they're so much

212
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:24,230
conflict

213
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:27,769
another interesting project I'm working
on United Nations war crimes commission

214
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:32,579
we had forty nine trials in nuremberg
and tokyo to earn a trial surrounds the

215
00:10:32,579 --> 00:10:33,600
the time at which

216
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,190
post-cold-war with you know we did go so
for example that turns out from 4348

217
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:39,820
there are about 2,000 trials

218
00:10:39,820 --> 00:10:43,600
that were secretly just been and
uncovered so if we can get that data in

219
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,339
mine it and then provide that resource
to lawyers

220
00:10:46,339 --> 00:10:49,519
then they can actually do with
classification working properly

221
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,850
they can go figure out you know what
would you do if there's a rape would you

222
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:54,310
do if there's a

223
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:58,060
genocidal acts because lawyers base
everything on precedents and there's

224
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,760
very little precedent as the point here

225
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,000
but I can generate precedent and so big
data becomes knowledge

226
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,130
teaches people you know how to make
decisions more informed decisions

227
00:11:06,130 --> 00:11:09,709
so here's some more contemporary
examples our traffic

228
00:11:09,709 --> 00:11:13,070
you wanna know where to go and how some
cars now telling you what speed to go in

229
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:14,380
order to avoid red lights

230
00:11:14,380 --> 00:11:17,899
summer telling telling you how to the
new Volvo tells you how to avoid an

231
00:11:17,899 --> 00:11:18,540
accident

232
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:21,649
just automatically redirect you every
time there's a traffic incident now this

233
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:23,290
is an actual architecture built by

234
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:28,220
pivotal which is a a big party BMC so in
just all the data and then surfaces

235
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,600
these cool graphics

236
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:33,579
so you can see what traffic looks like
I'm energy out of you know but

237
00:11:33,579 --> 00:11:37,910
you know each turbine sensor has a lot
of sensor so it goes back to the IRT

238
00:11:37,910 --> 00:11:38,490
model

239
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:42,850
so we're generating up Library of
Congress print collection every month

240
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:46,529
in terms of data because its 500
gigabytes per day for each blade and you

241
00:11:46,529 --> 00:11:48,399
can see many blades are not typical
turban

242
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:53,639
may be familiar with his turban seen it
before yeah your place this with a

243
00:11:53,639 --> 00:11:56,560
a big win like you see out here
sometimes they can get as many as 30,000

244
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,380
sensors

245
00:11:57,380 --> 00:12:00,620
why cuz they're reading in it's like
weather forecasting the transportation

246
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,800
it's it's reading in the

247
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:05,240
directional Aaron or to figure out which
way to turn the blade just like sailing

248
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,660
so you try to figure out the optimal to
get the most energy so

249
00:12:08,660 --> 00:12:11,800
tons a day to be incurred created by all
sorts of sources

250
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,970
this is where you might see the security
conference which is the RC model taking

251
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,300
in all your sensors

252
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,050
and putting it someplace storing it so
you can do analysis to find your attack

253
00:12:20,050 --> 00:12:20,630
vectors

254
00:12:20,630 --> 00:12:24,019
I'm they have one in my not tell you
enough but if you have all of them

255
00:12:24,019 --> 00:12:27,890
it tells you where your threats are
right so I guess you going through these

256
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:28,540
all day

257
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:32,040
are couple funny ones here is a social
analysis of tweets

258
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,170
in San Francisco and it's hard to see in
here but basically

259
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:39,199
the red iPhone green android you see a
pattern or the Android people are on

260
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:39,940
ferries

261
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:43,899
that's like the ferry terminal and that
a ferry path across the city and the Red

262
00:12:43,899 --> 00:12:45,930
a scattered evenly across the the bay

263
00:12:45,930 --> 00:12:50,199
which to me says rich Apple yacht owners
verses pour Android

264
00:12:50,199 --> 00:12:53,579
ferry writers right so

265
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:57,339
instant knowledge I if you look at the
Downtown San Francisco area

266
00:12:57,339 --> 00:13:00,829
you see the BlackBerry users
congregational circle uses for like a

267
00:13:00,829 --> 00:13:01,850
half circle there

268
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:05,430
even a guess what is going on over here
in San Francisco why so many BlackBerry

269
00:13:05,430 --> 00:13:08,440
users to congregate

270
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:12,210
but blackberry Office close but not
quite

271
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:16,170
government User Conference I don't think
about that

272
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:20,530
no but city hall that was my guess is
also a federal building but that's

273
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,410
actually further left quite a bit for
the left

274
00:13:22,410 --> 00:13:26,020
I to get outta like federal map to map
all the federal building's

275
00:13:26,020 --> 00:13:31,720
I nope they actually turns out to be the
Apple Store

276
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:33,800
Twitter asked me how I figured this out
by the way after a

277
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,570
a show this to twitter they're like we
get this data

278
00:13:37,570 --> 00:13:40,930
so its public debt I just use the
public's or so here's whether anybody

279
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:41,750
know this is

280
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:45,870
this is a weather mapping system it's a
radar system that

281
00:13:45,870 --> 00:13:49,170
track so what kinda storm is this
basically what's happening here let me

282
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:49,540
know

283
00:13:49,540 --> 00:13:53,210
that insects

284
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:56,870
so apparently global warming is creating
this insect buoyant so these are

285
00:13:56,870 --> 00:14:00,280
mayflies exploding and their pictures
there to discussing even show you

286
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:04,550
love towns just covered in insects so
this is an explosion insects one night

287
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:08,110
picking up on it so it basically tells
you want something strange that when you

288
00:14:08,110 --> 00:14:08,850
have and

289
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:11,610
a detection system you think about
security detection and you to

290
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:12,800
false-positive like this

291
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,810
it like throws off your ready I go I
gotta be a huge storm coming out of the

292
00:14:15,810 --> 00:14:16,310
river

293
00:14:16,310 --> 00:14:19,880
which makes no sense alright so quickly

294
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:23,040
any guesses what this is you know which
side is random

295
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,040
looking at that insects there is a hit
there

296
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:30,030
how do people say the left side is
random you'll see the right side is

297
00:14:30,030 --> 00:14:30,460
random

298
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:35,070
as a turn to the left side is random
because the connections

299
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:38,630
on the right side the insects actively
trying to keep space from each other

300
00:14:38,630 --> 00:14:41,730
and so it actually comes from New
Zealand you can go on the salt or

301
00:14:41,730 --> 00:14:45,260
utica a little boat in like it's a top
at the cave the glow worms

302
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,560
seek get interesting things may look a
lot today to but

303
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:51,680
are on the same level this is the
bombing map of

304
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,720
London by the germans and if you dig
down actually looks

305
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,250
very like non-random I guess in a way

306
00:14:58,250 --> 00:15:01,250
because it's like we can see even
distribution here but the further you

307
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:03,790
dig down the more it starts look random
cause our actual very

308
00:15:03,790 --> 00:15:07,490
clear lines and patterns so apparently
the Germans are mapped out exactly where

309
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:08,500
the bomb every run

310
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:11,530
mice a live in London so I went lookin
looked at my house it's an interesting

311
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:12,200
thing to do

312
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:16,530
in bomb site you can do it live they do
this today actually so this is San

313
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:17,240
Francisco

314
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:20,340
this is insurance companies big did
analysis of where the bombs will hit San

315
00:15:20,340 --> 00:15:21,890
Francisco author terrorist attacks

316
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:25,860
and so they rank them by severity red
obviously most extreme

317
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,760
I'm gonna goes on and on so this is what
a blast looks like this big debt

318
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:30,310
analysis a blast radius

319
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:33,370
after terrorist attack like which way
the bomb blasts go into urban versus

320
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:34,320
rural area

321
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,320
and then this is what smallpox infection
looks like as it spreads through the

322
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:38,710
middle

323
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:42,020
the midwest the United States that's
Chicago Illinois I'm

324
00:15:42,020 --> 00:15:44,620
and also Saint Louis and so you can
imagine they're doing this already with

325
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,590
people that we talk about a lot but
actually this insurance companies are

326
00:15:47,590 --> 00:15:49,150
very accurately predicting

327
00:15:49,150 --> 00:15:50,050
these outbreaks or

328
00:15:50,050 --> 00:15:53,970
they spread using big house I could go
through millions examples this is health

329
00:15:53,970 --> 00:15:55,410
care this is the amount of %uh

330
00:15:55,410 --> 00:16:00,700
data that's in each ejaculation of sperm
so 31 petabytes a second updater

331
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:04,070
which is Google's only processing 20
petabytes a day

332
00:16:04,070 --> 00:16:09,850
so think about that for a second I'm
actually on that point 244 trillion

333
00:16:09,850 --> 00:16:11,860
gigabytes of data in human cells

334
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:15,760
so you can see why you know talk about
big data analysis and health care gets

335
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,190
into this like while so like

336
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:20,550
holy grail of way to really understand
everything we do the math

337
00:16:20,550 --> 00:16:24,380
others annable a prediction chart they
were of anybody know why a bowl

338
00:16:24,380 --> 00:16:25,320
predictions are of

339
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:30,079
is really interesting so it's called the
gödel project is a guy

340
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:33,730
his very ambitiously trying to suck in
all the information in the world all the

341
00:16:33,730 --> 00:16:37,360
conversations to try to see where
bowlers first any missed it

342
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,519
well as English is an English tool

343
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,839
and a lot of the infections were in
french-speaking countries right so I

344
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:46,410
miss that

345
00:16:46,410 --> 00:16:52,699
so adding French hopefully the Germans
don't have a disease next

346
00:16:52,699 --> 00:16:56,709
with the bottom line here sort spooky
because if you take this analogy as

347
00:16:56,709 --> 00:17:00,339
you know big data he wants the literally
listen to every single whisper in

348
00:17:00,339 --> 00:17:03,379
every corner every party the globe in
order predict the next disease

349
00:17:03,379 --> 00:17:07,409
verses a distributed model which would
be like a why don't you

350
00:17:07,409 --> 00:17:10,709
have a conversation with somebody and
through are a hierarchy

351
00:17:10,709 --> 00:17:14,699
like the actual detectable with you the
hierarchy so the local

352
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:18,100
healthcare like a hospital said hey we
have a problem or to the hospital so

353
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,490
that a problem to the government the
governor report tonight

354
00:17:20,490 --> 00:17:23,829
patients rights that a hierarchical
local distributor based system

355
00:17:23,829 --> 00:17:27,039
and this is a top-down like listening to
everything will figure out where it is

356
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:27,860
first so

357
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:31,330
he was slower than the distributed
system which ironically

358
00:17:31,330 --> 00:17:33,970
he's running on a Hadoop like
environment which is a distributed

359
00:17:33,970 --> 00:17:35,200
hierarchical system

360
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,419
right so is almost like answer his own
question I'm

361
00:17:38,419 --> 00:17:41,789
is not running a mainframe so here's
2009 dual

362
00:17:41,789 --> 00:17:45,940
said that they detected flew faster and
their flu project was heralded as you

363
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:48,750
know two weeks ahead heralded as the
future detecting flu

364
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:52,159
anybody follow this and we see this
every

365
00:17:52,159 --> 00:17:55,520
know that it was wrong for three
consistent years so today we look back

366
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,419
on and go wow they really were way off
but it came out as we can predict faster

367
00:17:59,419 --> 00:18:02,750
and it's because there's a rig
algorithmic accountability has been one

368
00:18:02,750 --> 00:18:03,610
of the problems

369
00:18:03,610 --> 00:18:07,260
it's sort of like a it's a box inside
the box things are happening

370
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:10,260
and we don't know exactly what's
happening so this is the allegory for

371
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:13,900
the prom with Hadoop you trust these
systems and then the wrong

372
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:17,070
a lot of times so here's the audience
operating system

373
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:21,690
anybody heard that axiom so if you're on
Facebook you're like run an ad you wanna

374
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:24,080
make sure advertising to real people
with real

375
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:27,510
needs not just fake bogus accounts and
and facebook says you know they're

376
00:18:27,510 --> 00:18:30,650
keeping down 25 percent fraud or
something which is ridiculously good

377
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:34,429
versus other systems they're just open
so they have this audience operating

378
00:18:34,429 --> 00:18:35,039
system

379
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:39,370
type analysis to prove that somebody is
real but then if you go do analysis of

380
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:39,950
the data

381
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:43,850
this is a woman who look at our own data
and she challenged in said I can't

382
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:45,510
possibly be 26 years old

383
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:50,450
with two children who are 14 and 17 you
think that the system would be able to

384
00:18:50,450 --> 00:18:53,250
detect that because those are simple
numbers it's simple math

385
00:18:53,250 --> 00:18:56,860
it should be able to know itself but it
doesn't right humanistic a look at it

386
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,090
right so biologically impossible

387
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:03,059
here's a quick quiz on knowledge in the
past

388
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:06,559
so anybody know the disposable diapers
story by Arthur little

389
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:09,629
you know you know why we use disposable
diapers instead a cloth diapers

390
00:19:09,629 --> 00:19:13,470
so he was able to manipulate the data
and the news marketing to convince

391
00:19:13,470 --> 00:19:14,809
people is environmentally

392
00:19:14,809 --> 00:19:18,820
better we use less water it's like
better to put into

393
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:22,289
landfill that it is to use a a a towel
or a diaper that scoff

394
00:19:22,289 --> 00:19:25,049
so it's basically a manipulation at the
marketing data to prove to people

395
00:19:25,049 --> 00:19:26,029
something that

396
00:19:26,029 --> 00:19:29,919
basically isn't true we found since then
the people who go back and look at his

397
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:31,570
analysis like this makes no sense

398
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:33,980
there's been a lot of criticism over but
it's too late the market's already

399
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,539
pushed towards disposable diapers

400
00:19:35,539 --> 00:19:39,029
a frozen coke 0 spent too much time on
but basically Burger King had sixty five

401
00:19:39,029 --> 00:19:40,789
million dollars on the line we're gonna
invest

402
00:19:40,789 --> 00:19:44,429
and Coke was saying wow all the students
are buying this

403
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:47,490
frozen coke you probably wanna have it
never Burger King

404
00:19:47,490 --> 00:19:50,700
and it turned out that somebody was
paying students

405
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:54,440
at all the local schools to go to Burger
King and buy frozen coke literally

406
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,490
giving them about your

407
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:59,090
so that would turn up the results so its
wholly bogus results and then finally

408
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:00,429
bacon my favorite example

409
00:20:00,429 --> 00:20:04,639
one of them I'll at anyone heard of the
beach the company and Edward

410
00:20:04,639 --> 00:20:09,240
bernie is he kinda invented PR invented
manipulation of the media and and

411
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,740
marketing so the reason we bacon today
my argument is and a lot of people say

412
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:13,139
this

413
00:20:13,139 --> 00:20:16,169
is that the case is he was able to
control the

414
00:20:16,169 --> 00:20:19,720
the consent to the masses to eat bacon
before then there really wasn't much

415
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:23,549
consumption bacon and the the pork
industry was in decline and Beechnut who

416
00:20:23,549 --> 00:20:25,830
was selling a lot of pork wanted a way
to sell more

417
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:30,279
so healing a study that said nine outta
10 doctors say a big breakfast is good

418
00:20:30,279 --> 00:20:30,710
for you

419
00:20:30,710 --> 00:20:34,619
to bacon and that every thought leonard
and doctors say bacon is good for you

420
00:20:34,619 --> 00:20:38,779
and then that turn the market diamonds
are other example archaeological apples

421
00:20:38,779 --> 00:20:39,470
were basically

422
00:20:39,470 --> 00:20:43,159
marketing since the turn of the century
has been trying to get data

423
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:46,289
to turn things into knowledge and the
knowledge becomes like

424
00:20:46,289 --> 00:20:50,059
big big money purchasing decisions so it
was a dupe is really doing

425
00:20:50,059 --> 00:20:54,159
to do is getting people knowledge to
change everything changed people's ideas

426
00:20:54,159 --> 00:20:54,889
elections

427
00:20:54,889 --> 00:20:58,649
so that the scary part there was
security capabilities up the data lakes

428
00:20:58,649 --> 00:20:59,460
are embryonic

429
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:02,409
as a gardener quote which has gotten a
lot of press but they're basically

430
00:21:02,409 --> 00:21:04,590
saying hey we're still in the early
stages of security

431
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:08,690
on the system's we need to trust the
most and the model that we see a lot

432
00:21:08,690 --> 00:21:12,580
is if you store everything I like the
CIA quote which is you know you can

433
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,139
connect dots if you don't have dots

434
00:21:14,139 --> 00:21:16,300
so this store all the dots

435
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:19,200
and so they can connect them and if you
can do the right analysis which could be

436
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,250
trying to convince people to

437
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:23,290
eat bacon if not bad for them by telling
what's good for them because some doctor

438
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:24,530
said so in the analysis

439
00:21:24,530 --> 00:21:27,740
that's winning that's winning the
marketplace so you can build the right

440
00:21:27,740 --> 00:21:29,310
tools for the right people

441
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:33,140
and get them to use it and it's all
based on this idea analysis being like

442
00:21:33,140 --> 00:21:34,330
looking in the rearview mirror

443
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:37,560
I find that funny because when you look
at the rear view mirror

444
00:21:37,560 --> 00:21:41,680
me know where was invented big hit here
race cars

445
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:45,480
so the first rear view mirror was the
the Marmon wasp

446
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:49,730
in 1911 so wasn't as Indy 500 race and
the guy put a rear view mirror on

447
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:51,210
because I could get rid of his passenger

448
00:21:51,210 --> 00:21:53,760
the other guys to look behind was a
mechanic basically it would look behind

449
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:54,810
the cars coming

450
00:21:54,810 --> 00:21:58,030
in order win the race you gotta know
where the competitors are so the rear

451
00:21:58,030 --> 00:21:58,800
view mirror was a

452
00:21:58,800 --> 00:22:02,350
a winning tools away just like we're
talking up Hadoop it's a way to win

453
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:07,420
everything the market but I looks really
at the idea race cars I thought wow okay

454
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:10,370
so if they do business giant powerful
engine that makes us so much more

455
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,120
powerful

456
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:14,610
then is there a risk situation like in
race cars

457
00:22:14,610 --> 00:22:18,160
where if you lose control you lose
everything actually turns out to be true

458
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,620
we blow but you can buy me it's pretty
devastating if you put a lot of trust in

459
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:21,870
it

460
00:22:21,870 --> 00:22:25,520
so there's a real picture guy getting
thrown out of his race car he was only

461
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,130
bruised

462
00:22:26,130 --> 00:22:29,180
but but this art but see built in the
race is eventually

463
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:33,030
and it would take about 45 years to go
from my rearview mirrors

464
00:22:33,030 --> 00:22:36,310
to seat belt so kinda curious how long
it'll take us to get from this rear view

465
00:22:36,310 --> 00:22:36,830
mirror

466
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:40,410
Hadoop to the seat belt to dupe great
where we actually protect

467
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:43,440
data and if I look at the seat belts

468
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,870
it turns out from 1885 to 1970

469
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:51,040
or early 58 when they first went into
use there's quite a bit I'm

470
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,170
and the the turning points were
criticisms over engineering

471
00:22:54,170 --> 00:22:58,130
so we really need is the equivalent of
criticisms of Engineering in Hadoop

472
00:22:58,130 --> 00:23:01,460
like criticize a dupe and talk about
prevention is the only cure for bad

473
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,110
Hadoop

474
00:23:02,110 --> 00:23:06,130
rates is to you article seem to be that
what people think seat belts are just

475
00:23:06,130 --> 00:23:09,670
because regulators but regulators got
the idea for people pointing out how bad

476
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:11,420
things were and this turned out to be
doctors

477
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:14,620
so who are the equivalent today I've up
a new doctors

478
00:23:14,620 --> 00:23:17,880
right these are the things that have
doctors would be saying but you have

479
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:19,270
immutability by design

480
00:23:19,270 --> 00:23:22,220
so you should be able to change files
but in fact you can go change whatever

481
00:23:22,220 --> 00:23:23,430
you want pretty much anywhere

482
00:23:23,430 --> 00:23:27,260
happens all the time and resiliency is
by design but we're finding outages all

483
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:27,730
the time

484
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:28,530
so even

485
00:23:28,530 --> 00:23:31,720
amazon says you have any availability
zone but then the Availability Zone goes

486
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:34,750
down they say what doesn't mean
availability of its availability zone

487
00:23:34,750 --> 00:23:37,730
it means you have to connect multiple
availability zones if you want a bill

488
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:39,160
ability in your availability zone

489
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:44,860
and so we get security mode by design
you can turn on Hadoop security

490
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:48,480
nominee view security but his security
literally has like us which you can flip

491
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,180
and say ok am in security mode but it's
not actually secure

492
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:54,850
weird like availability zones and so

493
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:58,420
traction a complex a ecosystems our
problem and that is not

494
00:23:58,420 --> 00:24:01,950
terribly usable for not very technical
it's a lot of Java in fact a lot of the

495
00:24:01,950 --> 00:24:04,330
tools coming out now which like aP's
essentially

496
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:07,890
are just so you're at the touch Java so
it's like taps for aP's

497
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:11,420
because people want to deal with it a
lot other thread assumptions in 2009

498
00:24:11,420 --> 00:24:14,010
that came out the original security
document were based on

499
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:17,730
no man in the mills it's really hard to
do if you let people into a printer and

500
00:24:17,730 --> 00:24:18,840
they have open access

501
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:22,670
I gonna stop someone for sending the
middle row that's not protected that it

502
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,050
assumes that users don't have root

503
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:27,070
very difficult to do because that
standard open fireman

504
00:24:27,070 --> 00:24:30,780
guess everybody root level authority you
have to work really hard to get the

505
00:24:30,780 --> 00:24:31,460
levels down

506
00:24:31,460 --> 00:24:34,990
and then there's no net controls another
assumption which doesn't make sense if

507
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:35,790
you already have

508
00:24:35,790 --> 00:24:38,980
a somebody with Rick control of course
they can control the neck so

509
00:24:38,980 --> 00:24:42,650
pretty hard at go with those threats
options the ecosystems are pretty

510
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:43,260
complex

511
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:46,920
if I was the describe the Duke to you is
a nutshell what it looks like

512
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,810
this is sort of how it works you have a
storage layer which I go to detail after

513
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:51,970
if you want to know how it works

514
00:24:51,970 --> 00:24:55,400
and then you have a computer where which
is like your PC or any device your

515
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:56,680
laptop it's like you have

516
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:59,660
a hard drive and then you have a
processor but that's just distribute

517
00:24:59,660 --> 00:25:01,210
over tens of thousands of systems

518
00:25:01,210 --> 00:25:04,810
so you're trying to basically secure the
way would secure inside your machine

519
00:25:04,810 --> 00:25:08,450
across a wide distribution network and
then on top of that you have your app's

520
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:11,450
and the app's give database access you
can scripts

521
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:15,960
on top a bit I you can stream data I get
a couple examples here in a second

522
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:19,210
and on the far right is the security
model which if this looks familiar

523
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:22,860
the to the PC model it's because that
would be where the antivirus it's like

524
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:25,110
after you've built your entire
architecture now you can install

525
00:25:25,110 --> 00:25:25,950
anti-virus

526
00:25:25,950 --> 00:25:28,750
and I'll be this thing they just takes
your lawyer security which turns out to

527
00:25:28,750 --> 00:25:30,160
not really take your security

528
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:34,230
and twenty years later we realized why
would a cock up that was so

529
00:25:34,230 --> 00:25:38,110
there are a lot of projects which are
worth mentioning here Knox Rhino century

530
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:41,389
X a secure Falcon also have independent
running on there

531
00:25:41,389 --> 00:25:45,950
own and it's a quagmire over discourse
right now what they really gonna do

532
00:25:45,950 --> 00:25:49,209
so here's an example %uh scoop

533
00:25:49,209 --> 00:25:52,359
is the just like the name za implies
scooping it up

534
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:56,099
and putting it into the environment so
that's great you know you wanna scoop

535
00:25:56,099 --> 00:25:59,419
like my single database that is also
today to scoop into Hadoop

536
00:25:59,419 --> 00:26:03,089
part make it part of your daily other
original version was ac- alive people in

537
00:26:03,089 --> 00:26:05,359
like command line interface so they made
a

538
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:09,070
graphical version called scoop to which
is not compatible with security

539
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:12,399
mode so if you want to use the cooler
newer version you have to turn of

540
00:26:12,399 --> 00:26:14,099
security in your entire Hadoop
environments

541
00:26:14,099 --> 00:26:17,829
so it's pretty big compromise another
example is storm

542
00:26:17,829 --> 00:26:22,570
anybody her storm so if you wanna do
like really fast and all sorts of data

543
00:26:22,570 --> 00:26:26,450
likes a tweet so I see who's following
tweet sandwich URL's are getting really

544
00:26:26,450 --> 00:26:27,589
between the most

545
00:26:27,589 --> 00:26:30,559
you can't just do a scoop because I
would be static data and by the time you

546
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:31,889
look at it after processing

547
00:26:31,889 --> 00:26:35,589
who knows how many new URL's are being
followed so stream Armin storm is going

548
00:26:35,589 --> 00:26:37,159
to stream that all the time

549
00:26:37,159 --> 00:26:40,249
and every time you get an update its
gonna tell you like oh wow there's an

550
00:26:40,249 --> 00:26:40,729
update

551
00:26:40,729 --> 00:26:44,619
and snowstorms than she does this it has
the spouts and then these bolts

552
00:26:44,619 --> 00:26:48,099
that's what a characteristic of a dupe
is really bad naming and really bad

553
00:26:48,099 --> 00:26:49,629
icons and like graphics

554
00:26:49,629 --> 00:26:53,820
so spouts in Bolton its it's terrible
but anyway

555
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:57,849
the you use storm and you can get these
real time updates and the really fast

556
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:01,739
but again it's designed for that
identify me the highlight enough in the

557
00:27:01,739 --> 00:27:04,269
it's designed for scaleable
fault-tolerant

558
00:27:04,269 --> 00:27:08,089
use data right fall color is built in
it's the architecture for fault

559
00:27:08,089 --> 00:27:09,700
tolerance because as multiple

560
00:27:09,700 --> 00:27:13,859
a services running but it turns out that
it actually feels really is really

561
00:27:13,859 --> 00:27:14,379
brittle

562
00:27:14,379 --> 00:27:17,529
and if you do weird things to it is this
one person said it breaks

563
00:27:17,529 --> 00:27:20,539
and a focus for upcoming releases will
be security

564
00:27:20,539 --> 00:27:24,179
so in future or build security into our
fault tolerant system

565
00:27:24,179 --> 00:27:27,719
I'm in fact here's what my favorite
quotes you know what I can get it to

566
00:27:27,719 --> 00:27:30,779
work I just do it are minus RF on the
entire storm directory

567
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:33,809
and that seems to work to get started
again any

568
00:27:33,809 --> 00:27:36,659
any problems with that in a multi-tenant
environment if you're deleting the

569
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:38,820
entire storm directory for everybody

570
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:42,469
yeah he says makes really do this and
developing a bar with the yuan

571
00:27:42,469 --> 00:27:45,589
don't don't ever try to do don't ever
try to fix this is the fix but I'll try

572
00:27:45,589 --> 00:27:46,979
to use this in a production environment

573
00:27:46,979 --> 00:27:51,859
alright so psyched about seven ways to
kill hope for the future an overview

574
00:27:51,859 --> 00:27:52,970
I

575
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:55,760
will go pretty quickly through these so
first so I believe

576
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,020
you know and this is or using from
capitals model I believe we should look

577
00:27:59,020 --> 00:27:59,980
at it and steps

578
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:02,700
so you have the in just after pulling
data and you're storing the data

579
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:03,440
somewhere

580
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,840
with Chad self is a big security issue
you're analyzing the data

581
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:10,200
which I showed you can be manipulated
into weird results and the new surface

582
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,220
into these visuals which are coarser

583
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:15,770
suspects security and then you take
action upon it which you upset the map

584
00:28:15,770 --> 00:28:16,490
back to

585
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:19,830
accurate results and security so my
argument is that we should be able to do

586
00:28:19,830 --> 00:28:22,030
at least six things to protect it

587
00:28:22,030 --> 00:28:24,980
and so I'm reading a book about it and
these are the six things in advocating

588
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:25,560
in the book

589
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:29,310
and then the seventh because I forcing a
missed talk seven things to do

590
00:28:29,310 --> 00:28:33,250
would be GRC on top of that which i
think is important but

591
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:38,870
this is really the best audience for it
so quickly through GRC yeah I loved your

592
00:28:38,870 --> 00:28:39,550
Shiba

593
00:28:39,550 --> 00:28:43,220
you have to be careful we talk to about
it so here's an example zombies versus

594
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:46,790
terrorism this is an actual honest to
god insurance chart that I pulled from a

595
00:28:46,790 --> 00:28:47,770
big data company

596
00:28:47,770 --> 00:28:51,060
so they're doing over you know with
return period

597
00:28:51,060 --> 00:28:55,280
loss by parallax over 5,000 years the
loss from terrorism

598
00:28:55,280 --> 00:29:00,600
is quite high was the loss from zombies
is quite low we know why

599
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:03,950
and I guess is songs are predictable

600
00:29:03,950 --> 00:29:08,310
zombies are you there zombies are not
zombies worst terrorists like everywhere

601
00:29:08,310 --> 00:29:10,680
anyone if you could be a terrorist for
different organizations and doing

602
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:13,450
different things and connections are
very fluid and so the loss from

603
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:15,860
terrorism can be very very difficult to
like avoid

604
00:29:15,860 --> 00:29:19,870
and very very complicated and this is a
personal to be honest I change the names

605
00:29:19,870 --> 00:29:20,670
that really zombies

606
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:23,800
but something equivalent is obvious this
is a personal issue mind a lot of people

607
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:24,980
talk about the zombie

608
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:28,970
issue in security information security
and I'm like not hard you should the

609
00:29:28,970 --> 00:29:30,530
Rideau there is always a not

610
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:33,530
it's like the simplest thing ever so for
a GRC mode

611
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:37,150
going back to my experience with the
guys building robots for Ford planets

612
00:29:37,150 --> 00:29:40,890
right if you have robots to have a
little bit intelligence then they can do

613
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:43,740
certain things but ultimately the end up
in traffic jams for example

614
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:47,360
which we do in our cars as the police
predicted with the synchronicity song

615
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,150
it's like you you don't really have
visibility to know they're gonna run

616
00:29:51,150 --> 00:29:52,140
into a traffic jam

617
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:55,250
unless you're in God note which who
actually uses the word God

618
00:29:55,250 --> 00:29:58,520
and so they're able to look down and say
will route everybody different

619
00:29:58,520 --> 00:29:59,200
directions

620
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,470
so governance risk and compliance is
really about having this

621
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:04,330
up level view it's like in

622
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:07,539
Big Data environments really having a
god-like you to know where to turn the

623
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:08,059
trouble

624
00:30:08,059 --> 00:30:11,970
and so we're trying to move away from
the simple in the theoretical

625
00:30:11,970 --> 00:30:15,679
the chess game essentially into the go
game which is the complex the real

626
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:18,750
I mention go and just because a lot of
people talk about what's in

627
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:21,990
and you know chess and how computers
beat humans

628
00:30:21,990 --> 00:30:26,559
adjust Irish by flair that even your
phone can be your chest not very smart

629
00:30:26,559 --> 00:30:30,090
but if you put ago game on your phone
you should not lose to that go game

630
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:33,690
that they're not very good I still lose
so embarrassed to admit that have not

631
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:36,659
that great ago but I do play all the
time trying to win cuz theoretically I

632
00:30:36,659 --> 00:30:37,490
should be beating it

633
00:30:37,490 --> 00:30:41,169
and the problem is that there are 130
thousand moos

634
00:30:41,169 --> 00:30:44,899
in the first move in go but the early
400 moves in chess so

635
00:30:44,899 --> 00:30:47,649
a lot of our advertising about how cool
computers are in these big did

636
00:30:47,649 --> 00:30:49,889
environments is directed towards things
we win

637
00:30:49,889 --> 00:30:53,370
not towards things were computers fall
down and every node is Eminem's are

638
00:30:53,370 --> 00:30:53,779
present

639
00:30:53,779 --> 00:30:57,720
suffering out the brown Eminem's even
know van Halen

640
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,909
ever Van Halen used to have his rider
you must separate on my

641
00:31:01,909 --> 00:31:05,500
so this is basically game 3 where he is
like in order to understand my opponent

642
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:06,440
in order to win this

643
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:10,669
very complicated exchange i've a
fifty-page like you know we put a bigger

644
00:31:10,669 --> 00:31:14,370
sets and is also supplied shows not
understand whether they're done any that

645
00:31:14,370 --> 00:31:14,990
properly

646
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:18,000
he had this buried in there and if he
went to his dressing room and found that

647
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:18,669
they were just

648
00:31:18,669 --> 00:31:21,470
brown Eminem's he knew that they read
the whole thing and probably followed

649
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:22,039
everything

650
00:31:22,039 --> 00:31:25,990
unless they were gaming him which is
possible but because I was sorta secret

651
00:31:25,990 --> 00:31:28,740
he didn't tell people he assumed that
you know they did or they didn't

652
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:31,850
and then if he found there was mixed in
you that the whole thing was often he'd

653
00:31:31,850 --> 00:31:33,269
have to let go and check everything

654
00:31:33,269 --> 00:31:36,549
because maybe things would fall you know
so it's it's like the avoiding the

655
00:31:36,549 --> 00:31:37,690
spinal tap outcome

656
00:31:37,690 --> 00:31:41,659
but using game theory with Eminem's
alright so that's your CNN not showing

657
00:31:41,659 --> 00:31:43,510
it high visibility and have like

658
00:31:43,510 --> 00:31:46,570
real threat modeling which we don't do
it to do we don't threaten model

659
00:31:46,570 --> 00:31:50,070
as you can tell you can have roots that
are you know assumption but of course

660
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:52,429
already has roots also got some policies
like that

661
00:31:52,429 --> 00:31:55,529
but security like as a policy oftentimes
means

662
00:31:55,529 --> 00:31:59,409
access restricted trusted personnel am
and then they try to do this through

663
00:31:59,409 --> 00:32:02,450
three things they do encryption
authentication and authorization or to

664
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:03,120
enforce

665
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:06,980
some idea of this policy the problem
being

666
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:11,240
like authentication as an example we
don't do it very well so security mode

667
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:12,000
as I mentioned

668
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,460
like if you turn it on you basically
moved from where you use pseudo to run a

669
00:32:15,460 --> 00:32:15,830
command

670
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:19,429
to re-run k in a tournament you're
familiar with herb ross

671
00:32:19,429 --> 00:32:22,679
you have to get a ticket before you do
something so in pseudo you have to be in

672
00:32:22,679 --> 00:32:23,640
the source file

673
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:27,370
which is local often scan bureau but
mostly local so he moved to curb ross

674
00:32:27,370 --> 00:32:29,230
you're just asking something else for
authority

675
00:32:29,230 --> 00:32:32,500
and in big large distributed
environments that can be a pain

676
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:36,100
so it can slow things down so you tend
to put tickets and instead

677
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:39,120
above caress tickets you give tokens
that are

678
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,080
not expiring we'll talk about the second
but here the point really is that if you

679
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:44,690
want to destroy an entire directory

680
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:48,000
you just do but pseudo HDFS as a user

681
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:52,360
and then the the command are minus RMR
so filesystem mice are mars the same

682
00:32:52,360 --> 00:32:52,870
thing as

683
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:58,029
are minus are UNIX as our future on can
at UBS consider pseudo say Kate at minus

684
00:32:58,029 --> 00:32:58,549
K

685
00:32:58,549 --> 00:33:02,389
giving Mike up took Mike ticket from the
key tab

686
00:33:02,389 --> 00:33:05,980
which sits on the temp directory by the
way which if your gonna head open

687
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:08,399
firemen and it starts to have problems
they tend to turn

688
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:12,080
the temp directory into 777 because
that's a smooth things out

689
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:16,830
that so things are going to the temp
directors are like the tickets for

690
00:33:16,830 --> 00:33:17,809
authentication

691
00:33:17,809 --> 00:33:21,510
so you see the problems of the compound
but so anyway that's

692
00:33:21,510 --> 00:33:25,350
and other examples MapReduce job kill so
if you want to kill the people's jobs I

693
00:33:25,350 --> 00:33:26,159
say this a lot

694
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:29,620
you know you just you Canada you wanna
kill it with a a ticket but

695
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:34,690
anybody know why you wanna kill a job
where jobs were important obviously

696
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:37,889
so you kill somebody else's job 0 what
they're doing

697
00:33:37,889 --> 00:33:41,029
who cares what they're doing my jobs
report which leads to artifacts for

698
00:33:41,029 --> 00:33:43,870
example so so it might be running a
report and the be like oh my job done

699
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:44,450
early

700
00:33:44,450 --> 00:33:47,500
all this run these results and wheelbase
are

701
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:51,269
for cheap purchasing decisions will buy
bacon now because my results show this

702
00:33:51,269 --> 00:33:55,779
because until the job early so and if
you got other conferences like I try to

703
00:33:55,779 --> 00:33:57,590
speak at the Dube summits and stuff
quite a bit

704
00:33:57,590 --> 00:34:01,669
and I find the guys that talk about
security those generally say it's a real

705
00:34:01,669 --> 00:34:04,450
pain in it these are the security
experts on state saying this is how to

706
00:34:04,450 --> 00:34:05,240
secure Hadoop

707
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:09,010
and they say it's really hard so after I
told you these authentication tips

708
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:12,230
like turn on curb Ross it's actually
hard so I don't recommend doing it but

709
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:12,589
it

710
00:34:12,589 --> 00:34:16,139
if somebody comes along like an auditor
a security person says you have security

711
00:34:16,139 --> 00:34:19,710
then you may want to turn it on but
otherwise good luck

712
00:34:19,710 --> 00:34:23,349
alright so here's an example of what I
was talking about anybody seen Blade

713
00:34:23,349 --> 00:34:23,710
Runner

714
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:28,450
so the concert the blade runner's you
have these replicas these robots and

715
00:34:28,450 --> 00:34:29,190
they go away

716
00:34:29,190 --> 00:34:32,129
do things for you and they come come
back you don't want them to come back to

717
00:34:32,129 --> 00:34:33,500
hire blade runners to kill them

718
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,710
well their living longer they're
supposed to live so

719
00:34:36,710 --> 00:34:41,159
by the fall in Hadoop response to these
jobs at live 24 hours or seven days max

720
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:44,629
and it's a simple text file that tell
them they can't live longer and so this

721
00:34:44,629 --> 00:34:47,230
is essentially what they were predicting
1968 with

722
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:51,240
a Blade Runner they're saying you know
eventually those jobs don't wanna die

723
00:34:51,240 --> 00:34:55,079
and I'll try to keep themselves alive
see if to get people give people the job

724
00:34:55,079 --> 00:34:57,260
a fine and killing jobs which is what
i've seen

725
00:34:57,260 --> 00:35:00,690
part it's because you can see the client
would get the curb Ross relationship

726
00:35:00,690 --> 00:35:03,770
so if things everything securing cool
but behind the scenes

727
00:35:03,770 --> 00:35:08,150
your job tracker which member House like
the rose your job jackets figure out how

728
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,500
to count the rose and the sign

729
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:13,010
roles to for accounting for the down
it's actually give it opens out to

730
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:16,030
authorize all of the distributed nodes
to do their job

731
00:35:16,030 --> 00:35:20,119
so the more year giving out tokens and
the more you're spawning jobs the more

732
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:20,650
you're sort of

733
00:35:20,650 --> 00:35:24,630
down the road giving out more and more
authentication capability

734
00:35:24,630 --> 00:35:27,900
and so eventually have jobs running with
tokens for ever you gotta go kill those

735
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:28,339
guys

736
00:35:28,339 --> 00:35:32,490
so cya monitoring I'm wondering is a

737
00:35:32,490 --> 00:35:36,569
a real problem because the this really
different all these different

738
00:35:36,569 --> 00:35:40,190
products are using right every app is
written by different groups patches got

739
00:35:40,190 --> 00:35:43,609
not doesn't have a centralized system
our way to to keep track everything

740
00:35:43,609 --> 00:35:47,579
and of course everyone's got almost
reliable authority and we recognize this

741
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:54,260
it's an album cover any guesses I love
hidden stuff in my presentations

742
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:58,000
this is the roots is obvious

743
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,550
you listen to the roots prohibit now
anyways he ended with a lot of people

744
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:04,040
having root level authority

745
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:07,890
you can put in other levels abuser but
ultimately to run the environment

746
00:36:07,890 --> 00:36:11,370
somebody has to have ruined will go in
and make changes and a lot of times I

747
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:12,070
find a

748
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:15,640
give that control to several people know
to keep the jobs running I'm

749
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:20,090
and again it's hard so really it this is
an opportunity for me to go off a little

750
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:21,850
bit on how modern will change

751
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:27,430
Amy recognize this as as lines in

752
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:31,020
gravel could be lines and Sandra for the
beginning I talked about the

753
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:34,660
the Stingray so can you tell which
direction somebody's walking here

754
00:36:34,660 --> 00:36:40,200
and we do any hunting or tracking
walking to the left

755
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:44,580
for joining this way

756
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:47,600
my right

757
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,618
your left

758
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:53,339
yes this is somebody who's walking steps
that way and then decided group I'm

759
00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:54,420
stepping into a

760
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:58,339
ok a detection system and then stepped
out and ever look at those old like

761
00:36:58,339 --> 00:37:01,869
Japanese gardens where they like the
sensuous doing as its you know I can

762
00:37:01,869 --> 00:37:02,279
tell

763
00:37:02,279 --> 00:37:05,390
imagine trying to go back and cover your
tracks in the sand pit has lines that

764
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:05,829
have been

765
00:37:05,829 --> 00:37:08,969
created by Mark has been practicing for
thirty years there's actually setting

766
00:37:08,969 --> 00:37:10,339
honey trap sir the setting

767
00:37:10,339 --> 00:37:13,190
traps for you to step into it so this is
outside National Building in Silicon

768
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:13,609
Valley

769
00:37:13,609 --> 00:37:17,069
that I was working at nine or so it
stepped into it so take a picture

770
00:37:17,069 --> 00:37:20,390
but the ideas as what we need to get to
you in big data instead of thinking

771
00:37:20,390 --> 00:37:22,589
about in terms of syslog like am I
reading

772
00:37:22,589 --> 00:37:26,719
you know an individual log up individual
system I worked a lot with VMware on

773
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:27,210
some other

774
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:30,660
the cloud security we try to move away
and still trying to move away from the

775
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:31,489
idea that we're just

776
00:37:31,489 --> 00:37:34,819
walking the system the system instead
looking at the overall view in saying

777
00:37:34,819 --> 00:37:35,920
are we seeing steps

778
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:40,849
in San which gets us to the IO ti world
to so if we can actually pull in

779
00:37:40,849 --> 00:37:44,920
information from lots of sensors we are
not be super accurate anyone sensor we

780
00:37:44,920 --> 00:37:45,589
just pullin

781
00:37:45,589 --> 00:37:49,400
change overall so for example here's a
big did environment where

782
00:37:49,400 --> 00:37:53,009
you have like a web server you have your
sales machines you have your call center

783
00:37:53,009 --> 00:37:56,219
and they start to feed using flume which
is I

784
00:37:56,219 --> 00:38:00,759
kinda the fast equivalent of scoop scoop
you scooper database and flew me just

785
00:38:00,759 --> 00:38:03,369
turned on in like your weblog for
shooting to HDFS

786
00:38:03,369 --> 00:38:07,109
so if you're pulling all your logs
basically out of these

787
00:38:07,109 --> 00:38:11,890
into HDFS then you might use storm right
to sort of capture them in real time

788
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:15,519
so you can have a web interface I have a
cat but it's basically a user over there

789
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:16,369
trying to figure out

790
00:38:16,369 --> 00:38:19,380
what's going on at all those things so

791
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:22,369
that gives you real-time analysis of
what's happening and then inside you

792
00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:23,579
still have things like a

793
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:26,729
MapReduce which is trying to get results
so it's counting the number people

794
00:38:26,729 --> 00:38:27,710
glasses on

795
00:38:27,710 --> 00:38:31,180
and then pig because people hate using
Java is a scripting language

796
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:34,299
as a job this morning I suggest that in
a row to rob is

797
00:38:34,299 --> 00:38:37,690
you know Rob Robert No

798
00:38:37,690 --> 00:38:40,549
okay so he was saying that he counted
the number of times the FBI in their

799
00:38:40,549 --> 00:38:42,749
speech said the words like snowed in

800
00:38:42,749 --> 00:38:46,460
or said children because he saying like
if I do a word count

801
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:49,719
out same thing as me County number
classes in here if I do a word count I

802
00:38:49,719 --> 00:38:51,619
can prove the FBI's being orwellian

803
00:38:51,619 --> 00:38:55,569
so I suggest that we should do this for
all FBI speeches ever and then seeping

804
00:38:55,569 --> 00:38:56,799
into a trend analysis

805
00:38:56,799 --> 00:39:00,489
to see if they're being orwellian
overtime the speech but unless orwellian

806
00:39:00,489 --> 00:39:01,770
then eighty percent the other

807
00:39:01,770 --> 00:39:06,340
rally in speeches that given he's doing
a point I'm analysis a political theory

808
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:10,440
I wanna do long-term like trend analysis
a political theory

809
00:39:10,440 --> 00:39:14,670
so pig a as getting back to the point is
the scripting language so I suggest we

810
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:17,340
do a pig word count: being a double
entendre

811
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:21,660
pig Rekha I good joke so

812
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:25,420
has a long job so whose he is a
orchestration system that's basically

813
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:29,100
going to help you manage your MapReduce
your pig because not only is it hard to

814
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:29,569
write

815
00:39:29,570 --> 00:39:33,360
Java and deal with H base DC right pig

816
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:36,620
Latin such a call pig latin instead but
then you might get

817
00:39:36,620 --> 00:39:39,850
up tired of doing it by hand so you have
a busy schedule it for you

818
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:42,900
which is like every time something new
comes in every time the call center

819
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:43,780
picks up a call

820
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:47,410
it flags and so is he figures out okay
should run the script to update my

821
00:39:47,410 --> 00:39:48,050
results

822
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:51,320
tonight in big data analysis in real
time using all these pieces

823
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:55,300
oh my god how do you like this right you
gotta keep track of everything happening

824
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:56,800
all over if you're looking for risk

825
00:39:56,800 --> 00:40:00,290
it's like you gotta look all over and on
top of that people start at all

826
00:40:00,290 --> 00:40:01,420
databases to

827
00:40:01,420 --> 00:40:05,930
this is a recent graduate real story
came in was you know fresh off the boat

828
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:09,200
and said I will have access to the HDFS
environment great you're really smart

829
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:14,080
so here's a sequel interface and she did
drop table and destroy the entire HDFS

830
00:40:14,080 --> 00:40:17,120
database 296 hours to restore

831
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:20,360
the data killer so it stayed in the
database and so

832
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:23,780
Hadoop saves a lot of time unless you
destroy it and then it actually adds a

833
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:24,370
lot of time

834
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:29,770
can slow down quite a bit so controls
are important so as a final point what's

835
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:32,550
happening is your getting these this is
the pivotal distribution what you're

836
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:34,270
getting is all the green represents

837
00:40:34,270 --> 00:40:38,640
add-on services which is again like 30
antivirus models like after Microsoft

838
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,830
gives your operating system

839
00:40:39,830 --> 00:40:43,200
a topic that you can add stuff so you
have command center you have better

840
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:44,100
sequel engines

841
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:47,230
and they have their logging command
center gives you the ability to

842
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:51,080
like if people come in you can log
keystroke logger all their access

843
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,650
your bill to premature essentially
around your environment by using a

844
00:40:53,650 --> 00:40:54,400
distribution

845
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,050
if it has the right mindset right to
access control

846
00:40:58,050 --> 00:41:02,250
yard authorization is interesting so
yarn is a new version a MapReduce

847
00:41:02,250 --> 00:41:05,820
I'll be no yarn where they are

848
00:41:05,820 --> 00:41:12,270
not the response once I give you a
certificate to Amazon for fifty pounds

849
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:12,960
we say

850
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:15,980
have used yarn

851
00:41:15,980 --> 00:41:20,440
okay so I do actually have a couple gift
certificates but we'll get to that later

852
00:41:20,440 --> 00:41:23,480
so the authorization is funny because
the

853
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:27,390
you see the top level says everyone star
SEO no one is

854
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:30,580
space right I auditing for space

855
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:35,470
so I'll little level words as users and
no group so if you want actually

856
00:41:35,470 --> 00:41:36,800
authorize users

857
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:40,380
and not group you put your username and
a space

858
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:43,380
but if you become a space that's okay
cause I would your next user

859
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:46,960
but space means no group right awesome

860
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:50,360
so groups though users would be space
Man Group

861
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:53,600
because there's a space before but the
group name then the campy user

862
00:41:53,600 --> 00:41:57,520
but its common space there would be a
user not

863
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,610
not user art so with that in mind

864
00:42:00,610 --> 00:42:03,810
if you go to these environments dubin
virus you'll find a lot of times they

865
00:42:03,810 --> 00:42:05,360
put star in a lot

866
00:42:05,360 --> 00:42:08,450
and the reason they put starring is
because they say you you have to

867
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:12,130
its is the default setting for stall but
you can't take start up some jobs

868
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:12,840
because

869
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:16,650
there the random it's like going to
Gmail or Yahoo Mail

870
00:42:16,650 --> 00:42:20,780
you can't basically access control list
them because everybody has access to

871
00:42:20,780 --> 00:42:22,200
Yahoo Mail's they can get their mail

872
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,170
you can't predict who's gonna come and
check their mail unless you have a and

873
00:42:25,170 --> 00:42:26,640
access control list every user

874
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:30,700
two billion users not gonna happen so
instead we do %um a secret Atoka

875
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:33,670
right if I know my secret and getting my
mail account so this is the theory

876
00:42:33,670 --> 00:42:34,750
behind yarn

877
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:38,160
I for certain jobs they're exploding
tens of thousands of jobs

878
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,390
you have to have tokens distributed
properly but what I said about opens

879
00:42:41,390 --> 00:42:42,000
before

880
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:46,990
I gets worse alright so also in a little
bit the next section how bad it is

881
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:50,900
but tokens base we can be delegated or
tokens can be used over again

882
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:55,610
and they don't die so I'm depending on
access control lists not working star

883
00:42:55,610 --> 00:42:58,620
because I can give tokens that are tied
down

884
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:02,610
you may see this till the tokens you can
go find things their star access control

885
00:43:02,610 --> 00:43:03,490
you can get in for ever

886
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:08,680
so other controls really needed I here's
a good example how printers are built

887
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:12,520
so in this model of access control on
the left is your ad hoc

888
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,940
are your development environment where
you have users with accounts you have

889
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:17,630
tickets every time so he logs in

890
00:43:17,630 --> 00:43:21,270
they have a ticket and then you get
tickets that expire so

891
00:43:21,270 --> 00:43:24,710
sounds good right on the right is your
production environment where

892
00:43:24,710 --> 00:43:28,480
you give batch account access the
tickets come

893
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,710
key tabs and the auto renew so it's like
the production environment

894
00:43:32,710 --> 00:43:36,580
is built to run for ever and the user
development environment is meant to be

895
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:37,240
locked down

896
00:43:37,240 --> 00:43:41,430
some backwards right so it's interesting
to me that you see this you just don't

897
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:43,740
want to slow down production because
you're right you're driving the car in

898
00:43:43,740 --> 00:43:46,420
the race you want the rear view mirror
and you just gonna slow down so you got

899
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:47,290
everything for

900
00:43:47,290 --> 00:43:51,470
performance scale ability ASI turn off a
lot of controls you might have it was

901
00:43:51,470 --> 00:43:53,510
just like you know your daughter
learning to drive

902
00:43:53,510 --> 00:43:57,720
arts authentication providers get pretty
interesting

903
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:01,380
if you have your users and then you have
your services assume use but these two

904
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:02,520
you want to give services

905
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:06,300
infinite control there a lot of holes
you can poke from the usual air into the

906
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:07,180
service layer

907
00:44:07,180 --> 00:44:10,619
seeing coming through SSH we were able
to kill tell it off you know

908
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:14,790
chaos but we weren't able to kill off
HTTP so people can come in through web

909
00:44:14,790 --> 00:44:16,380
HDFS without encryption

910
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:20,619
you get the password many go through SSH
there's HDFS client goes direct to

911
00:44:20,619 --> 00:44:21,320
storage

912
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:25,030
there's a MapReduce client basically the
idea here you can get to any

913
00:44:25,030 --> 00:44:29,020
a job tracker or name node name nodes
are going to deal with your storage

914
00:44:29,020 --> 00:44:31,840
so if you wanna get access to storage
your attack that gonna get access to

915
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:32,440
jobs

916
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:35,710
you got to the tracker so

917
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:38,730
the main promoters this is how when we
were trying to deal with it you have

918
00:44:38,730 --> 00:44:41,710
an Active Directory domain in your
company and you build a printer inside a

919
00:44:41,710 --> 00:44:42,130
dupe

920
00:44:42,130 --> 00:44:45,600
so you would lock down the Hadoop
environment and then obviously you would

921
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:46,160
share

922
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:49,560
just a little bit of information if you
don't exist inside you can't login

923
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:52,290
and we're gonna share just that we're
going to create a group that could help

924
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:52,810
users

925
00:44:52,810 --> 00:44:56,510
but of course people can still SSH
indirectly if they get the credentials

926
00:44:56,510 --> 00:44:59,580
but they know the HDFS username
credential they can just come into

927
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:00,010
directly

928
00:45:00,010 --> 00:45:04,480
bypassing our perimeter to do work and
so we might put a bastion host in the

929
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:04,910
way

930
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:08,050
and enforce these guys to come into the
bastion host which talks the Active

931
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:11,220
Directory now there's no way for them to
get into the spirit are some pretty cool

932
00:45:11,220 --> 00:45:15,450
that's basically how to deal with it but
it's not differ from the enterprise I

933
00:45:15,450 --> 00:45:15,900
can

934
00:45:15,900 --> 00:45:19,460
let your imagination go wild you can
easily you know that bastion host being

935
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:20,640
compromised for example

936
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:24,050
you can collect all the credentials and
I dupont fireman on for all the users

937
00:45:24,050 --> 00:45:27,100
so vulnerability management another fun
section

938
00:45:27,100 --> 00:45:31,320
I'll go quickly there are three CDs
known for Hadoop seems that a shocking

939
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:35,990
3cds a clutter little special credit
because they have three of their own

940
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:39,760
so total is overlap there's five total
seabees how many

941
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:41,609
vulnerability think there are few search
in

942
00:45:41,609 --> 00:45:45,249
the jeera over dupe jurors there but
tracking list

943
00:45:45,249 --> 00:45:49,739
any idea how many bugs there are
vulnerabilities in G roe versus how many

944
00:45:49,739 --> 00:45:54,579
TV's there are I don't know there's so
many

945
00:45:54,579 --> 00:46:00,150
yellow cedar and I do job on it so

946
00:46:00,150 --> 00:46:03,430
here's an example to talk about with a
delegation token this is a real

947
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:05,039
vulnerability I found in the jeera

948
00:46:05,039 --> 00:46:08,349
so delegation token show up in the URL
the URL gets rental Aug

949
00:46:08,349 --> 00:46:12,269
the oral has your token it this is like
when those mistakes that every church

950
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:15,249
you know web programmers make where they
put up token right into the URL

951
00:46:15,249 --> 00:46:18,619
is grab it and you can just log in
forever as that person so the obvious

952
00:46:18,619 --> 00:46:19,789
solution is to do whatever and

953
00:46:19,789 --> 00:46:22,239
has been doing which is hide it
somewhere put in the header put it

954
00:46:22,239 --> 00:46:25,099
somewhere it doesn't end up in the logs
put it somewhere it doesn't get shared

955
00:46:25,099 --> 00:46:28,730
like a go to this URL to log into my
head a cluster

956
00:46:28,730 --> 00:46:31,670
and then there are you logged in as you
right there's no authentication required

957
00:46:31,670 --> 00:46:32,940
here's another example

958
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:36,339
passers and secrets are scattered
throughout a lot other developers alike

959
00:46:36,339 --> 00:46:39,559
i really wanna use encryption but we
don't have a key management tool source

960
00:46:39,559 --> 00:46:40,989
for the key next to the storage

961
00:46:40,989 --> 00:46:45,099
that happens a lot or put in the scripts
you can dig around in this year and

962
00:46:45,099 --> 00:46:47,970
and find exactly where to get the
exploits there's like a million-dollar

963
00:46:47,970 --> 00:46:48,670
abilities in there

964
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:51,789
I might our classes computer science
students last week

965
00:46:51,789 --> 00:46:55,369
in near Vienna and I told them there
third graduate there a

966
00:46:55,369 --> 00:46:59,249
grades be based on how many CDs they
could file a lot of jeera Sophie will be

967
00:46:59,249 --> 00:46:59,960
a lot more soon

968
00:46:59,960 --> 00:47:03,619
and if not the best students

969
00:47:03,619 --> 00:47:07,200
so I yeah I don't have a ton of time so
just very quickly

970
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,359
the idea that Netflix others have
propagated is that servers are pets

971
00:47:10,359 --> 00:47:13,609
because we're growing them so fast you
shouldn't like hang on to them shouldn't

972
00:47:13,609 --> 00:47:14,369
treat them like

973
00:47:14,369 --> 00:47:18,280
you know this cat your feet cake oh my
server so lovely I really think it's

974
00:47:18,280 --> 00:47:19,290
important special

975
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:22,349
you should treat them like house instead
but this was I think

976
00:47:22,349 --> 00:47:25,550
created by people who don't know
anything about house I know a little bit

977
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:29,119
and I grew up around the block house and
so it turns out that house kinda

978
00:47:29,119 --> 00:47:32,490
are like pat's the operative word being
asset right

979
00:47:32,490 --> 00:47:35,839
up pat is an asset because it gives you
affection I guess or whatever people up

980
00:47:35,839 --> 00:47:36,200
at

981
00:47:36,200 --> 00:47:39,369
differ reasons but on an animal that
like a cow that you have a

982
00:47:39,369 --> 00:47:42,690
a rancher gives you milk and money and
cheese whatever so

983
00:47:42,690 --> 00:47:46,030
if you just look at as an asset then you
will protect assets and it turns out we

984
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:50,220
know a lot more about house we do pets
because they're such valuable assets

985
00:47:50,220 --> 00:47:53,369
so that model in 2012 I spoke about how
to

986
00:47:53,369 --> 00:47:56,730
to deal with cholera this is a store a
lot of time to go through it but

987
00:47:56,730 --> 00:47:57,349
basically

988
00:47:57,349 --> 00:48:00,710
if you look for a source for infection
the way we do in cows now and we can

989
00:48:00,710 --> 00:48:03,099
understand the propagation of the
infection

990
00:48:03,099 --> 00:48:06,829
then we can find the source eliminated
which was developed in eighteen fifties

991
00:48:06,829 --> 00:48:10,390
it was the beginning of germ knowledge
was early big data analysis if you will

992
00:48:10,390 --> 00:48:13,670
using math this is a four night short
approve the people that live next to

993
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:14,190
water

994
00:48:14,190 --> 00:48:17,210
that was contaminated died that was the
beginning of germ theory

995
00:48:17,210 --> 00:48:20,000
I would also prove that if they drank a
lot a beer and didn't go to that water

996
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,079
pump then they didn't die

997
00:48:21,079 --> 00:48:25,420
so pure save people so I apply this to
technology

998
00:48:25,420 --> 00:48:29,809
and basically the RM is if you can
easily identify problems and have

999
00:48:29,809 --> 00:48:32,660
routine treatment and mineral judgments
then you're on the right path

1000
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:35,640
so we need solutions like aspirin or
ibuprofen are things that we've

1001
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,200
identified a really simple

1002
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:40,200
that's how we're gonna do a boner
abilities but the way it works is if we

1003
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,450
have on the back and some way of keeping
records

1004
00:48:42,450 --> 00:48:46,599
so you identify the problems you store
those records based the big data

1005
00:48:46,599 --> 00:48:47,470
analysis piece

1006
00:48:47,470 --> 00:48:50,329
so keeping them separate and
understanding where resilience comes

1007
00:48:50,329 --> 00:48:51,390
from really helps

1008
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:54,490
motor abilities and so too big did
environment these are examples of

1009
00:48:54,490 --> 00:48:55,059
illness

1010
00:48:55,059 --> 00:48:58,299
these are all abilities you run into the
HTTP services I

1011
00:48:58,299 --> 00:49:01,730
you'll find jobs tickets service
delegation is broken you'll find it an

1012
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:02,480
authority

1013
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:05,520
is too high API's can be easily abused

1014
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:09,020
keras has no definition randomness
people freak out when reading this

1015
00:49:09,020 --> 00:49:11,470
issues come up and and hashing tables in
your talk about

1016
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:14,880
those competitions to make sure the
passion is secure in

1017
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:18,200
outside to do but inside to do nobody
talks about it all are

1018
00:49:18,200 --> 00:49:21,480
weather out the tickets generate a biker
brosser random enough for secure enough

1019
00:49:21,480 --> 00:49:26,160
so passers example where I would look
for illness

1020
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:29,759
in a MapReduce job budget house show up
are to data protection

1021
00:49:29,759 --> 00:49:34,150
the important thing to realize here is
that there's really no reason what's

1022
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:34,539
been a

1023
00:49:34,539 --> 00:49:37,250
expectation of privacy anymore want to
start talking about massively

1024
00:49:37,250 --> 00:49:40,339
distributed systems there's a recent
court case in California which says

1025
00:49:40,339 --> 00:49:43,990
if the date is recorded somewhere then
that date is public information

1026
00:49:43,990 --> 00:49:47,000
so in that sense are you to protect data
that's considered

1027
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,220
public could become sort of weird if
technologies really capturing

1028
00:49:50,220 --> 00:49:51,000
information

1029
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:54,549
that you knowingly exposed then it's
basically public information

1030
00:49:54,549 --> 00:49:58,029
so becomes a question i've the
expectation of challenging integrity

1031
00:49:58,029 --> 00:50:01,869
its are like a civil dissipated
disobedience exercise and so

1032
00:50:01,869 --> 00:50:05,619
as a quick example radars trusted I was
implicitly in all the cases

1033
00:50:05,619 --> 00:50:08,950
so my brother for example what the
challenge the same court and having been

1034
00:50:08,950 --> 00:50:12,609
an astrophysicist he said let me explain
to you the mathematical algorithm

1035
00:50:12,609 --> 00:50:15,660
that will show you that you've misfired
a radar gun and

1036
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:19,000
I'll help you improve the integrity via
radar guns if you look at the stake it

1037
00:50:19,000 --> 00:50:22,390
and this okay guilty a

1038
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:27,670
so he was like I can map world's like
Whitacre so I got a ticket that was

1039
00:50:27,670 --> 00:50:30,980
laser-based I was like how that seem
strange maybe I can show how that's not

1040
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:31,470
gonna work

1041
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:35,400
i'd if we can challenge laser but I can
maybe challenge at the way I know as a

1042
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,410
social engineer I can just go pay the
judge

1043
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:40,900
and he let me off so it's what I did
gifts only five bucks to the Sun

1044
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:44,180
a guy who went to law school with the
judge

1045
00:50:44,180 --> 00:50:47,630
and magically disappeared but in the
meantime I learned that

1046
00:50:47,630 --> 00:50:51,329
a laser is unable to detect moving
objects so even though there's a guy on

1047
00:50:51,329 --> 00:50:53,630
the street by a laser saying you were
speeding

1048
00:50:53,630 --> 00:50:56,859
I was going really fast and not say I
wasn't speeding but if

1049
00:50:56,859 --> 00:51:00,289
they do that and they tell you that
you're guilty it turns out that they can

1050
00:51:00,289 --> 00:51:00,759
see you

1051
00:51:00,759 --> 00:51:03,910
that blank spot is basically what they
see which is birds

1052
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:07,809
which is cloud anything moving is
invisible to light our guns they're

1053
00:51:07,809 --> 00:51:09,779
using to tell you that you're guilty
which is so weird

1054
00:51:09,779 --> 00:51:13,559
they can see things like I mean these
they actually use light are quite a bit

1055
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:15,400
for it really interesting to get
analysis

1056
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:19,430
like this is analysis so power lines to
tell if there's a breaker tell you

1057
00:51:19,430 --> 00:51:20,700
there's a weakness or something right

1058
00:51:20,700 --> 00:51:24,319
up to see the trees can see everything
so this the like this I think this week

1059
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:25,039
old light are

1060
00:51:25,039 --> 00:51:28,410
actually honestly and so I read actually
really 20

1061
00:51:28,410 --> 00:51:32,740
13 that all laser scanning methods a
basically assume that they object to

1062
00:51:32,740 --> 00:51:33,480
stationary

1063
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:37,460
2013 and yeah we've been for years at
least twenty years I think

1064
00:51:37,460 --> 00:51:41,590
using lighter to detect moving objects
foot so the idea protections weird

1065
00:51:41,590 --> 00:51:44,550
so it actually turns out you know if you
can't kill those viruses with a

1066
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:46,660
medication they should just take a
lawsuit because

1067
00:51:46,660 --> 00:51:50,400
other ways if dealing with data
protection errors and sewer

1068
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,590
start to see is that issues of trust are
coming around relationships

1069
00:51:53,590 --> 00:51:56,600
you protect things based on authority
and relationship to one another

1070
00:51:56,600 --> 00:51:59,610
I some people say the sale defeat things
like I sis

1071
00:51:59,610 --> 00:52:03,240
if you really understand the complexity
of the relationships so it's not very

1072
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:03,870
promising

1073
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:07,110
but here's a real world example google
has light on top of their

1074
00:52:07,110 --> 00:52:10,520
cars right there automobiles I call them
auto autos

1075
00:52:10,520 --> 00:52:13,930
because I don't know but automobile the
first time was

1076
00:52:13,930 --> 00:52:18,450
automated right mobile automated its or
try again it's like the automated

1077
00:52:18,450 --> 00:52:19,180
automated

1078
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:23,710
mobile so the auto auto admits or
failure or auto 2.0

1079
00:52:23,710 --> 00:52:27,290
so the light are sitting on top
basically as opposed to the tax stuff

1080
00:52:27,290 --> 00:52:28,810
but as I showed you its blind

1081
00:52:28,810 --> 00:52:32,050
so I've been thinking about ways that we
can blind paladar effectively and then

1082
00:52:32,050 --> 00:52:35,290
blind the GPS by redirecting it so their
cars I gotta control

1083
00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:39,130
I'm so and that's a big environment you
have to worry about

1084
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:42,610
whether Google decides to send you off
the road because it detects something

1085
00:52:42,610 --> 00:52:45,700
and it thinks that it's right and you
don't think it's right

1086
00:52:45,700 --> 00:52:48,840
for example the texas school bus with
children in it and it says I'm gonna

1087
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:51,420
send you off a bridge because I need to
save the school children

1088
00:52:51,420 --> 00:52:54,650
and you like there's no school bus and
there's any of the bridge you're giving

1089
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:58,230
control to them so data protection
becomes weird if you give over control

1090
00:52:58,230 --> 00:53:00,840
to people who are basing their decisions
on faulty systems

1091
00:53:00,840 --> 00:53:04,870
which we knew way back to nineteen
eighty I United States had an operation

1092
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:05,930
in the desert that

1093
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:09,770
went awry because a guy was staring at
us somebody on the ground and use a

1094
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:11,260
helicopter the first start walking

1095
00:53:11,260 --> 00:53:14,720
and you couldn't tell because a brownout
conditions so we've been developing

1096
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:18,230
a better technology for years in the
military based on this idea

1097
00:53:18,230 --> 00:53:21,840
they were fixing it now some ways
examples of fixing it

1098
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:25,640
with a cumulative which basically means
if you want to compromise the communal

1099
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:26,250
environment

1100
00:53:26,250 --> 00:53:29,600
you see this allowed me to pick you love
you can compromise the admin then you

1101
00:53:29,600 --> 00:53:32,130
get complete control but you're
basically locked out of the network now

1102
00:53:32,130 --> 00:53:32,970
in the storage

1103
00:53:32,970 --> 00:53:36,080
it like a real environments our Tahoe is
another example

1104
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:39,680
where same thing if you can get into the
Tahoe gateway which can run local so it

1105
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:40,340
can be hard

1106
00:53:40,340 --> 00:53:41,710
but if you can compromise the game

1107
00:53:41,710 --> 00:53:44,500
you can get into the environment's
that's the proxy which becomes the focal

1108
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:45,710
point to protecting data

1109
00:53:45,710 --> 00:53:49,380
as opposed to the network at the storage
array was our current solutions so

1110
00:53:49,380 --> 00:53:49,930
finally

1111
00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:53,140
network and system solution there is a
lot over

1112
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:56,290
equaxion to protect the network and the
system's

1113
00:53:56,290 --> 00:53:59,619
but it's not well deployed so ask any
Hadoop environment

1114
00:53:59,619 --> 00:54:03,030
a where you know how they manage their
certificates

1115
00:54:03,030 --> 00:54:06,650
or even as the weather where they do
hardly that's not it not a popular topic

1116
00:54:06,650 --> 00:54:07,770
inside a compartment

1117
00:54:07,770 --> 00:54:10,849
they really don't have any idea and so
their other more

1118
00:54:10,849 --> 00:54:14,970
deeper problems like there's no
exception for JDBC why does that matter

1119
00:54:14,970 --> 00:54:18,770
a hive for example sequel anything a
sequel running on top of

1120
00:54:18,770 --> 00:54:23,580
a H HDFS so people are trying to use our
job Aquarius into the storage

1121
00:54:23,580 --> 00:54:27,950
are often using JDBC with no encryption
you just go intercept other

1122
00:54:27,950 --> 00:54:29,680
communication even more so

1123
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:32,839
when they turn on SSL anybody know in
all ciphers are

1124
00:54:32,839 --> 00:54:36,630
North Cyprus non ciphers no ciphers

1125
00:54:36,630 --> 00:54:39,990
so they turn on SSL but

1126
00:54:39,990 --> 00:54:43,130
in the documentation it says attorney
and Alzheimer's that's the only thing

1127
00:54:43,130 --> 00:54:44,089
that they support right now

1128
00:54:44,089 --> 00:54:48,839
so as you dig into communications that
people are using to talk to get the

1129
00:54:48,839 --> 00:54:50,570
storage then you find more and more at

1130
00:54:50,570 --> 00:54:55,280
instances up I give an example here JDBC
is what a typical JDBC call

1131
00:54:55,280 --> 00:54:59,470
looks like from from higher and there's
there's no a SSL there's no encryption

1132
00:54:59,470 --> 00:55:00,440
you're basically doing

1133
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:03,490
cleartext so here's an example recently
I love

1134
00:55:03,490 --> 00:55:07,250
a map are in Swat got together did a
demo of how their mining Twitter data

1135
00:55:07,250 --> 00:55:10,380
and right away I notice they're doing it
over non SSL connection when I look at

1136
00:55:10,380 --> 00:55:11,740
the Netflix security monkey

1137
00:55:11,740 --> 00:55:15,300
again no SSL connection security monkey
is the

1138
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:18,460
management tool for security in a large
distributed environment and you're

1139
00:55:18,460 --> 00:55:21,410
logging in as an administrator to
environment with no

1140
00:55:21,410 --> 00:55:25,950
protection your password so it gets more
and more

1141
00:55:25,950 --> 00:55:29,349
complicated as you get to like large
environments there's an example well

1142
00:55:29,349 --> 00:55:33,380
RPC calls HDPE never a threat to anyone
it is that has a credential gives you

1143
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:35,910
access any environment you can pretty
much pick and choose where you want to

1144
00:55:35,910 --> 00:55:36,320
get in

1145
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:40,970
as you dig deeper alright so that's
basically the whole idea

1146
00:55:40,970 --> 00:55:44,619
you have six things that I went through
where there's lots of room for

1147
00:55:44,619 --> 00:55:45,180
improvement

1148
00:55:45,180 --> 00:55:48,880
and that of course the GRC would serve
see for top-level where things were

1149
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:49,460
breaking

1150
00:55:49,460 --> 00:55:52,950
which hopefully for policies are set up
right are monitoring set up right we'd

1151
00:55:52,950 --> 00:55:53,999
see oh yeah we have

1152
00:55:53,999 --> 00:55:57,379
we doing strange behavior in the
beginning I talked about well

1153
00:55:57,379 --> 00:56:01,539
arce solution for example it's really
behavior-based it's not just that

1154
00:56:01,539 --> 00:56:04,099
you know there's somebody who's
connecting over report we haven't seen

1155
00:56:04,099 --> 00:56:04,579
before

1156
00:56:04,579 --> 00:56:08,549
which is useful for example for the past
12 months we've seen these JDBC

1157
00:56:08,549 --> 00:56:09,269
connections

1158
00:56:09,269 --> 00:56:13,209
and they look like this an hour sinker
GT bck collection that looks different

1159
00:56:13,209 --> 00:56:14,439
it's a different every day

1160
00:56:14,439 --> 00:56:18,359
its accessing more data than it used to
soviet-built enough data points using

1161
00:56:18,359 --> 00:56:20,779
big data analysis you can look at Big
Data Systems

1162
00:56:20,779 --> 00:56:24,509
and see unusual behavior and so then you
could say it's comply or not

1163
00:56:24,509 --> 00:56:27,629
so the future state essentially very
quickly is

1164
00:56:27,629 --> 00:56:31,439
I we've made some progress with some
distributions so

1165
00:56:31,439 --> 00:56:34,629
here's I haven't put names on these but
they've come up with their own

1166
00:56:34,629 --> 00:56:37,779
this is my fear they call their own
security like as if we've never done

1167
00:56:37,779 --> 00:56:38,689
security before

1168
00:56:38,689 --> 00:56:42,469
and I know anybody who wants to do in
eighty PV era PA e

1169
00:56:42,469 --> 00:56:46,029
compliance check and even use the word
perimeter in there

1170
00:56:46,029 --> 00:56:49,509
a model which i think is ridiculous
we're trying to get rid of Realtors and

1171
00:56:49,509 --> 00:56:50,079
they're like

1172
00:56:50,079 --> 00:56:53,689
you can't build a printer these guys use
encryption in their model

1173
00:56:53,689 --> 00:56:57,229
which I also don't like and we have
these other sort of side projects that

1174
00:56:57,229 --> 00:56:58,649
are supposed to take her everything

1175
00:56:58,649 --> 00:57:02,459
so I think we need to do is build
something like the six and I'll tell you

1176
00:57:02,459 --> 00:57:03,029
the truth

1177
00:57:03,029 --> 00:57:05,889
I borrow the six from a buncha
compliance standards I looked at and I

1178
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:08,569
thought well this we've done these
before when we just apply these to

1179
00:57:08,569 --> 00:57:09,089
Hadoop

1180
00:57:09,089 --> 00:57:11,419
and I'll make people happy cuz once
they're done we can just say they're

1181
00:57:11,419 --> 00:57:13,329
also comply with HIPAA and PCI

1182
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:17,199
other stuff I'm so here's a quick four
phases are five phases

1183
00:57:17,199 --> 00:57:21,199
how you do in the future basically
member the latency argument member all

1184
00:57:21,199 --> 00:57:22,149
the argument about how

1185
00:57:22,149 --> 00:57:24,749
skill bill you're supposed to work this
is what I used to look like you had a

1186
00:57:24,749 --> 00:57:26,209
buncha distributed systems

1187
00:57:26,209 --> 00:57:30,019
and you had a checkpoint and that turned
out to be not so secure

1188
00:57:30,019 --> 00:57:34,239
so we moved everything into a data
services layer and we have a really fast

1189
00:57:34,239 --> 00:57:36,059
network speed so the latency is an issue

1190
00:57:36,059 --> 00:57:39,429
so your computer that's distributed
actually comes just memory and ship

1191
00:57:39,429 --> 00:57:40,439
there's no storage

1192
00:57:40,439 --> 00:57:44,339
on the nodes actually century why is
that cool because if you sent restore

1193
00:57:44,339 --> 00:57:45,009
the data

1194
00:57:45,009 --> 00:57:48,989
then you can access controls on the data
based on classification

1195
00:57:48,989 --> 00:57:52,049
so if you know Bob shouldn't see alice
is home data

1196
00:57:52,049 --> 00:57:55,989
the chalet share work data then I can
actually build an access control lists

1197
00:57:55,989 --> 00:57:57,029
based on authority

1198
00:57:57,029 --> 00:57:59,689
on the data and this is a real
architecture that we're starting to use

1199
00:57:59,689 --> 00:58:00,269
which is

1200
00:58:00,269 --> 00:58:03,789
every time some inquiries a big did
environment I'd check to see if they

1201
00:58:03,789 --> 00:58:06,579
have access to it but I can do that
because I would centralize

1202
00:58:06,579 --> 00:58:07,000
if I have

1203
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,540
distributed it's literally like asking
everyone to view every time somebody

1204
00:58:10,540 --> 00:58:13,250
wants access to data whether that
person's have access to data

1205
00:58:13,250 --> 00:58:16,610
it gets really complicated distributed
systems are very difficult to engineer

1206
00:58:16,610 --> 00:58:20,400
but I centralize a in a distributed
environment that at least have a stopgap

1207
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:24,630
it's like building a a printer using
fast enough speed and so that I can

1208
00:58:24,630 --> 00:58:26,110
provide some least authority

1209
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:29,910
like I talked about Camillo and and laps
that I can provide some way of saying

1210
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:34,650
if I give you access my granted access
isn't just like an ACL

1211
00:58:34,650 --> 00:58:38,710
it's not just saying your name gives you
access to your key so every time I give

1212
00:58:38,710 --> 00:58:40,490
somebody access it comes with a key

1213
00:58:40,490 --> 00:58:43,730
and so when they say I'd like to access
this file: the shop with the token

1214
00:58:43,730 --> 00:58:47,150
now you access controls can be opened
because they come with the security

1215
00:58:47,150 --> 00:58:51,330
of the token or the ticket and that
actually work so real-world examples

1216
00:58:51,330 --> 00:58:55,440
well we can have environment service
layer essentially so when somebody tries

1217
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,100
to do Hadoop like stuff

1218
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:00,440
they talk to our proxy they talked or
service layer and we would check to see

1219
00:59:00,440 --> 00:59:01,800
if they have access or not to

1220
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:06,030
data and compute resources both are
scaleable and then

1221
00:59:06,030 --> 00:59:09,090
in a real real world environment here's
a hospital

1222
00:59:09,090 --> 00:59:13,230
so outpatient inpatient care would go to
the service layer to try to query

1223
00:59:13,230 --> 00:59:17,510
what's that Asus and then all the stuff
going on like insurance companies

1224
00:59:17,510 --> 00:59:21,050
trying to do analysis and Shino defer
part to the hospital doing work

1225
00:59:21,050 --> 00:59:24,270
would be feeding into the state a lake
so we create a buffer essentially

1226
00:59:24,270 --> 00:59:27,680
and so that's where we are today if you
don't do this then you try to distribute

1227
00:59:27,680 --> 00:59:30,040
the security throughout everything and
it's just like Swiss cheese

1228
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:32,760
it's like people can walk through
basically anywhere it shooting fish in a

1229
00:59:32,760 --> 00:59:33,690
barrel as we say

1230
00:59:33,690 --> 00:59:38,530
so thats basically the whole talk within
hours a lot to cover

1231
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:42,300
adding it to go to its depth but but
again why I'm try to build transparency

1232
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:43,090
sure everybody

1233
00:59:43,090 --> 00:59:46,700
where the risks are try to show that the
tools that are relevant SAR difference

1234
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:48,600
than what we've might have done in the
past

1235
00:59:48,600 --> 00:59:51,820
and then show the resilience really has
become one the most important pieces cuz

1236
00:59:51,820 --> 00:59:52,990
if these systems die

1237
00:59:52,990 --> 00:59:56,560
like with that intern killed you know
ninety six hours with the data

1238
00:59:56,560 --> 01:00:00,050
the I see all the time executives say
okay I'm done with a dupe

1239
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:02,960
if you can keep this thing up then
forget it does get off to go back to

1240
01:00:02,960 --> 01:00:04,220
Oracle or something crazy

1241
01:00:04,220 --> 01:00:11,220
so are thanks of your time we'll take
questions

1242
01:00:15,609 --> 01:00:16,819
help a fair questions

1243
01:00:16,819 --> 01:00:21,349
I would be giving you a book but I

1244
01:00:21,349 --> 01:00:26,270
didn't care that you happy I do
sometimes do with the book

1245
01:00:26,270 --> 01:00:29,270
the new book will be out in a couple
months hopefully

1246
01:00:29,270 --> 01:00:36,270
so which covers all the stuff in more
depth any questions

1247
01:00:49,109 --> 01:00:52,219
I would never want to answer for Oracle
but

1248
01:00:52,219 --> 01:00:56,109
I can guess so the question is is Oracle
planning to do yeah so true

1249
01:00:56,109 --> 01:01:00,939
so my theory is overall we're moving
away from databases because

1250
01:01:00,939 --> 01:01:04,749
databases were structured in a way that
was limiting

1251
01:01:04,749 --> 01:01:09,140
and people want access to unstructured
so you can do database on the fly

1252
01:01:09,140 --> 01:01:13,029
so I believe that the databases will
become a front-end to the actual

1253
01:01:13,029 --> 01:01:16,719
data repositories and as people shift to
a new mindset

1254
01:01:16,719 --> 01:01:21,659
the move of old database like management
interfaces like I will access my data

1255
01:01:21,659 --> 01:01:24,249
through my Oracle Database the move to
direct access

1256
01:01:24,249 --> 01:01:27,409
streaming access so for example and the
Twitter

1257
01:01:27,409 --> 01:01:31,149
their bodies as Twitter but if you look
at Twitter followers or URL's that are

1258
01:01:31,149 --> 01:01:31,599
getting

1259
01:01:31,599 --> 01:01:35,229
picked up if you did that a database you
be extracting and dumping

1260
01:01:35,229 --> 01:01:39,149
ATT alright you extract you transactions
you load to try to move away from that

1261
01:01:39,149 --> 01:01:42,939
and do like real-time query is like
what's the most number followers now

1262
01:01:42,939 --> 01:01:46,169
now how many people are following now
how many people are following so

1263
01:01:46,169 --> 01:01:50,209
the future is probably getting to real
time but I'm not a database guy honestly

1264
01:01:50,209 --> 01:01:50,959
I'm just a

1265
01:01:50,959 --> 01:01:54,389
little pen tester so whatever they do
i'm looking for.

1266
01:01:54,389 --> 01:01:58,669
clause yeah

1267
01:01:58,669 --> 01:02:02,279
there is a gap there because they have
to have access and credentials

1268
01:02:02,279 --> 01:02:06,529
and the more you use a an intermediary
that isn't secure the more you open

1269
01:02:06,529 --> 01:02:09,179
yourself to people also have access to
the intermediary

1270
01:02:09,179 --> 01:02:13,249
the Gateway buying compromise thing in
the middle then I can go and do whatever

1271
01:02:13,249 --> 01:02:13,889
you can do

1272
01:02:13,889 --> 01:02:19,029
impersonate you affordable secure
gateway where you can get unless we

1273
01:02:19,029 --> 01:02:20,259
really test you for

1274
01:02:20,259 --> 01:02:25,669
proper credentials ideally would be

1275
01:02:25,669 --> 01:02:29,519
back to Mabel example it would be we
don't actually have to build an

1276
01:02:29,519 --> 01:02:32,469
all-knowing all-encompassing system
because we have a way

1277
01:02:32,469 --> 01:02:36,999
%uh asking people to in a hierarchical
way going to ask people that they know

1278
01:02:36,999 --> 01:02:38,380
who ask people they know

1279
01:02:38,380 --> 01:02:41,349
and all the things that important get
reported up through the chain so we

1280
01:02:41,349 --> 01:02:42,769
don't have to know inside

1281
01:02:42,769 --> 01:02:46,959
certain environments and that's when I O
T model if I run engine with 30,000

1282
01:02:46,959 --> 01:02:47,649
sensors

1283
01:02:47,649 --> 01:02:50,969
I don't want to go and listen to every
engine all the time everywhere

1284
01:02:50,969 --> 01:02:54,539
I wanna have engines that are able to
identify flaws report up

1285
01:02:54,539 --> 01:02:58,530
just that flooded it's the same argument
as do I wanna have fun

1286
01:02:58,530 --> 01:03:03,150
development varmints in information mood
or debug mode or don't have min warning

1287
01:03:03,150 --> 01:03:03,740
load

1288
01:03:03,740 --> 01:03:06,850
so you wanna turn things in a warning
load but

1289
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:09,850
still have the ability for things inside
to know what's important enough to

1290
01:03:09,850 --> 01:03:10,550
report back

1291
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:14,240
it it actually turns into political
science more than computer science

1292
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:21,240
because the privacy issues any other
questions

1293
01:03:23,150 --> 01:03:28,110
fifty pounds

1294
01:03:28,110 --> 01:03:33,100
that's at I can't pay people for
questioning anything

1295
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:40,100
where to make the suit yes

1296
01:03:45,700 --> 01:03:49,220
what's that

1297
01:03:49,220 --> 01:03:52,260
how have I seen a security incidents so
I mention one

1298
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:58,270
with the woman who destroyed the data I
what can I say yeah I've seen outages

1299
01:03:58,270 --> 01:03:59,000
basically

1300
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:02,040
availability has been the biggest
incidents because we measure that

1301
01:04:02,040 --> 01:04:06,440
um act a theft the data we don't even
know yet how to measure that properly

1302
01:04:06,440 --> 01:04:10,500
we have some environments that are PCI
compliant we have some that are

1303
01:04:10,500 --> 01:04:14,100
hipper complained that are getting there
but honestly the incidents that show up

1304
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:18,040
easiest and most our availability
because they're so easy to measure

1305
01:04:18,040 --> 01:04:21,310
if you still consider the part of
security which I do so

1306
01:04:21,310 --> 01:04:28,310
yes yet custom computing into

1307
01:04:29,170 --> 01:04:33,030
a trusted computing do no not that I
know of

1308
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:36,000
well action to take that back so what
are the things that runs on Hadoop is

1309
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:36,830
like the NSA

1310
01:04:36,830 --> 01:04:41,400
and so large intelligence gather
organizations probably do

1311
01:04:41,400 --> 01:04:44,540
trusted computers cuz they still have
that stuff sitting around they haven't

1312
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:45,460
migrated of it

1313
01:04:45,460 --> 01:04:49,000
but I think more to the point it's a
commodity architecture

1314
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:52,800
and trusted tends to be expensive and so
people are pushing ahead so fast

1315
01:04:52,800 --> 01:04:56,280
onto cheap easy they don't wanna put in
place

1316
01:04:56,280 --> 01:04:59,700
something trusted however Intel is

1317
01:04:59,700 --> 01:05:03,100
I think banking on the fact that they're
gonna make secure chips with crypto

1318
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:03,880
accelerators

1319
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:09,080
and I'm RHS aum's and %ah put those into
every node in a big environment this is

1320
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:10,410
the norm for data management

1321
01:05:10,410 --> 01:05:14,160
in a few years so every intel-based node
may have

1322
01:05:14,160 --> 01:05:18,350
the ability to be a trusted node so I i
see that coming in the next year two

1323
01:05:18,350 --> 01:05:19,630
years will start talking about

1324
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:26,630
how to talk to an HSM on a node it

1325
01:05:26,800 --> 01:05:28,800
yeah I didn't say that I have it

1326
01:05:28,800 --> 01:05:32,360
yeah somebody has claimed to have a
Hadoop environment as PCI compliant and

1327
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:33,510
the ones i've seen

1328
01:05:33,510 --> 01:05:36,860
there you know the scoop flume
relationship there

1329
01:05:36,860 --> 01:05:39,920
mostly scooping so they're out-of-date
so they basically scoop

1330
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:43,650
into an environment that's heavily
lockdown that has sensitive data

1331
01:05:43,650 --> 01:05:46,770
and that gets out of sync it violates
the idea

1332
01:05:46,770 --> 01:05:50,270
real time but it's the only way to lock
it down believe so

1333
01:05:50,270 --> 01:05:54,240
so many people and these a bastion host
so if you go in its key large so they

1334
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:55,180
can go backwards in time

1335
01:05:55,180 --> 01:05:58,550
yeah so there is compromised nobody that
I know of

1336
01:05:58,550 --> 01:06:03,090
a is doing a true wide open and opened
fire at with PCI compliance

1337
01:06:03,090 --> 01:06:06,300
I think the closest you get with
accumulate would be okay

1338
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:09,560
I think Tahoe laughs maybe even better
where your

1339
01:06:09,560 --> 01:06:13,140
encrypting every cell and encrypting
access

1340
01:06:13,140 --> 01:06:16,180
so be pretty heavy complicated

1341
01:06:16,180 --> 01:06:19,260
or working on building that as a as an
model

1342
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:22,680
because we have to go the questions

1343
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:28,710
some other question other knife to me
questions who once the certificate

1344
01:06:28,710 --> 01:06:33,740
at the fight it out one more question

1345
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:38,390
k gonna ask another question

1346
01:06:38,390 --> 01:06:45,390
that

1347
01:06:47,450 --> 01:06:51,140
so I've mentioned that the the future of
Internet of Things security is building

1348
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:52,260
these pockets

1349
01:06:52,260 --> 01:06:55,220
where things can talk to each other an
early report important enough

1350
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:56,390
information back out

1351
01:06:56,390 --> 01:07:00,020
so we need a way of designing a model so
your home for example is your private

1352
01:07:00,020 --> 01:07:00,690
barrier

1353
01:07:00,690 --> 01:07:03,750
but I can get data out your home that's
relevant to

1354
01:07:03,750 --> 01:07:06,720
fixing your system's like a
vulnerability is on your system I we

1355
01:07:06,720 --> 01:07:08,690
need to know that you have a system that
needs a patch

1356
01:07:08,690 --> 01:07:11,980
I don't need to know that your home
between is ours and that you had a

1357
01:07:11,980 --> 01:07:13,900
girlfriend and not your wife at home
with you

1358
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:17,510
ands I don't know you haven't paid your
bills or that a known felon is in your

1359
01:07:17,510 --> 01:07:18,010
house

1360
01:07:18,010 --> 01:07:21,400
and I find that out by like tracking
them inside your home so they're also

1361
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:23,020
the privacy issues around things

1362
01:07:23,020 --> 01:07:26,609
that we need to build pockets and I
don't see a lot of people actively

1363
01:07:26,609 --> 01:07:29,160
building those pockets and reporting
ACII

1364
01:07:29,160 --> 01:07:33,940
ways of communicating yet so that to me
is the problem a PI should be able to

1365
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:34,710
give us some

1366
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:38,020
privacy in some you know who's actually
leading this is so the sass providers

1367
01:07:38,020 --> 01:07:41,619
the sass providers give you the ability
to get services but you can see inside

1368
01:07:41,619 --> 01:07:42,020
them

1369
01:07:42,020 --> 01:07:45,920
they're hiding a lot they're hiding a
lot a really bad behavior

1370
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:49,369
they're not patching they're not
protecting your data but you can see

1371
01:07:49,369 --> 01:07:51,160
that because they create a SASE layer

1372
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:55,220
but your API says my date is my date and
I can see anyone elses date because I'm

1373
01:07:55,220 --> 01:07:57,680
using API not because I'm looking at the
actual

1374
01:07:57,680 --> 01:08:01,349
access controls on the system's behind
the API so

1375
01:08:01,349 --> 01:08:05,210
strangely enough in the model love the
sass if we

1376
01:08:05,210 --> 01:08:09,420
use the sass model her home then we this
leaf litter the upside down

1377
01:08:09,420 --> 01:08:12,460
Google is our customer where the service
provider where

1378
01:08:12,460 --> 01:08:15,690
giving them access to us but they can
see inside they just get what accessed

1379
01:08:15,690 --> 01:08:19,910
you know we give them in our API that we
turn on yep that's the challenge I've

1380
01:08:19,910 --> 01:08:23,069
Internet of Things it's in the tens of
thousands of nodes

1381
01:08:23,069 --> 01:08:26,969
per person not in the the wearable our
discussion is like

1382
01:08:26,969 --> 01:08:32,339
89 maybe 15 devices and i'm talking
about tens of thousands of devices

1383
01:08:32,339 --> 01:08:35,080
which is the industrial Internet of
Things much more complicated than the

1384
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:35,660
wearables

1385
01:08:35,660 --> 01:08:39,650
I thank you
