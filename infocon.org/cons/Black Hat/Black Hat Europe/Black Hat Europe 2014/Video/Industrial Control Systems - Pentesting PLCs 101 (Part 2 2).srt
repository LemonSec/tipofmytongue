1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,830
okay on so what we were doing was

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:07,509
some performing some kind of request to
the medicinal later using

3
00:00:07,509 --> 00:00:11,670
mb2 gets um what we are gonna do now is

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:14,759
are use another tool that is included in

5
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:18,240
Metasploit Framework arm so

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,720
as he takes a long time to launch the

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,140
Metasploit in the VM I suggest that you
start by

8
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:32,140
taping a MSF comes on right now

9
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:36,510
okay so these were the commands used to
perform

10
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:39,760
on the disc worries and no the switch to
the next one

11
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,550
I also we can launch MSF console

12
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:50,550
and then use the modus client which is
and auxiliary month you

13
00:02:02,010 --> 00:02:09,010
still not loaded

14
00:02:11,910 --> 00:02:18,910
some gonna play around a bit and change
the values

15
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:45,910
okay

16
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,860
so here you have the Metasploit console

17
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:52,740
I am it ok if i won if you've been able
to

18
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:58,400
to launch it okay so I will use on the
steering wheel that's

19
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,490
the into scanner

20
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:04,820
SCADA then it's the moment disclaims

21
00:03:04,820 --> 00:03:08,410
by taping in full you can have some
information

22
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:12,230
on the module I am so there was
previously on

23
00:03:12,230 --> 00:03:15,700
my discussion with you that on the alone
people to

24
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,450
the right that use two Koreas so that
was kinda limited so

25
00:03:19,450 --> 00:03:23,540
I on its a modified its so it's no part

26
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:27,080
%uh the it's not part of the Metasploit
Framework

27
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:32,240
so how to use its some first of all you
have to take a look at the what kind of

28
00:03:32,240 --> 00:03:36,670
I action you can do so sure actions I
think

29
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:40,940
yes so you can read cause I'll read the
ridges sir

30
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:44,450
right to call alright to register so

31
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:47,650
for example I'm gonna set action to on

32
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:54,650
read the value other register them

33
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:57,920
I'm gonna take a look at the options so

34
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,410
of course need to set up your targets

35
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:06,910
so once against gonna be localhost some

36
00:04:06,910 --> 00:04:11,550
you have to set the data address where
you want to read for example

37
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:15,160
for me let's say I want to read on

38
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:20,859
$38.5 maybe and then you just

39
00:04:20,859 --> 00:04:24,140
taping the run that so you rhonda Zr
modules

40
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,380
and as you can see

41
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:31,070
and the value stored at the register
number five is for

42
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,280
which is funny

43
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:40,030
because yes

44
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:45,820
took it so let's try something else two
previous address

45
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:49,430
and its 3 so yes you can see that

46
00:04:49,430 --> 00:04:52,630
those are the the values they created

47
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:56,030
on maybe it's not interesting to

48
00:04:56,030 --> 00:05:00,260
but not to let it to spend too much time
just gonna show you that you can modify

49
00:05:00,260 --> 00:05:01,600
the action as well

50
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:08,600
arm right register

51
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:11,430
and then

52
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:14,720
af2 said the data up it's a 12 rights

53
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:18,060
12 tree update addresses for

54
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:22,449
around as you can see

55
00:05:22,449 --> 00:05:26,240
see is that succeeded and it is true

56
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,910
have you been able to do the same

57
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:36,910
for those %uh view waffling okay

58
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:41,660
sorry I R okay

59
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:46,610
I'm gonna try to are well I do not know
to meet

60
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:50,889
text bigger but its modest guy and in
one word everything is lower case

61
00:05:50,889 --> 00:05:54,349
sorry control

62
00:05:54,349 --> 00:05:59,020
up

63
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:06,020
yeah but this

64
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:26,330
he returned and I'm guessing a control

65
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:31,730
minus is for lowering size sheesh

66
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:37,180
lets in my

67
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:44,180
she won my ping is very specific

68
00:06:48,130 --> 00:06:55,130
anyway

69
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:04,680
so let me just go back to the states

70
00:07:08,930 --> 00:07:13,729
yes so home that was in the simulator no
I think it's time to try to move on to

71
00:07:13,729 --> 00:07:14,090
the

72
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:19,289
the real PLC's mom there's something
very important new

73
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:22,740
you should never never never from any
tests on the

74
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:26,189
live ICS systems because there are so
much

75
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:30,990
a at risk I usually what you can do is
try to

76
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:34,750
a do you test on the lab like this one I

77
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:37,990
or you can try to do the test during and
maintenance phase

78
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,020
author planned or factory I'm experience

79
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,080
most factories shut down at least one
which

80
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,060
each year so try to and it's difficult
but

81
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:52,099
I you can try to plan your test during
this specific face

82
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:55,319
on

83
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:58,430
okay so the the first phase I would be
there we come

84
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,949
so we're gonna try to do a port scan and
identify DACs on the network

85
00:08:02,949 --> 00:08:06,520
so adjusts

86
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:10,580
I plugged in I

87
00:08:10,580 --> 00:08:14,440
a WiFi access points sorry

88
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:18,669
so here you have the SSID and the
password

89
00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:25,669
I just try to connect and tell me if it
works yeah it's kinda funny SAT

90
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:52,340
is it okay for you did you succeed in
connecting

91
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:56,070
if so you can try to being

92
00:08:56,070 --> 00:08:59,390
the two PLC's here you have the IP
addresses

93
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:02,820
it's that five hundred Snyder and up 50
for the Siemens

94
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:06,960
they should answer to ping requests

95
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:13,960
let me try yet works for the

96
00:09:16,150 --> 00:09:23,150
Snyder and for the Siemens okay

97
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:27,520
euro swag I'm gonna

98
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:34,520
but you can

99
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,399
okay so let's start with a using

100
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:05,149
and that so and not is the de facto tool
for performing

101
00:10:05,149 --> 00:10:08,589
and again of reconnaissance or let's for
scanning

102
00:10:08,589 --> 00:10:12,120
however it can be quite harmful to do so
on ICS

103
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,579
I on the related subjects are you once I
was

104
00:10:15,579 --> 00:10:19,519
doing some ion penetration tests on
building automation

105
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,250
and i Justi the and that for TCP port
scan

106
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:27,990
of one the was gonna PLC that was
handling the lights

107
00:10:27,990 --> 00:10:32,990
and air conditioning of the building and
then and not

108
00:10:32,990 --> 00:10:36,320
study in hanging and the phone started
ringing so

109
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,720
when you do have been this you know that
when the phone rings it's never good

110
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,130
never good news so actually all the
communication cards

111
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:47,490
just crashed because most of the time
when you're talking

112
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:50,870
I ACS a the devices have that is

113
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:54,120
some reach TCP IP stack so it's quite

114
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,790
easy to to go from a denial-of-service
sometimes

115
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:00,920
only by performing a on and and maps can

116
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:04,990
you can find on also two interesting
stories from the

117
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:08,459
missed standard I would people trying to
bear from

118
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:09,420
a

119
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,440
penetration test nice yes in one case
the loss for

120
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,720
5 now fifty thousand dollars of material

121
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,960
and on the also incident penetration

122
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:23,200
tester on just

123
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,820
made the there was a big problem with
gas distribution so far several

124
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:30,840
hours the company was not able to
distribute gas so

125
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,000
yep it was kind of a big deal so what
you can do to prevent

126
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,200
I am this kind of two incidents on

127
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,710
you can use the the switch scandal a

128
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:44,450
which will really really the make this
can go slower

129
00:11:44,450 --> 00:11:48,910
but it's also safer I you should do a
TCP scan

130
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:52,980
instead of the scenes can on because
when you just seen scan

131
00:11:52,980 --> 00:11:57,540
for some devices they will try to to the
connection open for a long time

132
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,940
since you unit never did a full N Shake
n

133
00:12:00,940 --> 00:12:04,230
that's gonna crush them and also

134
00:12:04,230 --> 00:12:08,530
try not to use any fingerprinting
function and I just use some and not

135
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:09,290
play Kings

136
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:13,880
be wise in the selection of this plugins
on

137
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:17,420
so yeah that's the theory however here a

138
00:12:17,420 --> 00:12:21,050
that's on this a small lab begin the

139
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:24,620
a um

140
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,640
we're gonna tried to me quites

141
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,890
a fast are some that

142
00:12:30,890 --> 00:12:36,499
fire and that

143
00:12:36,499 --> 00:12:39,649
um so you see if a inputs can Jeep

144
00:12:39,649 --> 00:12:42,730
sir scandal they

145
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:46,029
calls on and then I'm gonna

146
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:48,270
try to scanned the

147
00:12:48,270 --> 00:12:55,270
it's a dissonance yep

148
00:12:56,530 --> 00:12:59,910
also includes is to and switch to
prevent

149
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:03,590
up Janice grievous looking

150
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:07,960
so as you can see it's really slow

151
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,030
and I'm using a directs the Ethernet
cable

152
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:15,980
I R on the local network so it's really
slow but

153
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:19,940
that's it it safe for today

154
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:25,790
I'm just going to the classical

155
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:32,790
and thats camp

156
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:47,040
on the gym

157
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:51,230
so you can see the only open service
phone was

158
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:54,370
HTTPS that's because we did not perform

159
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:57,920
afoot to CT scan so if you want jack
cheese can

160
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:01,100
all the ports we have to the use the
peace reach

161
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:04,920
no I'm gonna do it uprooted trees down
if

162
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:11,920
does not that's too long too much time
it's quite long so I'm just gonna

163
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:19,260
give you the answer

164
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:25,930
yet so the two ports that you should be
able to seeing TCP

165
00:14:25,930 --> 00:14:29,280
are 443 that she's wage TBS

166
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:35,330
and 102 that's actually the the
proprietary protocol that cements uses

167
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:36,110
to communicate

168
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:41,920
I with the and programming software
around if they do the same for the

169
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,800
that's it for the Snyder

170
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,690
I just be able to find some FTP HTP

171
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,870
and some might be sports

172
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:59,870
yes they're all open does that work for
you also

173
00:15:13,709 --> 00:15:16,680
get

174
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:19,500
okay so I just cheated because I wanted
to do you

175
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:24,890
to get fast on the and thats can I am
you can also find online some specific

176
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:25,930
and not scripts

177
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:29,320
for ICS I know that digital boned I
really is

178
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,690
some recent leaves I think its project
call the Red points

179
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:36,560
that's a so that could be a nice now
resource to take a look at

180
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,220
and dunno we're gonna use different too

181
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:44,230
that is specifically designed for ICS

182
00:15:44,230 --> 00:15:48,180
was made from the

183
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:51,230
scanner strangelove team it's called

184
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:55,220
PLC scan so it's not like

185
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:59,390
and maps it's not gonna find old open
ports it's just gonna focus

186
00:15:59,390 --> 00:16:02,680
on the muddy sport and the reports used
by Siemens

187
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,200
so it's only a sports getting two ports
thats

188
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:10,170
since these are legitimate requests I am

189
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:17,170
there's really a little chance that you
will crash anything by doing that

190
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,580
so what you can do is go to the tools on
directory

191
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:26,990
and then nation death appearances can I
think

192
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:30,790
up it's a Python script so you can

193
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:34,210
take a look at the source could if you
want um

194
00:16:34,210 --> 00:16:37,820
take a look at the ALP but

195
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:42,920
anyway I'm just going into a classical
scan so with us

196
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,450
underwater ranch so it's you

197
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:51,980
slash 24 so as you can see it's not
really

198
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:57,440
a fast in takes one I P F 21 IP and
tries to communicate with the port

199
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:03,710
102 or 502 so quite quickly we can see
that

200
00:17:03,710 --> 00:17:07,170
on the Snyder on PLC was detected

201
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:11,280
on the unit ID for which

202
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:16,160
the there was a response received is you
are 255

203
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,200
we can see that we have some information
about the

204
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:22,390
the hard when would use so actually

205
00:17:22,390 --> 00:17:26,390
the 2030 is the the mother love the CPU

206
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:31,070
so the

207
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:34,190
the scan is still running I 23 cheese

208
00:17:34,190 --> 00:17:37,850
that fifty when we'll have some
information about the

209
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:44,850
the Siemens Kelsey

210
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:54,610
it working yes K some not gonna wait

211
00:17:54,610 --> 00:17:58,800
I'm just going scanned that fifty

212
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:02,159
and an same way for the Siemens

213
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:05,360
you see that some information was
already

214
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:09,630
I gathered like the few more version all
the hardware division

215
00:18:09,630 --> 00:18:16,300
the the CPU you should get the same
results

216
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:23,300
nope okay

217
00:18:25,409 --> 00:18:25,870
site

218
00:18:25,870 --> 00:18:29,580
the the only difference is that I'm I'm
using the this cable

219
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:33,409
and using the wifi so maybe that's the
source of the program

220
00:18:33,409 --> 00:18:37,169
did work for the

221
00:18:37,169 --> 00:18:41,320
for the Schneider yes and that further
cements okay

222
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:48,320
quite strange fish

223
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:53,400
no actually it's appearances can stir

224
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:57,080
led to the Standard Version eight
downloaded two weeks ago I think

225
00:18:57,080 --> 00:19:01,140
okay so we just

226
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:05,409
so two different ways of a identifying
PLC's on the network

227
00:19:05,409 --> 00:19:08,880
on there's a third way which is cool as
an MP and I'm

228
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:12,480
into show you how actually by default

229
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,179
the PLC is a response to I SNMP requests

230
00:19:16,179 --> 00:19:21,010
so on in

231
00:19:21,010 --> 00:19:25,320
on letting Kelly you have a call to the
school S&P check

232
00:19:25,320 --> 00:19:30,020
I used to switch tea and then you inputs

233
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:33,270
the IP address so in this case

234
00:19:33,270 --> 00:19:36,500
S&P S&P check main st

235
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:41,860
and then at 2.5 and its gonna give you

236
00:19:41,860 --> 00:19:42,690
a

237
00:19:42,690 --> 00:19:48,760
a lot of information so if a start you
out

238
00:19:48,760 --> 00:19:53,640
the hardware version on then you have
the network configuration

239
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:57,290
and then something that's quite
interesting you have the different

240
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:00,490
network who roots configured and also

241
00:20:00,490 --> 00:20:04,090
arm although listening ports on TCP and
you TP

242
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:07,920
so instead of performing in that works
can you just

243
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:11,240
you can just buy from a SNMP requests
and he will tell you

244
00:20:11,240 --> 00:20:15,110
what are the parts available that in
come in the also

245
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:18,670
I can do the same on the

246
00:20:18,670 --> 00:20:22,490
cements I think I should get similar
results

247
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:26,430
on you see that there is

248
00:20:26,430 --> 00:20:30,060
three different you DP ports I actually
do not know

249
00:20:30,060 --> 00:20:37,060
what the last two are used for and I do
not have the

250
00:20:37,660 --> 00:20:41,560
on the stuff i listening to seaports

251
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,910
so did not have the same level of
information but

252
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:49,570
that's an interesting to know just by
sending a SNMP request again

253
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:56,570
gether interesting information

254
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:03,130
yes exactly if for example

255
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:07,150
some maybe it's a good idea I'm going
try to do that so

256
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:10,250
I will launch Unity Pro

257
00:21:10,250 --> 00:21:17,250
which is Snyder programming software kid

258
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:29,549
I'm going to try to connect and

259
00:21:29,549 --> 00:21:35,660
say yes now I'm connected I'm going

260
00:21:35,660 --> 00:21:39,730
stop kilts again and

261
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:46,730
and then we sit on that five say yes

262
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:54,840
wat thats me there should be

263
00:21:55,160 --> 00:22:01,340
so you actually have the IP address of
the programming software and also

264
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:01,980
someone

265
00:22:01,980 --> 00:22:08,710
on the FTP yes

266
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:12,370
do not use it during this a
demonstration but yes

267
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:16,790
I think it should be a 51% of something
a piano between 50 and 60 Donna

268
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:20,130
sovereignty some just but the PLC back
in

269
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:24,390
start mode that's way too late shift of
some

270
00:22:24,390 --> 00:22:31,390
okay

271
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:38,529
and back on

272
00:22:38,529 --> 00:22:41,929
okay it's the next what we can do is try
to take a look

273
00:22:41,929 --> 00:22:45,200
and those a let's say interfaces that we
discovered

274
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:49,809
for example the FTP DHCP try to find
something new abilities

275
00:22:49,809 --> 00:22:53,510
I once again ever everything that i'm
gonna demonstrate his

276
00:22:53,510 --> 00:22:56,860
already known so on o0 day today

277
00:22:56,860 --> 00:23:00,669
um okay so

278
00:23:00,669 --> 00:23:07,669
let's take a look at the web interface
actually I think it will not work on

279
00:23:09,649 --> 00:23:12,750
%um because I failed to instill DJ the

280
00:23:12,750 --> 00:23:17,380
might be uploading and web interface
after Schneider

281
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:21,039
heavily relies on the J the habits

282
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:25,049
so I can see really looks like the one
from the internet

283
00:23:25,049 --> 00:23:30,450
and

284
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:35,640
for example if they try to go to the
Monitoring tab I just have to option

285
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:39,080
the call data a detour I'm gonna kick
understand the one

286
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,270
and then have on but that a

287
00:23:42,270 --> 00:23:46,000
asked me to input some I password

288
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,100
so do you know the password it anyone
try to guess the password

289
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:54,130
sorry nope

290
00:23:54,130 --> 00:24:01,039
yes and the password nope

291
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:06,760
user user these conventions of course

292
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:09,779
for yet for

293
00:24:09,779 --> 00:24:13,799
so here you can see that you have a nice
job a plate that shouldn't

294
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:17,899
allow you to bed from some can of
modification on PLC

295
00:24:17,899 --> 00:24:20,909
you should modify them should be able to
modify them the

296
00:24:20,909 --> 00:24:24,260
some data arm I think the

297
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:27,330
the value of the register and the cause

298
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:31,820
what else do you have on

299
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:36,010
basically you can see what the PLC look
like

300
00:24:36,010 --> 00:24:40,200
if you're not just near the PLC and you
can see that it's in RUN mode

301
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:47,200
and then you haven't input/output card
some information about the

302
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:53,460
somewhere and in the setup menu you can
we face some

303
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:58,299
some of the things I like the HTP access
rights

304
00:24:58,299 --> 00:25:01,919
and the specific passwords okay

305
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,490
com so now what

306
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:11,020
be can do is on let me go back here

307
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:15,929
so I told you there is a lot of several
Jeff applets on the server

308
00:25:15,929 --> 00:25:20,200
whatsoever the if you look in the files
directory on the VM those

309
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:25,100
a subdirectory that's cool jars and that
contains all the jet outlets

310
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:28,419
that they recovered from the

311
00:25:28,419 --> 00:25:35,419
from the PLC

312
00:25:36,270 --> 00:25:39,000
are so what will be interesting to do is
try to

313
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:42,680
a let city come by and those outlets or
perform any gain of

314
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,730
I mmm analysis to see what's

315
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:49,760
what he is in the yep that's so the most
basic one would be to perform a

316
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:55,230
the string query of course are some
gonna

317
00:25:55,230 --> 00:25:59,580
look for and the the a word that's
longer the six characters

318
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:02,670
in the in the app lets

319
00:26:02,670 --> 00:26:07,090
and here you can pick whatever you

320
00:26:07,090 --> 00:26:11,420
whichever you want I'm gonna pledges
strings

321
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:18,420
sorry

322
00:26:19,090 --> 00:26:19,830
yes it worse

323
00:26:19,830 --> 00:26:23,070
we're gonna see I'm

324
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:28,730
I puppy by Pete into more so as you can
see you can find some

325
00:26:28,730 --> 00:26:32,700
information on and what we are going to
look for his

326
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:35,720
maybe I don't know we can't

327
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:39,090
retro password or username things like
that

328
00:26:39,090 --> 00:26:42,880
anyway you can see that you can record
some kind of information

329
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:49,880
I think you

330
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:53,780
also should have I'll on your VM

331
00:26:53,780 --> 00:26:57,300
arm let's go into the tools

332
00:26:57,300 --> 00:27:00,580
directory should have something that's
cool the

333
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:05,480
GD day which is a java Decompiler so on
my VM it's not working but

334
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:11,910
you should launch it I'm gonna launches
and I host so if I open the same jar

335
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:12,470
file

336
00:27:12,470 --> 00:27:17,010
a with the java Decompiler and I take a
look

337
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:21,320
are let's see maybe at the I do not
remember it is

338
00:27:21,320 --> 00:27:25,160
there is a missed package and down

339
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:32,160
I globe icon thing could be interesting
so as you can see there's something

340
00:27:32,370 --> 00:27:32,710
called

341
00:27:32,710 --> 00:27:36,160
FTP loading and FTP password how could
it into this

342
00:27:36,160 --> 00:27:39,160
J that lets so would look for changing
the password

343
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:44,410
and as suggest we try to connect to the
FTP service using those

344
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:48,010
credential to see if they really work or
if they do not work

345
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:55,010
I think you already know the answer

346
00:28:14,380 --> 00:28:17,460
here you can find the crates the user
name is seized the egg

347
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:24,460
and the password is factory cast at
Snyder so with these two credentials you

348
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:28,830
should be able to connect to the

349
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:32,860
FTP server or above the Snyder and then
you can try to find

350
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:36,799
all the facts that you won't you will
also be able to find the file that

351
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,470
contains the word the user

352
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:42,230
which is the username and the password
required for the

353
00:28:42,230 --> 00:28:49,230
web interface

354
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:06,220
sign up its

355
00:29:06,220 --> 00:29:13,220
too much complex of for password so you
can see that things

356
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:22,420
on

357
00:29:22,420 --> 00:29:26,220
and in the RDT and directory at the root
of the

358
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:29,440
FTP server you can find failed at school

359
00:29:29,440 --> 00:29:33,660
that's where doctor Rd I think it's
already in the VM and it only contains

360
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:40,660
the word user

361
00:29:51,619 --> 00:29:57,690
months it's good that too said okay so
that was a few

362
00:29:57,690 --> 00:30:00,929
example of what we can do with the
standard interfaces

363
00:30:00,929 --> 00:30:05,639
and I think now it's time to I to move
on to use

364
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:10,029
ICS specific protocols and
vulnerabilities I am

365
00:30:10,029 --> 00:30:13,119
so yes I

366
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:16,659
let sit for the Snyder what you can try
to do is modify the value

367
00:30:16,659 --> 00:30:20,129
up some registers to be able to I

368
00:30:20,129 --> 00:30:23,379
but the lights on as you can see there's
only one the

369
00:30:23,379 --> 00:30:26,710
is on at the moment I think to
additional the

370
00:30:26,710 --> 00:30:30,389
lambskin be turned on by modifying the
but his value

371
00:30:30,389 --> 00:30:33,809
and for the cements you have on

372
00:30:33,809 --> 00:30:37,570
in the tools I R slash Skansen

373
00:30:37,570 --> 00:30:40,869
directory you have to the specific tools
that I

374
00:30:40,869 --> 00:30:45,200
a wrote for the seaman's and you can
also read the different values and

375
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,159
modify the values

376
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:49,789
so of course if everyone does it at the
same time it's gonna be a

377
00:30:49,789 --> 00:30:56,789
can have a mess but I think we can try

378
00:31:06,550 --> 00:31:10,180
ok yes I'm gonna use MBT gets on tour

379
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:17,180
on Etsy read values ok

380
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:34,670
king

381
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:37,080
and now I'm gonna try to modify some
value so

382
00:31:37,080 --> 00:31:41,250
clearly these depends on the way the PLC
was programmed

383
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:44,610
are so for example make is I can tell
you

384
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:48,950
if you the change the value 21 good just
to find the right address

385
00:31:48,950 --> 00:31:52,050
and it should do that but the other
lights

386
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:55,240
on think it's dead just nine maybe yes

387
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:59,740
and there should be another one maybe

388
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:04,160
aids nope them

389
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,600
yes the last one's broken so are

390
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:11,760
I'll let you play with it for a few
minutes to make sure that works

391
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:15,720
of course at the same time we should be

392
00:32:15,720 --> 00:32:19,030
you could be using white shark to take a
look at the data packets but

393
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:26,030
it's exactly the same as what we've done
with the simulator

394
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:39,710
so for example if used the same a common
but you replace one bay 0 you should be

395
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:40,590
able to turn

396
00:32:40,590 --> 00:32:47,590
one of the light of

397
00:32:57,289 --> 00:33:03,830
yes

398
00:33:03,830 --> 00:33:10,830
and if we all do it at the same time is
gonna go crazy I have no idea actually

399
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:13,860
it

400
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:17,200
depends in does not depend on the PLC
and

401
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:20,650
are you some kind of electrical relays
because the PLC uses

402
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:25,760
20 24 volts a for the outputs and the
lamps on the UES 12

403
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,350
so I think if we do it all at the same
time we

404
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:32,460
maybe in two or three days we're going
to break the relays because the

405
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:35,560
they have a limited the life span

406
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:41,960
but that's all the PNC is not going to
be broken sir

407
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:45,350
yes also because that's the

408
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:51,660
lets the home router so yep okay so
apparently that works

409
00:33:51,660 --> 00:33:55,520
um then week could also try

410
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:58,940
our yeah something it's also interesting
um

411
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:04,360
whatever you you do I you I think there
is one laid that you will not be able to

412
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:07,620
to modify why because

413
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:10,670
if during the the program that they put
in the PLC

414
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:14,760
I said a for example Deslatte should be
on

415
00:34:14,760 --> 00:34:18,240
the PLC as a that says secure cycle

416
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:22,640
so every I think it's around twenty or
thirty seconds

417
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:27,020
between check in in with the that's a
reprocess all the program

418
00:34:27,020 --> 00:34:30,030
so even if you can't undervalued you off

419
00:34:30,030 --> 00:34:33,420
printing League seconds later is going
to come back to haunt so

420
00:34:33,420 --> 00:34:36,960
you with you as you can see the anything
up in

421
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:40,580
now ok if so no for the

422
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:45,520
much further cements an issue going to
the scan 7 folder you can see

423
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:49,610
side that you have there are several I

424
00:34:49,610 --> 00:34:53,470
by some scripts they devote myself on

425
00:34:53,470 --> 00:34:55,859
if you use the review

426
00:34:55,859 --> 00:35:00,920
on and you inputs and the IP address

427
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:05,759
yes they should be able to see the the
value of the input and outputs

428
00:35:05,759 --> 00:35:09,059
I'm gonna just Nichole deste and

429
00:35:09,059 --> 00:35:16,059
3p the two first speech and if they do
it again

430
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:23,799
yes can see that a input 0 NE points1

431
00:35:23,799 --> 00:35:27,160
are no set to 1 and also the outputs

432
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:32,410
that depends of course on the
programming software does that work for

433
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:34,730
you also for the scenes because we had
problems before

434
00:35:34,730 --> 00:35:41,210
with the PLC's can thats

435
00:35:41,210 --> 00:35:44,670
exact them that's the request that's
written it's a

436
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:48,019
by phone and you use nondescript okay

437
00:35:48,019 --> 00:35:52,869
great I also know as you can see

438
00:35:52,869 --> 00:35:56,569
in the directory does also I am as

439
00:35:56,569 --> 00:36:03,130
creep that the scald right outputs so
I'm going try to use that one

440
00:36:03,130 --> 00:36:08,769
and on the para- meters

441
00:36:08,769 --> 00:36:12,109
the first one is the IP address and the
other one now

442
00:36:12,109 --> 00:36:16,249
lets its your another really good
programmer so

443
00:36:16,249 --> 00:36:19,480
I am there are five outputs for the

444
00:36:19,480 --> 00:36:23,519
this kind of Siemens PLC so here you
just have to input

445
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:27,239
a a1 for each of the Open 2012

446
00:36:27,239 --> 00:36:30,369
but to on an issue but 20 it that's

447
00:36:30,369 --> 00:36:33,380
on change to of so I think

448
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:36,529
this one this will shut the lights

449
00:36:36,529 --> 00:36:40,019
of and the switch should

450
00:36:40,019 --> 00:36:43,299
two or three on yet sry but again

451
00:36:43,299 --> 00:36:47,140
anyone doing the same with different
value the Tudor the last one gets the

452
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:52,460
last word

453
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:53,890
and this time on the Siemens

454
00:36:53,890 --> 00:36:58,099
at the relays I actually part of the PLC
so I'm sure if we

455
00:36:58,099 --> 00:37:01,300
a all send different comments we can
break the

456
00:37:01,300 --> 00:37:04,420
actual PNC sometimes

457
00:37:04,420 --> 00:37:11,420
Sunday and there is a nice clicking also

458
00:37:17,950 --> 00:37:21,920
okay so this creates a I'm not online
yet they will be on my YouTube

459
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:26,160
I maybe this weekend I dunno of course
it depends on the configuration of the

460
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:26,940
PLC

461
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:30,670
I I use a specific labor real so

462
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:35,220
I that's cold snap 7 was developed to a
low third party to develop

463
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:40,380
a software that communicates with PLC so
I'm just using snaps on and

464
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:44,560
a by them right rubber so it's really a
basic script

465
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:51,560
do not look at the source code its
sheets but it works

466
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:03,790
okay so this was for the first part

467
00:38:03,790 --> 00:38:06,950
and then a lot to up

468
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:11,180
other things to show you I think someone
already tried the first one

469
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:15,020
which is the Metasploit module two but
the PLC in the stop

470
00:38:15,020 --> 00:38:19,710
are starts mode I'll its action action
that this

471
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:23,480
the done and the thick and then on and
think take it away

472
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:28,860
sorry so I'm hoping I have one

473
00:38:28,860 --> 00:38:35,860
and the console still open and no

474
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:47,200
yes okay so this time gonna use

475
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,450
it's also in talks in your mobile it's
in admin SCADA

476
00:38:51,450 --> 00:38:58,450
and then are money gone command I think

477
00:39:04,420 --> 00:39:06,780
see if you take a look at the info its

478
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:10,480
actually some something that was I am
discovered by

479
00:39:10,480 --> 00:39:15,460
digital boned um I suggest by running
this module you

480
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:18,630
also run Wireshark I'm gonna do that and

481
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:21,970
listen 210

482
00:39:21,970 --> 00:39:28,970
mean to face at least this one do K

483
00:39:32,020 --> 00:39:35,240
I'll sleep of course have to set the
targets

484
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:42,240
it's not this one and a and just a plain
wrong

485
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:48,110
and it shuts down

486
00:39:48,110 --> 00:39:51,430
okay Sonam gonna take a look

487
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:56,690
at the where shark capture K

488
00:39:56,690 --> 00:40:00,860
so I you can see scenes neck act

489
00:40:00,860 --> 00:40:05,650
and then some not be square is on

490
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:09,400
if we take a close look

491
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:15,830
same as before transaction identify or

492
00:40:15,830 --> 00:40:19,510
0 but that's interesting

493
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:23,510
the common that I sent

494
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:26,980
actually uses and unknown function code
which is 90

495
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:30,010
of 5 a hex to I

496
00:40:30,010 --> 00:40:34,790
send specific comments to the last night
a PLC so that's an old heredity

497
00:40:34,790 --> 00:40:38,390
to my knowledge its does never been I

498
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:42,660
fixed and then

499
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:46,600
mean when you said not to run you can
the but the PLC back to run

500
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,920
sometimes it will not work right away

501
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,490
because there is some kind of
reservation mechanism and if I put them

502
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:55,260
kids seem to stop mode

503
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:58,560
have to wait several minutes to set it
to run again depending

504
00:40:58,560 --> 00:41:05,560
so that could be also can have a big
year for clients because

505
00:41:05,810 --> 00:41:09,050
ish all the PLC's of shut down and do
you produce nothing on you plan to

506
00:41:09,050 --> 00:41:09,830
factories 0

507
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:16,830
up

508
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:25,160
K than the last 1i want sure you still
in

509
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:29,190
I'll auxiliary and mean scaled up

510
00:41:29,190 --> 00:41:32,820
so it's called with the constructs

511
00:41:32,820 --> 00:41:35,850
sticks transfer and there is and
underscore

512
00:41:35,850 --> 00:41:38,950
as: or they're shown so it's a version
that I modified

513
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:44,490
I think it's in the neutral as of today
it's not part of the Metasploit module

514
00:41:44,490 --> 00:41:45,010
because

515
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:48,220
I lets its not really greatly

516
00:41:48,220 --> 00:41:51,870
coded and also it does not work all the
time

517
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:56,090
and it's a modification of the

518
00:41:56,090 --> 00:41:59,420
original you buy digital bond because
there was some

519
00:41:59,420 --> 00:42:02,590
specific issues I in the emerging budget

520
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:05,710
digital bond on some of the counter

521
00:42:05,710 --> 00:42:09,330
where not right so I just

522
00:42:09,330 --> 00:42:12,460
I modified some I've the codes

523
00:42:12,460 --> 00:42:17,170
down and I'll also added an action that
those together information

524
00:42:17,170 --> 00:42:24,170
are so let's run that's

525
00:42:26,829 --> 00:42:31,489
and that's if it works as the you know
the PLC's in the stop mode but yes it

526
00:42:31,489 --> 00:42:31,949
works

527
00:42:31,949 --> 00:42:35,479
so you can recover the PNC model

528
00:42:35,479 --> 00:42:38,650
product name as you can see it's not
correctly decoded

529
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:42,910
you can see that it was the done using
Unity software version 5

530
00:42:42,910 --> 00:42:46,289
and then you can see the comments up the
project so

531
00:42:46,289 --> 00:42:50,130
that may or may not be interesting arm

532
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:54,829
what's really interesting is to be able
to said the action to download

533
00:42:54,829 --> 00:42:58,179
and then they just f2

534
00:42:58,179 --> 00:43:01,219
but the file name or so policy slash
words

535
00:43:01,219 --> 00:43:07,760
much test it peaks

536
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,150
so this could take some time I'm gonna
take a look at

537
00:43:10,150 --> 00:43:14,900
Wireshark to see what's going on as you
can see

538
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:18,140
more Modbus on TCP requests

539
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:21,520
still using the function got ninety

540
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,660
so I'm actually retreating to program at
the PLC using

541
00:43:25,660 --> 00:43:28,740
a modest command which is an
authenticated and and untreated

542
00:43:28,740 --> 00:43:35,740
ok is apparently it worked

543
00:43:47,860 --> 00:43:51,810
it's a program of a decision that
someone made to use and nothin TKD

544
00:43:51,810 --> 00:43:52,890
protocol to

545
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:56,520
I lows arbitrary download of the program
file yes

546
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:59,640
that's actually not part of the modest
particle at all it's not in the

547
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:00,400
specification

548
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:07,400
yes action this

549
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:10,940
this a specific amount of Siemens does
not support not just a default

550
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:14,500
I'll so yes I can that uses
vulnerability however

551
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:17,860
in the past I think that someone who
presented at

552
00:44:17,860 --> 00:44:21,180
like at the US a in 2011

553
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:24,840
the demonstrated something new abilities
like and authenticated

554
00:44:24,840 --> 00:44:28,590
start and stop on the seaman's and
different kind of

555
00:44:28,590 --> 00:44:32,640
the denial of service on but I'm not
sure he was able to download the program

556
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:37,680
on much about that so as you can see

557
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:42,440
the this that a peaks just the just a
classical 58

558
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:46,710
I own lets you gonna

559
00:44:46,710 --> 00:44:49,720
tried to take a look at the XD to

560
00:44:49,720 --> 00:44:53,180
nothing really interesting

561
00:44:53,180 --> 00:45:00,180
at least at the beginning here you can
see

562
00:45:00,990 --> 00:45:04,110
thats on this is the project name of

563
00:45:04,110 --> 00:45:07,940
on the program this is the comments that
have been

564
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:11,050
d-unity there some so

565
00:45:11,050 --> 00:45:17,510
I think the get tech works

566
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:20,510
then you would see I a lot of error
messages

567
00:45:20,510 --> 00:45:24,589
written in French I do not know it's if
it's in French because

568
00:45:24,589 --> 00:45:27,880
the Snyder is a French company or
because I'm using a French version of

569
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:28,630
the software

570
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:35,630
I have no idea so yes here you can see
that we we covered the

571
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:39,760
the program um

572
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:44,349
the thing is at the moment you do not
know how to use it

573
00:45:44,349 --> 00:45:48,690
on because AP excited will not be opened
directly by Unity Pro

574
00:45:48,690 --> 00:45:52,050
so what they did to be able to exploit
its is

575
00:45:52,050 --> 00:45:55,960
trade and then the project in Unity Pro
arcade it's

576
00:45:55,960 --> 00:45:59,010
and then its a filed with the

577
00:45:59,010 --> 00:46:02,619
STA extension then you just rename to
zip

578
00:46:02,619 --> 00:46:06,349
you and the pits and you can see what's
inside I think I have it on

579
00:46:06,349 --> 00:46:12,750
may VM maybe

580
00:46:12,750 --> 00:46:19,750
nope have to switch to the other VM

581
00:46:29,110 --> 00:46:32,840
okay

582
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:37,650
here and establish that it

583
00:46:37,650 --> 00:46:42,730
yes so here we are classical st5 so
that's an archive of the Unity Project

584
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:49,110
kit

585
00:46:49,110 --> 00:46:56,110
know it's as if I

586
00:46:57,779 --> 00:47:01,229
I asked to consider Rd from five to go
to been a PU have

587
00:47:01,229 --> 00:47:05,289
been station at a peaks so actually all
you have to do is replace

588
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:08,700
this it peaks failed by the one you just
download with the module

589
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:11,710
UN rename it to station at 8px and then
you can

590
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:14,739
open the project immunity so that means
you have

591
00:47:14,739 --> 00:47:18,670
the led to the wall source code of the
pier above the PLC project on a computer

592
00:47:18,670 --> 00:47:23,890
so that's gonna interesting what's also
interesting is the vulnerability allows

593
00:47:23,890 --> 00:47:25,289
you to perform just the opposite

594
00:47:25,289 --> 00:47:28,979
in by the opposite I mean reprogram the
PLC

595
00:47:28,979 --> 00:47:32,599
using the same functions so that's also
can have a big deal because you could

596
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:36,220
polity seriously disrupt the industrial
process

597
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:43,220
by doing so so if you want to you if you
want to use the Metasploit module

598
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:49,200
I owe you can do its buts relief several
people do it at the same time that show

599
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:50,549
it's going to work but you can't write

600
00:47:50,549 --> 00:47:57,549
my guest

601
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:05,170
okay and that leads me to the conclusion
of this

602
00:48:05,170 --> 00:48:08,580
our workshop mom I think I've
demonstrated

603
00:48:08,580 --> 00:48:13,140
a lot of in their abilities of the bad
behavior in ICS

604
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:16,580
now the question is what can we do about
its I am

605
00:48:16,580 --> 00:48:19,740
you can try to do some things you have
to do that's you have to know that's not

606
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:20,190
really

607
00:48:20,190 --> 00:48:23,609
easy but network segmentation for
example

608
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:27,670
I as they demonstrated we showed on you
can find ICS

609
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:31,140
on the Internet that's not normal I do
not understand what

610
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:34,290
it is the case so I that's the first
step

611
00:48:34,290 --> 00:48:37,990
exit actually scan the internet as you
should I'm to find you on

612
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:41,710
ACS and be sure that they are not on the
internets

613
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:45,720
South some of my clients needs and they
found some interesting things

614
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:50,690
certainly you should also restrict your
access from the corporate network to the

615
00:48:50,690 --> 00:48:51,420
ACS

616
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:54,950
to prevent I think us from getting in
for example when we've got from

617
00:48:54,950 --> 00:48:56,109
penetration test like

618
00:48:56,109 --> 00:48:59,359
ninety-five percent of the time we get
admin and

619
00:48:59,359 --> 00:49:03,210
a the Windows admin Active Directory
domain

620
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:07,160
so if it's easy to go from the corporate
network to the ACS we gonna

621
00:49:07,160 --> 00:49:10,940
also be a admin of the ICS that's that's
not acceptable

622
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:14,420
I batch when you can so

623
00:49:14,420 --> 00:49:17,490
yes even if you do it only once a year
try to apply

624
00:49:17,490 --> 00:49:21,089
security to bed she is on your PLC's

625
00:49:21,089 --> 00:49:24,460
on a Windows machine you can also do the
same if you have to

626
00:49:24,460 --> 00:49:27,940
the just use a dedicated WSUS for you
ICS

627
00:49:27,940 --> 00:49:31,960
that's not the problem can be done um

628
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:36,150
try to apply some corporate best
practices so changing default password

629
00:49:36,150 --> 00:49:39,349
that something what what not no yet

630
00:49:39,349 --> 00:49:42,650
not everybody does it on the corporate
network but most people do

631
00:49:42,650 --> 00:49:45,700
you should try to do the same on the ice
yes when you can

632
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:48,900
of course for the hot good credentials
you can't but

633
00:49:48,900 --> 00:49:52,490
at least do what you can do the same the
same for the

634
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:56,790
services on specific model of PLC can
disable the web server you can disable

635
00:49:56,790 --> 00:49:57,240
the

636
00:49:57,240 --> 00:50:00,869
on the FTP server most of the time
nobody use it

637
00:50:00,869 --> 00:50:06,589
so just disable it and then the most
important point I think it's time to

638
00:50:06,589 --> 00:50:09,450
start monitoring the security of the ACS

639
00:50:09,450 --> 00:50:13,910
so there are some IPS absence specific
signatures for ICS

640
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:17,630
you can also define your own that's that
they're complicated and

641
00:50:17,630 --> 00:50:21,410
I in order to be efficient I think we
have to start today trying to

642
00:50:21,410 --> 00:50:24,839
step-by-step monitoring some part of its
and

643
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:28,030
to to be able to to make it work
tomorrow at the

644
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:31,180
bro the level and so I was looking for a

645
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:34,200
a good conclusion but they did not find
any so I just put

646
00:50:34,200 --> 00:50:38,990
to funny pictures the to remind us that
yes we can do some things to secure the

647
00:50:38,990 --> 00:50:40,800
ACS but it's really really costly

648
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,480
and thats also laypeople do not do it
just simply

649
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:48,220
did you have any question for me

650
00:50:48,220 --> 00:50:51,329
now I think s speak a lot but

651
00:50:51,329 --> 00:50:55,730
I'll be happy to answer any question can
also

652
00:50:55,730 --> 00:51:02,730
still Android allowed for a few minutes
if you want to try to crash everything

653
00:51:05,120 --> 00:51:06,330
no okay thank you the
