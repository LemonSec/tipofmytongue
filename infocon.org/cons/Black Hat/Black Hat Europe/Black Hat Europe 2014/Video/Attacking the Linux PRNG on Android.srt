1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,379
hi man I miss Academy I'm secure their
senator

2
00:00:03,379 --> 00:00:06,799
I've been secure the system's and today
I would present an attack

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,580
we develop in the Linux on the number de
Naito on Android

4
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:13,620
I would begin to talk with

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:17,940
what motivated us to conduct this
asserts and why we needed

6
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:21,400
to attack the on the Magento with that
had a brief

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,880
simplified overview of how the on the
number generator walks

8
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:31,800
and I'll point out a flaw and its design
using this knowledge

9
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,610
I will be able to outline our tax i'm ok
and put a

10
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:39,120
two manifestations that famous the first
one

11
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,860
acquire some local presence the attacker
on the device

12
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:47,170
and another manifestation can be

13
00:00:47,170 --> 00:00:52,520
employees motivated attack a finally
with discuss

14
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,559
congregations that are used in your
devices and how some of them might not

15
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:57,289
be as good as

16
00:00:57,289 --> 00:01:03,609
they seem so the snow is that

17
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:07,090
over a year ago we found the classic
stock-based buffer overflow

18
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:07,860
vulnerability

19
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:12,080
in one of the most critical services
Android the keys to service

20
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,430
the key so service is responsible if so
Inc

21
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:19,729
people elected that a such as private
SAT's began to this

22
00:01:19,729 --> 00:01:23,360
et cetera reported our findings to
Google

23
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,509
and at they fixed it in Kit Kat he also
published a white paper

24
00:01:28,509 --> 00:01:31,780
I got in this one ability and mowing
question can be found there

25
00:01:31,780 --> 00:01:35,409
you know that okay they're walking
exploits

26
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:38,720
an attack a mass overcome several
defense mechanisms

27
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,530
I and that's what makes it a

28
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,610
which is imposed by the case of service
and other defense mechanisms which I

29
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,100
imposed by the operating system

30
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,250
and for instance at the space layout
randomization

31
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:56,549
SL that Execution Prevention the EP

32
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:00,630
our dept and stock analysts debt

33
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:03,780
I from Exeter and the Dept defense
mechanisms

34
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:07,450
can be I bypassed using an iPhone a
medic

35
00:02:07,450 --> 00:02:10,759
it then re-entered programming show code

36
00:02:10,759 --> 00:02:14,610
and the guy thing SNR what you've seen
is that whenever we cash

37
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:18,150
the key so service the operating system
response the

38
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:21,300
with a new randomized other states that
out

39
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:24,430
and an attacker can use this property to
defeat

40
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:27,630
SL in our eyes

41
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:31,270
the most formidable up sicko an attacker
would face when

42
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:34,459
Ekman trying to exploit this
vulnerability with me with

43
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:40,959
overcoming that kinda is the fast
mechanism p.m.

44
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,780
on Android stuck anna is a fun bites

45
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,760
that I used to detect stock-based buffer
overflows

46
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:53,560
before the execution of malicious code
canaco

47
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,360
I am the enforcement of the kennedys
requested joint

48
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,390
eso between the compiler and the
operating system on the one hand

49
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:06,080
the operating system offer funding bites
to process

50
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,750
and on the Honda the other hand the boss
has been a image

51
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:14,410
must be compiled with stuck protection
when the stock

52
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:17,940
but that the flag is used the compiler
its code to the Bulldog

53
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,930
and Epico each function in a blog its
code that

54
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:25,220
sends a copy obvious that Kennedy just

55
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:30,299
before just after the save it on this
and in the epilogue

56
00:03:30,299 --> 00:03:34,350
just before the code that jumps to that
save it down to this:

57
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:39,030
its code that checks if their original
value of the stock any

58
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:43,290
is the same as a saved copy of that and
I if there is a mismatch

59
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:49,459
I the poll done with class itself okay
so

60
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:53,350
before other it so quickly am

61
00:03:53,350 --> 00:03:57,000
when the Bionic lead to see which is on
under its new its implementation

62
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,340
was though then I it directly expected

63
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,590
photo on the bites front on the number
generator

64
00:04:03,590 --> 00:04:10,050
on Android phone quickly and unloads I
am

65
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:13,340
went about eclipse is loaded it takes
the most

66
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:17,139
the form %uh significant bites of
something we call

67
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:20,799
the 80 on them they deny them is a
process

68
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:24,310
is that is a pointer 216 on the bites
that

69
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:28,340
each process has I am date on them gets
allocated

70
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:31,950
doing the foreskin nation and every
process has it

71
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:37,169
in its other space I am I know its buses
kitchen mother is a unix-like

72
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:40,260
bosses cash in mother where down forces

73
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:43,370
is the folk system call 2k the child
process

74
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:46,639
which is identical to it spent and then
usually

75
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:51,870
is a member this existing code is used
to replace the chines bennett image

76
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:55,330
with anyone now the existing call

77
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:59,960
does about thanks but to important think
that it does also

78
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,010
is that it enforces SLR

79
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:06,700
meaning it to determine status this
layout up the process

80
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:11,270
and the other thing is that it populates
dogs in effect of the process

81
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:14,300
dogs in a bit though is a mechanism

82
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:17,850
of communicating information from Canada
to use a space

83
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:21,560
dogs into that though has a fighter
which is causing

84
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:24,639
the a tandem which binds to 16 on the
bites

85
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,000
which us our in the process outer space
so

86
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,060
whenever Exec system call is used 16 on
the bites

87
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,979
are expected form the other members and
I don't outpaced

88
00:05:36,979 --> 00:05:40,660
someone and other space at the process
and appointed to

89
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:44,250
by to 89.2 and again

90
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:49,030
on tabloid 4.3 and on once went about
eclipse see though it's

91
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:54,370
it takes them for most significant bites
of the eighty on them and place them

92
00:05:54,370 --> 00:06:00,070
as the kennedy is a member this debt
plus cash in on that we will get back to

93
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:00,360
it

94
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:05,349
when I'll describe one of our attacked
us guess so

95
00:06:05,349 --> 00:06:08,639
the at some picnics that use to

96
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:13,430
a overcome stuck in it is the first
technique is and they've both force

97
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:16,539
attack which is inefficient inning in

98
00:06:16,539 --> 00:06:21,300
and im in Paktika to do so on a device

99
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,919
other techniques across some special
feature

100
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,479
fund the process we want to attack for
example and information equator vs

101
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:32,539
part so even the whole kinda value and
if

102
00:06:32,539 --> 00:06:36,030
your in iraqi you could somehow at I'm

103
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:39,610
all that I this tactic got pointer which
points to that

104
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:43,759
at to the Canada value in the process I
am

105
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,820
unfortunately none of these non
techniques well epic event in our case

106
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:51,300
so we had to take it the other

107
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,990
different approach and instead of thank
outta or bypass

108
00:06:54,990 --> 00:06:58,060
that stock Kennedy protection on

109
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:03,000
I'm we had thought why not to attack

110
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:07,009
at this also find the mess in the system
which creates which gives us

111
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:10,650
actually done the bites that Canada
value so

112
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:15,060
what he did we I am we reconstructed the
state

113
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:19,229
the other knowledge and I don't not
using that echoes for today

114
00:07:19,229 --> 00:07:23,949
okay so let's wrap up think so we found
availability in a critical service in

115
00:07:23,949 --> 00:07:24,470
online

116
00:07:24,470 --> 00:07:28,030
in an effort to exploit it we had to
overcome speck nd

117
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:31,289
we will unable to do so using an

118
00:07:31,289 --> 00:07:34,789
using on technics kennedy's a full on
the bites

119
00:07:34,789 --> 00:07:38,020
that out expect that fund the Linux on
the members and I don't

120
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:42,340
and initially we aim to find a weakness

121
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:46,539
in the other number generator so we
could have some intelligent guess

122
00:07:46,539 --> 00:07:52,120
of what that Canada maybe and instead we
end up with a full-fledged attack

123
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,639
under Linux on the number tonight though
an elite get

124
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:00,570
so now we know why you want to attack
the numbers and I saw

125
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:04,250
before we get to how actually do it and
with

126
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,789
simplified overview of how than the
number generator actually looks

127
00:08:07,789 --> 00:08:11,099
so the Linux on the Magento

128
00:08:11,099 --> 00:08:14,850
maintains the poets pool is just now

129
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:18,270
gotta love bites in purple the blocking
cool

130
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:21,650
and in other people and elemental nice

131
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:25,560
such as i mix between you mean impotence

132
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:30,450
or at timex between this access events
is inserted into the in purple

133
00:08:30,450 --> 00:08:33,669
and and estimate of how much

134
00:08:33,669 --> 00:08:37,020
and poppy was set at is kept by the
count

135
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,370
by the other number denied if

136
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:43,820
if that on the number generator is
working properly

137
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:47,150
this in that I meant a nice which is in
the in purple

138
00:08:47,150 --> 00:08:51,700
would propagate into the block below and
a number of people

139
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,460
remember that if day I am

140
00:08:55,460 --> 00:08:58,480
the random number generator of us

141
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:02,090
3 output interfaces to cut the devices

142
00:09:02,090 --> 00:09:05,130
that they have on them and their view on
them and one function

143
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:09,690
the get on on bytes function the devil
and then cut to the Vice

144
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,870
it down on the bites a gun s them out

145
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:15,900
and poppy at which is it which is in the
pool

146
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:19,730
I if there is inches insufficient amount
of entropy

147
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:25,510
it blocks at the moment is obtained they
did you and Kat the device

148
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:29,010
it down on the bites the godless them
out to Santa Fe

149
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:32,400
which is in that at group I so

150
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:37,800
the at that you either never blocks the
get on the bites functional

151
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:41,870
works in a similar manner to that that
you and then cut the device

152
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:45,120
I am but it was designed to be used

153
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,590
then the counter for example they called
the exit system call

154
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:52,680
I'm it eventually expects 16 on the
bites right

155
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,870
so it uses the get on by Sun 10 to
expect those bites and place them

156
00:09:56,870 --> 00:10:00,140
summer in the process other space at
which I

157
00:10:00,140 --> 00:10:04,310
appointed by at date on them today by
the date on them

158
00:10:04,310 --> 00:10:08,250
you'll see what too much thinks I am

159
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,300
when bites requested form the pools

160
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:15,150
so many people what really happens
underneath is some kind of a feedback

161
00:10:15,150 --> 00:10:15,540
loop

162
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:19,530
I'm and bites on a quest that so and by
psych Stockton

163
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:22,900
then their highest using Shaw 1 function

164
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:27,080
are mixed again to the pool then

165
00:10:27,080 --> 00:10:30,610
and bites I expected again and and other
harsh

166
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:34,400
another show one is at but fun so
essentially the output

167
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,520
have the other number generator is
hashed twice using

168
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:41,270
Shaw on cryptographic hash function and
another thing

169
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:45,370
is that gunness up the amount of bytes
request sent

170
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:50,690
fund on another de Naito I am done in
the mid-atlantic starting blocks

171
00:10:50,690 --> 00:10:55,030
of 10 bytes Anton its if necessary so
for example if you want

172
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:58,470
at nine on the bites it would expect 10
by 10

173
00:10:58,470 --> 00:11:02,340
thank it okay so

174
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:05,610
on the left you see that the envelopment
a nice which is

175
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:09,000
mixed orkut into the input of on top of
that

176
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:12,740
in purple and the number of people what
you see is time value

177
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:16,940
I which is mixed in we called this time
value deceive the courts

178
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:20,150
when the other number modern is
initialized

179
00:11:20,150 --> 00:11:23,490
there when the county what's up I

180
00:11:23,490 --> 00:11:27,230
these time it is out mixed into the
polls and

181
00:11:27,230 --> 00:11:31,240
and on the right you see that

182
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,760
at see the clip that have talked before
a study for a

183
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:38,530
epics such in I make some

184
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:41,750
make some bites get them

185
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,780
ethics touch and find the bites results
in some bites

186
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:49,230
0 past bites X them mix back into the
pool

187
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:53,270
as I've said the kennel

188
00:11:53,270 --> 00:11:56,450
keeps send estimate of how much and
poppy

189
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:59,720
days in the pool because this estimate

190
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:03,800
the KTC the can handle the count if the
KTC

191
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:08,520
exceeds the 192 be limit noise something
purple

192
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:12,440
is mixed into the number of people but

193
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,450
if there is no boo thang and copy it
means that doing but I'm

194
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:20,000
noise from the input will is never mixed

195
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:25,540
to the number of people and what you're
left with is quite the degenerated

196
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:29,240
and the number generator which on the
defense on then i'm looking cool

197
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,030
that time see the and the author of
exceptions

198
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:37,779
form the other number Jenna from that
number of people

199
00:12:37,779 --> 00:12:40,830
with that in mind I just have a quick
although he of the blue

200
00:12:40,830 --> 00:12:45,400
time-line offended another vice so the
device powers on

201
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:48,740
then the bootloader notes the Canon
Image

202
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:52,490
into the memo and then the counter
starts to boot

203
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:57,350
eventually that on the number tonight
the mother is initialized this is the

204
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:58,240
place where that

205
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,279
done looking to land in Ca 2+ and the
looking for a seated

206
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:04,890
with this time reading then the count

207
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:08,360
at booth is finished can cause that in
its

208
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:11,730
process which I starts that

209
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:15,760
Android platform boot to stop the
process

210
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,890
I am the other two events

211
00:13:18,890 --> 00:13:24,100
yes with them

212
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:27,300
you think like the device okay I am

213
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:30,320
on same on some embedded devices I with
that

214
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:33,620
list heading go has and has an

215
00:13:33,620 --> 00:13:37,420
X and I think on this somebody devices
there

216
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:42,270
input the seeds see that the pros as the
Arctic so it's very predictable

217
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:46,290
K I am so at the next events Mako in a
different other

218
00:13:46,290 --> 00:13:49,730
I am but it is you know them into other
attack

219
00:13:49,730 --> 00:13:53,510
there are other so at the fest event

220
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:57,570
is they've ended nyse: something to cook
is mixed into the number of people

221
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:00,730
and the other event is the event that
the phone is Eddie

222
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:04,339
to use for example you can use yo what's
a publication church and stopped

223
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:08,940
jetting okay so before

224
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:12,320
I get into what we actually did I

225
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:16,330
how we actually contributed so when we

226
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:19,500
a.m. before we actually I

227
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,160
started our research we stumble upon
many many

228
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:27,410
papist that talked about at this one
ability though boo thang

229
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:30,810
and top even ability on embedded devices
but

230
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:34,130
many purpose on the postulated

231
00:14:34,130 --> 00:14:37,830
that lobe with a man to be can result in
a practical Focus Attack

232
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:41,700
and this is where week and to none of
them actually

233
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:45,700
presented this kind of attack so our
contribution is

234
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:48,880
we present the but the comps item on
time

235
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,500
and two and attack on this

236
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:55,350
he also formalize the attack and give an
image of its complexity which can be

237
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:55,830
fine

238
00:14:55,830 --> 00:15:00,040
founding the white paper and we
demonstrate that both a concept

239
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:05,190
against Khan mobile platforms alright

240
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:12,190
okay so it is a

241
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:16,590
what can be achieved using our attack
you're saying that

242
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:20,290
given a leak of the value expected from
the number of people

243
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:24,390
a call that to get on a bike function
gets its bite

244
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:28,410
it on the bites fun than other people
and no good time and Toby

245
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:32,310
this stated on the numbers and I thought
can be the ticket or determined

246
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:35,430
until XML and puppies too high until

247
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:39,690
nice some in purple is mixed into the
number of people I am

248
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:43,730
okay why not

249
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:47,040
we actually in a white that that we
discover more implicate the attacked so

250
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,710
which

251
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:51,500
I am we also tackle that the then to
impact

252
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:55,400
I think because mixed into the number of
people so if you into said

253
00:15:55,400 --> 00:16:00,580
I am they say they like it in attack
fame ok

254
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,760
we used a random number generator
against itself

255
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:07,060
many times at the first instance affair

256
00:16:07,060 --> 00:16:12,030
have this is what we do with the leak
value because that leak is just

257
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:16,540
a sequence a fun the bites from the
number looking for okay

258
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:19,770
so bacall lobe with a man to be
degenerates

259
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:23,500
that on the number de natal and the
output update on another deny those

260
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:24,180
hashed

261
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:28,390
twice using show one shell one

262
00:16:28,390 --> 00:16:31,840
is a cryptographic hash function and
cryptographic hash functions

263
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,680
are designed to be collision assistant I
meaning that that

264
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:39,490
if you want to keep the doc
cryptographic hash functions function on

265
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:44,880
two different inputs it is import about
that output

266
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,670
would be the same

267
00:16:48,670 --> 00:16:51,639
using that I am it is highly unlikely
that

268
00:16:51,639 --> 00:16:55,480
and a member Janet us 0 I'm ducking
proust that number of pupils

269
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:59,999
that that seeded with different scenes
will result in the same output

270
00:16:59,999 --> 00:17:04,649
they got less up the old of acceptance
to the minute results

271
00:17:04,649 --> 00:17:08,230
this is that every leak which is just a
sickness

272
00:17:08,230 --> 00:17:11,970
fun and bites from the number of people
is almost certainly

273
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:18,299
the offspring of line specific see with
that in mind we can now

274
00:17:18,299 --> 00:17:22,329
misguided the food attack final you're
saying that

275
00:17:22,329 --> 00:17:25,539
given a leak from the number I can cook
of a

276
00:17:25,539 --> 00:17:28,880
on the number tonight I'll for example
at victim device

277
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:32,710
we could simulate many many off and on
the number again I those

278
00:17:32,710 --> 00:17:36,110
with defense seeds and compare
extractions

279
00:17:36,110 --> 00:17:40,370
with an online leak again

280
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:43,950
do the show once collision resistant but
the if one of the cemented the random

281
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:44,870
number generators

282
00:17:44,870 --> 00:17:49,039
produces a sequence funding bytes that
is the same as the leak value

283
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:52,190
we almost certainly found the scene of
the

284
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:55,269
victim sound another day night of the
victims not looking pool

285
00:17:55,269 --> 00:17:59,679
once we have the seed up the number of
people

286
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,860
of that victims on the number generator
we can produce the same outputs

287
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:07,769
at of the deal un nombre de Naito until
noise from the in purple

288
00:18:07,769 --> 00:18:13,039
is mixed into the number of people and
again

289
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,789
and in the white paper we demonstrate at
the moment look at that flow which takes

290
00:18:16,789 --> 00:18:20,820
the event for input but nice something
to do is mix

291
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:25,399
into number of people if you're
interested it I'm

292
00:18:25,399 --> 00:18:28,590
okay so you see that that's lame ok we
actually

293
00:18:28,590 --> 00:18:34,720
a faced similar problems with it on then
other people see these eight bytes long

294
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,679
and say we consider on it and not a
second part I am

295
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:42,289
which is on the four bytes and assuming
that the nanosecond out uniformly

296
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:43,070
distributed

297
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:47,789
we have 30 32 and the PO other one
billion

298
00:18:47,789 --> 00:18:51,149
different seed values so essentially we

299
00:18:51,149 --> 00:18:54,539
need to simulate over one billion

300
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:58,840
depend on a number generators and
compares compare the extractions

301
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:02,030
I am yep course

302
00:19:02,030 --> 00:19:05,820
this can be done a fine with cloud
server so

303
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:09,350
I don't know some government agency
power to

304
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:12,430
them competition power but we wanted to
make a

305
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:15,660
back a low-cost attack on this I am

306
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,210
as you will see am and of this study

307
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:23,360
of I of the device vs that the action
and puppies

308
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:28,220
less but that this isn't it is it will
get it another problem that we face

309
00:19:28,220 --> 00:19:32,900
is that days some code affair hidden and
a piece of switches concurrency

310
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:36,680
I am that develop this of that on them

311
00:19:36,680 --> 00:19:41,270
number on the number mother the
important didn't put a lock

312
00:19:41,270 --> 00:19:44,880
on the extract and mix function
operations up the other number generator

313
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,530
so essentially if two-thirds requests on
the bites concurrently

314
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:55,540
this state oh the contents of the pool
may change and anyone in the middle of

315
00:19:55,540 --> 00:19:56,540
the house competition

316
00:19:56,540 --> 00:20:00,260
this is bad but again as another teaser

317
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:04,070
we will see that that that is there is
some

318
00:20:04,070 --> 00:20:07,890
maybe there is some bias in the
concurrency that we can I'm

319
00:20:07,890 --> 00:20:11,770
make use of and I doubt that

320
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:14,840
two pubs is what can actually be
attacked we need

321
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:18,830
some everly booth service so pic

322
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,990
I am that you this on this I'm

323
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:25,740
because remember that we given a CV seen
it

324
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,340
and the number den and improves data
generated by that

325
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:33,890
victim's son the number tonight though
and another problem is where can we get

326
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:38,420
the leak writing so to make things
simpler

327
00:20:38,420 --> 00:20:43,800
II I am we I we segmented are divided
the boot time-line

328
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:47,160
I'm we've seen that

329
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:50,380
come cossette takes place on the

330
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:53,500
when the candid with is finished bacall
at

331
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:57,480
so the time from the time the countered
with is finished and on what he called

332
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:57,900
this

333
00:20:57,900 --> 00:21:03,020
con con see how I am another segment is

334
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:06,830
from the time that on the number
generator mother is initialized I

335
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,980
to the time the kanell finished boot
because this

336
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,040
the best

337
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:14,660
licked I get on segment why because
they're

338
00:21:14,660 --> 00:21:18,730
then we don't need to not take into
consideration konsi hell

339
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:22,770
all nice something purple being mixed
into the number of people

340
00:21:22,770 --> 00:21:27,530
and other segment is at what he called
the good nick target segment

341
00:21:27,530 --> 00:21:30,770
which is from the time the platform
starts to boot

342
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:33,820
and the time there nyse: something
purple

343
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:37,880
is mixed into the number of people and

344
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,610
day last segment is what because the bed
lick target segment

345
00:21:41,610 --> 00:21:45,210
which across from the time Inc the pool
is mixed

346
00:21:45,210 --> 00:21:48,380
into the number of people and on what's
again

347
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:52,410
this I am we also

348
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:56,050
made an attack I the texts this index
and ice chest so

349
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:59,610
on the thought that that at present the
a this is a bad pic target you can

350
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:02,900
now the numbers and I still have a
number af

351
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:07,000
using leaks and targets from the bed
next target segment

352
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,850
and up to thinks

353
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:14,870
out so leaks attack targets from the
best leaked out that segment be called

354
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:15,230
them

355
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:18,450
a candid with a mic I can have a good
time

356
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:23,110
attacked on and licks both targets from
the good lick target segment bacall

357
00:22:23,110 --> 00:22:27,010
a platform with a mic up that phone
booth time attacked on

358
00:22:27,010 --> 00:22:30,740
cake with that in mind

359
00:22:30,740 --> 00:22:35,640
we can now add we have it the theoretic
the theory behind

360
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:39,070
I with Oxfam ok we now see how we can
actually use it

361
00:22:39,070 --> 00:22:43,430
so we'll have some Manuel which I'm

362
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:48,330
d'amato has no effect but envoy and fun
that motto is see how we

363
00:22:48,330 --> 00:22:52,500
that I've that number of people see that
the other members and I thought of some

364
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:53,380
victim device

365
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:56,680
and from that CD we'll see how we
construct

366
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:02,480
that he still scanning about it okay so

367
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,750
dust the disclaimer we have nothing
against Samsung

368
00:23:05,750 --> 00:23:09,450
we love them and we just happen to have
a divisive them K

369
00:23:09,450 --> 00:23:14,260
I'm could so we at to go device

370
00:23:14,260 --> 00:23:19,250
and we 22 went into their and some some
website and on that account

371
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:23,730
we then excessively use the paint a
command

372
00:23:23,730 --> 00:23:27,540
yeah the paint a command is used I can
the developer stew

373
00:23:27,540 --> 00:23:31,120
the bag the Canon and output from that

374
00:23:31,120 --> 00:23:36,770
print a command is pushed into that kit
can anything before so

375
00:23:36,770 --> 00:23:40,080
a in other fine some bias in the seed
value

376
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,120
that we put me in case on the input and
down

377
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:48,310
the number of people seats I am in other
to find have relevant

378
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:51,330
attacked leaks 0 attack targets we put

379
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:54,500
in case commands on the get on a bye
sanction

380
00:23:54,500 --> 00:24:00,900
in order to catch some bass in the con-
see we fix the seeds

381
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:04,120
South experiments with fix the seats and
we

382
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:07,530
we taste they can constitute am

383
00:24:07,530 --> 00:24:11,220
although fix action with s though the

384
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:16,970
exceptions Fonda and i'm looking for. so
into

385
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:20,050
be able to the device more than two
thousand times

386
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:23,530
it's time we dump the coming battle to a
file

387
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:28,130
so am imagine hearing this thing

388
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:31,270
I times

389
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:34,760
it hot ass and that everyone in the
office

390
00:24:34,760 --> 00:24:39,070
and at hated us okay after yeah

391
00:24:39,070 --> 00:24:42,610
yet well after though

392
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:46,920
yeah 2000 asap us we actually realize
that began

393
00:24:46,920 --> 00:24:50,580
we have the town that weekend just
protest a comment on

394
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:57,020
this thing but that we did it before
okay

395
00:24:57,020 --> 00:25:02,000
am so air we yeah hunted with this we
continued our walk

396
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:06,320
I'm and what we found when we analyze
the

397
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:09,760
logs we found at that phone booth time
leak

398
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:14,790
which can be used against a platform
with time act on it am

399
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:18,120
the got on with Alex at is

400
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,230
farm at the Android spa suspicion mother

401
00:25:21,230 --> 00:25:24,960
application for sketch in which is not
as that

402
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,100
was it estimates so and I designed this
chose to spawn

403
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:32,549
every application process by folk Ingham
us the process

404
00:25:32,549 --> 00:25:36,679
designed to process that is both up by

405
00:25:36,679 --> 00:25:40,220
in it so it's doing that some with time
and

406
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:43,440
is folk 10 expects think they called the
exact yeah

407
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,130
exit man's at 16 on a bite I extracted
from

408
00:25:47,130 --> 00:25:50,250
on them again i tho placed in there I'm
boss

409
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:54,540
other space side but sparse other space
and %uh pointed to by the AT&T

410
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:57,740
item eso

411
00:25:57,740 --> 00:26:02,140
I am that designed the process a was
pond using

412
00:26:02,140 --> 00:26:05,590
unix-like additional ATPases kitchen
with it

413
00:26:05,590 --> 00:26:09,230
but application process for example what
supporters

414
00:26:09,230 --> 00:26:12,960
a cat doing at the SAG process cash in
which

415
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:17,429
on the folks mussah posts well as
existing call

416
00:26:17,429 --> 00:26:20,650
because that the exec is the one when
forces

417
00:26:20,650 --> 00:26:24,440
at this base that on the recession and
the one that assign state on them

418
00:26:24,440 --> 00:26:29,950
so all applications in under it has the
same kind I

419
00:26:29,950 --> 00:26:33,559
the same AP on them and largely the same
and a spaced-out

420
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:36,750
am this is a serious man ability now
they

421
00:26:36,750 --> 00:26:41,240
it is also and knowing that nothing that
ability and there's a great paper cause

422
00:26:41,240 --> 00:26:42,380
that forms I got

423
00:26:42,380 --> 00:26:44,400
to MOA which is

424
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,850
that form some time ago it is a gated
and the

425
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:51,420
offer some to get a chance to that
problem it

426
00:26:51,420 --> 00:26:54,780
so again we have decided

427
00:26:54,780 --> 00:26:58,380
my supporters and we have applications
for example what's up

428
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:02,840
ok contacts am the what's up a comp its
application

429
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,960
like every other application share the
same

430
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:10,670
am 80 on them as they gots because the
existing call is never used

431
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:13,800
so what if we just have

432
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:17,390
another process which just looks on its
Boeing

433
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:21,560
a tandem I am this is the only thing
that a minor

434
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,950
is doing it looks I in its own on its
own and

435
00:27:24,950 --> 00:27:28,420
a condom and sends it to some cloud
service which computes

436
00:27:28,420 --> 00:27:35,420
at the scene after victim device okay so

437
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:38,750
is I got as I got 80 on a bizarre leak

438
00:27:38,750 --> 00:27:42,900
it's a platform with a mic which means
that it causing the concurrency health

439
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:43,360
phase

440
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:48,270
we must they can concentrate sedation I
am

441
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:52,010
enough let's study of the some
persevered bias for the specific

442
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:55,030
exec extraction path well xtouch

443
00:27:55,030 --> 00:28:00,250
old of acceptance from that number can
pull but we've seen is that

444
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:03,790
twenty percent of the some bus had
zygotes 80 on on bytes

445
00:28:03,790 --> 00:28:09,430
some well index action path this means
that given a unique

446
00:28:09,430 --> 00:28:14,020
given cyclists 80 on them and assuming
the type of possible to 230

447
00:28:14,020 --> 00:28:17,860
possible seats the chance to find this
seed

448
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:21,490
of the other militant I thought is 150
at

449
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:25,630
but an even more than that

450
00:28:25,630 --> 00:28:29,090
I'll a of its study revealed that the
actual Shannon entropy

451
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:33,030
of that then to pay off their I
non-blocking proceed

452
00:28:33,030 --> 00:28:36,540
is much less than what the estimated we
estimated it to be

453
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:39,610
30 bit is actually much less it is

454
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:43,310
on 24 bits I just to give you that but
cautions

455
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:46,550
don't have enough and the payments that

456
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:50,290
at other billion different funny is

457
00:28:50,290 --> 00:28:53,610
of the seed have the number of people
and 24 bits

458
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:57,560
miss that on the about seven million

459
00:28:57,560 --> 00:29:00,670
an defense seeds needs to take

460
00:29:00,670 --> 00:29:04,080
we need to take into consideration well

461
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:09,050
16 and yeah on it up get other 16
millionaire

462
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:13,020
okay I'm yes and out what that

463
00:29:13,020 --> 00:29:16,510
I'm and even more we also found that

464
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:20,040
what you see here the probability mass
function of that of lenses succeeds

465
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:23,060
I am and we see that their a

466
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:26,290
that some seeds amo probable

467
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:29,630
then other so we can actually optimize
our attack our

468
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:33,160
I am I am we can optimize

469
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:36,750
at the process where we find well we
seem it on another genitals

470
00:29:36,750 --> 00:29:40,110
with different seats we can't just take
am form that

471
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:43,190
and than just that I must i'm ok what
about

472
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:48,360
and that use them first okay so

473
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:52,430
now we've got the seed and

474
00:29:52,430 --> 00:29:56,520
we I we looked at

475
00:29:56,520 --> 00:29:59,880
that early but services because must
have them

476
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:04,170
of them use the at takes a is the can
invite him

477
00:30:04,170 --> 00:30:07,750
and given a seed at the probability of
finding

478
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:11,310
at can you offer any good service is
provided

479
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:15,230
in this a in the stable so as you can
see some of them

480
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:19,760
there some of the early with us this
weekend actually with Pat I'm 100

481
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:20,410
percent

482
00:30:20,410 --> 00:30:24,830
find the kind about you my the key still
is s16

483
00:30:24,830 --> 00:30:29,360
100th six-percent so in total given

484
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:32,420
zygotes 80 on them the portability of
guessing

485
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:36,750
the keys to scan if I do is one other
100 um

486
00:30:36,750 --> 00:30:41,360
which is one percent same imagine every
100 boots

487
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:45,490
that device performs we i if you believe
in portability

488
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:48,990
weekend I find the case though their can
anybody

489
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:52,050
so if our model goes viral

490
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:57,470
I am at one percent of our devices that
i infected will

491
00:30:57,470 --> 00:31:01,960
probably you know that that we can
probably guess correctly

492
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:06,140
the kennedy value of the cousteau but
they member when we came phone

493
00:31:06,140 --> 00:31:09,250
we needed to guess 32 under beats

494
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:11,130
just to give you

495
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:14,920
how am to show how our how

496
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:18,820
up how much other I'm how them i think
is out with action

497
00:31:18,820 --> 00:31:22,610
at this is the probability of the
finding a guessing correctly

498
00:31:22,610 --> 00:31:26,250
32bits a set at 32 bits

499
00:31:26,250 --> 00:31:29,810
I'm so as you can see this is
affirmative action

500
00:31:29,810 --> 00:31:33,840
and with that in mind we not continue to
the demo

501
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:37,730
I to Tom

502
00:31:37,730 --> 00:31:40,890
okay so the AP on them at

503
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:44,880
X 230 though it just a simple
application which

504
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:48,410
sense the AP on them to a cloud service
okay so

505
00:31:48,410 --> 00:31:52,900
that stuff K

506
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:56,420
what you see here is the a ton of that
the process which is actually zygotes

507
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:59,590
it on them and and I P just their

508
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:06,590
IBM Cloud Server

509
00:32:10,669 --> 00:32:13,350
we're sending it got into the cloud
deaths a

510
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:19,730
service and way I'm we initially as many
a walker

511
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:22,760
thirds that seem it on the method
enables

512
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:29,760
in we hope to find the seed

513
00:32:39,470 --> 00:32:42,650
good as you can see we found the seed of
the victims

514
00:32:42,650 --> 00:32:46,760
device their on them not looking to see
the of the victims device

515
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:50,020
and the number genital with that

516
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:54,210
I on the left to see the real key so can
any at it was obtained

517
00:32:54,210 --> 00:32:57,260
using any instrumentation just that

518
00:32:57,260 --> 00:33:01,160
the paint K they get on a bus function
on their I am

519
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:04,430
kiss the process and we just so the full
most significant bites

520
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:09,170
you can also at the peak at the key so
can anybody work with that DB server

521
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:16,170
which is installed on the phone

522
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:22,980
yep

523
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,220
at supposedly

524
00:33:24,220 --> 00:33:31,220
on

525
00:33:55,379 --> 00:33:58,600
no yep entirely anti

526
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,759
orkut yeah cost me took in the white Evo
its

527
00:34:01,759 --> 00:34:05,809
yeah heck good am so with at the
civilian

528
00:34:05,809 --> 00:34:10,109
at we got the same value call and me
seem like many other members tonight us

529
00:34:10,109 --> 00:34:13,149
and the car that we have the possibility
of una

530
00:34:13,149 --> 00:34:17,520
and six-percent 6 1/2 in 100 and we find

531
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:24,520
can anybody yeah yeah okay

532
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:30,669
get so we found a condo value and

533
00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:34,139
I you you be I

534
00:34:34,139 --> 00:34:37,510
John you up a bit probabilistic back on
this am

535
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:40,980
we now turn to did second the fact that
they'll which

536
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:45,429
is at its cat which summit is a
deterministic at that time this

537
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:48,580
is a simple amid think six to

538
00:34:48,580 --> 00:34:52,669
at get debt a.m. Nanda keep a seed

539
00:34:52,669 --> 00:34:56,740
update on the number again I thought of
some device and from that pic and

540
00:34:56,740 --> 00:35:00,090
I'm make somehow weekend

541
00:35:00,090 --> 00:35:04,430
attack some at we can make ipv6 I'm
interjection are

542
00:35:04,430 --> 00:35:08,860
getting the key so can I buddy so again
me

543
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:13,440
again we have nothing pass on a guest
again something we just happen to have

544
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:19,450
and other divisive them yeah related it
to have been k is and the 60 seats

545
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:25,420
and again haunted with the sound when we
analyzed

546
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:28,470
their logs what we've seen is that

547
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:32,760
there's a candid with a mic that can be
used to attack it cannot be time

548
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:36,200
target I'm

549
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,480
while the can is both

550
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,270
up and ipv6 mother is being annisten I
initialized and

551
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:46,620
extracts fall on the bites fund on a
Monday night

552
00:35:46,620 --> 00:35:50,230
so it's a Canon booth timely the cop K
we called the

553
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:55,170
this on the bites and when the audited
the county code

554
00:35:55,170 --> 00:35:58,600
of that the st. device of I'm grateful

555
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:03,310
point wine both point2 we've seen that
the ipv6 five min identify a

556
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:06,910
is computed by a deterministic function
I am

557
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:11,650
s and the the function is the 11 because
we can just take it from there

558
00:36:11,650 --> 00:36:14,740
down from the county con but what

559
00:36:14,740 --> 00:36:18,720
is relevant is the inputs and outputs us
that dysfunction

560
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,140
so the the press input is that onto
which is just

561
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:25,370
a fun and bites that I expected doing
candid with I'm

562
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:29,120
and another input is that ipv6 this
nationalists

563
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:32,280
of the packet so am

564
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:37,000
when at and I P five min is IP 65
minutes

565
00:36:37,000 --> 00:36:41,260
is constructed it is being sent from

566
00:36:41,260 --> 00:36:44,100
send it to us either so this is that
addresses this issue

567
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:47,390
I am and their output

568
00:36:47,390 --> 00:36:50,800
of this the domestic function is the
ipv6 five minutes a day

569
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:54,230
I am

570
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:57,640
the pair the the ipv6 destination on
this

571
00:36:57,640 --> 00:37:01,410
and that ipv6 finalmente the is Alec

572
00:37:01,410 --> 00:37:04,830
why because out there

573
00:37:04,830 --> 00:37:09,010
I'm because weekend

574
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:13,400
because I and

575
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:17,240
was expected doing the cannibal time
began at it is

576
00:37:17,240 --> 00:37:21,880
the can concussive doesn't take place
during this time

577
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,920
began seen it many random number
generators up to that

578
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:28,120
and value and feed it into that
deterministic function

579
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:33,080
s mmm

580
00:37:33,080 --> 00:37:37,950
yep but I'm

581
00:37:37,950 --> 00:37:41,220
I think it's not actually I think that
that

582
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:44,850
if you have the same in Pitts at it has
some

583
00:37:44,850 --> 00:37:47,920
counter and its and I'm

584
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,240
in the count and so fine what they
desire

585
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:55,590
never I think in this can invest in

586
00:37:55,590 --> 00:38:00,910
it was on income and then I want each
time I am

587
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:05,600
yet okay so I am but they call that the
inputs

588
00:38:05,600 --> 00:38:09,120
of the F function is I also

589
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,670
at the ipv6 the senescent other so we
need some clever way

590
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:16,020
getting that that this out with that in
mind

591
00:38:16,020 --> 00:38:21,120
be fair over the affair ipv6
segmentation and ICP v6 conquest

592
00:38:21,120 --> 00:38:24,730
so IP packets that exits the path and to
you

593
00:38:24,730 --> 00:38:28,460
the path Maxim first mission you did are
divided into five minutes

594
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:32,260
which %uh then sent and then the
assembled by the Civil

595
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:36,840
it's funny that the packet contains the
same faculty

596
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:40,420
which is used by this era to identify

597
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:45,640
five minutes of a particular back at
sorry

598
00:38:45,640 --> 00:38:49,430
but as a problem ipv6 foundation doesn't
happen very often

599
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:54,819
me to make it happen soaping 6

600
00:38:54,819 --> 00:38:59,150
is the same utility you know of IPD file
think it that opportunity

601
00:38:59,150 --> 00:39:02,940
is utility fo a sending an ICMP v6

602
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:07,619
echo requests which request the target
to send ICMP echo it nice

603
00:39:07,619 --> 00:39:14,619
with this same exact data so if we send
an ICMP echo request

604
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:18,579
with that a larger than the path max Inc
this mission you did

605
00:39:18,579 --> 00:39:22,299
we will actually make this either send
the fragmented

606
00:39:22,299 --> 00:39:27,089
it tight with that in mind we now ask

607
00:39:27,089 --> 00:39:31,509
describe a scenario so wearing the I'm
so them steeple output

608
00:39:31,509 --> 00:39:35,210
and out that a a comes

609
00:39:35,210 --> 00:39:41,089
and he installers a malicious wifi
hotspot cause skippers think skipper 3

610
00:39:41,089 --> 00:39:44,539
a victim and he

611
00:39:44,539 --> 00:39:49,329
am want Seth Internet connectivity
doesn't want to pay much money to

612
00:39:49,329 --> 00:39:52,410
is a service provider so he connects to
this

613
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:57,200
ski pitifully SAT then the only thing

614
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,079
out the comps is doing is sending a
fragmented ICP v6

615
00:40:01,079 --> 00:40:05,180
echo request which usually at

616
00:40:05,180 --> 00:40:08,880
make dead victim I send fomented

617
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:13,019
ICP echo apply so

618
00:40:13,019 --> 00:40:16,249
now am the victim be

619
00:40:16,249 --> 00:40:20,049
computed ipv6 fine with AD with the
attack us

620
00:40:20,049 --> 00:40:24,799
ipv6 us others because that at that %ah
costs also %uh this

621
00:40:24,799 --> 00:40:28,019
is the victims this a national this on
its

622
00:40:28,019 --> 00:40:31,299
echo it I so I with ECA

623
00:40:31,299 --> 00:40:36,430
a knows the ipv6 fine with aiding and
ipv6 this a nationalist

624
00:40:36,430 --> 00:40:40,069
just great because now we can

625
00:40:40,069 --> 00:40:45,739
actually compute I am we can actually at
down on many at

626
00:40:45,739 --> 00:40:49,059
cement done and then again I toss with
the proceeds

627
00:40:49,059 --> 00:40:52,559
and compare with a leak by am

628
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:55,789
what he founded the s2 device was quite
alarming

629
00:40:55,789 --> 00:40:58,590
I what we've seen is that the action and
Toby

630
00:40:58,590 --> 00:41:02,160
of that number keep a seat is way less

631
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:05,750
than 30 bit its on in nineteen beats at
which

632
00:41:05,750 --> 00:41:08,820
is about 500 at defend

633
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:14,250
as seed options cut

634
00:41:14,250 --> 00:41:20,020
okay 500,000 better options have so
again so at the immensity of this

635
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:24,840
we estimated that at then to be of the
nanosecond would be

636
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:28,180
30 beat other one one billion K

637
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:31,340
and then we Ana on the s4 device we
found

638
00:41:31,340 --> 00:41:34,670
that the entropy is 24 bits which is

639
00:41:34,670 --> 00:41:39,300
other sixteen million defense seductions
and then

640
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:43,240
on the st. device we found that the
entropy of the number keep a seat is

641
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:46,240
way less than that on the five

642
00:41:46,240 --> 00:41:50,670
hand that thousand I'm defense see that
is so

643
00:41:50,670 --> 00:41:55,470
this affect can be down on us in a time
it's a vet and we also found

644
00:41:55,470 --> 00:42:01,360
and that the ELMO book am some of the
dentist at the seats are more popular

645
00:42:01,360 --> 00:42:03,010
than the other so we can actually even

646
00:42:03,010 --> 00:42:08,190
optimize it further okay so

647
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:11,720
given the seed what can we actually
attack we could

648
00:42:11,720 --> 00:42:15,970
use that we can make an ipv6 fun with
injection weekend I had the exact

649
00:42:15,970 --> 00:42:17,090
identity

650
00:42:17,090 --> 00:42:20,130
which will be used for any destination
on this by

651
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:24,670
that device I am with we defined

652
00:42:24,670 --> 00:42:29,220
many use cases for this weekend on the
a.m maybe inject some data out

653
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:33,470
some dust that I am data thing is that I
am

654
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:36,930
at the kennedy value of early but
process

655
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:40,050
a process can be guest also

656
00:42:40,050 --> 00:42:44,230
so for instance with the possibility of
fun in 20

657
00:42:44,230 --> 00:42:50,220
we can compute the key still scanning
about you given the sea and

658
00:42:50,220 --> 00:42:53,560
other other early but services that we
can guess

659
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:57,380
correctly there at can anybody up as and
in this table

660
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:04,380
K

661
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:12,900
eso

662
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:16,359
I am some coffee to get a chance that I
used in your devices

663
00:43:16,359 --> 00:43:22,380
so I'm wanna TSN is to save and to be a
cost boots

664
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:25,450
miss that on shutdown

665
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:28,470
I'm on them numb on the bites out

666
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:31,500
expected fund on a number tonight I'll a
place

667
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:35,200
someone in the bus system and then

668
00:43:35,200 --> 00:43:39,099
on startup I am this file is injected

669
00:43:39,099 --> 00:43:42,450
into their pools and on another night of

670
00:43:42,450 --> 00:43:47,210
now I this mitigation defence

671
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:51,200
on that the fastest in must be mounted
which miss

672
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,910
it must the girl doing the platform but
I'm now

673
00:43:54,910 --> 00:43:58,930
will get to why this is a problem and
also an attack a key and

674
00:43:58,930 --> 00:44:02,309
could make the device I am shut down
before

675
00:44:02,309 --> 00:44:06,230
I am think the pool is next into the
number of people

676
00:44:06,230 --> 00:44:11,000
so actually this five maybe also a
Ivanova too low but I'm attacks

677
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:14,180
another another mitigation is

678
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:17,650
at lasted X 10 a.m. to be injection

679
00:44:17,650 --> 00:44:20,660
for example form a network service %uh

680
00:44:20,660 --> 00:44:24,109
on them that 0 at going to his playmates

681
00:44:24,109 --> 00:44:28,329
cell service I'm the problem with this
one is that

682
00:44:28,329 --> 00:44:31,619
it depends on the metal stock being
initialized

683
00:44:31,619 --> 00:44:34,710
and that and and some

684
00:44:34,710 --> 00:44:39,780
cryptographic at I'm but a Corsair

685
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:43,230
that developing doing the platform but
I'm for example there

686
00:44:43,230 --> 00:44:46,770
it is this SLs certificate pinning I am

687
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:50,049
the bonhomie that this kind of
mitigation

688
00:44:50,049 --> 00:44:54,180
is that what they're saying up today
that they some extent in to be

689
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:57,559
and popping and they inject it at

690
00:44:57,559 --> 00:45:02,410
doing the platform boot I'm but what if
we have a Canon with a mic

691
00:45:02,410 --> 00:45:09,120
and the counter with a target this this
medication doesn't help us

692
00:45:09,120 --> 00:45:11,760
at recalled that and other mitigation

693
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:15,510
as to initialize the seeds using a how
to on the numbers and i'd

694
00:45:15,510 --> 00:45:20,110
because that's what made out that can
very I'm

695
00:45:20,110 --> 00:45:24,420
low-cost and efficient is that the
actual and took the

696
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:28,780
of this seeds of the pools was very

697
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:31,920
low said but if they're full it bites

698
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:36,290
of that on the magenta of that ducking
the pool so that on the line tonight on

699
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:37,400
a seated

700
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:40,970
by hit at two on the number generator
which is provided by the Humber

701
00:45:40,970 --> 00:45:44,080
up unless this had on them

702
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:48,270
number data is a compromise by some
government agency weekend

703
00:45:48,270 --> 00:45:52,870
then to be is in custom medically of the
seats at the courts

704
00:45:52,870 --> 00:45:56,170
so it will be they have to conducts

705
00:45:56,170 --> 00:46:03,170
out that but his it made still be
feasible that will take a lot of time

706
00:46:10,960 --> 00:46:13,170
exactly the goods

707
00:46:13,170 --> 00:46:16,290
think up some act good then whatever for
this baby bath

708
00:46:16,290 --> 00:46:20,130
I okay um

709
00:46:20,130 --> 00:46:23,849
your next paycheck I'm so and other
mitigation is

710
00:46:23,849 --> 00:46:28,580
to mix device specific data to the polls
for example the boss so too baby

711
00:46:28,580 --> 00:46:31,619
it will make the hair damn

712
00:46:31,619 --> 00:46:34,730
it not will make the letter that that
have a

713
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:37,890
hair difficult because it hits now to
guess

714
00:46:37,890 --> 00:46:42,619
some specific values of the device and
finally

715
00:46:42,619 --> 00:46:47,580
I am in your account us the even more
medications that allows for Mo

716
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:50,790
with them and poppy on devices with love
with a man to be

717
00:46:50,790 --> 00:46:54,260
I we didn't get into them because it to
pass some in a yeah

718
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:59,030
most them I'm mowlam deep

719
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:02,750
overview of how the numbers and I
thought we expect you can find I'm

720
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:07,890
antibody formation on them in our paper
okay

721
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:11,260
tuck or up so we're we found that Linux

722
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:15,349
based devices with low boo them and
poppy Manoa Paktika

723
00:47:15,349 --> 00:47:19,960
low-cost attack anonymous tonight on
that back to class and of a study of the

724
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:20,530
device

725
00:47:20,530 --> 00:47:24,839
and then online leak and allows the
attacker to predict that on a number

726
00:47:24,839 --> 00:47:28,990
which is generated by the victim's son
the knowledge and I we've seen too many

727
00:47:28,990 --> 00:47:29,839
stations

728
00:47:29,839 --> 00:47:32,990
this at the claim of one which is
probabilistic

729
00:47:32,990 --> 00:47:37,210
and across a look at presence and a
device and another manifestation

730
00:47:37,210 --> 00:47:40,380
which is a Moz at which can be employed
a monthly

731
00:47:40,380 --> 00:47:43,390
but at which is deterministic but can
also

732
00:47:43,390 --> 00:47:46,390
at we can also guess that Canada but if

733
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:49,410
ended with us processes with someone at
with

734
00:47:49,410 --> 00:47:53,250
sample ability finally we've seen as
somebody get a chance on

735
00:47:53,250 --> 00:47:57,080
and how something might not be as good
as at they seem to be

736
00:47:57,080 --> 00:48:04,080
thank you for listening and attending
%ah

737
00:48:04,650 --> 00:48:07,870
%ah

738
00:48:07,870 --> 00:48:14,870
estimate

739
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:30,380
now cause but like all the time you need

740
00:48:30,380 --> 00:48:35,880
that and either affair a few a few after
I left to be initialized I'm

741
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,470
before an I it will be an issue as

742
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:43,670
at after that can allow that I've after

743
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:47,049
after that number deny the mother is
initialized so

744
00:48:47,049 --> 00:48:51,140
in the time gap between the an when the
item number generator is initialized to

745
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:51,390
the

746
00:48:51,349 --> 00:48:55,579
to the time the out of mother arafat
civilization as

747
00:48:55,579 --> 00:49:02,579
it may be still be ivana yeah

748
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:11,930
yep you

749
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:16,109
are high that in that espy attack hair
you at at

750
00:49:16,109 --> 00:49:19,930
doing if if the platform with a week and
the platform with time attack target

751
00:49:19,930 --> 00:49:23,249
then you know method is that correct but
as upset as I have shown

752
00:49:23,249 --> 00:49:27,660
I'm and here this is the same problem

753
00:49:27,660 --> 00:49:33,079
about the just that if you have a candid
with a mixed up and

754
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:40,079
cannon with Anton at their Yarmouth can
be see the bypass

755
00:49:44,930 --> 00:49:46,290
exactly exact

756
00:49:46,290 --> 00:49:49,550
but we've seen that that there is some
talk and that Linux

757
00:49:49,550 --> 00:49:54,100
can develop a stance that actually want
to act inject and poppy

758
00:49:54,100 --> 00:49:58,260
to the pools that doing the bootloader
thanks so will see a

759
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:03,340
at where he develops up

760
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:08,270
yeah exactly cross

761
00:50:08,270 --> 00:50:15,270
miss this yeah

762
00:50:36,320 --> 00:50:43,320
up

763
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:48,660
yep

764
00:50:48,660 --> 00:50:54,240
exactly Estes

765
00:50:54,240 --> 00:51:01,240
I

766
00:51:09,569 --> 00:51:15,270
affect the combat that the computation
time but that what i've seen in your

767
00:51:15,270 --> 00:51:15,569
account

768
00:51:15,569 --> 00:51:19,400
us that that the actual function is
there is way air

769
00:51:19,400 --> 00:51:22,450
way at it's not that deterministic

770
00:51:22,450 --> 00:51:25,710
it depends on the bites that I expected
there I'm

771
00:51:25,710 --> 00:51:32,710
on time of the fun cashing fun and
education cost

772
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:47,700
up yep

773
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:06,310
this

774
00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:10,250
is a very good point what we've seen is
that I'm on some

775
00:52:10,250 --> 00:52:14,900
okay so when that pools I am other find

776
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:19,820
that the find using add this test static
a see that actin

777
00:52:19,820 --> 00:52:23,870
I am and them not initialized with their

778
00:52:23,870 --> 00:52:27,480
with zoso if in memory the page s

779
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:33,160
that were allocated at I its on specific
some specific ons

780
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:38,920
their at a.m. that transistor sign such
a way that

781
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:42,530
it will always a.m. nullify all make

782
00:52:42,530 --> 00:52:45,940
at pages set that too busy or but

783
00:52:45,940 --> 00:52:50,170
what we've seen is that I am in some

784
00:52:50,170 --> 00:52:53,470
and devices that I am a is

785
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:57,130
I'm away is and is a pic I know which

786
00:52:57,130 --> 00:53:01,050
show which if it is not

787
00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:04,700
allocate about on the internet we have
some noise I

788
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:08,460
and not that none of them is ignited
that we need to I am inkatha's on some

789
00:53:08,460 --> 00:53:08,950
devices

790
00:53:08,950 --> 00:53:12,580
I'm this and number on them

791
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:19,580
this on the numbers and that is very at
in predictable

792
00:53:34,119 --> 00:53:38,380
you yeah

793
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:45,380
bus frost yes

794
00:53:47,869 --> 00:53:48,280
this

795
00:53:48,280 --> 00:53:55,280
mmm

796
00:53:59,260 --> 00:54:06,260
up

797
00:54:13,890 --> 00:54:20,890
yes

798
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:30,230
I am we actually searched for this kinda
fair

799
00:54:30,230 --> 00:54:33,520
but if they're kinda thing because it
will make a attacked s

800
00:54:33,520 --> 00:54:37,050
most simple we didn't find an an

801
00:54:37,050 --> 00:54:40,119
any method that they can use I'm

802
00:54:40,119 --> 00:54:44,070
yet the second I am

803
00:54:44,070 --> 00:54:47,200
in a minute K I'm the secondary

804
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:50,220
can guess because now I am the second

805
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:54,310
you can just Anna with that the device
couple of times and just

806
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:58,290
so see what the second at doing when
that

807
00:54:58,290 --> 00:55:02,490
pulls out mix whether proceeded at that
time many

808
00:55:02,490 --> 00:55:09,490
yes this site

809
00:55:15,060 --> 00:55:19,190
I'm but the same end up each time

810
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:26,190
human yeah I'm

811
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:34,440
just I don't understand I'm

812
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:40,700
art I have Patna him out

813
00:55:40,700 --> 00:55:45,830
okay you know day it may be enhanced

814
00:55:45,830 --> 00:55:52,450
break up

815
00:55:52,450 --> 00:55:59,450
him

816
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:08,270
I'm okay so that's it

817
00:56:08,270 --> 00:56:15,270
up one final question this yes

818
00:56:26,790 --> 00:56:30,820
yeah okay I am

819
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:35,000
its a good question om what is seen is
that them

820
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:39,100
cont an CPU men effect us I am

821
00:56:39,100 --> 00:56:42,830
giving yeah and up could for accessing

822
00:56:42,830 --> 00:56:46,120
the tournament tonight %uh for example
the IBC then how the hair

823
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:49,720
and commence so essentially you could am

824
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:53,290
call at used on another data with

825
00:56:53,290 --> 00:56:57,190
and just a simple the how to and another
and another with a simple

826
00:56:57,190 --> 00:57:00,940
up cunt but this is not very common and
at

827
00:57:00,940 --> 00:57:04,750
today's architect us I'm a in the future
it many

828
00:57:04,750 --> 00:57:06,560
okay as thank you for attending
