1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,550
hello black hat house early today K

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:09,059
was at lunch awesome

3
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:12,010
the its

4
00:00:12,010 --> 00:00:16,660
tired I'm done I'm out grab the mic side
so today we're going to talk about

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:17,390
Amazon

6
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:20,689
and how do people buy just a show and
some

7
00:00:20,689 --> 00:00:24,180
and work to there was one o'neal see
everybody raises and that I austin

8
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:27,260
so um we're talking about

9
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,250
bringing Macha I was on what that means
i wanna talk about the cloud

10
00:00:31,250 --> 00:00:35,900
okay um but done so first lead to
serious myself to the obligatory I'm

11
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:39,860
America their peers and so I'm I'm
primarily ap psych I've been doing

12
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,059
outside for a long time

13
00:00:41,059 --> 00:00:46,129
work a lot of scanning products and are
right now working people bear code

14
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:50,309
where I am the director Technology
Strategy & we started getting into it

15
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:54,020
in been involved in building things into
beta we are in a big way um

16
00:00:54,020 --> 00:00:58,020
quite some time ago on a star play a
role in the US but since 2009

17
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:01,280
and along that way along their journey
it was

18
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,080
who's definitely it's a journey if you
wash other companies do so may be

19
00:01:05,080 --> 00:01:06,280
yourself personally

20
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:09,910
has gone through this journey on yet
really exciting you are very exciting

21
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:10,660
things and then you

22
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:14,149
you do a lot of scary things in and you
learn a lot of things by making one

23
00:01:14,149 --> 00:01:15,369
mistake long way so

24
00:01:15,369 --> 00:01:18,849
I'll be sharing a hero summer that as we
go to the talk

25
00:01:18,849 --> 00:01:21,849
um as I go through this if anybody has

26
00:01:21,849 --> 00:01:24,729
a question they feel like they just is
burning a hole in your pocket you gotta

27
00:01:24,729 --> 00:01:25,700
ask you feel free

28
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,459
go ahead it was a bad question I'm just
gonna ignore you but it's a good

29
00:01:29,459 --> 00:01:30,420
question

30
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,630
or bad question the same to the end but
it's up to you

31
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,080
%uh the big idea so may will have to
leave it to the end but I will leave

32
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,539
room for questions hopefully

33
00:01:38,539 --> 00:01:43,369
so I'm this is kinda agenda we're gonna
try to talk about this some

34
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:46,670
points hopefully this is really here for
me to keep on

35
00:01:46,670 --> 00:01:51,149
on topic but I'm we're gonna go through
live in intro and and and

36
00:01:51,149 --> 00:01:54,190
try groundings and then we'll end up on
a on

37
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,869
on things a at the very end and I have
the old angel project but the

38
00:01:57,869 --> 00:02:01,500
should be machete anyways so woodstock

39
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,539
about um how I would like everyone here

40
00:02:04,539 --> 00:02:08,399
troopers this talk or as a security
researcher to think about

41
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,640
cloud environments like it a US or or
anyone

42
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,640
anyone else I like you to take a moment
out something about clout as a SASE

43
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,590
pass I am

44
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:21,910
us hubble bubble of my ass whatever it
is and think about it

45
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:25,090
from a simple law and become a simpler
perspective

46
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,760
have cloud being an operating system
write something about what you get from

47
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,750
an operating system

48
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:34,190
you get this your memory you get
computer great rocket fuel economy a

49
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,500
distant memory a computer now have a way
to rate code in

50
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,310
and interface with API's and and manage
it that way and I think

51
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,460
this is the fundamental way that we
should view

52
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:48,330
cloud alarms as an operating system not
as something

53
00:02:48,330 --> 00:02:52,060
bunch a virtual machines are a buncha
services somebody else managers for me

54
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:55,320
or buncha whatever we want to call it
it's an operating system

55
00:02:55,320 --> 00:02:58,740
and it may be a very advanced server
system or maybe a simple one depending

56
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,030
upon the prior to using

57
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,490
but it's an operating system and if you
think a net

58
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:08,050
free mind %uh menu the approach it from
a the security research perspective

59
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:11,459
you can kinda change your perspective
about how you start to view things

60
00:03:11,459 --> 00:03:14,660
and you know Windows and Linux that's
just the microkernel

61
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:19,250
up this operating system right um and
select gonna lead you to think about

62
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:22,780
the infrastructure in the infrastructure
itself that's the code up the operating

63
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:23,500
system rain

64
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,010
I write a few lines the code whatever my
configuration management solutions

65
00:03:28,010 --> 00:03:31,130
choices maybe I use an small maybe are
you shocked when I create

66
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:34,410
infrastructure how to code and I do that
in a matter of seconds

67
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:38,340
and that he is in the PI's and make that
a possible

68
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:42,830
roll party that operating system in
nobody's really been spending time

69
00:03:42,830 --> 00:03:46,239
when you you think about it from an
operating system point of view um

70
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:49,660
doing a very specific part here targeted
kinda

71
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,690
testing from operating system benchmark
against sister

72
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:58,120
against against the club turn I'm sure
play people trying to hack in and was on

73
00:03:58,120 --> 00:03:59,560
all that other stuff i'm talking about.

74
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:04,800
the whole system rain so with that kind
of structure in my list talk a little

75
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:05,489
bit about

76
00:04:05,489 --> 00:04:08,910
the you know what you get just kinda
certain

77
00:04:08,910 --> 00:04:12,230
some baseline here so fully realized

78
00:04:12,230 --> 00:04:15,810
it a US application probably look
something like this: um

79
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:19,200
is just one fancy diagram there's lotsa
different fancy diagrams

80
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,490
but that's a lotta components all the
systems are virtualize all the systems

81
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,580
are created probably in seconds by

82
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:27,610
some script or something that you can
rate and

83
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:29,040
if you created manually from the

84
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,290
to the when you are you doing it wrong
but you know

85
00:04:32,290 --> 00:04:35,430
that's okay we all started their parade
and

86
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:38,920
in and make really systems and
traditionally when we thought about

87
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:42,340
building up an environment where mostly
thinking about our applications were

88
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:44,510
talking about application security
locking down

89
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:47,670
but the interesting thing about that is
the applications themselves it's a very

90
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:48,740
small part

91
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:53,780
up the overall system great so the Java
code I spent

92
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:58,000
months working on our PHP got better
whatever it is that you creating a new

93
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,630
putting that

94
00:04:58,630 --> 00:05:02,870
sorry have some biases poachers so you
know that you put into

95
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:06,220
in the environment up that's just a very
small part in an environment

96
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,290
and it exists in this much more
complicated space that

97
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:12,590
previous to something like a WSU just um

98
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:16,690
a pretended it worked fine because
somebody else's responsibility

99
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:20,210
but as a single individual you could
create all this and have it done in a

100
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:21,250
day and actually

101
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:24,970
deploy your application in there it but
you might not realize that

102
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:28,410
even though you create all this is all
share responsibility to secure and

103
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:29,150
manage all that

104
00:05:29,150 --> 00:05:33,550
and that's the entire system right the
majority system is gonna be provided by

105
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:37,140
whichever provider using the would say
to the US and

106
00:05:37,140 --> 00:05:40,530
wanna give you all these wonderful
pieces here it's your responsibility

107
00:05:40,530 --> 00:05:43,520
to make sure they're secure to make sure
that you're using them correctly and

108
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,830
that when you put them together

109
00:05:44,830 --> 00:05:48,920
you have introduced Dani Sordo firm a
you know emergent

110
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:52,850
a kind over chaos into that system
because it can get quite complex

111
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:56,850
so if that's where I try to go

112
00:05:56,850 --> 00:06:00,560
with nice environment that's clean and
make some room in a beautiful Visio

113
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,230
diagram

114
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:04,870
um waterway start out with well

115
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:08,850
I mean she coming to surprise you get
from a WSU getting quoting cooler than

116
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:12,180
infinite number rather empty racks that
you can do anything it's like that scene

117
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,280
from The Matrix where

118
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,640
new steps answers any guns what's gots

119
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:21,060
rate and just gun start showing up so
every day I wake up nigga I need servers

120
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,030
lotsa searchers

121
00:06:22,030 --> 00:06:26,410
trade and they just aren't showing up
and I was very exciting that's why Sir

122
00:06:26,410 --> 00:06:28,730
play areas the fact that I could go and
create

123
00:06:28,730 --> 00:06:33,520
100 systems just by clicking buttons was
unbelievable rent you get a friendly

124
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,510
web interface him on a long list the
support of compliance certifications

125
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:40,620
and then you show up your eye

126
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,580
break because

127
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:45,509
sterner we show up we put our stuff in
it and this is what happens

128
00:06:45,509 --> 00:06:49,270
we treat the the digital colour love
this

129
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:52,610
greater the virtual Columbus right we
the

130
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:56,080
we started with these grand ambitions
and everything's gonna be absolutely

131
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,969
perfect in clean just the way it started

132
00:06:57,969 --> 00:07:02,469
but a week goes by and maybe you take a
break in East about you gave what are

133
00:07:02,469 --> 00:07:04,150
your developer friends access to the

134
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:09,090
so the Consul wire when you come back
you like fire the 300 systems running in

135
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:12,110
what are the names and why do I have 50
launch

136
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:16,210
you know launch group zeros laying
around the world of our own rules open

137
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,340
to the entire internet and

138
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:21,849
what the hell is going on freidan oh my
God my bill it's like five thousand

139
00:07:21,849 --> 00:07:23,509
dollars what happened you know

140
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:28,289
people had that really fun experience
the first time we realize that

141
00:07:28,289 --> 00:07:33,879
you know and ask for Josh is a good be
really the bugs cost like real demoss

142
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:34,849
will dollars

143
00:07:34,849 --> 00:07:40,129
very quickly parade yeah arena bodyline
according to like group I just spent

144
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:41,020
three dollars

145
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:45,289
great so you get the digital or virtual
colon

146
00:07:45,289 --> 00:07:49,710
love this and if you're like me you were
at some point that guy hey

147
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:53,129
you are stuck in there somewhere trying
to figure out what on earth hebei

148
00:07:53,129 --> 00:07:56,419
and I got myself into and

149
00:07:56,419 --> 00:08:00,860
has a lot of people know you know it
building a applications on top in the US

150
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:04,129
is complicated le services I'm gonna
just do the safe route

151
00:08:04,129 --> 00:08:07,190
I'm in a forklift my existing
applications

152
00:08:07,190 --> 00:08:12,449
in Amazon because I had you know maybe
dozens maybe hundreds of people working

153
00:08:12,449 --> 00:08:13,849
on these absolute gotta

154
00:08:13,849 --> 00:08:16,879
operations team everybody understands it
on just a forklift them

155
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,229
and deploy them in the Amazon and

156
00:08:20,229 --> 00:08:23,349
you know that's a nice idea but the
problem is a forklift in can also be a

157
00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:24,349
little bit dangerous

158
00:08:24,349 --> 00:08:28,279
rate so did 450 is at Prosser taking a
legacy application

159
00:08:28,279 --> 00:08:31,349
and moving into a into something like
you to be with us

160
00:08:31,349 --> 00:08:35,860
a lot as most expensive way because
large house you'll realize

161
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:39,209
just how low our utilization of the
resources is

162
00:08:39,209 --> 00:08:43,500
rate so sometimes we oversize the
system's but it's also dangerous

163
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:46,990
right take all those existing controls
that you've got

164
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:50,810
here I D S is your firewalls you
whatever it is using some fancy some

165
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:53,060
products they've been tracking all the
events

166
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,779
you put that eatery us and it's all
wonderful but it's also completely

167
00:08:56,779 --> 00:08:57,480
oblivious

168
00:08:57,480 --> 00:09:01,110
to something to spend a lot of time
talking about which is the API

169
00:09:01,110 --> 00:09:06,149
and how that is the real a controller
for your entire environment

170
00:09:06,149 --> 00:09:10,440
the other problem that becomes a this
but also talk about his

171
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,850
on how previously in order very low
priority one abilities are bono's you

172
00:09:14,850 --> 00:09:16,640
didn't think were really that important
to you

173
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:19,930
become really bad things in in his own

174
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:23,970
and the meaning availability also
changes we had

175
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:28,000
dozen people who are tasked with keeping
a single machine up and running

176
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,959
I like to think availability in the in
the relative curity the media

177
00:09:31,959 --> 00:09:33,690
availability completely changes

178
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:38,240
in so it's not about having a dozen
people are under people are a million

179
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,670
people all tasked with keeping a single
machine running

180
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:44,760
availability native grasses about arm
having multiple

181
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:49,430
from multiple have everything right on
he'd have to lease two machines because

182
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:51,360
failure is guaranteed and

183
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,560
you on the Netflix guys talked a lot
about this in the past we've watched in

184
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,100
their talks we talk about what the die
was cast monkey

185
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:00,810
where they said you know it failed it's
inevitable that things are gonna blow up

186
00:10:00,810 --> 00:10:04,329
so let's just make the process have a
little faster so we love all the little

187
00:10:04,329 --> 00:10:04,950
bit faster

188
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:08,709
and it's true sooner or later its gonna
fail so that

189
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:11,670
one box that runs in your data center
that nobody knows what it does but

190
00:10:11,670 --> 00:10:13,170
generates a hundred million dollars

191
00:10:13,170 --> 00:10:18,120
you that in the cloud and you haven't
binary architecting it it's the Titanic

192
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:24,649
waiting to happen so all this sky comes
together in a bit what you note on the

193
00:10:24,649 --> 00:10:26,850
first point I want to make sure that
when I think about is

194
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:30,970
emergent in security rank hope you love
her like emergent properties a complex

195
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:31,630
systems

196
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:35,140
great where these properties come out of
the woodwork the could never possibly

197
00:10:35,140 --> 00:10:35,959
expect

198
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:39,420
lot of people spent a lot of time trying
to to

199
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,399
test every eventuality to test
everything that they can possibly do

200
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:43,860
before they deploy the software

201
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:47,459
the problem with an with an environment
like YouTube yessir really any cloud

202
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:48,000
provider

203
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:51,339
is that that environment has a lot of
very in predictable

204
00:10:51,339 --> 00:10:54,410
things 10 things I like the um

205
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:58,730
remark on quite a lot is a salir call
internet whether we people have ever

206
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:00,590
heard a internet weather

207
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:03,300
so I'm gonna be the world's first
Internet weather reporter

208
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:07,070
at some point Umair weathers you know
you come come to work one day and you're

209
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:09,300
looking at the scissors like everything
just seems to be running a little bit

210
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:09,890
slower

211
00:11:09,890 --> 00:11:12,970
%uh this everything seems to be running
a little faster

212
00:11:12,970 --> 00:11:17,330
the system seems to be um just behaving
little bit odd names kinda like very

213
00:11:17,330 --> 00:11:18,000
well in a

214
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,950
West region today things are running a
little bit slower but in the east it's

215
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:24,000
really fast it's going to be a nice
sunny day

216
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,470
for him so this internet weather can
affect your whole system so now

217
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:32,070
systems you got that were dependent on
having consistent access to disk or

218
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:35,300
a reliable bility to to communicate with
systems whether

219
00:11:35,300 --> 00:11:38,390
their avoidable 22 internet whether
great

220
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:42,420
and these kinda emerging problems start
to be to enter into the system in a

221
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,030
system that was perfectly secure

222
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:47,820
starts at these cascading failures and
if you look at but the most complex

223
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,020
systems in the world things like
airplanes are

224
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:53,610
things like that you'll see if this
cascading failure fact where what little

225
00:11:53,610 --> 00:11:55,300
things come together conspire

226
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:58,550
and cause a very a big problem of course
the

227
00:11:58,550 --> 00:12:02,890
larger scale this assumes the worse it
gets um

228
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:07,020
so in it whether guarantee failure
everything its offer to find

229
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:10,480
um a lot of people don't build systems
with the idea that

230
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,510
i can't. I can do the the virtual call
that love

231
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:18,150
yanking Ethernet card out a machine and
playing into another one without losing

232
00:12:18,150 --> 00:12:19,750
a packet rain

233
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:23,810
I can do that with an economy I can take
the virtual network adapter and plug it

234
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:24,520
into another one

235
00:12:24,520 --> 00:12:29,010
green um and then all the other band
management capabilities for all

236
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:29,600
happening

237
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,990
completely outside have any other
traditional controls and

238
00:12:32,990 --> 00:12:36,040
this some really talking about the PI an
API is

239
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:39,390
everything everything that we needed
really concern ourselves

240
00:12:39,390 --> 00:12:42,430
with the so my recommendation

241
00:12:42,430 --> 00:12:46,620
on that point kinda the the peace here
that you're comfortable on this is that

242
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:47,440
I recommend

243
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:51,460
on that we think about you know eventual
consistency from a security model

244
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:56,620
free this was really tough because you
say others to sounds kind of like a yr

245
00:12:56,620 --> 00:13:00,170
you know a perfect world and I I'll be
the first summit there certain type

246
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,180
decisions that are not going to map
under this

247
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:05,330
but the idea that you should get your
decision loop

248
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:09,620
tight enough so that you're able to
respond versus trying to control change

249
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:14,340
you're able to respond to change if you
can respond to change fast enough it's

250
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:17,220
better than being able to control change
because the truth is will never be able

251
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,290
to control change

252
00:13:18,290 --> 00:13:21,510
particularly in a cloud environment
where the changes are a lot of times are

253
00:13:21,510 --> 00:13:22,330
your control

254
00:13:22,330 --> 00:13:27,080
completely BRRip if you try to maintain
complete control on your entire system

255
00:13:27,080 --> 00:13:30,110
for managing and securing your
environment is but based on change

256
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:32,450
control on the move to an 80 s like
environment

257
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:36,110
where your developers might be sitting
at that console or

258
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:39,820
internet weather is affecting you one
day you're eventually gonna have chaos

259
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,570
you mention I can be able to survive

260
00:13:41,570 --> 00:13:46,460
when something does change and it will
happen um

261
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:50,770
you thinking about that how many people
heard about the when Netflix like a year

262
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:52,370
ago at christmastime like died

263
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:55,780
prior to that happen anybody people like
with the kids they're screaming

264
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:59,150
and so the year after that happened

265
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:03,090
how did people notice any disruption in
Netflix's services

266
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:07,220
how people knew that they shut off fifty
percent

267
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,540
their entire environment and nobody
noticed right

268
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:14,390
they realize that they couldn't control
change insulate and they have got in

269
00:14:14,390 --> 00:14:17,710
that promise bit them really big on
christmas probably the most important

270
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:21,240
times the year and they said I will at
best way for us to handle a sister

271
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:24,270
create the most chaotic event we can
imagine and

272
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:27,400
except that is going to happen and they
destroyed the entire

273
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:30,760
east coast to their operations they
failed over the west coast and nobody

274
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,020
noticed is amazing

275
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:36,540
now granted that works for streaming
platform we have millions users

276
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,740
it's gonna be a different approach if
you're managing a financial system we

277
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:43,020
have certain kinds of transactions that
have to maintain consistency

278
00:14:43,020 --> 00:14:47,850
see can apply this other obviously part

279
00:14:47,850 --> 00:14:49,040
so

280
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,149
I keep on talking about the API and this
is the king of the jungle

281
00:14:52,149 --> 00:14:56,440
line in this jungle line above in a US
our environment is the API

282
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:59,750
if we're thinking traditionally about
how I managing systems and I'm logging

283
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:03,060
in 20 min setting them up and creating
snowflakes from going about

284
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:07,329
things the way originally did I'm
missing out on a very powerful piece of

285
00:15:07,329 --> 00:15:08,319
that environment

286
00:15:08,319 --> 00:15:12,569
I'm also missing out on a entire channel
4 for how the environment gets managed

287
00:15:12,569 --> 00:15:16,430
or can be disrupted out from underneath
me. and that king in a jungle

288
00:15:16,430 --> 00:15:19,660
is the API's rip and that's why

289
00:15:19,660 --> 00:15:22,310
you know she's been a lot I'm just
looking at the time US Consul you

290
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:25,459
haven't delved into what you can do with
the API's are built on a mission around

291
00:15:25,459 --> 00:15:27,160
that you're missing out on a big part

292
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:30,959
love what um makes a powerful but also
what can make a very

293
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,380
dangers as well so when you think about

294
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:37,569
that new introduction this new line of
the jungle here

295
00:15:37,569 --> 00:15:41,089
you have to ask yourself what is
actually my new attack surface

296
00:15:41,089 --> 00:15:44,769
has a really interesting here kinda
famous quote from Chris trough we talked

297
00:15:44,769 --> 00:15:45,130
about

298
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:48,190
if your security sucks now you'll be
pleasantly surprised by the lack a

299
00:15:48,190 --> 00:15:48,860
change

300
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:53,750
we moved to the club right and um I
would I would argue that in reality it

301
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,089
actually get a lot worse

302
00:15:55,089 --> 00:15:58,860
doesn't get better and it's not because
anything that

303
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:02,540
Amazon Microsoft or anybody did it's
because

304
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:05,910
you haven't spend the time to understand
how these things

305
00:16:05,910 --> 00:16:10,440
affect you in it whether suffer define
everything and

306
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,620
you know the API and points let's talk
about those are second-rate

307
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:17,089
they're open by design a trump all
existing controls I can spend

308
00:16:17,089 --> 00:16:21,079
a lotta time walking I wish machine and
I couldn't come right back in behind in

309
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:21,860
clone it

310
00:16:21,860 --> 00:16:26,839
and disable other controls that are
created on the public a

311
00:16:26,839 --> 00:16:30,790
or the private eye peas might be public
when I create a machine inside it easy

312
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:32,230
to classic now most people

313
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:35,260
when they create a new character in in
BBC but a lotta systems

314
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:38,610
to your knees to classic you get a
private IP address

315
00:16:38,610 --> 00:16:43,269
udall sign in to put the public IP
address and used might think Owatonna 10

316
00:16:43,269 --> 00:16:43,610
dot

317
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:46,610
network range numbers can be whatever
see that I have my admin interface

318
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:47,579
running on that

319
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:52,649
well guess what if I'm a a customer in
the city classy I create my own private

320
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:55,829
system in there I can see the private IP
spaces

321
00:16:55,829 --> 00:16:58,949
is open to a lot of things I can poke
around and i've

322
00:16:58,949 --> 00:17:03,839
you know taken a very casual look
looking around in there are a lot of web

323
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:05,040
servers running out there

324
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:08,470
and saw get to that in a second night
but the only thing

325
00:17:08,470 --> 00:17:13,010
ultimately only thing that's really
standing between you anatole compromise

326
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:14,270
your entire data center

327
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:17,959
is the security or the secrecy a few API
keys

328
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:21,309
in you think about that for a second

329
00:17:21,309 --> 00:17:24,449
it's not just that they're gonna get
access to a few systems is that you

330
00:17:24,449 --> 00:17:25,530
gonna let somebody

331
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:31,640
get access to entire data center me so

332
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:36,179
API access in a virtual world and clout
world means physical access rain

333
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:39,250
and thats though the peace that we have
to realize is

334
00:17:39,250 --> 00:17:43,970
is a kinda good the linchpin to this
whole thing so

335
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:47,880
what exactly can happen if I R have the
the the you know

336
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:51,960
credential exposure well so pretty
common we probably heard about people

337
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,220
where they go in and

338
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:57,360
you know somebody I get access to the
keys the first thing you do is a set up

339
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,299
a bit cleaning my

340
00:17:58,299 --> 00:18:01,510
operationally people had that happen one

341
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:04,790
23 okay I'm I'm been lucky it hasn't
happened to me but

342
00:18:04,790 --> 00:18:07,970
it's some is very real and

343
00:18:07,970 --> 00:18:11,750
you know I think that everybody had that
happen till was actually the the

344
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,650
luckiest

345
00:18:12,650 --> 00:18:15,860
a bunch to be honest straight you had an
impact your bill

346
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:19,390
but what they can really do they go for
that they can adjust you know go in an

347
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,640
alter your applications a good start
spreading

348
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:24,860
know some sort them out where they can
use environment launch additional tax

349
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:28,940
they could download all your customer
data from from the environment I mean

350
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:32,820
maybe they do all for these things
ultimately once they're done with this

351
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,179
they can go in and make a new clean
tired Acer

352
00:18:35,179 --> 00:18:40,080
me and their companies are found this
out the hard way

353
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,669
who built environments I and and
accelerate their credentials get exposed

354
00:18:44,669 --> 00:18:47,059
and soldiers had been 20 mining
operations but

355
00:18:47,059 --> 00:18:52,240
there is a there is a pretty on up a
pretty big case where company had this

356
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,280
happen where they

357
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,700
lost their entire environment had to
shut down completely rain

358
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,300
so the entire

359
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,440
um ability for your a good company to
function

360
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:05,540
rests on top for the secrecy laws API
keys seen guess where I'm going with

361
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:08,400
this rain talking about how we might get
access to these keys for you

362
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:13,750
so where some other nutritional controls
I can bypass

363
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:17,530
so let's take it easy to system put in
the PC

364
00:19:17,530 --> 00:19:21,230
lock it down block all the network
traffic throw away the SSH keys throwing

365
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:22,130
the passwords

366
00:19:22,130 --> 00:19:26,230
just shut everything down make it
absolutely impossible in the physical

367
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:29,740
world I would have to actually at this
point walk up to the machine and

368
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:33,180
and do something on the Consul well

369
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:37,850
you can say that machine is completely
locked down but he ws I can just make an

370
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:40,060
API call for got the permission to do so

371
00:19:40,060 --> 00:19:43,560
I can make a call in their clone that
system open it up

372
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:47,220
I don't have the keys are at have
anything snapshot it mounted to a

373
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,790
machine that I do have control

374
00:19:48,790 --> 00:19:51,980
above and then I can extract anything I
need or want

375
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:55,250
the best part about that is there are no

376
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:57,820
traditional controls are you have in
place that are probably gonna attack me

377
00:19:57,820 --> 00:19:58,470
doing that

378
00:19:58,470 --> 00:20:02,150
very same is true for DS had built out

379
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:07,050
a my you know database posted in RTS
maybe it's bicycle Oracle PostgreSQL

380
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:11,990
and I don't need your passwords to get
to the database as new snapshot

381
00:20:11,990 --> 00:20:15,330
you could have come up with the world's
most complicated password database if I

382
00:20:15,330 --> 00:20:16,350
can snap shot it

383
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:20,890
I can mount it and take it someplace
else so is an attacker if i'm looking at

384
00:20:20,890 --> 00:20:22,860
your applications running in a WS

385
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,920
or any cloud environment and I and I'm

386
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:29,770
I look at that no go you know what I can
spend all day with the sequel injection

387
00:20:29,770 --> 00:20:31,040
vulnerability in trying to

388
00:20:31,040 --> 00:20:35,390
perfect or I could just find one of
these lesser volatile is an attack well

389
00:20:35,390 --> 00:20:36,040
in the second

390
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:40,480
extract the API keys clone a database

391
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,540
moving into another account so you don't
even see the impact your bill

392
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:46,830
and pulling all the data in completely
actual

393
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:50,350
X will treat all your information
without a without you ever really

394
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:51,370
knowing that happened

395
00:20:51,370 --> 00:20:55,540
I there's no transactions in your web
server so transactions in your idea

396
00:20:55,540 --> 00:20:56,690
slices know that

397
00:20:56,690 --> 00:21:00,580
I just made an EP I call copied it
snapshot of your database and I have all

398
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:01,470
your information

399
00:21:01,470 --> 00:21:03,850
so

400
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:06,740
what are some ways I can get access to
to the API's

401
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:10,430
right so the obvious big mistake as I
can

402
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:14,630
fuking actually checking API keys to get
home um

403
00:21:14,630 --> 00:21:19,420
I you know would like to believe that
that doesn't happen anymore

404
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:22,520
I did a search last night and a

405
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,890
I was really a really disturbed by what
I saw um

406
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:29,090
and I can also exploit born bilities
taxes metadata

407
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:32,070
so last night when I was going to get
help I did a quick search for secret

408
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,060
access key

409
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:36,630
and in like the second page A results
there's somebody is gonna have a very

410
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:37,180
bad day

411
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:40,690
right it was that easy so

412
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:44,800
the good news about this is that Amazon
and other folks and on wiser than they

413
00:21:44,800 --> 00:21:45,700
are proactively

414
00:21:45,700 --> 00:21:48,660
going out there and trying to find the
stuff and alert people before it becomes

415
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:50,510
bad so they are doing the right thing

416
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:54,480
but this is something that's all too
easy to do so

417
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,110
be very careful about when you're
checking in your code that you not

418
00:21:57,110 --> 00:21:58,510
hardcore your credentials

419
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:01,560
it's so easy to do almost everybody does
it

420
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,430
thankfully when you go through a lot
according to hurt you start to see a lot

421
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:05,760
of placeholders for things

422
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:10,100
um so it's a suggestion that people are
getting wiser maybe they just got burned

423
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:11,220
by a little bit too much

424
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,960
um but if you want to think about how

425
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:18,990
a you know quickly this can turn from
you know a mistake to really bad

426
00:22:18,990 --> 00:22:23,620
um set up in a pure honey pot take an
account you don't care about what does

427
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:25,820
know systems check in those credentials
when you get home

428
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:29,880
and then spend a little time looking at
your environment within about 60 minutes

429
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:30,760
you should see

430
00:22:30,760 --> 00:22:34,150
machine starting to pop up in your
environment in

431
00:22:34,150 --> 00:22:37,570
so the 62nd 15 minutes about six minutes
or less

432
00:22:37,570 --> 00:22:41,160
maybe sixty seconds it depends if you
get lucky great

433
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:45,130
arm and it'll be amazing but while the
power the cloud

434
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:48,030
put all these machines just generating
themselves except you're not the one

435
00:22:48,030 --> 00:22:49,200
doing it right near the

436
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,930
next thing you know there's a neighbor
very effective at cleaning my knee

437
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:56,430
operation environment so that's the best
thing that could possibly happen

438
00:22:56,430 --> 00:23:00,820
how can I get accesses the PI's if I
haven't like gone accidentally checked

439
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:02,410
into my counter event

440
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:06,090
arm just made some really really dumb
mistake by posting my

441
00:23:06,090 --> 00:23:09,540
credentials online somewhere arm and so
the first

442
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:13,890
area that our focus on is medida and

443
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:16,650
if you search on Google for images
military don't kind

444
00:23:16,650 --> 00:23:19,930
really cool Metallica like stuff I had
no idea the Internet is awesome:

445
00:23:19,930 --> 00:23:24,060
parade so I love this particular want to
lose cloud medicaid okay

446
00:23:24,060 --> 00:23:28,380
and it is out there and I'll something
that we don't necessarily think about

447
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:32,040
but when I bring a machine inside ABC to

448
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,060
on there is made it is socially with
that machine so that the machine can

449
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:38,420
know who it is what it is to do when it
starts up how's going to bootstrap

450
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:41,910
and if I'm using some other permissions
and policy models

451
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:45,740
but I should be using um it can also
contain credentials

452
00:23:45,740 --> 00:23:50,360
so what is cloud midday to so it's

453
00:23:50,360 --> 00:23:53,830
kinda loosely based on a standard RC
stare that was um

454
00:23:53,830 --> 00:23:59,130
kinda taken for this just ask and on it
does all kinds of awesome things

455
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:02,860
on so I can drop a startup scripts of
your wondered how a a

456
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:06,690
ec2 instance can not automatically
bootstrap itself

457
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:09,840
on how I can pass a script into that
machine when it starts up

458
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:14,550
are misusing something a project a cloud
in it that polls in the service the

459
00:24:14,550 --> 00:24:15,140
scripts

460
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:18,220
I'm actually starts up runs them and um

461
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:22,050
up I can put a lot information the meta
data as well outside over

462
00:24:22,050 --> 00:24:26,420
no tags and other information um and
then it also has all kinds of other data

463
00:24:26,420 --> 00:24:29,820
and it's not just a WS that has this all
cloud providers have

464
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:33,640
made it is to some extent except
massagers little bit different

465
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:38,160
um and they actually have it in a in a
fixed file that lives on that the

466
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:38,940
filesystem

467
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:42,570
all the other ones provided dynamically
through this the to this interface

468
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:47,090
um and interesting enough I just learned
on just the other day that

469
00:24:47,090 --> 00:24:51,050
while Google has this they have
introduced a custom header

470
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:54,870
that makes it much much are harder to
get access the meta data which

471
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:58,840
hope kinda make it more difficult to
extract omitted from systems and some

472
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:00,030
other technical talk about

473
00:25:00,030 --> 00:25:04,020
but some at least you know least there's
some ideas how this will improve and I i

474
00:25:04,020 --> 00:25:08,070
expect it will prove at some point but
right now if I make a request to that he

475
00:25:08,070 --> 00:25:09,130
ws URL

476
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:11,120
I just fire up w

477
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,710
you know that you get a curl I'm gonna
get back a lot really interesting

478
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:15,400
information

479
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:19,690
and I would recommend the use the W to
curl because

480
00:25:19,690 --> 00:25:23,200
using the command-line tools you're not
going to get everything so here's just a

481
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,030
list I've

482
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:28,200
you know running this sudden you get
command what I'm going to %uh get outta

483
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:28,870
this

484
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:32,340
and you can see I got all kinds a great
stuff you know what my upper

485
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:36,570
public IP addresses what my entrance
ideas is all the things that I have

486
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:40,440
II can't necessarily get together
outside the system but

487
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:43,550
some just wanna W get it man is going to
be axed all this

488
00:25:43,550 --> 00:25:47,880
and each one of the ones I hear that is
a folder means there's more data behind

489
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:51,100
a more information now

490
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:55,820
if I wanted to extract my credentials
how to meditate if I find a policy or

491
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,420
profile to my instance

492
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:01,600
um what's gonna happen is its gonna put
that information

493
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,030
into a key that's been a into the I am

494
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:09,580
a key with the security council's under
a profile name just gonna have to do a

495
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:11,809
couple request to figure out what the
profilers

496
00:26:11,809 --> 00:26:15,290
let me get back something like this and

497
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:18,480
the data in red is everything that I
need to authenticate

498
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:22,550
and get access right I can take that
information

499
00:26:22,550 --> 00:26:25,700
pop that in a configuration file my
local machine nm

500
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:29,170
basically I have these credentials now
ready to go running on my system and I

501
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:31,880
can make those API calls with his
credentials from anywhere

502
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:36,170
the need to be so of course the
questionnaire you wondering is are also

503
00:26:36,170 --> 00:26:37,710
I can run this from the local machine

504
00:26:37,710 --> 00:26:40,840
on what can I what else can I do with
this home I got it

505
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:44,410
get this outside the machine that I
already have access to right

506
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:48,420
a course these keys rotate I think
there's a 24 hour time line on

507
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:52,120
on on how long this key rotates but a
twenty-four hours and do a lot of damage

508
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:53,250
in 24 hours

509
00:26:53,250 --> 00:26:58,370
so this is where so many old ball
abilities I was talking about

510
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:02,490
kinda gain a new life um some other ones
that were on

511
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:05,670
clearly worse to spend a lot of time
worrying about like a man injection for

512
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:08,260
tonight not be thinking about sir site
request forgery

513
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:12,380
re been wondering about you know
unintended proxy all these kinda lead in

514
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,520
a in a direction of where I can

515
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:17,690
somehow tricked the application that I
still to make a

516
00:27:17,690 --> 00:27:21,460
web request on my behalf and

517
00:27:21,460 --> 00:27:24,390
blotted his own abilities are out there
but a lot of times people what's the big

518
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:28,350
deal I can trick the application to go
pull down you know web page somewhere

519
00:27:28,350 --> 00:27:31,670
or remember all the military API's are
just

520
00:27:31,670 --> 00:27:35,380
posted on a web euro right so um

521
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:39,740
what I do it that well some real-world
examples that are

522
00:27:39,740 --> 00:27:42,980
ami people heard about what happen to
present suppresses a

523
00:27:42,980 --> 00:27:46,100
presentation company that some they've

524
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:49,390
the crew this candid new way to do
presentations and

525
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:53,400
they have a configuration file in there
entirely in a us-based you can upload

526
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:54,920
their configuration file in the

527
00:27:54,920 --> 00:27:58,250
into into their environment Carlos it
even put your roles

528
00:27:58,250 --> 00:28:02,380
the presentation like go fetch this
image in putting the presentation for me

529
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:06,570
so the attacker was

530
00:28:06,570 --> 00:28:10,360
actually chasing a bug bounty very
responsibly disclose this

531
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:14,330
arm figured out so I'm just gonna go and
create presentation has every single

532
00:28:14,330 --> 00:28:15,090
meta-data

533
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:18,210
URL and information request that I need

534
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:21,360
let me put that in a presentation you
know blood present

535
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:25,470
and within seconds he got back a
presentation that was perfect at all the

536
00:28:25,470 --> 00:28:27,660
private data on the instance that was
running

537
00:28:27,660 --> 00:28:31,070
rape any did this because he is able to

538
00:28:31,070 --> 00:28:35,050
exploit one of those windows I just
talked about um

539
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:38,730
at Black Hat in in Vegas this year and
return Cherokee

540
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:43,930
published a a a technique similar to
this using a service I request will

541
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:48,760
availability up our request forgery so
we where he can go in

542
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,770
and to the same thing he was testing
application

543
00:28:51,770 --> 00:28:55,560
forget how do you treat the application
request URL request the meta-data

544
00:28:55,560 --> 00:29:00,070
pull that back and %ah many had actually
taken a step further he found out that

545
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:03,600
they had tried at least a lockdown the
the policy associate with those

546
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:04,380
credentials

547
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:07,840
so all I can do is injector s us SQS
message

548
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:12,540
on May into the query cue system that
delivers provide you

549
00:29:12,540 --> 00:29:17,040
Armenia to exploit a a celery Python
board already but once he was in there

550
00:29:17,040 --> 00:29:21,010
nearly PI access it was only a matter of
time and

551
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:24,810
as you start to look you start to think
about these model is a lower priority or

552
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:27,660
ones that we have necessarily been
looking at because we've only been

553
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:30,490
concerning ourselves a sequel injection
cross-site scripting

554
00:29:30,490 --> 00:29:34,510
if we haven't been thinking about these
types of all the boys the ones that are

555
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:36,320
maybe not as exciting

556
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,659
remove the car we could be in for very
rude awakening rape

557
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:43,880
so what are some other things that I can
do

558
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:47,190
to control API access we'll is not a
whole heck of a lot now if

559
00:29:47,190 --> 00:29:50,529
if you're using I'm who the buyer me
because they have a custom header it's

560
00:29:50,529 --> 00:29:52,580
very hard to forge a custom header

561
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:56,470
into a request started to do that so
that that's gonna stop a lot of things

562
00:29:56,470 --> 00:29:57,809
but even a WS

563
00:29:57,809 --> 00:30:01,970
the only control I really have as I can
specify source IP address

564
00:30:01,970 --> 00:30:06,179
when I apply that to a policy arm that
our Creator I sign

565
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:10,169
to my API credentials and I can assign a

566
00:30:10,169 --> 00:30:14,750
source IP in that in you know one thing
I might consider doing is assigning the

567
00:30:14,750 --> 00:30:18,940
the source AP the VPC gateway that's
being used in my view BC environment

568
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:23,080
on you can't lock it down to just are
just lucky down to 10 dot

569
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:27,340
one hit a private IP address space
because anybody else in a dubious can

570
00:30:27,340 --> 00:30:30,470
fire from machine in private IP space to
make that same request

571
00:30:30,470 --> 00:30:34,289
right um so that one %uh control you can
do

572
00:30:34,289 --> 00:30:38,740
um it I think this is going to improve
in time I'm sure that the data versus

573
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:41,779
is was gonna think about how to lock
this down I think the group what Google

574
00:30:41,779 --> 00:30:43,419
is doing is gonna try to become a
standard

575
00:30:43,419 --> 00:30:48,580
on it doesn't asylum at the problem if I
have a commanding general ability I can

576
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,320
still get

577
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:53,720
access that information and it once I
figure out as an attacker that you're

578
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,889
reading it in to us

579
00:30:54,889 --> 00:30:57,950
the first thing that I should be going
for is not

580
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:01,590
any of the other volatile is only thing
I care about is getting access to your

581
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:02,110
metadata

582
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:05,480
because thats ideally gonna give me
access to love

583
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:09,659
autumn bus a secure environment course I
need to make sure that I'm walking down

584
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:11,039
those policies and thats

585
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:15,440
one the other problems I see quite often
great so how do you detect if this is

586
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,179
even happening

587
00:31:16,179 --> 00:31:19,269
great well for a lot of people um

588
00:31:19,269 --> 00:31:22,379
the use their bill as the IDS system

589
00:31:22,379 --> 00:31:25,789
when he moved to to something like
Amazon rain like her

590
00:31:25,789 --> 00:31:29,309
I got a really big bill something bad
must be happening crane

591
00:31:29,309 --> 00:31:32,620
that became their there there the
intrusion detection system

592
00:31:32,620 --> 00:31:36,039
and you know they may not get that bill
for for 30 days

593
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:39,429
arm all these people been extremely
lucky

594
00:31:39,429 --> 00:31:45,230
great so my task is you know please
please don't use your bill as an IDS

595
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:49,190
um ask yourself am i doing anything to
actually detect or know what's happening

596
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:50,110
in the background

597
00:31:50,110 --> 00:31:54,770
when he's a pic API calls are being made
am i monitoring this side channel that's

598
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:55,570
that's occurring

599
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:59,510
in my environment and um you know there
are a lot of things you can do their

600
00:31:59,510 --> 00:32:02,600
first you can turn on Cloud trail you to
be of some people

601
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:05,790
a player like larger to turn this on

602
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:09,690
immediately police are everybody should
have this turn on I think it should be

603
00:32:09,690 --> 00:32:10,720
on by default

604
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:13,790
the moment you a start a new

605
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:17,540
account any research turn this on you
turn on in all the regions

606
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:21,480
it'll start storing all the access
requests that are happening in the

607
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:25,120
to your API all the PI calls and
everything the start storing it in a

608
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:25,620
bucket

609
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:30,300
s3 bucket your choice and you know you
can say no no just keep six months worth

610
00:32:30,300 --> 00:32:30,930
a dater

611
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:34,660
or however long you want to store it I'm
you can do something like large stash

612
00:32:34,660 --> 00:32:37,880
as open source solution to track and
monitor all that information

613
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:41,390
on you can go on life commercial
solution but if you're

614
00:32:41,390 --> 00:32:45,140
building a system we're trying to detect
intrusions in your universal varmint and

615
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:47,090
you're not looking at your clout roll
records

616
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:52,000
that's a huge problem that's a huge
mistake absolutely please turn on

617
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:56,460
once you turn on your trying to watch it
now you gotta really turn your attention

618
00:32:56,460 --> 00:33:00,510
to what I cause excessive lack of access
control which is where you got

619
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:02,520
developers creating policies like this

620
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,960
great how many people have been like I
don't know why it's not working well

621
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:05,760
just open it up

622
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,280
creche now just open up more permissions
all channeled

623
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:12,580
I will get back and we'll fix that later
just the API I'm not giving anyone the

624
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,310
keys rate

625
00:33:13,310 --> 00:33:16,750
well this is the absolute worst thing
you did on only only a

626
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:20,000
the I've seen people over if you like
lol

627
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:25,000
um a lock it down and in on a block a
few services but then they allow people

628
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,140
to access I am

629
00:33:26,140 --> 00:33:29,380
why can create user count all in one
greats like green commissions

630
00:33:29,380 --> 00:33:34,400
on so this this can access a lack access
control is is kinda party was %uh the

631
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:36,090
Debs culture which I love

632
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:39,170
on because I think it's all about
getting stuff done

633
00:33:39,170 --> 00:33:43,550
both as we give developers who don't
necessarily have a great track record of

634
00:33:43,550 --> 00:33:45,940
security because in focus on building
great stuff

635
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:49,800
bring them into this environment where
there are often predisposed to just

636
00:33:49,800 --> 00:33:50,780
making it work

637
00:33:50,780 --> 00:33:53,539
%uh you start to see a lot of policies
like that

638
00:33:53,539 --> 00:33:56,879
and when I'm what did a lot of the
toughest environments missus happen in

639
00:33:56,879 --> 00:33:57,379
every

640
00:33:57,379 --> 00:34:01,039
a division by me that I looked at we
have some developers are new at the

641
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:03,889
start reading the stuff they start using
the Wizards in the

642
00:34:03,889 --> 00:34:06,869
automated systems and mister cream these
policies that are basically open

643
00:34:06,869 --> 00:34:07,590
completely

644
00:34:07,590 --> 00:34:11,059
and there's really no way daughter all
that stuff

645
00:34:11,059 --> 00:34:14,799
so it's on us to kinda

646
00:34:14,799 --> 00:34:18,159
guide ugh you know the folks are using
this and keep

647
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,720
um you know keep develops popular
powerful by not

648
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:25,429
a not allowing developers kinda should
themselves before our

649
00:34:25,429 --> 00:34:28,990
ourselves if we're the ones playing
around with it and realize that

650
00:34:28,990 --> 00:34:33,129
that API access is actually the most
important thing that I should be

651
00:34:33,129 --> 00:34:36,379
concerning myself with not spending
years trying to make sure that I P

652
00:34:36,379 --> 00:34:37,839
tables rules are perfect

653
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:42,079
very on a security group rules a perfect
those things are important but

654
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:46,419
if I'm like to meet guys they're all
easily bypassed

655
00:34:46,419 --> 00:34:50,730
the other piece of information that

656
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:53,909
the week sometimes think need to think
about in terms of where data can leak

657
00:34:53,909 --> 00:34:56,549
out a made up his environment is

658
00:34:56,549 --> 00:35:00,069
tags: so tags: is something I can assign
a pretty much any

659
00:35:00,069 --> 00:35:03,119
entity NAWS arm

660
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:06,760
its the really wonderful towards the
only way you're really gonna be able to

661
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,920
make sense of stuff because everything
is got you know complicated ID numbers

662
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,630
assertion with you never can remember

663
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:16,170
unless you're a man and so you can use
tags the same stuff but realize

664
00:35:16,170 --> 00:35:20,680
a lot of us are probably also using
third-party services that help us manage

665
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:24,520
eww us they were using something that
helps keep track of our bills they were

666
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,660
using something that starts up systems
like

667
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:30,049
rates kilowatt not help me create
environments well they have access to

668
00:35:30,049 --> 00:35:31,000
all the tax

669
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,569
maybe I'm using a a a permissions model

670
00:35:34,569 --> 00:35:39,079
I can do this in an address I can define
a policy that defines

671
00:35:39,079 --> 00:35:44,480
who has axed what based on tags what
I've just done there's transition the

672
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:48,420
the security rights to whoever can trade
in change tags:

673
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:51,890
if they can create or change tags in my
environment now they can create

674
00:35:51,890 --> 00:35:55,730
or change the permissions my environment
effectively

675
00:35:55,730 --> 00:35:58,640
and i've seen people put a lot of very
interesting stuff in here in tax I've

676
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:00,230
seen people put passwords in here

677
00:36:00,230 --> 00:36:04,579
she people put hip Yankees in here
thinking all this is just gonna stay

678
00:36:04,579 --> 00:36:05,569
with an A to B us

679
00:36:05,569 --> 00:36:09,710
those are some of the most scary
examples that information can leak out

680
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:16,710
previously so title about this just
explain just kinda how that works of I'm

681
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:17,650
running in

682
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:21,309
in ec2 classic in really the way to get
around this is to you should get off the

683
00:36:21,309 --> 00:36:22,069
city class

684
00:36:22,069 --> 00:36:25,170
can get into BBC but for example let's
say I'm

685
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:30,230
I'm on a system and I say tell me what
the I IP addresses for for us

686
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:33,490
a system that I've created in maybe
given a nice

687
00:36:33,490 --> 00:36:37,589
a your CNAME it tells me oh it's an
alias for this other site known to go

688
00:36:37,589 --> 00:36:38,099
into

689
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:41,329
Amazon ifill what what is that site
resolved to

690
00:36:41,329 --> 00:36:44,339
and if I make that DNS resolution inside
Amazon

691
00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:49,250
it was on to something extremely helpful
which is a translator to the private IP

692
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:52,900
that I can use a little my when I'm do
in my network requests

693
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:55,920
his router with in Amazon's environment
which is great

694
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,920
because I traffic doesn't have to go
over the open Internet but I now know

695
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,940
that this server

696
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:05,089
is listening on that private IP address
know why is a useful

697
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:09,119
long time ago we used to you know seem
all abilities where

698
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:13,339
arm a lot of debug information used to
escape we used to see a lot of %uh

699
00:37:13,339 --> 00:37:16,880
extra error messages are details like
that and then people started saying

700
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:19,930
you're on a turnout of whenever the web
server is listening on up

701
00:37:19,930 --> 00:37:23,880
public IP address and make sure that it
doesn't give any detail their messages

702
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:27,940
for private IP address are probably
developer using that system so I'm going

703
00:37:27,940 --> 00:37:29,200
to cough up all the goods

704
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:34,750
very still happens today and I can tell
you looking at some other systems that I

705
00:37:34,750 --> 00:37:36,010
saw inside a dubious

706
00:37:36,010 --> 00:37:40,030
that their in that same ballpark giving
up a lot more information

707
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:43,619
or their administrative in for
interfaces that their not expecting the

708
00:37:43,619 --> 00:37:45,000
entire world have access to

709
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:49,410
granted if i if i my webserver behind

710
00:37:49,410 --> 00:37:52,390
you know he'll be a meeting at the he'll
be IP address that may not be very

711
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:53,260
useful to me

712
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:56,950
but if I do manage to get the actual IP
address that's going to be

713
00:37:56,950 --> 00:38:00,170
very useful to me because that's where
mister my attack it's not the public

714
00:38:00,170 --> 00:38:00,829
side

715
00:38:00,829 --> 00:38:05,059
and to spend all day going over the
Amazon network very high speed

716
00:38:05,059 --> 00:38:06,640
and testing a private private

717
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:12,820
office is also an opportunity to leak
things

718
00:38:12,820 --> 00:38:16,610
out about our services so looking at it
and yes pockets some there is some

719
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:17,970
research that was done

720
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:21,400
I'm a little while ago about one in
seven buckets out there have

721
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:25,020
absolutely no access credentials on the
role whatsoever is completely open

722
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:28,360
um that's probably intentional for a lot
of them

723
00:38:28,360 --> 00:38:31,880
but just taking kinda cursory look at
some other stuff out there i think

724
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:35,890
actually this example where it's just
excessive lack of access control

725
00:38:35,890 --> 00:38:39,310
with ABS um

726
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:43,240
sometimes I don't think about you know
how easy it is to just clone a system

727
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,930
me how many times you had a system in
Amazon were just destroyed so for some

728
00:38:46,930 --> 00:38:48,610
reason like I can't get it to boot

729
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:51,920
coming in to get access to it the answer
to that is just

730
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:56,430
snapshot amounted to another machine
that does boo you can easily get access

731
00:38:56,430 --> 00:38:56,860
to it

732
00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:01,210
by can use that same method of attack if
I've gotten access to environment

733
00:39:01,210 --> 00:39:05,750
the cloning machine I don't need your
SSH keys rent um

734
00:39:05,750 --> 00:39:10,110
I can get around that if I in enable EBS
encryption you might not a turn on TBS

735
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,800
encryption real you're thinking of

736
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:15,760
they've got the keys so I don't really
it's is a real encryption anyways

737
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,540
because they've got the keys with the
resuming

738
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:21,020
just turned on its like an impact
anything and it's actually going to

739
00:39:21,020 --> 00:39:21,540
prevent

740
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:26,210
this title for up cloning the
environment to take that out of the

741
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:27,730
environment for bringing in my own

742
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:31,650
and it's a very easy flag that you can
turn on

743
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:37,310
new creating UBS falling all that comes
together kinda call like to

744
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:40,610
glycol hear the full stack attack we
have a lot of these little different

745
00:39:40,610 --> 00:39:44,760
pieces of information or are leakage
where I've got private IP space which

746
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,380
gives me an administrative interface

747
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:49,690
I can find all abilities more likely in
that type interface

748
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:53,990
because the ability to extract meta-data
I can go from there to find API keys let

749
00:39:53,990 --> 00:39:56,130
me create other accounts are maybe's
clone

750
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:59,650
additional information or clone your
database and I can do all that

751
00:39:59,650 --> 00:40:02,690
outside of the traditional world

752
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:07,850
rate again not spending any time banging
on the front door be application where

753
00:40:07,850 --> 00:40:11,000
you've got all your defenses all your
logs everything that's managing that

754
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:11,970
point it at that

755
00:40:11,970 --> 00:40:13,260
playing at a bar

756
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:17,450
I'm so to get a handle on all that to
kind of

757
00:40:17,450 --> 00:40:22,020
some a help you know people are using in
areas better understand

758
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:26,230
are what permissions they have in their
environment are mice are working on a

759
00:40:26,230 --> 00:40:26,910
tool

760
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:30,200
our minutes early you know got a great
name in a

761
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:34,210
and an image Chris and I and the idea
was to

762
00:40:34,210 --> 00:40:37,950
um give people ability kinda new range
from this data so they can see what's

763
00:40:37,950 --> 00:40:38,600
going on

764
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:42,650
and doing it very Automator pramanik way
so that I don't have to spend more time

765
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:43,940
looking at a web UI

766
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:47,700
um you don't bring an informational the
closer

767
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,750
in a lot a big sis is out there that a
lot of people create things and

768
00:40:50,750 --> 00:40:54,420
a.m. Amazon's got a couple to all the
talk about a couple other tools are out

769
00:40:54,420 --> 00:40:54,820
there

770
00:40:54,820 --> 00:40:58,310
I'm so this isn't the only thing that's
out there um but I wanted to make my

771
00:40:58,310 --> 00:40:59,260
life easier

772
00:40:59,260 --> 00:41:02,480
on a couple things um will

773
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,500
first things I want to be able to
analyze all that I am permissions and

774
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:09,330
and really understand what does this
user this key actually have access to

775
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:11,280
what can a touch what can a touch

776
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:16,810
re um the other pieces I want to be able
to record all services and things are in

777
00:41:16,810 --> 00:41:19,650
use like so I can start to understand
what are some of those connections

778
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:20,740
between the environment

779
00:41:20,740 --> 00:41:25,170
arm and I also want to be able to crack
open these am I Z vs images quickly

780
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:29,010
and extract as much information as I
could from them on if I ever needed to

781
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:32,550
and of course last part is coming soon
I'm sorry

782
00:41:32,550 --> 00:41:36,950
still working on are so I'm a couple
screenshots

783
00:41:36,950 --> 00:41:41,260
other sis is not a fancy interface on
there but I wanted to be something I can

784
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:45,220
a good script in control says just
example doing some permissions analysis

785
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:47,390
where I'm extracting all the all the
keys

786
00:41:47,390 --> 00:41:50,470
it's not going to make a lotta sense
it's lotta tiny taxed

787
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:53,660
by this cut output is the kind of thing
where it's going to come back and say

788
00:41:53,660 --> 00:41:54,050
okay

789
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:58,030
this user can access these things are
these systems call be accessed through

790
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:58,820
this user

791
00:41:58,820 --> 00:42:02,550
and start to connect those dots together
um

792
00:42:02,550 --> 00:42:06,070
the other part pieces basically pulling
all the resources together

793
00:42:06,070 --> 00:42:09,150
um and the the piece that I I wanna

794
00:42:09,150 --> 00:42:12,240
make also corporatist wall is the
ability to track

795
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:15,770
change rate arm after the fact

796
00:42:15,770 --> 00:42:19,610
soak interface workload trail large if
you haven't even arm

797
00:42:19,610 --> 00:42:22,650
been running that you just are that the
that's great wish you had those running

798
00:42:22,650 --> 00:42:24,340
for a while to pull information in

799
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:27,970
so you can see what changed when are
based on

800
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:32,640
arm you know how this your system is
extracted information so I can see here

801
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:36,790
that the cc2 system transition from
running state to stop stayed on this

802
00:42:36,790 --> 00:42:37,460
time in

803
00:42:37,460 --> 00:42:41,540
why not and I get that information out
of a lot of other tools

804
00:42:41,540 --> 00:42:45,210
I like it that %uh the ABS consul but
after 14 days all

805
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:48,250
or couple hours that information can be
gone

806
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:51,530
or have to go digging through the
clutter logs sohn

807
00:42:51,530 --> 00:42:55,050
I'm really trying to make this
information more at your fingertips

808
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:59,370
and they're certainly other tools out
there like Netflix the security monkey

809
00:42:59,370 --> 00:43:03,790
a whole buncha open source stuff that's
very good tracking resources

810
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:06,830
I think what you'll find very
interesting %uh the two-alarm

811
00:43:06,830 --> 00:43:11,020
gonna hopefully release for senior is
its focus on I am permissions

812
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:14,780
and really defining exactly what the
user candor can't do and what resources

813
00:43:14,780 --> 00:43:16,520
and systems as access to

814
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:21,090
on if you have a higher support level
within a WSU also have something called

815
00:43:21,090 --> 00:43:22,310
trusted advisor

816
00:43:22,310 --> 00:43:25,540
which provides a lot to get information
to give you some modeling tools for your

817
00:43:25,540 --> 00:43:26,910
security group as well

818
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:31,040
arm and then Andreas released his number
stratos tool which was

819
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:35,040
designed it can exploit that very
specific mobility found extract metadata

820
00:43:35,040 --> 00:43:39,380
army also has some I am are things
there's what's worth checking out some

821
00:43:39,380 --> 00:43:39,960
good stuff

822
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:43,280
so you guys have been

823
00:43:43,280 --> 00:43:46,500
a great audience I hope this kinda
broaden your mind to think about what

824
00:43:46,500 --> 00:43:49,940
we're building a diverse environment how
you would go about that I want

825
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:53,740
if anything for you to come out other
sister one

826
00:43:53,740 --> 00:43:56,950
hope that you have a electric in in all
your clouds

827
00:43:56,950 --> 00:44:00,800
but to think about the AP I think about
what's possible that

828
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,890
when you forklift in your applications
bring in India into an

829
00:44:03,890 --> 00:44:07,310
Amazon environment don't just think
about the traditional controls

830
00:44:07,310 --> 00:44:10,800
realize you've got this a this this big
hole you can drive a truck through

831
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,620
basically

832
00:44:11,620 --> 00:44:15,540
and and spent some time trying to lock
that down any questions from

833
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:22,150
sure

834
00:44:22,150 --> 00:44:29,150
in

835
00:44:30,370 --> 00:44:31,100
yes so

836
00:44:31,100 --> 00:44:34,660
their environment as is perfect until
you show up rate you know and then you

837
00:44:34,660 --> 00:44:36,570
start putting your stuff in the
environment so

838
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:41,010
all the certs lovin go out the window
the moment you start to play wraps

839
00:44:41,010 --> 00:44:45,330
some people love consider like 20
Amazon's got PCI certification

840
00:44:45,330 --> 00:44:48,400
great on your PC s urs no doesn't work
that way rate

841
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,560
arm they've gone and certified their

842
00:44:51,560 --> 00:44:57,710
empty racks essentially as a place where
you can build a PCI certified in Ramadan

843
00:44:57,710 --> 00:44:58,370
toppled

844
00:44:58,370 --> 00:45:02,340
but you gotta do the action exter extra
work to make that a reality

845
00:45:02,340 --> 00:45:09,340
I'm you serious in question in

846
00:45:15,019 --> 00:45:20,490
here

847
00:45:20,490 --> 00:45:20,970
what

848
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:24,480
so I I do know this is that if I turn on
college girl I see every

849
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:29,460
access to a to environment and well so
everything goes to the PI

850
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:33,559
when access so when I'm on the web
console it's going to the API

851
00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:38,339
when the arm when I trigger any service
or anything like that it's going to the

852
00:45:38,339 --> 00:45:41,809
API's this really there's nothing that
can be accomplished outside API

853
00:45:41,809 --> 00:45:45,809
on so the very at the ritz so I don't
know that for a fact only question free

854
00:45:45,809 --> 00:45:46,589
W us

855
00:45:46,589 --> 00:45:50,869
I certainly haven't seen anything in the
years I've been doing it we're like

856
00:45:50,869 --> 00:45:55,339
who did that I'm you'll see stuff like
NEC to system being rebooted

857
00:45:55,339 --> 00:45:59,329
because you have maintenance events and
things like that you'll see an event

858
00:45:59,329 --> 00:46:01,710
where okay this machine has to be
rebooted because

859
00:46:01,710 --> 00:46:06,520
whatever last couple weeks a whole
message machines got rebooted NAWS

860
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:11,210
arm so you see those kinds of events or
systems have to get restarted

861
00:46:11,210 --> 00:46:14,270
but term I've never seen anything that
would suggest that

862
00:46:14,270 --> 00:46:17,329
that's possible but that's worth you
know aspin

863
00:46:17,329 --> 00:46:20,849
we should we should trust but verify
ring so

864
00:46:20,849 --> 00:46:26,069
any other questions awesome you guys
been a great audience thank you very

865
00:46:26,069 --> 00:46:26,589
much

866
00:46:26,589 --> 00:46:27,420
really appreciate it
