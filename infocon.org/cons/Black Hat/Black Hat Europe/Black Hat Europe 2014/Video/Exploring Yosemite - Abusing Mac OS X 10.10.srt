1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:04,140
go after nylon I'm Tiffany I and many
comps

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,600
are we are we are from Tim defy research

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,290
anywhere from Taiwan so the topic of
this presentation is

4
00:00:12,290 --> 00:00:15,889
exploring yosemite abuse in make a
choice

5
00:00:15,889 --> 00:00:19,189
10 dot 10 so um this

6
00:00:19,189 --> 00:00:24,230
on DNC's are like that mom there are
more and more people using Mac so

7
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:27,800
%uh during this year's are we spent a
lot of time

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,970
aren't doing security research are make
always X

9
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:35,290
it is quite interesting and so on and we
majorly

10
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:38,530
our focus on this system securities such
as

11
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:42,110
armed rooted techniques or like prove
each

12
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:47,989
escalation or exploit me away so it's
like are more labels security

13
00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:51,199
issues and asses like

14
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,270
only Joan May or early June are

15
00:00:54,270 --> 00:00:57,620
a polearm announced that beta of
yosemite so

16
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:00,989
are we have decided to see the
difference

17
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:05,100
about arm 10 done I intend at 10 and

18
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:08,189
arm yeah we want to see the security
improvements

19
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:12,229
and arm to see is it can against

20
00:01:12,229 --> 00:01:17,330
our mail where are a kid is there any
yes security in has money in kernel or

21
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:18,040
use them all

22
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,680
and there's an any new security security
mckinney them

23
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,710
so always start this research

24
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:28,450
and on we have some findings animist ok

25
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:31,530
are we are going to discuss several
techniques to abuse

26
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:35,070
are you so much and we are going to
release a scanning tool

27
00:01:35,070 --> 00:01:39,170
and for public for free how so so are we

28
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:42,659
we will have our we implement it at
school that

29
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:45,979
we can ship the kernel check the system
is it

30
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:49,840
like invented by rookie yet so um

31
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,280
and coincidentally I yosemite has just

32
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,450
are being released last night so home
yet

33
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,810
and so today I can have this chance to
share with you

34
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:07,270
artist this research

35
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:11,340
I so um nunca en mi fone founded are 25

36
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:15,790
our research in Taiwan and about
actually we are doing some research I

37
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:16,520
researched

38
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:19,890
summer sir intelligence research we
monitor and analyze

39
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:24,540
and tricks I was right so I'll on the
asia-pacific area

40
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,060
I especially love the cyber is denounced
a text

41
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:33,239
and we are also very interested in Bondi
at the research

42
00:02:33,239 --> 00:02:36,459
so I'm not only not only analyze the

43
00:02:36,459 --> 00:02:39,560
exploited are has been used in real
attack

44
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:42,840
we also arm happy to look

45
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,840
problems are for new platforms

46
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,850
and new technologies so are we

47
00:02:48,850 --> 00:02:53,690
and also are we are we are member
assault injured security group

48
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:57,019
and we are %uh the changer the ginger
hold

49
00:02:57,019 --> 00:03:00,470
he Kong every year and he can is 100

50
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:04,040
the largest security conference in Asia
a area

51
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:07,170
and on this year are now we have

52
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:10,760
like without more than a thousand
attendees so it's like is

53
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,700
are kinda beat and and 20 so we suppose
sponsor

54
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,470
City a team and we got the second pro a
second-place

55
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:22,880
in the difficult they've come %uh CDF
final

56
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:26,690
your and I'm the organizer of the cum

57
00:03:26,690 --> 00:03:30,660
are so here is a sure Ind

58
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:33,890
introduction of arm my company my team

59
00:03:33,890 --> 00:03:37,200
you know so we are in third chance and
spur and provider and we tracked

60
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,660
and we monitor cyber threats and this is

61
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,150
%uh a little bit about myself arm so on

62
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:49,730
yeah I'm the leader of 25 and I am

63
00:03:49,730 --> 00:03:52,860
interested in many fields I

64
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,780
brown dirty an like our virtualization
security

65
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:00,040
and arm yep and

66
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,209
none to I is our chip researcher

67
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:06,709
he's so well-known market researcher and
has been

68
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:10,680
out this cause in the market is for many
years

69
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:14,090
and he he has he owns where several CD

70
00:04:14,090 --> 00:04:17,329
and home yeah and his major I'll

71
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:21,320
all expertise include like homebound
aids research

72
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:25,060
exploit techniques malware detection and
mobile security

73
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:29,180
and recent years are he started his

74
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:32,470
its exploration and discovery in
programs

75
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:38,039
in may cause an ex and nine-time me
frequently presentations in

76
00:04:38,039 --> 00:04:42,229
like in Asia security conferences and
this is first time we can

77
00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:47,289
present research in Europe for a soco I
would like to

78
00:04:47,289 --> 00:04:50,710
appreciate eyes I partners are they
surprised as a lot

79
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:55,050
for doing this research

80
00:04:55,050 --> 00:04:58,850
okay this is the engine to the content
or my presentation

81
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:02,670
so um we were own introduce the

82
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:06,600
arm yet the first we want two hours

83
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,170
to review previous previous words ok
make noise

84
00:05:10,170 --> 00:05:14,030
X rocket yeah I N then now we were star

85
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:17,440
armed haha tell you how we start how to
star

86
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,810
me away or a kid and introduce some new
tricks

87
00:05:20,810 --> 00:05:24,330
and also are we were introduced a way to
bypass

88
00:05:24,330 --> 00:05:28,090
our kernel module rewrote it may be
verification on Yosemite

89
00:05:28,090 --> 00:05:31,420
and also arm we will discuss more
details

90
00:05:31,420 --> 00:05:36,070
about Arkanoid a kid and your summer
routine and the last bar

91
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:39,100
oh we were introduce and really is

92
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:44,360
us are 20 nervous system for china tea
very Firefall make noise

93
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:51,360
X yeah okay so I in this section we are
going to review some previous works

94
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,260
of may cause its rocket are this is the

95
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:00,320
real billion I look it's and desist are
the most well-known

96
00:06:00,320 --> 00:06:03,530
are a kid and it is open source and it

97
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:07,580
like I did it was released arm for
disclosure in

98
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:11,540
chained heat of and Collen the
capabilities

99
00:06:11,540 --> 00:06:14,970
are that you can see it like arm they

100
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:18,090
it can hide files height a process
height

101
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:22,220
are you sir from coord W and yeah

102
00:06:22,220 --> 00:06:26,630
and doing some rookie basic functions
and also the

103
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:30,660
it is already two years old it is still
the most famous noted

104
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:34,280
a Mentos X so we are going to our focus

105
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:37,360
on the arm process hiding techniques

106
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,830
to discuss arm may cause colonel

107
00:06:40,830 --> 00:06:44,560
and we will also like to mention

108
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,080
volatility a volatility is well-known
memory for in set to ON

109
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,920
party at The Sopranos our mentors X as
well so

110
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:56,190
on it can detect rueben as of course

111
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:59,470
as so arm yeah this is the current

112
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:03,200
current are a nice a good are rookies
Skinner

113
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:08,300
on that weekend get so if you know any
other good nucleus can therefore may

114
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,020
cause X

115
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,630
our place let us know and you know we
are very interested in these

116
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:16,170
so and it is it this is also because
that

117
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,999
we cannot find are

118
00:07:17,999 --> 00:07:22,189
good are looking skin so we decide to
include min

119
00:07:22,189 --> 00:07:25,699
are on to us okay also

120
00:07:25,699 --> 00:07:30,819
are for and epidural he is one of our
most well-known make noise researcher

121
00:07:30,819 --> 00:07:34,099
and you never he published this paper
own prick

122
00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:37,759
and so on he introduced a lot of protein
shakes

123
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,709
we learned a lot from his paper you so
um

124
00:07:41,709 --> 00:07:45,939
yeah if you would like to start Nokia
Research this paper might be a good

125
00:07:45,939 --> 00:07:49,189
costar and most

126
00:07:49,189 --> 00:07:52,409
of are okay techniques he introduce
Indies

127
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:55,729
our paper is a kernel function in like
ok

128
00:07:55,729 --> 00:07:59,499
so I we also implement on this detection

129
00:07:59,499 --> 00:08:02,860
in our tool and use this lookin to test

130
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,999
and we are home

131
00:08:06,999 --> 00:08:11,809
here we have are assured and also your
previous work because we are all we

132
00:08:11,809 --> 00:08:12,899
publish some

133
00:08:12,899 --> 00:08:16,409
some research into Asia in less much

134
00:08:16,409 --> 00:08:19,699
as well sold we will also like to reveal
some

135
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:22,849
of I these are as well so own

136
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:27,029
I'll you know so our in the Blue Hens
show we

137
00:08:27,029 --> 00:08:27,449
I

138
00:08:27,449 --> 00:08:30,580
home I'll we release art

139
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:34,399
at away to I'll we

140
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,829
arm are we disclose oh wait to

141
00:08:37,829 --> 00:08:41,550
employment at the rents noted Kim bypass
lottttt

142
00:08:41,550 --> 00:08:44,670
a detention and also I will introduce

143
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:49,360
oh wait to arm to make a previous normal
user

144
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:52,820
I will show you details later and oh so
are we

145
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:56,480
introduce a way to a direct access
memory from use a model

146
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:59,810
as use them a process can access ARCA no
more memory

147
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:03,320
directly and also are we introduce a way
to

148
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:06,660
loaded loading loath to know module with
our warnings yeah

149
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:10,490
and some motrin is still or so I would
like to mention here

150
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:13,740
the first is armed if you like to

151
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,040
our grand on are a process

152
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,440
for root permission you money to a star
from here

153
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:26,350
are you like give process aren't stack
said you ID to become busy

154
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:31,389
the UI the of the process is so are the
process can have permission to do things

155
00:09:31,389 --> 00:09:34,949
and on now so

156
00:09:34,949 --> 00:09:39,199
on 00 like to person %uh mission is
pressed that arm

157
00:09:39,199 --> 00:09:42,569
in following slide when we explain
techniques are

158
00:09:42,569 --> 00:09:45,670
and details we will also use Windows

159
00:09:45,670 --> 00:09:49,660
as a sample because are too heavy are
use Windows as he

160
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,810
is simple to help you to understand: are
more easily

161
00:09:52,810 --> 00:09:56,889
because I know more people aren't are
more from

162
00:09:56,889 --> 00:10:00,149
for many always windows looted because
Windows RT they are already

163
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:04,060
a lot of our research a Windows book
itself our tech

164
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:07,589
are something simple to help you to
understand: easier

165
00:10:07,589 --> 00:10:11,199
and in this case our grant grant
permission

166
00:10:11,199 --> 00:10:15,019
to a process is to modify processes
talkin like yeah

167
00:10:15,019 --> 00:10:18,100
I mention in the below par that power
windows do in

168
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:22,290
this how in those don't miss okay so on

169
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:25,459
usually if you are you so long to dupe
religious teens

170
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:29,600
are keen is to use as you are as you do
are to become

171
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,870
are super user and is to become root and

172
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:37,290
in nice presentation implication are we
introduce this technique

173
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:40,800
to bring no more user preached and as
you can see

174
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:45,279
a and the screen net this user

175
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,040
I use are no more user you ideas 5 our
501

176
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,279
and but this user can our Lord

177
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:55,459
como mucho so it in the here arm

178
00:10:55,459 --> 00:10:58,589
there is no como mucho this 9 kinda true

179
00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:02,279
this is our upon mushers camacho and

180
00:11:02,279 --> 00:11:06,319
%uh this user can lot is kinda mucho are
without any warning

181
00:11:06,319 --> 00:11:09,350
and won't be parked and yeah

182
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:14,939
and after lot you can you skip KX the
state you can see this canard model has

183
00:11:14,939 --> 00:11:15,800
been loaded

184
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,180
so in this is are looks like a no more
user

185
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:23,050
by it can lot when the module yeah how
do we do this

186
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:26,290
because our our host free image arm

187
00:11:26,290 --> 00:11:30,079
we supposed to be rich you can do many
things I A list

188
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:34,170
you can get into canot arm ways these
prove each

189
00:11:34,170 --> 00:11:37,949
and this you can lot camacho yes so it
is not a bot

190
00:11:37,949 --> 00:11:41,110
or Bobby it is so I is still works

191
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:44,230
on Yosemite so are located is it misses
all

192
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:48,939
are one of the rocketry treat that are
when you install you're a kid you can

193
00:11:48,939 --> 00:11:52,399
art Grand is permission to use desde to
the user

194
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,200
and the user won't be like are
suspicious are

195
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,090
the be suspicious be found because it is
just no one user

196
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:04,210
looks like normal user okay San

197
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:08,500
the second trick I would like to mention
is aren't there eg kernel memory access

198
00:12:08,500 --> 00:12:11,820
on we introduced think these techniques
and

199
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:15,740
are this technique help us to SS cannot
directly

200
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:20,440
I need for more details are you can
review referred to this blog post

201
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,100
on Metro cab are very detailed
explanation for this

202
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:27,810
are for these feature not or you can go
it

203
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:31,380
viability Petro capitulo Co it to my
bookmark building

204
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:34,820
it 0 still words on Yosemite so

205
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:38,220
are that is whole wheat employment the
are

206
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:41,630
SBB X system Burge Burge on the verifier
axed

207
00:12:41,630 --> 00:12:45,330
are we use this technique to access
kanam Emery told reid

208
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:48,600
do are checked connery directly so

209
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:52,260
are if the if this our approach got
blocked

210
00:12:52,260 --> 00:12:56,930
are to a long walk and we have to find
other way to get into kernel

211
00:12:56,930 --> 00:13:00,420
so are we as use this trick to essence
condoning

212
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:03,460
okay so are when we

213
00:13:03,460 --> 00:13:07,550
I their home we'd start doing yosemite
research

214
00:13:07,550 --> 00:13:11,070
arm yosemite has not been release yet

215
00:13:11,070 --> 00:13:14,580
so it is kind of tough it is not easy
because

216
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,740
other firsts armed they keep changing
things

217
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:21,840
and they keep changing data structure
they keep changing our source close old

218
00:13:21,840 --> 00:13:25,320
are when we implement some Proc I and
then

219
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,900
necks raise their changed so we have to
change again and

220
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:33,460
are because they are still there this
version is under development

221
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:37,040
development sold %uh so still has not
been released yet

222
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,870
so are we have to

223
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:43,110
on to reverse engineering every time to
check the data structure to check the

224
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:43,920
source code to

225
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:47,550
to check the binary so I ideas cannot
top

226
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:51,540
n now so we spent a lot of time

227
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:55,980
to analyze and finally our yesterday
aren't

228
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:59,320
it has been released a but our we

229
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:03,770
up the we are going to raise it raises
some to about are not not not because

230
00:14:03,770 --> 00:14:06,940
we haven't had a chance to test lattice

231
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:10,550
are virgin yet so after test %uh evert
at

232
00:14:10,550 --> 00:14:13,980
after tested and the latest version we
were is a tool

233
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:17,890
okay so other URL

234
00:14:17,890 --> 00:14:22,350
is I looks different right harm any
change to the UI

235
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:25,960
and you can see the text bar

236
00:14:25,960 --> 00:14:31,480
right I it is it look familiar it is

237
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:35,130
seventh annual not like when those
Arctic spa

238
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:39,730
right okay so I won't

239
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:43,350
young person how long does make some def
arm

240
00:14:43,350 --> 00:14:47,290
are def ten-point night and point them
point n

241
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:50,339
and arm so we give it I'll

242
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:55,430
yup def certain so we dont are we were
ordered released eight hundred least a

243
00:14:55,430 --> 00:14:57,700
tie with Tampa assistant go table

244
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:01,040
and make trip table I did the table and
there are

245
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:04,540
actually many our new functions new
API's in this

246
00:15:04,540 --> 00:15:08,560
arm table so but we don't have time and
we

247
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:12,080
no documents so are we we we don't know
how what

248
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:15,510
a new API is actively doing so but

249
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:19,630
I'll we provide a state ID you but you
are interested you can reveal the state

250
00:15:19,630 --> 00:15:20,850
I and the Czech new

251
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:23,960
API newt system call what is it %uh

252
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:27,520
but is purpose okay so he

253
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:33,550
businesses that they thought we were
love keep you okay so

254
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:36,880
arm you're talking about a kid you have
to know

255
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,480
are you have to think about how to start
you're a kid so here I would like to

256
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,190
mention some techniques to start a new
kid

257
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:46,660
and also we were introduced ups us

258
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:50,110
treat to are star army or

259
00:15:50,110 --> 00:15:54,580
a rocket get under press r load in
newark is now up

260
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:57,810
like a program star in in Windows so

261
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:01,150
aren't in Windows you were like put put
this

262
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:05,730
are you for it is cute about in this
directory backstop territory and

263
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:10,850
I'll make noise it is similar last just
put things in this territory

264
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:14,320
and that oppress do is users

265
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:18,930
directory they report performed as and
the last two is system folders so you

266
00:16:18,930 --> 00:16:19,270
can

267
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:23,010
yes star your program and

268
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:26,400
the second is Biol if you want to on
star you will

269
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:30,500
like militias still I'll I want those
you can use the street

270
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:35,270
used is our registry to start your a
preload your idea I'll

271
00:16:35,270 --> 00:16:38,620
and aren't they are they are also
similar functions

272
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:41,870
own may cause X so you just arm

273
00:16:41,870 --> 00:16:45,030
up they P least file

274
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:48,640
and change it is bearable and then you
can stand arm

275
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:53,850
make some tooo to be pre-loaded and here

276
00:16:53,850 --> 00:16:57,100
I'm going to show you some treat is not
very

277
00:16:57,100 --> 00:17:00,680
very like are but disarm is a treat

278
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,370
an kind of useful so of I extension

279
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:08,079
and this idea is also from windows in
the alarm there's a

280
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:13,079
when the and file are you find them boys
are post engine and weighs

281
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:16,829
file extension usually associate ways
some program

282
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:20,329
rights and a change this art Association
you

283
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:23,770
can like arm make are it's too

284
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:27,339
is cute the program that user are didn't
expect

285
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:31,050
so this API this API

286
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,790
arm it I Inc is in charge of this

287
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:38,330
are setting so using this API you can
change the setting

288
00:17:38,330 --> 00:17:41,870
and our own that completeness 18c

289
00:17:41,870 --> 00:17:45,170
is actually in this CSS store file

290
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:49,060
so um India is simple is like this

291
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:52,730
yeah the file association said he is
here

292
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:56,550
and each user has its own set in so here
lot

293
00:17:56,550 --> 00:18:00,360
first one is no my user and the the
second one is the road route

294
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:04,320
Assos profile extension setting has so

295
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:11,320
he I'm going to show you at the game

296
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:28,879
I so um so in the big so pressed

297
00:18:28,879 --> 00:18:32,889
I'll we open this file

298
00:18:32,889 --> 00:18:36,169
it were it trigger early arm

299
00:18:36,169 --> 00:18:39,769
yea is simply triggered the are quick
time

300
00:18:39,769 --> 00:18:46,769
to to see the speedy alright on

301
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:53,990
okay and every other week lead is appt
is a BP is changing to us

302
00:18:53,990 --> 00:18:57,299
a filing extension a association say
teens

303
00:18:57,299 --> 00:19:04,010
and then we open this again and

304
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:07,130
it also cheater picketed here

305
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:10,750
so we just simply changing the arm

306
00:19:10,750 --> 00:19:14,559
files a a sentence 18 stand you can
bring your

307
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:21,559
are know where a kid up and so

308
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:26,370
actually many are ok it reeks that the
idea is actually from windows because

309
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:27,080
they are as

310
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:34,080
are already a lot of our research we
doesn't get okay so

311
00:19:35,929 --> 00:19:39,179
on this section I will show you are
bypassing

312
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:42,450
kernel module where verification on your
sanity

313
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:45,940
it is so are may cause temple night

314
00:19:45,940 --> 00:19:50,710
are you want to Lord a kernel module oh
the first you have to put

315
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:55,400
kernel module file into this directory
system library extensions

316
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,950
and wrong k txt Lord to lot

317
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:03,429
the file and if the colonel roger is not
signed toys will pop up

318
00:20:03,429 --> 00:20:08,390
warning message just a warning message
so on temp or not you still can lot

319
00:20:08,390 --> 00:20:12,850
camacho that is unsigned spar over

320
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:16,910
arm 10 to 10 this got blocked so

321
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:20,000
instead over a warning message it blocks

322
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,020
the kernel aren't is blocked the condo
model audience 0

323
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:28,940
when you tried to Lord a and on cycle
module you look at this warning

324
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:32,660
you again is one so you do a show like a
bad hit invalid

325
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,860
signature all this camacho we're not law

326
00:20:35,860 --> 00:20:38,910
sold I'll yeah officially

327
00:20:38,910 --> 00:20:42,200
it blocks the are on cycle mucho

328
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:45,700
but it is edgy week and just

329
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:49,299
some other way to bypass they're very
impatient so

330
00:20:49,299 --> 00:20:52,740
so online always are up Polytechnic

331
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,790
is we can load a Camacho from any pets

332
00:20:55,790 --> 00:20:59,110
no need to be put in their past that I
just mentioned

333
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:03,690
and also file is actually not required
you don't have to implement a real convo

334
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:04,470
much a file

335
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:08,180
you can you see it from like a memory a
chance or

336
00:21:08,180 --> 00:21:11,970
from Nick what notebook so and also no

337
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:15,320
are technique and lot kernel module
without are

338
00:21:15,320 --> 00:21:19,460
any brief occasions and no warning
message tottering 0 warning: messaging

339
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:19,860
and

340
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,970
actually no need to Peche okay XD the

341
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:27,490
or or other program this is how we

342
00:21:27,490 --> 00:21:32,370
load the car model we just call these
API and Katie St request API

343
00:21:32,370 --> 00:21:35,780
and is this API is in charge of the are

344
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:39,380
como Modelo didn't and it wont verify
anything

345
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:43,540
you late 0 okee it will make verified
that it has tried to you

346
00:21:43,540 --> 00:21:47,640
give him and and some said he's so you
have to make

347
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:51,380
all makes teens are correct and then it
work said

348
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:55,370
en lo these camacho and 0 not also
mention is

349
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:58,410
art I i just mentioned arm

350
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:01,410
in the beginning right so are long
comacho

351
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:07,080
doesn't have to be a route are you just
need to have the pre with host very rich

352
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:11,580
solar cells goes like this: are you view
it aunt Kay exterior Chris

353
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:16,070
on the check host peerage so you if you
have a hospital with you can don't kill

354
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:16,680
my gym

355
00:22:16,680 --> 00:22:19,680
yeah so use this

356
00:22:19,680 --> 00:22:22,730
our approach then you can don't care
much

357
00:22:22,730 --> 00:22:26,960
I would have but then later so okay so
um

358
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,510
continue we we we go along to are
discussed kono

359
00:22:30,510 --> 00:22:36,150
malt brew kit okay so

360
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:39,840
our is not the first such a player is
the kernel

361
00:22:39,840 --> 00:22:43,070
I Windows is you know usually is file by

362
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:46,500
and he always colonel and arm on

363
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:49,700
may cause an ex aren't before 10 dot 10

364
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:52,170
it is it would in

365
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:55,060
growth territory make Colonel but our

366
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:58,930
front assists and attended moved to
system library

367
00:22:58,930 --> 00:23:02,310
colonels I yeah in this territory so is

368
00:23:02,310 --> 00:23:06,590
every our little change and I

369
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:10,440
yup for dis armed regard no discussing
own

370
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:14,340
interns all the our process hiding
usually are

371
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:18,310
on the UK US Rd to rate direct kernel
module

372
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:21,960
out that could not object modification
to hide the process

373
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:26,190
so usually are like this picture shows
that are just are linked

374
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:29,960
the early legally you are usually
process is it arm

375
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:34,170
many by a link least so we just on
inkless then we can

376
00:23:34,170 --> 00:23:37,360
hide a process this issue very basic
idea

377
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:40,600
and you know the nest

378
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,920
take a look at process structure so that

379
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:47,100
the first one is the link to this
process link list so

380
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:50,120
yuppie least is are you know it's

381
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:53,420
on you can find one process one by one

382
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:58,560
by a this list and

383
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:02,930
um actually are you take a look more all

384
00:24:02,930 --> 00:24:07,500
yet are detail that you can find here is
that task point

385
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:10,540
so process will aren't linked to a task

386
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:13,790
and in task structure there is also

387
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:16,940
another are link least there so

388
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:21,060
arm so that there's still

389
00:24:21,060 --> 00:24:25,560
how we make it different some all means
of detecting Julian rubin

390
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:29,130
only are linked the process least so

391
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:32,520
globally didn't Arlington our task list
so

392
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,140
are we just are chicken chicken pho the

393
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:40,060
rubin our weekend just are verified the
task least

394
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:43,820
and to see is are be our processes

395
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:47,590
matched test least if it doesn't match
Jul it shows

396
00:24:47,590 --> 00:24:54,590
some process got hide it by rubin so use
this approach to detect okay and Nubian

397
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,060
art cannot

398
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:01,600
are hired from in Piedmont because
active monitor

399
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:06,910
are checked task this not process list
and rabin

400
00:25:06,910 --> 00:25:10,460
are can only run on 10 does seven so
it's just

401
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:13,840
example there it it artist it could then
wrong

402
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,860
arm that blood his version of make noise
okay so

403
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:21,890
arm we'd we not only are linked

404
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:26,140
arm police and has placed we also owning

405
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:30,130
all possible Linda least tried and tried
to hide

406
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:34,340
this process so after we only got
downing call please

407
00:25:34,340 --> 00:25:37,770
RB um if not in doubt and we can bypass

408
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:41,600
lot that the check among on that and
online

409
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:45,840
and but because our own lot lot yet he
doesn't support end up ten

410
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:49,260
yet so are we cannot test but will
always think

411
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:52,270
our approach 10 steel bypass are this
different

412
00:25:52,270 --> 00:25:55,620
detection so all from

413
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:58,680
yeah are high did and yeah so

414
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,690
currently we know it is aren't we we

415
00:26:01,690 --> 00:26:04,850
you can say it's are completely on
invisible

416
00:26:04,850 --> 00:26:08,280
in column on to hide hi the process so

417
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:11,530
but arm height and detect the process

418
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:15,750
is like and can't and mosque in kernel

419
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:19,770
so when you are army disclose your way
to hide process

420
00:26:19,770 --> 00:26:22,790
that is dement definitely a way to
detect sold

421
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:26,530
are ya just they can someday they can
detect has undertaken in

422
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:30,180
are you have some new approach to bypass
then

423
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:33,530
they can try to deter at the end so yeah
is the

424
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:37,780
market them Askim and this history

425
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:41,250
always already happen I Windows right so
this year

426
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:44,460
demonstration whole I our

427
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:50,200
I'll noted works okay so in the
beginning wastes are

428
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:57,200
her cake you later

429
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:09,360
and then we star antibody arm

430
00:27:29,410 --> 00:27:36,410
them

431
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:50,179
the rule

432
00:27:50,179 --> 00:27:51,250
all 10

433
00:27:51,250 --> 00:27:58,250
yet

434
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:03,500
them

435
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:10,500
yeah them

436
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:15,810
the woman little in

437
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:22,810
you didn't along

438
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:32,830
and sorry told numerous or I

439
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:50,930
ok it's so I you know we ways to can be
ready here and we can seek a clear the

440
00:28:50,930 --> 00:28:51,870
fraud attempted

441
00:28:51,870 --> 00:28:55,570
activity munter and now is star I'll

442
00:28:55,570 --> 00:28:58,850
to Lord are arm

443
00:28:58,850 --> 00:29:02,840
this is arm

444
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:05,840
camacho are a kid so it just started

445
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:12,040
okay now is star this

446
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:12,590
are

447
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:16,720
for repeat and now is start to

448
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:23,720
height to keep writing

449
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:42,660
Eddie is 754 be

450
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:46,680
okay

451
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:51,940
so who good yeah we we can we can hide
it are keeping it not so it can release

452
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:52,830
is still here

453
00:29:52,830 --> 00:29:59,830
so it still

454
00:30:03,590 --> 00:30:10,480
never that they more sheep when the
dates

455
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:16,540
my

456
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:23,540
is never happen first time in open

457
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,710
more so this continual that the

458
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:45,290
BM retire and this Ulm

459
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:48,510
to continue our presentation so om

460
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:53,440
yeah um yet that then with I'll start to
discuss your summer kid

461
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,410
and now on ya like I mentioned that are
on the

462
00:30:57,410 --> 00:31:01,160
that the are both them that we please
present

463
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,530
a way to country to the make process
invisible

464
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:07,680
so but arm from the demo

465
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:11,010
are yet there is actually very very

466
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:14,790
easy way to arm so

467
00:31:14,790 --> 00:31:21,790
see the invisible process from user mall

468
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:50,680
something

469
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:57,680
the

470
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:04,680
show

471
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:47,150
not give me one more chance I'm sorry 0

472
00:32:58,289 --> 00:32:59,650
keys so

473
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:06,650
lot

474
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:18,240
well

475
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:25,240
you you

476
00:33:51,110 --> 00:33:55,180
okinawa kicker is yeah disappear and but
yeah

477
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:58,630
aren't currently it is invisible from
Coloma but a

478
00:33:58,630 --> 00:34:03,780
actually mmm there's a you're somewhat
cool

479
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:10,780
and can usually find his process

480
00:34:12,220 --> 00:34:15,220
because yet the it is

481
00:34:15,220 --> 00:34:18,660
the optimism on come on by fingers are
wrong I am

482
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:22,130
it is easy very easy to be detected cuz
are

483
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:26,710
because I'll lunch D and launch Cydia
and so large the men each

484
00:34:26,710 --> 00:34:31,710
09 steep is monitor whole process
creation and termination so

485
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:35,490
its also maintained a job least text
least

486
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:39,400
are to of in use their mom sold are from
lunch the

487
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:43,190
you can see all process information so
hide in process

488
00:34:43,190 --> 00:34:47,179
franca no mo is not enough because our
lunch D can tell you

489
00:34:47,179 --> 00:34:51,010
everything so I'll so

490
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:54,370
this is lunch is the oldest so you can
see all the

491
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:57,580
list all the task from lunch D no no

492
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:02,030
known are no relation to condone just
pure pure use them all

493
00:35:02,030 --> 00:35:08,570
okay so this is the way we we disclose
in by haitian they're darn Inc

494
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:14,410
our job lunch the in lunch the and are
but

495
00:35:14,410 --> 00:35:18,140
aren't in 10 don't end there is a very
big change

496
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:21,230
dead are there is %uh intend on I each

497
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:24,340
our price: is user has what lunch D but

498
00:35:24,340 --> 00:35:28,360
are in to not end there is only one
lunch D so

499
00:35:28,360 --> 00:35:31,430
are the work we would you do that work
again so

500
00:35:31,430 --> 00:35:36,920
and so they are a lot of change in
nineteen and also like

501
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,980
on that address I'll I showed you

502
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:43,240
the address this is dead task address

503
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:47,220
but intend or 10 this is removed so no
address information

504
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:51,190
is even on yet the more difficult to
heck

505
00:35:51,190 --> 00:35:54,790
okay so here's the way to

506
00:35:54,790 --> 00:35:57,820
a weed head the a dreaded dedicate to to

507
00:35:57,820 --> 00:36:02,520
are two months by large d and but
basically the idea is

508
00:36:02,520 --> 00:36:06,350
try to find lunch D other than that job
least

509
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:09,920
in the lunch the and tried to IM Link so
it still works

510
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:15,120
and yeah here's some detail dead I think
we can just see them all

511
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:18,960
okay

512
00:36:18,960 --> 00:36:22,110
so we continue in this song scenario

513
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:26,560
so i cant turned to the weekend see
invisible killer there from

514
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:30,120
lunch CDR right so now I would I try

515
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:34,290
to home to

516
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:38,160
height heidi's our process

517
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:45,160
from

518
00:36:47,210 --> 00:36:52,720
from your Simone okay

519
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:56,230
so now we US lunch city again to see

520
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:59,900
it is invisible so now from Connemara
use them on the

521
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,960
this the processes country to the arm

522
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:07,280
be visible is still here okay so

523
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,300
so then we also implement a 2-on-2

524
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:17,300
detect these we go it

525
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:21,700
SPB X you issue mean use them all

526
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:26,710
and here on my C you can see here

527
00:37:26,710 --> 00:37:30,490
home gatekeeper ler

528
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:35,630
if found dead it dead if there is a our
link a talented our job

529
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:42,630
in lunch D into acabo on okay

530
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:55,020
right so arm in arm then I would like to
introduce

531
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:59,620
our tool a system where John de vere
Firefall may cause an ex

532
00:37:59,620 --> 00:38:02,630
it is are complete canard verifier

533
00:38:02,630 --> 00:38:06,470
for may cause ass mmm

534
00:38:06,470 --> 00:38:10,420
and I don't mean that the naming idea is
actually from

535
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:13,620
from here affront join our cause company

536
00:38:13,620 --> 00:38:17,150
I he she she published RSPB

537
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:20,320
back to 2006

538
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:25,970
and the two law is are actually for
design for Windows kernel verification

539
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:31,180
and so Arturo is very similar to the
idea is very similar to these so we

540
00:38:31,180 --> 00:38:32,120
aren't

541
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:35,430
we US decime on them and plus

542
00:38:35,430 --> 00:38:39,210
and X so are we going to see the BX

543
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:44,050
okay here is the

544
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:47,730
design concept in that oh we detect old

545
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:51,850
arm now basically we detect all possible
hoax

546
00:38:51,850 --> 00:38:55,370
dead we are the norm probably they are
there are some

547
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:59,530
thumb holes there we don't know yet but
on in this to our way into now

548
00:38:59,530 --> 00:39:03,090
everything to detect I read every
possible

549
00:39:03,090 --> 00:39:06,140
hawk that we can detect so yeah I'd like

550
00:39:06,140 --> 00:39:09,690
i-dtec is called table Sit N Go table
make trap

551
00:39:09,690 --> 00:39:13,180
kernel function in like oh ok there we
old cupid

552
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:17,070
a chip and also now only checkbooks

553
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:20,260
we are also armchair that

554
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:23,310
consistency between colonel file

555
00:39:23,310 --> 00:39:26,490
and memory because are you sure you

556
00:39:26,490 --> 00:39:30,520
many are routed will are like update
kernel functions

557
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:33,630
other update kernel De Ta up take a No

558
00:39:33,630 --> 00:39:36,970
and structures to are to try to

559
00:39:36,970 --> 00:39:41,090
are many empty many impotent men in with
that pretty always turn on soap

560
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:44,740
in we arch also check their consistency

561
00:39:44,740 --> 00:39:50,720
of colonel and fuck cannot file and
memory

562
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,680
so aren't you know the present we check
busy conoco looks

563
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:58,550
backed by DT since then call make track
tripped is this is that most busy

564
00:39:58,550 --> 00:40:02,050
to coax and then

565
00:40:02,050 --> 00:40:05,980
we checked Parker no more than all also
relation

566
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:08,990
yeah 8 all cannot other Asian allows

567
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:12,120
sir party kernel developers to authorize

568
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:15,460
action our patience always Dean colonel

569
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:18,460
and modifier authority agent decisions

570
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:21,980
and extend the kernel authorization
landscape sold

571
00:40:21,980 --> 00:40:27,460
arm many it developers can use this is
my pennies into imp are to implement

572
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:30,930
arm some are positive track although
some

573
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:34,020
our own at weekend are to some

574
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:38,030
actions when some like are filed drop
open file

575
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:41,330
and yes I'll are actually so

576
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:44,350
it is are usually used by arm

577
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:47,420
and Ross subway so and there are some
where most of

578
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:51,550
and there are so please use this
Argonaut authorization to

579
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:55,320
are to you are to plot their our file
scanning

580
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:58,600
to a trigger their fire skinning and
yeah so

581
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:02,660
just use this this API to register
alterations cop

582
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:07,420
and it is used arm yeah it is a flexible
design

583
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:11,660
and yeah I used on cut most um New
Jersey used by

584
00:41:11,660 --> 00:41:14,660
sup security software but arm

585
00:41:14,660 --> 00:41:18,290
yeah it can be used by some security
software but is

586
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:25,030
also can be are abused a so for Windows

587
00:41:25,030 --> 00:41:28,200
our developer that are there is a very
similar

588
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:35,200
API here I yes similar similar functions

589
00:41:36,010 --> 00:41:39,420
okay then are we also check our neck of
the altar

590
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:44,450
of course on so on that there are armed
two major places that you can

591
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:47,760
are hoc on their core behavior name or
date how so

592
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:51,470
are the first is KBR KP I IP future

593
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:54,750
and the second is kb I on suck if the
altar

594
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:58,050
this Duplessis arm yet we see are like

595
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:01,480
on fire or so where security so where
their coke

596
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:06,150
on this API to chat they were terrific
and so this is scene 02

597
00:42:06,150 --> 00:42:09,940
and the eyes our driver NDIS filter in
Windows

598
00:42:09,940 --> 00:42:13,740
yes of course we checked is fall

599
00:42:13,740 --> 00:42:18,000
malicious hooks and

600
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:21,010
are there is also very are very arm

601
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:26,180
huge part in make oscar not it is
trusted truck trusted yes the policy

602
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:30,190
trustee BST our friend make I'll make
framework

603
00:42:30,190 --> 00:42:34,750
arm for us ship in FreeBSD fiber region
5

604
00:42:34,750 --> 00:42:37,820
and so it's several many years ago

605
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:43,280
so it's a pro several policy machos for
developers to extend control and

606
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,950
security capabilities so

607
00:42:44,950 --> 00:42:50,680
are using trustee PSD you can are is the
implement your security policy

608
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:53,770
like are you want to check something at
some point

609
00:42:53,770 --> 00:42:57,210
you can do something yes so own

610
00:42:57,210 --> 00:43:00,500
yeah it are also used %uh a lot

611
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:04,690
by a poll so AB IPO use this to
implement like

612
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:08,520
arm applications in box and Time Machine

613
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:12,910
an yup other functions yup so make uses
a lot

614
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:19,500
%uh able use is allowed to implement
some all functions

615
00:43:19,500 --> 00:43:23,390
and so are of course are you yeah
security

616
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:27,890
passover can use this then yet big guys
can also use it is so

617
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:30,910
art chicken is arm I'll

618
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:33,940
trusted BSC policy called is also are

619
00:43:33,940 --> 00:43:37,830
the important is that we have to chat
yet so argues in

620
00:43:37,830 --> 00:43:41,820
are we checked in the structure here to
to see the trusted BSC is there

621
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:45,550
any a new or up no more a new policies

622
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:52,420
there and week we were sure this one
okay then

623
00:43:52,420 --> 00:43:55,420
you know there are a lot of things you
where you had to have checked so

624
00:43:55,420 --> 00:43:59,640
AMEC is are fundamental of make Oscar
noms ok

625
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:02,810
then there is many subsystems so

626
00:44:02,810 --> 00:44:06,220
on us that those subsystems in charge of

627
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:09,490
are many important functions inmate cohn
also

628
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:13,160
come in communication between this
subsystems

629
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:17,510
is us through mige its kind of are you
can think it is

630
00:44:17,510 --> 00:44:20,530
on RPC monkeys and 22

631
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:23,660
arm publication so art but I

632
00:44:23,660 --> 00:44:27,000
in MI G subsystem I you can see

633
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:30,000
are from this our structure you can call

634
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,540
you can plug arm subsystems here so

635
00:44:33,540 --> 00:44:37,150
aren't my arm yup if you want to do
militias

636
00:44:37,150 --> 00:44:41,210
arm teens then we can arm intercept on

637
00:44:41,210 --> 00:44:44,619
communications back here all weekend up
plus

638
00:44:44,619 --> 00:44:47,700
near subsystems so now the conclusion is

639
00:44:47,700 --> 00:44:51,170
easy to be hooked if you use using these
so

640
00:44:51,170 --> 00:44:54,250
armed as me the SBX also

641
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:58,640
checks above normal mige communication
up a no more MIGA hoax

642
00:44:58,640 --> 00:45:02,820
here okay and then our check

643
00:45:02,820 --> 00:45:07,170
are we also chaired are unlink it are
linked eat aren't gonna module

644
00:45:07,170 --> 00:45:10,240
a compelling after kernel module loaded

645
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:13,880
to arco no and it it managed by sums

646
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:17,609
data structure and it could be arlen kid
sooo so

647
00:45:17,609 --> 00:45:21,510
arm yeah I'll are located implement this
function

648
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:24,660
we try to hide ourself so you you

649
00:45:24,660 --> 00:45:27,990
if you use Dustin now wait like a txt
stead to

650
00:45:27,990 --> 00:45:31,770
to see our condo muchos you cannot see
our okay so

651
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:32,880
because we use

652
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:37,450
and some tricks to hide ourselves yes ok
check this kind of

653
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:43,680
invisible Camacho is also important okay
so

654

torture

656
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:10,290
it because then in this owned scenario

657
00:46:10,290 --> 00:46:13,560
we are already installed are located
right so we jus

658
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:18,790
round is to approach it dislocate and

659
00:46:18,790 --> 00:46:22,920
are you know other than Qadir take your
data is still invisible

660
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:29,920
you can see it but yeah system cannot
see it

661

680
00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:03,660
not nothing here and the next bar

681

right and so and we found some trust
trust PLC home

683
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:17,310
so the first one is arm safety net for a
time machine

684
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:21,600

are some condo in like ok we use this
approach to detect the morning I cook

725
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:05,910
we verified the function is it different

726
00:52:05,910 --> 00:52:10,410
aren't from files and memory if the
function is different the code is

727
00:52:10,410 --> 00:52:11,020
different

728
00:52:11,020 --> 00:52:14,800
we will give you be the warning we will
show dysfunction

729
00:52:14,800 --> 00:52:18,130
our show that stress this function is
God modified

730
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:24,250
or book got hoped yeah

731
00:52:24,250 --> 00:52:28,589

is are a colonel more new kid and we are
going to

736

00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:57,880
04 process hiding and then we will
bypass

740
00:52:57,880 --> 00:53:01,700
%uh this tool will like are it to you is

preach to you

746
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:23,980
so you after it randy is are you can
start to load kernel modules

747
00:53:23,980 --> 00:53:28,670
are and two do in some are pre-made
prove it bridges the NSE

748
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:33,280
and also it will hide is self soul when
you type K XD stead

749
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:36,950
you will not see this gonna module them
so it is

750
00:53:36,950 --> 00:53:40,560
are simple dead you can try start to try
and probably

00:54:30,210 --> 00:54:33,049
okay so conclusion arm yup the first

765
00:54:33,049 --> 00:54:37,950
stance I would like to mention is are
unsigned camacho can still be loaded

766
00:54:37,950 --> 00:54:41,150
into kernel yea have yeah I have them
out

767
00:54:41,150 --> 00:54:44,549
and also Arbor iris are possibly 82

768
00:54:44,549 --> 00:54:48,920
in primo make always X no kidding yes
you can see there I show

769
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:52,489
there are a lot of our own possibilities
to do hook

770
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:56,660
so are implement are routed is not
typical

771
00:54:56,660 --> 00:54:59,920
now sold %uh on yup Hawks the

772
00:54:59,920 --> 00:55:04,579
are their economic object modification
or called month location in lycopene and

773
00:55:04,579 --> 00:55:06,569
there are several ways to implement laws

774
00:55:06,569 --> 00:55:11,890
look is so it is possible yet and arm

775
00:55:11,890 --> 00:55:15,599
sometimes problems are not only Inc
konam

776
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:19,829
yeah so use them all mime have some
problems my have some wrote you some or

777
00:55:19,829 --> 00:55:20,380
a kid

778
00:55:20,380 --> 00:55:23,849
yeah so you still you also have to take
care about the

779
00:55:23,849 --> 00:55:27,859
you some more yeah and then all we'd
really is this tool
