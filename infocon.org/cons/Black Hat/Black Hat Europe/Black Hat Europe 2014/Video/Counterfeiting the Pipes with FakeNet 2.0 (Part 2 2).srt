1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,870
so thank you for coming back and

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,569
we're gonna work on us an example

3
00:00:07,569 --> 00:00:11,230
where you get he is taking yourself hope
we have had a chance to copy the VM

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:15,759
of if not their use USB sticks going
around

5
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,250
if you left the earlier with the USB
stick

6
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,910
and you came back with it now please
pass that of somebody else to copy it

7
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:25,970
or return to surprise um

8
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,109
it the way it works is on

9
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:33,040
we saw think that's pretty easy just
double click to run it right that's on

10
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:33,660
the desktop

11
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:37,250
but you want to change your settings we
have to go to see tools

12
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:40,520
taking it too so a lot of the lab is
talking about

13
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,450
a changing the settings so you can have
to go into their and open up this

14
00:00:44,450 --> 00:00:47,960
take net dot CFG file the open up and no
pat

15
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:51,579
and you can manipulate their if you
notice

16
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:57,219
their lab is in seeing our

17
00:00:57,219 --> 00:01:00,480
and then the land is lab underscore evil

18
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,100
also there's a text but document their

19
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:09,450
lab that text that's going to contain
like the questions for lab

20
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:16,450
so open that up because take a quick
peek at that

21
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:21,910
gone

22
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:25,510
so it's one after another sort of steps
that take you through

23
00:01:25,510 --> 00:01:29,380
I had to analyze it so you know first is
let's just run them our

24
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:33,580
with a cat on so start like that right
after that it's

25
00:01:33,580 --> 00:01:36,670
you know where you sit in our download
what what they just as a go-to

26
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:41,300
i'd and maybe try and turn on this annex
domains option this evening and he's out

27
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,430
additional domains

28
00:01:42,430 --> 00:01:45,750
so basically it's trying to gather as
many domains as many connections as it

29
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:46,480
gets ago

30
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:50,570
after that we're gonna turn on process
logging

31
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:53,760
which means you go into the
configuration file

32
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:57,680
and turn that on I by setting be

33
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:03,229
a process logging to yes are

34
00:02:03,229 --> 00:02:06,380
after the process logging and you'll be
able to identify which process is

35
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:08,160
actually doing the malicious activity

36
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,320
on and being that we're asking if he
could you could bet

37
00:02:12,320 --> 00:02:15,709
that lab underscored evil that XE is not

38
00:02:15,709 --> 00:02:19,310
the process that's doing the network
connectivity right that would make the

39
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:20,410
example very cool

40
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:24,730
cell turn on process liking and then
figure out what process is actually

41
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:28,280
doing the connection after you've done
that

42
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:32,100
you move to but now you want to set a
breakpoint like we're demonstrating

43
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:36,000
so use that connection break
functionality that is

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,630
inside both connection break this a
change that option from no

45
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,920
TS also make sure you

46
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:47,739
turn on Our Lady Bug as your

47
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:51,680
just in time to bugger she had options

48
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,870
just in time to fucking make I lied
about my

49
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:58,340
just in time to voter and then done need
to close out

50
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:01,550
once you've done that and set this TS

51
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:05,519
any process that starts up and making
our connection is going to break

52
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,450
in your debugger so what we want to do
there's

53
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:12,739
reconfigure that three-star fake net and
I

54
00:03:12,739 --> 00:03:16,360
and then run your mouth where hopefully
it'll break and then you're going to

55
00:03:16,360 --> 00:03:17,070
track down

56
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:20,220
maybe there's other domains an hour my
connect to that you wouldn't

57
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:23,720
have scenes and why she uses debugging
breakpoint I

58
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,769
also and then after that it's you know
figure out the puzzle

59
00:03:27,769 --> 00:03:31,450
is the final steps not figure out how to
get

60
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:33,700
what can you have fake net

61
00:03:33,700 --> 00:03:37,760
serve an hour breakers in think that we
can have it serves an hour

62
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,000
anything it's asking for a now hours
doing a GET request for

63
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,650
a web page are we could survive whatever
web page we want we just go into

64
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:48,730
see tools

65
00:03:48,730 --> 00:03:52,610
fake net and then the default files and
here's just a bunch of files that are

66
00:03:52,610 --> 00:03:53,870
served up for example the

67
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:57,140
I and he showed earlier the take any
program when you're on that just doesn't

68
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:57,709
pop up

69
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:01,360
we can't change that would allow any
execution will any file we want in there

70
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,780
and that'll take that will serve up
instead right so

71
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:09,099
the the final step is what can you have
fake net serve up to an hour

72
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:12,170
such that I it gets at the the

73
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:15,940
an hour to a open a message box

74
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:19,590
that basically says like you whether
something like that set the goals

75
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:20,030
allowed

76
00:04:20,030 --> 00:04:23,540
you go through all those different steps
so it's a exercising into the

77
00:04:23,540 --> 00:04:24,570
functionality

78
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:27,650
I'll take that and and getting

79
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:32,010
getting familiar with it if you are a so
you get stuck on that we're here to help

80
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:32,419
you

81
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:36,270
are also fuel if you wanna start running
other files

82
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:40,560
on insiders see now where

83
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,889
there where the files are an in class
such as web server da txt

84
00:04:43,889 --> 00:04:48,289
if you want to try that again or demo
deity any merit democratic see is the

85
00:04:48,289 --> 00:04:48,780
one that

86
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:52,060
injected into Cal arms are able to see
that

87
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,110
also the Laotian a Booker here so you
can um

88
00:04:55,110 --> 00:04:58,180
run any other any other 50 by Aries

89
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:02,330
from the book so that way you can a you
know tease out or functionality

90
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:06,789
using take that as well so the pilot
binaries you play around with

91
00:05:06,789 --> 00:05:09,880
by on the major focuses I

92
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,180
to get through this figure out the key
is so I guess

93
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:18,680
arch guys have any questions on

94
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:24,150
take a red life anything like that

95
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,210
we have all the answers

96
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:28,830
and sell yeah

97
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:33,380
so

98
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:37,840
with that I I will I guess the

99
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,850
the goal is I think we have an hour
right until 3:15

100
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:45,870
so we're gonna give you like 30 minutes
right now to work on this

101
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,920
and then we'll go over and she had a had
a

102
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:53,300
get the answer so go for it

103
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,570
up

104
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:00,010
up

105
00:06:00,010 --> 00:06:04,130
yeah and yeah I mean the next %uh means
option

106
00:06:04,130 --> 00:06:07,690
I don't know if we talk about too much
but it's basically the way to

107
00:06:07,690 --> 00:06:10,990
on sometimes Mauer

108
00:06:10,990 --> 00:06:14,910
Lake if you return a valid domain name
to appease an hour right away

109
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:18,260
then you're not gonna tease out the
additional domain names from a piece

110
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:19,790
about rape

111
00:06:19,790 --> 00:06:22,790
right there might be like 10 other
embedded domain names we wanted to say

112
00:06:22,790 --> 00:06:24,140
from through all those domain names

113
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:28,700
better than Dexter Maine option comes in
it said that to something greater than 0

114
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:33,730
inside a fake net and that'll return a
non-existent domain for each their quest

115
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:37,560
Rachel like let's say he requests a dot
com

116
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:41,280
and then be dot com and then that is
only two

117
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,800
the if you do an x two main one like
said 21

118
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,900
the next time a request a dot com it'll
actually return valid

119
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:55,900
says a way to tease out additional
domains

120
00:06:56,659 --> 00:07:01,300
record yet so

121
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:08,300
the NX domains may or may not be useful
in other words South up

122
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:14,379
are so

123
00:07:14,379 --> 00:07:20,789
lets a over this than start by running

124
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:24,349
think that and the let's take a look at
a

125
00:07:24,349 --> 00:07:29,669
what happens when we run even minor
nothing apparently

126
00:07:29,669 --> 00:07:34,689
broke their

127
00:07:34,689 --> 00:07:38,349
returning I'll must not have networking
setup

128
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:41,509
which is weird cuz I want to cleanse
natural

129
00:07:41,509 --> 00:07:46,259
should have it so on

130
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:50,319
anything that wasn't and putting up

131
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,070
ca

132
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,800
so we ran it on

133
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,030
and it it says also have a user agent of
Sir sup

134
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:04,200
else like it goes to BB study XD are
sorry BB dot practical matter now says

135
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:04,830
dot com

136
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:09,650
does a request for test such a pic I
also looks like maybe go to hello that

137
00:08:09,650 --> 00:08:11,280
now are now spoke to calm

138
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:15,930
I so the couple domains that we're able
to see so far

139
00:08:15,930 --> 00:08:18,930
also

140
00:08:18,930 --> 00:08:22,130
if we turn on an ex a domains

141
00:08:22,130 --> 00:08:25,330
I will see that we we really get those
two domains

142
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:28,520
so the next unless you're lucky only
your liking

143
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:32,640
you may be SOL another domain I'm
because there is a random this factor

144
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:32,990
with

145
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:37,190
what the other demands that it hits as
the next up was turned on process

146
00:08:37,190 --> 00:08:37,690
logging

147
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:41,420
so week ago into

148
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:45,300
tools

149
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:52,300
take that configuration

150
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:58,240
turn on the process lying which will be
on by default the future

151
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,459
but the point is to

152
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:04,610
learn run it

153
00:09:04,610 --> 00:09:08,410
and we run

154
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:15,410
the now where

155
00:09:17,759 --> 00:09:20,579
and this time we see that pain au pair
dodi XE

156
00:09:20,579 --> 00:09:24,639
is connecting over 40 so we now know
that the process has been injected to

157
00:09:24,639 --> 00:09:31,639
is no bad idea XD now we want to do the
connection break functionality

158
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:37,790
to you pinpoint to go that's doing the
connecting so we're gonna turn on

159
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:43,199
inside the think that will turn on
connexion break

160
00:09:43,199 --> 00:09:46,569
we well

161
00:09:46,569 --> 00:09:53,569
a turn on are just in time to bugging
and then

162
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,170
now it just in time to fucking open

163
00:09:57,170 --> 00:10:04,170
so we should break when we us when we
run them our this time

164
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:11,470
and we were able to break for an
exception handler so we're gonna step

165
00:10:11,470 --> 00:10:12,120
out a bit

166
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:16,820
and then we're going to do what we did
earlier which was

167
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:20,650
hey let's take a we took a look at the
stack trace

168
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:23,730
it was a really much to be had there
didn't get us back

169
00:10:23,730 --> 00:10:28,530
to the original place where it's coming
from cuz obviously our code not all

170
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:30,630
coming from when I net so

171
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:33,830
we think there might be show code so we
could do is

172
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:37,660
set our break on access

173
00:10:37,660 --> 00:10:42,140
on the RW section which is a section
with the Joker

174
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:45,710
to play

175
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:49,810
and it breaks on access when they get
back to chill code

176
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:53,360
which tells us that hey this look
previous caller the one that actually

177
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:54,000
did the

178
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,620
ended up doing that connect it was a
higher level called someone I met

179
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,870
function but we don't know which one

180
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:02,330
that's fine but

181
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:06,900
poke around and see you know if there's
anything here to be found

182
00:11:06,900 --> 00:11:09,920
like earlier we were looking on the
stack

183
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,450
in the demo example and look their

184
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:16,790
appears to be some strings on the stack
here so we turn this into

185
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:20,180
some ask you to look at and we start to
see

186
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:26,020
test RJ Peck make sense to us super evil
that actually haven't seen that yet

187
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:31,610
and sets a new string that we've fat now
found also we CBB Duk practical now are

188
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,630
now stuck on which is why the places
that let

189
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:37,750
also we see other one which is hollowed
out now earned a the book dot com

190
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:41,010
but we see as well but now we see to
know domains

191
00:11:41,010 --> 00:11:44,170
the dude new domains is one is the
password is

192
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:48,310
dot com and the other is or fall in
Russia dot com

193
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:53,650
slash super evil that tax sorry we could
start thinking that a baby

194
00:11:53,650 --> 00:11:57,150
there's a couple extra remains in there
that happen with some frequency

195
00:11:57,150 --> 00:12:01,070
right I maybe it's gonna do this to mean
that some other occasion

196
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:04,820
but we were able to see those by having
a break point here be able to

197
00:12:04,820 --> 00:12:10,580
go directly to that spot also we see
this you found me

198
00:12:10,580 --> 00:12:14,680
got exclamation point string so we are
we don't know what that is used for but

199
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:21,380
that's probably getting that message box
to pop up like we're talking about

200
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:24,310
sup the next step it requires you to be

201
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:28,209
a reverse engineer obviously because you
have to figure out how you can get it

202
00:12:28,209 --> 00:12:31,380
like what has to occur to get that
message box pop up

203
00:12:31,380 --> 00:12:37,620
cf2 perform some code analysis here and
so

204
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:41,370
if you analyze the show could all

205
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:44,449
would best thing to do would be to rip
it out pollen is something like a dirty

206
00:12:44,449 --> 00:12:46,519
hand we have three where loaded on this
pm

207
00:12:46,519 --> 00:12:51,600
good place to start on or you can just
look at an all in reverse that way

208
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:55,339
also this is a loop if you remember it
was

209
00:12:55,339 --> 00:12:59,509
it was in a loop going to different
domains rate like 24:05 a.m.

210
00:12:59,509 --> 00:13:02,870
in a row and for exiting so

211
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,910
many years ago about psych probably step
through this little bit and see if that

212
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:06,449
happens

213
00:13:06,449 --> 00:13:10,839
center every file it hurts

214
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:14,699
you know getting something from the
system as jumping around

215
00:13:14,699 --> 00:13:17,540
it so it's it's going up and some lube
we know it's going to loop through this

216
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,060
again

217
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:21,860
now it's calling get

218
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:25,430
account and doing some type of
mathematical equation on it

219
00:13:25,430 --> 00:13:28,500
before deciding to jump here are not

220
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:32,480
and if I take a look and if I would you
know

221
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,000
if I what will analyze this code I
realize that this jumper steak n

222
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,310
that's gonna take me to wear that its
it's been before so we don't want this

223
00:13:40,310 --> 00:13:45,339
this jump to be taken so we wanna like
you notice something like a 20 flexo

224
00:13:45,339 --> 00:13:51,250
that way it's not taken and then we see
a series of calls here

225
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:55,240
so we can step through us

226
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:59,040
see internet open

227
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:03,010
with surf's up make sense that's what
we've been seeing so far

228
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:06,540
we see internet open URL

229
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:09,959
however this time it's different right
if we take a look

230
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:14,350
now it's or ball in Rochefort dot com
slash super evil that text

231
00:14:14,350 --> 00:14:18,610
so maybe what we have to serve up year
the super evil

232
00:14:18,610 --> 00:14:24,480
is the thing we should go after next

233
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,490
we

234
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,890
scroll down to the coat a little bit
because we know that after a dozen

235
00:14:29,890 --> 00:14:31,279
internet open URL

236
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,540
going to Internet refile we saw that
happen earlier at this location

237
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:39,600
and what gets returned to the Internet
refile

238
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,130
is a buffer right so maybe it's
comparing something to the buffer

239
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:48,570
we see two comparisons here 12 34 and 12
32

240
00:14:48,570 --> 00:14:51,580
what is 34 32 in ASCII

241
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:57,260
34-32

242
00:14:57,260 --> 00:15:01,520
perhaps X 34 X 32 I should say

243
00:15:01,520 --> 00:15:07,370
42 rapes I kinda get ahead a little bit
earlier in the class rate as to what the

244
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,550
the code was so it looks like it checks
the first two bytes

245
00:15:10,550 --> 00:15:13,860
a super evil that text for having the

246
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:17,180
42 as the strain and if it does

247
00:15:17,180 --> 00:15:20,570
looks like it's going to come down here
and do this call

248
00:15:20,570 --> 00:15:23,730
so we kinda step through this a little
bit

249
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:27,010
up I just think I stepped over I know
it's

250
00:15:27,010 --> 00:15:34,010
it's actually in a break point it's
pretty funny of course cuz is doing a

251
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:39,930
connect

252
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:42,899
we see the internet refile of course is
not gonna be fed the 42

253
00:15:42,899 --> 00:15:49,749
Sorgen after kinda tricky here so right
here

254
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:53,430
says a jumper Steak N we don't want that
to happen right

255
00:15:53,430 --> 00:15:58,240
because the comparison to the fore then
there's a comparison to the two

256
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:05,240
we don't want that to happen either me

257
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:16,460
jump is taken up try set

258
00:16:16,460 --> 00:16:19,300
and it comes down here so we basically
forced to go through

259
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:23,620
and now we see that's about call a
message box every step over that we'll

260
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,260
see

261
00:16:24,260 --> 00:16:27,840
up their mess advice came up you found
me and so that's the key

262
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:31,130
so

263
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:34,620
does require some analysis but here you
see a pic nah caught

264
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:37,760
that entire transaction and I just
stepped through which was

265
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,250
you know went to the war on Russia dot
com and a

266
00:16:41,250 --> 00:16:45,520
which I know many be found but then did
the trick is is what we serve up a super

267
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:45,970
evil

268
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:50,670
so we could do is to force take that too
serve that up we could go into the fake

269
00:16:50,670 --> 00:16:51,180
net

270
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:55,120
tools big net to default files

271
00:16:55,120 --> 00:17:01,350
and put in you know if it's gonna get
super evil that tax which can change B

272
00:17:01,350 --> 00:17:03,060
to put a different a

273
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:06,390
text found that right one any file it
starts a forty-two will do it

274
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:10,500
and by default if it does big nipples
are up in a shelter it so we did we

275
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:12,380
could just change this HTML page

276
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:15,640
Jetstar 242 that's good enough to get it
to

277
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:20,390
to pop of course it has to actually go
to that domain

278
00:17:20,390 --> 00:17:23,560
which is something we forced to happen
and

279
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:26,890
the way to show called works as a
actually I every one out a thousand

280
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:27,750
chance

281
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:32,420
it'll actually go there versus the other
two domains were like 50 percent chance

282
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:36,930
cell possible from our to do that

283
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:41,240
in this is actually no but is it
realistic that an hour might go to a

284
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,290
buncha domains before actually going to
the real one

285
00:17:43,290 --> 00:17:47,340
oh yeah that ever happens all the time
right there trying to test and see if

286
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:49,820
their connections that available I've
seen peace in our that

287
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:53,160
you know go to goes to do with that on
every day for a week and then on

288
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:56,700
on day 8 is when actually goes to that
place so

289
00:17:56,700 --> 00:18:00,150
I mean it is a realistic scenario I'm
cell

290
00:18:00,150 --> 00:18:03,900
thats did everything else Tattler okay

291
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:10,900
so I if you guys have any questions I
could take a nap

292
00:18:11,559 --> 00:18:14,350
okay it's not a tip for the think that
workshop

293
00:18:14,350 --> 00:18:15,299
thanks in
