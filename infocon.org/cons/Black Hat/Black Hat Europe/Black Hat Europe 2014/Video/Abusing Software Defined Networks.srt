1
00:00:00,149 --> 00:00:05,390
this is abusing software-defined
networks the obligatory

2
00:00:05,390 --> 00:00:09,429
you know who I am page 10 Gregor picket

3
00:00:09,429 --> 00:00:13,750
how far security I think a lot of people
have been talking about what they do

4
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:18,140
I shifted back and forth deny red team

5
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:23,670
lutein actress Tabu team did some red
team I'm back in 1913 again I'm entry in

6
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:24,930
an hour so we do

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:28,119
on both antacid settings like people do
course

8
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:31,570
and now I'm ash care services highlights
and landing

9
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:35,590
now they're gone back to looting and Ms
Keisha said

10
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:39,969
to my contact information to you wish to
speak to me later

11
00:00:39,969 --> 00:00:43,210
about this thank an overview

12
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:47,940
out today's talk what is it what is
offered if I networking

13
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,010
you for some not for others Malaya

14
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:54,050
explore a little bit about that tell you
I'm you know what

15
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:58,800
use of undefined working and of course
exploiting it because we all like to

16
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,430
break things

17
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,940
sold to breaking a lot of things today
and how much fun it is to break things

18
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:04,580
we r

19
00:01:04,580 --> 00:01:08,490
are also here to help and we're breaking
things so that they can be fixed

20
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:12,189
tell or talk about some solutions
immediate solutions now

21
00:01:12,189 --> 00:01:15,979
as well as long-term how to handle
suffered a fine networking in moving

22
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:16,430
forward

23
00:01:16,430 --> 00:01:19,509
okay because you want to talk about this
as a bigger picture

24
00:01:19,509 --> 00:01:23,270
not just immediate our controllers we're
seeing today in the park cause they use

25
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:26,619
but the bigger picture are st. Anne
Arundel format that

26
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:30,659
and then finally wrapping up because I
will be introducing

27
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,710
a talk it today act and leaders a DVD

28
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:38,350
tears I you know I'm CEO version thereof
the update us when we can get the

29
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:38,939
toolkit

30
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:42,909
updates to it as well as some links for
it more information

31
00:01:42,909 --> 00:01:46,460
and ISDN 10 so let's start with

32
00:01:46,460 --> 00:01:50,569
modern-day networks and we have some
people here probably have

33
00:01:50,569 --> 00:01:55,509
a number people here involve networks
very interesting and most have asked 1st

34
00:01:55,509 --> 00:01:56,840
Ave bend or dependent

35
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:00,009
night equipment at very I'm

36
00:02:00,009 --> 00:02:04,609
unique way of implementing standard
features you have unique features and

37
00:02:04,609 --> 00:02:07,530
you have the command line t have to
learn just happy sicken

38
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:12,239
10 start adding using that one after the
other me I'm difficult to scale is

39
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,269
different moving parts

40
00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:17,610
complex on a break a very disturbing
configuration

41
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:21,519
each device has its own unique
configuration Anton view that network

42
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:24,769
and there's a consistency that creates
and because you make a risk make

43
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:25,299
mistakes

44
00:02:25,299 --> 00:02:28,629
10 and boxes I use

45
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:33,160
inflexible park also we are using light
is giving us in a difficult innovate

46
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:36,680
that because there are shared and we can
just make changes to distinctly on

47
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:39,900
without them to produce some we can't
just make changes

48
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:43,709
that we need my need in the park of and
protocols

49
00:02:43,709 --> 00:02:47,630
are unable to consider other factors
besides just the network itself

50
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:52,160
we talk about bigger things now talk
about application needs application

51
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,760
space is very important now talk about
business needs

52
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:58,019
that the sort up our cost can't attack
to

53
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:03,040
and so we have this very large very
fragile network

54
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,419
and we find that it's been very
difficult to change making one change

55
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:11,940
can be a bit fragile and everything
breaks case we very careful

56
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:15,569
we regard about our network because beat
him they work well but

57
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:18,819
may take some care intervening at work
tech

58
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:21,829
so and her suffered a fine network

59
00:03:21,829 --> 00:03:25,849
the idea is to separate the our control
and data plan

60
00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:31,230
where the four decisions are made by the
Comptroller and the switches and routers

61
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:35,150
just for packet ran toward the
controllers their program with all the

62
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:35,780
intelligence

63
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:38,950
have the full visibility all network

64
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:42,730
and can consider the totality of the
network before making any decisions

65
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:47,540
and icing is everything centralized it
can be very consistent and can force a

66
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:48,579
granular policy

67
00:03:48,579 --> 00:03:52,079
across network I can the Holy Grail on
the network

68
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:54,709
now from a central location

69
00:03:54,709 --> 00:03:58,030
him this leaves the switches ass bare
metal only

70
00:03:58,030 --> 00:04:01,890
and wish that means at that point and it
can be any better hardware/software

71
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:05,430
really doesn't matter they become more I
look ninety can

72
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:10,620
now the reason why we went distraction
is because Howard

73
00:04:10,620 --> 00:04:14,690
choosing a goalless tracks because I
solved a lot of problems in Eric space

74
00:04:14,690 --> 00:04:20,100
first of costs at with suffered a fine
art meets very I

75
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,940
very expensive I with ninety switches
hemorrhage much less expensive

76
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:27,990
how we like that question the business
side and then on routing

77
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:31,430
BGP lot of things that we would like to
do have problems doing

78
00:04:31,430 --> 00:04:36,830
curly with writing using BGP now lives
in different promptly consult with us

79
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:42,229
I'm main is route you can go ahead and
actual traffic around and bite before

80
00:04:42,229 --> 00:04:46,660
you you take out a service to teach %ah
to update or do repairs on a

81
00:04:46,660 --> 00:04:50,990
you can give the customer a chance to
choose the pointy guess

82
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:55,010
you can an additional factors to BGP
security

83
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:59,120
maybe reputation before choose the next
top also faster convergence

84
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,460
grain appearing at the internet exchange
points it's no longer a situation on

85
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:03,970
nothing

86
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:07,720
that a lot of problems are solved with
suffered a fine networking

87
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:11,349
and also expands accountability

88
00:05:11,349 --> 00:05:16,240
and it allows you to do real well world
a sizing info space

89
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,880
and will be on a cloud socializing up
the network as you choose as you wished

90
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:20,250
you

91
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:25,030
for the best I use a democrat it also
allows you to

92
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:28,349
goth from server load balancing to
actual network load balancing

93
00:05:28,349 --> 00:05:32,470
are gaining efficiencies that we have
not seen so far camp and course for

94
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:33,060
security

95
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,440
this is where people I'm I really been
having on the discussion about what

96
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,849
work in St in New for security allows
you to add

97
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:45,010
layers tonight access control you get to
consider other factors

98
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:48,699
SIHH at any time a day and maybe just
dates

99
00:05:48,699 --> 00:05:53,250
weekend verses I'll weekdays also to
Danes out attacks controlling and

100
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:53,949
additional layers

101
00:05:53,949 --> 00:05:58,139
and of course adapter traffic Manning
modern is no

102
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:01,270
no longer has to be from a fixed point
you can action movie monitoring

103
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:04,540
I with a long along with the traffic
America track

104
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:07,780
on the network in a course we knew have
the central

105
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:11,660
location were able to see the network
and then program plea

106
00:06:11,660 --> 00:06:15,020
change it you can and work toward attack
detection

107
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:18,750
negation make the actual network defend
itself to like two responses

108
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:22,730
that really at like eight bodies and
security side to

109
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:26,730
on add more dimension to what you can do
un-american protecting it

110
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:31,760
the network camp soul we see latin grade
can buy Saab not this new operations are

111
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:32,820
a different operations

112
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,470
and we can do with work early I'll
carrying out an hour

113
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:40,370
but also what we can do additionally
with offered if I networking 10

114
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:44,740
cell shopper define our king is actually
not a new thing it's something that

115
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:46,270
they've been working toward for a while

116
00:06:46,270 --> 00:06:49,940
to start off with some under par calls
that they were adapting

117
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:53,440
to can get the same kind and
centralization to control and

118
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,320
consistency

119
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:57,560
that's offered by networking with the
hoping to get with suffered if I

120
00:06:57,560 --> 00:06:58,170
networking

121
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:01,680
S&P extension on BGP netcom

122
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,300
Lisp peace at but there is always
something missing because

123
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,880
its primary purpose up para perverse are
these protocols

124
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,990
was not suffered a fine art not that bed

125
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:15,930
functionality actually went ahead and
Erica gone up

126
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:19,650
and not designed Park of person who
could ignite this paradigm

127
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:23,450
all the STB for the virtual space and

128
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:26,730
europe-wide bridging most virtual and
physical OpenFlow

129
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:31,050
and so we're talking all been told to
hear

130
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:35,160
it is something that is expanding has
I'm season has the most support

131
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,070
and is why I is being used by most are
the controllers rolling out now an

132
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:39,610
OpenFlow

133
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:42,870
savage tell my son that paradigm
controller

134
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:47,250
secure channel for the controller to
communicate over with before Thomas

135
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:51,630
time so we had to switch is in our thing
us to share their roles it defines at

136
00:07:51,630 --> 00:07:52,800
those forty éléments

137
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:57,090
a foreign process and then a message in
format so does forty elements

138
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:00,200
can't make it back to control in kind
updates to what they're supposed to be

139
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:00,630
doing

140
00:08:00,630 --> 00:08:05,120
with packet when a Karen and now 14
process this

141
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:10,040
the should look very much like firewall
9 for helmet will receive a packet

142
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:13,819
it will check the flow table if a match
is found

143
00:08:13,819 --> 00:08:16,709
XQ that action if no matches found

144
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:20,360
then it goes ahead and send that act
controller controller

145
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:26,429
has policy makes a decision pass that
decision on 24 now meant

146
00:08:26,429 --> 00:08:29,699
for ya no updates okay more extra texan

147
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:33,389
and anytime encounters at same time to
pack it and that has a match

148
00:08:33,389 --> 00:08:36,870
will carry out the action to get updated
did not have to keep I'm back and forth

149
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:41,060
can and this low tables they are very
much as I said like

150
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:45,040
firewall rules match action entries 12
fields

151
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,100
available for matching and their
wild-card matching available

152
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:52,529
shipping can have you cannot instantiate
now rules for group a package not just

153
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:53,259
individual

154
00:08:53,259 --> 00:08:56,910
packets a brief

155
00:08:56,910 --> 00:09:00,029
kind about graphical representation of
that relationship

156
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:04,779
this case we have an open flow switch
tho table that secure channel back Nick

157
00:09:04,779 --> 00:09:06,050
eight with the control over

158
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:10,290
using the OpenFlow protocol we like
pictures only

159
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:14,230
there's one I don't have what some
people have a lot I don't have on

160
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:14,680
Pinterest

161
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:18,009
can too many platforms

162
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:21,370
that a lot coming out right now but
these are some of them more on

163
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:26,079
product lines a syscall course cisco has
are prepared Terry platforms coming out

164
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:27,139
HP has them

165
00:09:27,139 --> 00:09:31,500
IDM and then there are some open source
want my once we get to get our hands on

166
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:33,170
my way that spending the big bucks

167
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:37,149
where Knox pox right you and flood

168
00:09:37,149 --> 00:09:40,360
light and open daylight specifically
looking at those today

169
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,339
because they are promoted as
production-ready so I wanted

170
00:09:44,339 --> 00:09:48,360
I to look at the sanity what we would
get if we went ahead and put those in

171
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:48,959
the production

172
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,329
10 tell first of sunlight

173
00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:58,050
it is an open source Java controller
primarily an OpenFlow base controller

174
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:03,610
sporting opens old version 1.0 is a fork
from the beginning Java OpenFlow

175
00:10:03,610 --> 00:10:04,290
controller

176
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:07,970
maintained by a single outfit big switch
networks can

177
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:11,230
sect is the basis for the commercial
pack big switch fabric

178
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:15,380
which is getting a lot of pressure right
now

179
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,240
and we have open daylight an open source
at a controller

180
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:21,560
many south on options including up in
SLO

181
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:25,650
and supports 1.0 and 1.3

182
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:29,170
it to a day after work from the
beginning Java OpenFlow controller

183
00:10:29,170 --> 00:10:33,460
and instead of being maintained by a
single out then it is a clever effort

184
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,100
under our

185
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:37,190
how long are popping up of course we've
had a lot of support for

186
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:42,100
let foundation being worked on by number
of people under that effort to check for

187
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:42,510
had

188
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:45,830
action your Packard brocade Cisco

189
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:49,560
lot a big names can actor

190
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:53,540
I say I have lacked the gym but I have
some act so we have

191
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:56,680
now works they work well but they take a
lot of care

192
00:10:56,680 --> 00:11:00,340
and to look to improve Namlook to salt
in our problems

193
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:04,430
we have a live great promise of his
lawyers capabilities would expand on

194
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:09,110
so courting IT industry accordion course
to the the material you get if you read

195
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:09,590
about these

196
00:11:09,590 --> 00:11:13,650
everything and the puppies are indochine
bad corset

197
00:11:13,650 --> 00:11:16,500
course not I i wouldn't be here
everything was going to be that

198
00:11:16,500 --> 00:11:16,980
wonderful

199
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:22,990
have tonight tackling and their number

200
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:27,170
our weaknesses in the park all itself
encryption and authentication are

201
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:29,470
defined within the standard VAT less

202
00:11:29,470 --> 00:11:32,470
night it's more of a suggestion and
requirement

203
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:37,000
start out very good it said he likes you
must can't a less

204
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:40,440
offer a secure channel Minnesota hang
backwards

205
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:46,110
and 21.0 set a less 14 said at you wanna
use TCP 80 K

206
00:11:46,110 --> 00:11:51,030
now all we find is if you give people
the opportunity to be less secure

207
00:11:51,030 --> 00:11:56,030
like tornado act neka choosing the
lesser care

208
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:59,050
so we saw two problems here

209
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:03,830
and controllers first of the night has
no support for TRS

210
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:07,220
baghdad only they've had plans for am

211
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:10,220
open daylight it supported but not
required

212
00:12:10,220 --> 00:12:13,350
and its K miss looks bad but I get worse

213
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:16,530
look at this which is and rest in no

214
00:12:16,530 --> 00:12:20,690
now no HP now some yeses brocade Cisco
extreme

215
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:24,990
what we find is there are Morneau's and
yes it

216
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:27,590
and always finding out here is a even if
you

217
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:30,960
whitetail ass you might have a hard time
you probably have a hard time getting a

218
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,990
nice match between

219
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:35,940
a controller supports the last and an
endpoint NetSupport still s

220
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:41,130
and actually worsen next we find in the
configuration settings for all these

221
00:12:41,130 --> 00:12:43,280
there doesn't seem to be an option for
certificates

222
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:47,550
no certificates notification which
pretty much

223
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:52,440
means any money committed can be an
endpoint or can just choose attacking

224
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:53,060
much

225
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:56,280
question at what we like to try new
right so

226
00:12:56,280 --> 00:13:00,740
all we find out here then is that with
the way to create a new standard or not

227
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:03,910
as it seems to be we are see a complete
mentation that standard

228
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:06,990
we had a lot of issues here with

229
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:10,430
our environment because we're gonna
dress up

230
00:13:10,430 --> 00:13:14,140
if you're lucky you may get their
matching said our controllers

231
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,720
and switches that export just with most
part article on

232
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:21,320
so a large number most people have
problems if makes disclosure

233
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,840
and modification demand the middle
because shorthand that right

234
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:29,190
matchup and then because we don't see it
on occasion support across the board and

235
00:13:29,190 --> 00:13:30,060
there's one vendor

236
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:33,890
of four chill s everyone is ending have
a problem

237
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:37,100
with Al service issues can for speaking

238
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:40,550
art and I'll service issues OpenFlow as
we can already

239
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:43,680
runners to remind right Central Asian

240
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:46,830
Intel the Tennessee dependency can be
explained in

241
00:13:46,830 --> 00:13:51,250
healthy know that the world to have a
promise your gonna have to address this

242
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:56,280
it's important to look at power bender
Tammy and so fly with that was explored

243
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:56,880
by

244
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:00,250
Salman francie time they did a study

245
00:14:00,250 --> 00:14:03,620
their results what they did and the
results are on Shah citer

246
00:14:03,620 --> 00:14:06,820
recommend looking at looking that up I

247
00:14:06,820 --> 00:14:10,250
seeing what the results were I'll give a
brief summary here course

248
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:13,970
there is also well that Netflix Hannah
supporting

249
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:17,490
took just a couple instances are see
bench

250
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:21,560
I don't know if you've never seen ash
and can I do to

251
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:25,110
jed Gottlieb like a pack a cracker
measures drops in traffic and generate

252
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,060
traffic and then

253
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:29,710
entrainment flat protesting stress
testing as well knife

254
00:14:29,710 --> 00:14:33,200
they used to here for that act try to
set up a few inches

255
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,630
a/c bench and a through packets at from
the controller and down it meant

256
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:42,100
came well it'll ironic because they

257
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:46,260
there's an option within file I'm radio
main entrance you can make a powered

258
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:50,130
turn right at me they found that when
you flip that switch

259
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:53,490
you naval that we compiled it it
actually went down faster

260
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:58,720
so yeah you turn on a really meaning and
it actually killed it

261
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,650
tasaday so tan importing can open
daylight

262
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:06,260
it is unknown but with investing because
it is Java

263
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:11,010
and for god sakes how at now to
experiment new year

264
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:15,390
you know we read I do the work of Salman
fancy time or two

265
00:15:15,390 --> 00:15:19,070
play with open at night I recommend if
you have a controller and

266
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:22,290
already there or plant in fact my show
you how a lot of us

267
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:27,160
won't be doing this very soon to play
with you this now these controllers or

268
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:27,620
your own

269
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:31,950
yes it was here this this force I
started developing them to learn more

270
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:32,940
about open daylight

271
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:37,580
on tire OpenFlow and and a controller
since I started building these tools

272
00:15:37,580 --> 00:15:40,900
and cash I can take a seat and I said
building outreach tool

273
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:44,950
adding more capability shifting the
focus today so what I started with this

274
00:15:44,950 --> 00:15:46,620
the first quarter talkin

275
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:52,070
I'll switch simper snakes and what
better way to learn the protocol into

276
00:15:52,070 --> 00:15:56,980
traits our simulate neck and then point
learning message that have to exchange

277
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:01,250
soul elsewhere checks in person some
flow switch exchange the closer the

278
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:01,810
controller

279
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:04,870
receives a response to a feature

280
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:09,580
quest he receives response to
configuration Sat configuration get

281
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:13,380
it does all the ACO I was received a
call

282
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:17,720
class returns ACA replied an issue that
relationship maintains a relationship

283
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:22,270
and you can run a shell fantasy how the
rations proceed with the controllers

284
00:16:22,270 --> 00:16:25,980
and what kind information passed back
and forth now course

285
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:30,520
I had ulterior motive might for Dennis I
wanted to see you

286
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:34,270
you know what we can turn this into and
so i didnt ok and I'll

287
00:16:34,270 --> 00:16:39,400
a nap and it offline plan so it's very
friendly

288
00:16:39,400 --> 00:16:42,200
establish a Danish relationship pretends
to be

289
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:46,510
to turn a bride from the endpoint thing
and it got there goes ahead mister

290
00:16:46,510 --> 00:16:51,540
I unloads on and color and so you know
if you look at the

291
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:55,940
might differ pretty side missed call
matching feels oliver_caman asians

292
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:59,970
and do the math in millions and millions
and nine the packets he compared to past

293
00:16:59,970 --> 00:17:00,890
time compiling

294
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:04,570
you a bit faster right have a couple
license yourself

295
00:17:04,570 --> 00:17:08,490
and see how your controllers times act
have a little fun on

296
00:17:08,490 --> 00:17:12,320
from I know how to recommend that I
reckon

297
00:17:12,320 --> 00:17:16,490
can now 24 online

298
00:17:16,490 --> 00:17:20,200
to a controller where the controllers
were on the final restart I want to

299
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,200
mention the bump or

300
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:24,980
and disney on corruption missus for
overflow non-christian

301
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:28,120
north on occasion music and things that
we love question

302
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:31,900
you need careful control switch and on

303
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:36,860
D&AD PCT of mitral I'm and they said
they're not really

304
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:40,860
flattening a standard you're kinda
moving along kill s is there in some

305
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,560
instances

306
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,740
but not completely I implemented

307
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:49,400
10 as an elongate or Russia stand
they're gonna start pushing out the port

308
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:54,890
and importantly there yet now so saffron
now

309
00:17:54,890 --> 00:17:59,570
but as a start mending the the stair
fully its guest are showing up so keep

310
00:17:59,570 --> 00:18:00,100
your eyes

311
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:03,270
open because this is dishonoured
open-door

312
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:07,690
accel keep an eye out there Press not a
problem now but some will be

313
00:18:07,690 --> 00:18:11,620
thing

314
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:14,370
alright so park also question fine I
find it fun

315
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:17,790
and some people to more about chinese
water torture but

316
00:18:17,790 --> 00:18:21,190
I like particles is worse with
controllers

317
00:18:21,190 --> 00:18:25,910
and sunlight there's no encryption for
the North Down HTTP API

318
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:29,460
an authentication for the HD Haiti babi

319
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:33,040
open now it seems to be better not
really

320
00:18:33,040 --> 00:18:37,050
as encryption on the North Down HTTP API

321
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:42,270
but is turned off by default dedication
on North town by it HTTP basic

322
00:18:42,270 --> 00:18:43,140
authentication

323
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:47,210
Heidi for pastors week and strong
passions are turned off by default

324
00:18:47,210 --> 00:18:51,140
and and wonderful and it seems like a
great

325
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:54,570
well it seemed a little better than fun
by not really

326
00:18:54,570 --> 00:18:57,570
because I'm gonna show you next flight

327
00:18:57,570 --> 00:19:00,640
and is a lot of stuff packed in open
daylight

328
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:05,860
she exploited can lie to cast a brown
that angeles la you actually have direct

329
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:08,980
access to it gain control of the
american support

330
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:12,780
although now it's more direct gonna take
a comedy tour

331
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:17,540
so grant more so than and up in the same
place and

332
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:20,810
if nations closure two interceptions for
both I

333
00:19:20,810 --> 00:19:23,920
networks too poor to buy a controller
topology

334
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:27,630
credentials on the opening night i'd
information disclosure both

335
00:19:27,630 --> 00:19:30,760
apology targets lighted you see stuff

336
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:35,400
time both those also topology flow and
message modification to

337
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,780
unauthorized access and access remove
access

338
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:41,920
all the fun stuff high-traffic my
personal favorite

339
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:46,050
and changing traffic and florals a light
action are high traffic

340
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:50,450
and I G two just change any aspect in
the head around that every most

341
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:53,490
most aspect better the lands like that

342
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:56,620
and now

343
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:00,580
before even dig into that network before
you can control and then our care

344
00:20:00,580 --> 00:20:02,270
directly on from that base network

345
00:20:02,270 --> 00:20:05,840
or indirectly an open daylight network
yet to find

346
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:11,770
9 soul OpenFlow double bass services are
currently listening on TCP port

347
00:20:11,770 --> 00:20:17,810
6633 there's a new port if I know it's
official now you can find it and I and

348
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:18,280
eyesight

349
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:24,590
6653 d tools all the tools they default
to 6633

350
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:29,050
but they accept an alternate port so if
you have a control it on an airport

351
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:31,100
already selling over with updates

352
00:20:31,100 --> 00:20:34,590
in point or the Davenport him now

353
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:38,700
nor to identify wannabes how open Sunday
services you a prayer hello

354
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:42,270
you change your whole if you get a
feature request

355
00:20:42,270 --> 00:20:47,120
then you know that you doing with a
taller if you don't and a switch

356
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:50,710
tell the next tools in the tool kit

357
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:54,550
of check 10 defies OpenFlow Bay services

358
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:57,590
and reports on the versions Pavel what

359
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:01,010
animation on float these tools were
designed for discovery

360
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:04,620
so what you gonna go ahead and do it in
a lest I love

361
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:07,750
poll said potentially have an open
publishers and I'm

362
00:21:07,750 --> 00:21:12,540
can you take that they say that a
hundred maybe I 255 beautiful son and

363
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,720
that you can't look at Tara

364
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:20,190
known all-star old-school subnet so you
going back to top check a smallest

365
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:23,550
654 knows what you that expose their

366
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:27,910
you get the smallest of the num of
animal known and unknown rate and points

367
00:21:27,910 --> 00:21:31,820
reporting a title Taylor to controller
or AR

368
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,870
and point acts which are are at all

369
00:21:35,870 --> 00:21:40,180
a version of Islam and just throw that
in there

370
00:21:40,180 --> 00:21:44,940
also and that script as well tel.no: you
can use a little short have

371
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:51,940
can so let's go ahead and see how easy
it is

372
00:21:54,270 --> 00:21:57,700
at the setup so of check as a potential
targets here

373
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:02,510
30 this next much faster than hotel

374
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:08,130
I told to slow service version one found
at 192 168

375
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:12,100
267 the sack I knew that already but are
still asking

376
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:16,150
to now go ahead and and so we have the
smallest

377
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:21,970
and told the senate controller

378
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:25,490
howard got that feature request back and
to a very quick

379
00:22:25,490 --> 00:22:28,620
very easy that actually use this

380
00:22:28,620 --> 00:22:34,020
the I'd program internet lead if you own
is interested yes they are controlled

381
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:41,020
how to write and was very quick very
easy

382
00:22:41,110 --> 00:22:44,620
Python take a look yourself

383
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:48,570
I L how that runs K now

384
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:53,110
a course what's next right are so as we
found this controller

385
00:22:53,110 --> 00:22:56,909
this saturday right behind this
controller is a small network

386
00:22:56,909 --> 00:23:00,700
one admin host to your house one server

387
00:23:00,700 --> 00:23:03,700
and when I D S which shall henceforth
called the center

388
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:06,809
can be anything and it's going to be
something like and ideas

389
00:23:06,809 --> 00:23:10,840
an attacker me I mean I'm not any fun
stuff myself

390
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:15,799
and identify targets and then you may
see also I wanna with the protecting

391
00:23:15,799 --> 00:23:19,250
course and then refined sensors the see
if anyone is listening

392
00:23:19,250 --> 00:23:26,190
are taught to net to do that today is of
maps download flows from the OpenFlow

393
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:26,760
controller

394
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,809
and he is the slowest identify target
Internet services

395
00:23:30,809 --> 00:23:34,919
tbilisi else to identify sensors it
works with finite

396
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:38,340
an open and I VHS I'm you actually are
the text for you

397
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:43,130
and we use the correct syntax now only
will this take an alternate port

398
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:46,570
bite if you have to end up using explain
connects play

399
00:23:46,570 --> 00:23:50,140
account gives you because everything an
open at all to say that

400
00:23:50,140 --> 00:23:53,270
give you everything on the opening i box
much

401
00:23:53,270 --> 00:23:56,690
everything includes the credentials for
the Northtown

402
00:23:56,690 --> 00:24:00,669
a CPA guy he had to go around you can
get the cash there

403
00:24:00,669 --> 00:24:05,470
mistakes alternate credentials it will
try the default first

404
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:12,470
I'm really at Planet in there you can
actual demonstration

405
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:23,910
act

406
00:24:23,910 --> 00:24:27,770
child very simple this is probably my
most user-friendly tool ever

407
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:31,420
isola menus hysol

408
00:24:31,420 --> 00:24:38,420
actually got the wrong one exit number
six

409
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:46,429
I guess you know the next to a comp
answer first thing we're gonna go and do

410
00:24:46,429 --> 00:24:47,309
is map a network

411
00:24:47,309 --> 00:24:50,370
budget basically request a controller
give me all your clothes

412
00:24:50,370 --> 00:24:53,789
10 national feature here

413
00:24:53,789 --> 00:24:57,120
because you act which you can't get into
which you mean

414
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:02,149
only dissonant Selangor and then

415
00:25:02,149 --> 00:25:05,750
T national message in a meeting

416
00:25:05,750 --> 00:25:09,539
hysol you can list the flows

417
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:12,559
you can do it here iraq recommend doing
that

418
00:25:12,559 --> 00:25:15,820
production network it wouldn't be
massive it will be all the clothes for

419
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:16,649
every switch

420
00:25:16,649 --> 00:25:21,769
every 40 on an arc tell I don't the
lesson but

421
00:25:21,769 --> 00:25:25,860
you can go and dump them a number seven
don't have to file her

422
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:31,470
editing wrapping living in Iran tight so
the first thing I'm going to use a good

423
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:32,340
then they targets

424
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:36,720
are targets to anti having to be me

425
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:39,929
years 225 227 eccentric Sentra

426
00:25:39,929 --> 00:25:43,639
then I want to a course as someone who's
had a

427
00:25:43,639 --> 00:25:47,980
high degree mention a network and
not-so-good interest Bell

428
00:25:47,980 --> 00:25:52,110
talent on Iran to be seen and i'm glad
to see what

429
00:25:52,110 --> 00:25:56,090
is currently being blocked our way what
I'm not allowed to come to get into

430
00:25:56,090 --> 00:26:00,149
kind of course that to interest me the
most timer five is a ACLs

431
00:26:00,149 --> 00:26:04,149
can toll to 25

432
00:26:04,149 --> 00:26:07,309
anything that comes from a 225 is going
to be dropped

433
00:26:07,309 --> 00:26:10,559
now I have an hour to 25 is the server

434
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,570
such great at Exit first thing I'm gonna
go after

435
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:17,120
but before I do that I wanna go ahead
and see if there are any sensors

436
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:20,419
now what this does is actual term
hearing time

437
00:26:20,419 --> 00:26:24,039
you see in the ring

438
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:27,250
going to part 5 tonight I am interested
men

439
00:26:27,250 --> 00:26:31,120
are while hiding from when it comes time
to go after tomor

440
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,029
tougher easy to I to use this tool

441
00:26:35,029 --> 00:26:38,440
and have fun finding out what is on that
network

442
00:26:38,440 --> 00:26:44,909
people you know have available for me

443
00:26:44,909 --> 00:26:48,610
and now so once he found an hour can we
handle and lawn

444
00:26:48,610 --> 00:26:52,870
same network the attacker then can now
granted access

445
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:58,730
I site administrator I mean it's only
fair and had an IDS

446
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:02,389
aminika little I spot in the 90 S and
now these s free

447
00:27:02,389 --> 00:27:06,130
not your question you want to risk I
free to attack cancer

448
00:27:06,130 --> 00:27:09,450
now the next to of course and I

449
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:15,789
tightening earlier access modify slow as
I network showed up in flow controller

450
00:27:15,789 --> 00:27:21,220
Angelo maxies for host class
transformation share your activity

451
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:24,330
I'll be doing it today but it actually
allows you to write your own floral

452
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:27,799
in there make changes to whatever you
want an asshole fields

453
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:32,289
and also allows you to move nearing and
high-tech to be from sensors

454
00:27:32,289 --> 00:27:36,250
put not black-backed works pretty much
the same way as of access

455
00:27:36,250 --> 00:27:41,009
matter of on map work so far but can
open a line

456
00:27:41,009 --> 00:27:44,509

582
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:10,329

and they're being on my job and

589
00:37:33,509 --> 00:37:39,009
saw you can guess what you might find
their to author find them

590
00:37:39,009 --> 00:37:42,720
back pocket these things things are
going into production we need to make

591
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,369

00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:52,980
all right now available solutions for
this and the guy is great

595
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:57,010
now we we demonstrate that the side
packs have these problems

596
00:37:57,010 --> 00:38:01,370
until they fix and we need to have a
solution for protecting ourselves in

597
00:38:01,370 --> 00:38:02,540
protecting our network

598
00:38:02,540 --> 00:38:05,580
for now and for the future 10

599
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:09,070
transport layer security they've gotta
finish

600
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:13,330
implementing standing if you gonna put
it in and you need appointed an

601
00:38:13,330 --> 00:38:17,800

that hard 9

603
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:25,200
and icing as in love the commodities
which is to support this will have the

604
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:25,720
cycles

605
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:29,260
and by the biggest complaint to you know
it's Matt intensive

606

done before you put it into production

612
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:52,440
you know 20 flat now works out there and
then called review

613
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:56,500
please please call to you I can't
believe

614
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:00,190
either these up iraq's economy in fact I
know of after talking to one of the

615
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:00,630
vendors

616
00:39:00,630 --> 00:39:03,960
that it was not cold reviewed yes they
don't have the resources for

617
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:07,630
that's fine make some

618
00:39:07,630 --> 00:39:11,060
fine to me twice finished up because it
is way to easy

619
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:14,260
10 very simple things for now

620
00:39:14,260 --> 00:39:18,830
our future is a little different and
when Indian to think about how we put

621
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:20,480
together these environments the bigger
picture

622
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:24,350
to protect against now services can all
about test in architecture

623
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:27,460
and near partitioning size and I now
work

624
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:32,030
have difference at up in tort having
different aspects it imparts the network

625
00:39:32,030 --> 00:39:35,990
contract clustering time 1h a situation
great

626
00:39:35,990 --> 00:39:39,720
and then a course take low-interest the
most parties controllers are operating

627
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,440
in reactive known meaning that
everything's calm a blank slate

628
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:46,620
and a instantiate those rules as packet
encountered

629
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:51,440
if you have an idea been a wreck I hope
you do Les Brown work stay Fleisher if

630
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,170
you can

631
00:39:52,170 --> 00:39:55,550
to make sure that there isn't much
dependency and the controller

632
00:39:55,550 --> 00:39:58,580
Mac changed he made on the flywheel
object

633
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:02,660
but starting out put a stake fighting if
you can

634
00:40:02,660 --> 00:40:05,590
and are Islam the burden an actual it
doesn't have to

635
00:40:05,590 --> 00:40:09,030
respond every single pack becomes law
can

636
00:40:09,030 --> 00:40:12,670
suffered at is how we can do to protect
against announcers

637
00:40:12,670 --> 00:40:17,130
modification packed these controllers
armful of particle systems

638
00:40:17,130 --> 00:40:22,100
you have applications are seeing an
environment at are in charge in parts

639
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,710
the network from park to flow space

640
00:40:23,710 --> 00:40:27,670
go ahead and put in in security based
application

641
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:31,310
new traffic at available there's for
visible in the network have a secondary

642
00:40:31,310 --> 00:40:32,520
security application

643
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:35,640
you can check the counters its detect

644
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,710
based on policy based on what the
configuration Eric why should be

645
00:40:38,710 --> 00:40:42,730
you know respond abnormalities have
missing since you can instantiate rules

646
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:47,020
into the so tables as things go long
have them detect and read the counters

647
00:40:47,020 --> 00:40:48,240
detect variations

648
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:51,900
and respond and nice now have something
watching the network

649
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:55,020
and have the Dr the environment

650
00:40:55,020 --> 00:40:59,810
match itself and then verification can't
before he put his application

651
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:03,790
can place you can do something called
her space analysis when it does it earns

652
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:06,030
a sporting elements into mathematical
formulas

653
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:09,880
the pack and becomes a cell numbers and
you can push it through

654
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:13,410
the from as you can do it with head
office now says and you can figure out

655
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:15,150
how this is gonna work before you put it

656
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:18,550
no more guessing we hope this is going
to work this way we think it's gonna

657
00:41:18,550 --> 00:41:19,110
work its way

658
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:22,570
what s best now signaled how it's going
to

659
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:25,950
I'll work so you can do it before you
put applications in in place

660
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:29,480
and then used %ah secondary issue 3
applications can i watch

661
00:41:29,480 --> 00:41:33,430
make sure they stay that way attack so
these are the kind of things that we are

662
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:34,900
going and doing hope and doing

663
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:39,620
to protect anarchy keep it safe actions
come out occasions that I did today

664
00:41:39,620 --> 00:41:42,910
nap so these are

665
00:41:42,910 --> 00:41:46,360
some serious issues how many mice are
gonna have to

666
00:41:46,360 --> 00:41:49,990
be concerned about this up how prevalent
is this going to be

667
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:53,550
Gardner sees it as one to 10 critical IT
trends

668
00:41:53,550 --> 00:41:56,670
for the next five years at five years I
can use five years

669
00:41:56,670 --> 00:42:01,500
so that connects look at this message is
having a really big impact ironic seeing

670
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:02,340
us moving toward

671
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:05,760
major networking vendors see it as
something that's key part of their

672
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:06,400
strategy

673
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:10,560
so much so that they're investing their
money in it netanya how much today

674
00:42:10,560 --> 00:42:13,720
believe that it's going to be there

675
00:42:13,720 --> 00:42:16,450
how about the people who actually asking
for is packed right

676
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:19,880
comes can iraq we find he surveys

677
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:23,220
sixty percent health estan be part of
the network

678
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:26,890
within five years forty-three percent
already have plans

679
00:42:26,890 --> 00:42:30,850
to put it into production tourist visa
issue that we're all gonna have to be

680
00:42:30,850 --> 00:42:31,390
worried about

681
00:42:31,390 --> 00:42:35,460
up we're all gonna have to hassle for
concern regarding this make sure that we

682
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:35,920
do not

683
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:39,400
fall on preethi since the torch exploits

684
00:42:39,400 --> 00:42:42,900
man now any

685
00:42:42,900 --> 00:42:46,070
are gonna have to her about it we have
to worry about it now

686
00:42:46,070 --> 00:42:50,300
and I it actually already here data
centers and cloud are considered the

687
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:52,550
killer appetite for most the moment is
right now

688
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:56,650
you can express tale investments
dameWare big in Essbase

689
00:42:56,650 --> 00:43:00,550
but it also moving toward Lanza in a
lawn caltech

690
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:03,850
Saturn an course the lawn cool

691
00:43:03,850 --> 00:43:07,730
NTT and AT&T and thank the

692
00:43:07,730 --> 00:43:11,110
google has an operating line are the
backbones

693
00:43:11,110 --> 00:43:14,120
national patent tied deeply invested in
it now

694
00:43:14,120 --> 00:43:17,900
it's coming it's here testing are going
to have to be concerned about

695
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:22,480
and line too concerned you wanna be
checking I'm not only these controllers

696
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:24,530
they are all controllers that we have

697
00:43:24,530 --> 00:43:29,480
a plan to put in place or have in place
now because it could go very right

698
00:43:29,480 --> 00:43:33,390
and independence hey who here actually
clean their banner

699
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:36,410
thank anyway and picking out yes

700
00:43:36,410 --> 00:43:39,810
I'm not only vendor independent
ultimately

701
00:43:39,810 --> 00:43:43,770
lower-cost York's the National Park
Asian an act

702
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:48,550
and you know go around run fast
evolution and the network you get

703
00:43:48,550 --> 00:43:50,780
production scale simulation and
computation

704
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:54,160
can try out right now how it's gonna
work and you can even

705
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:58,370
I know you can do is be at practical
reason but you wanna change network

706
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:01,460
after deciding on a proper configuration
you cash in exchange

707
00:44:01,460 --> 00:44:05,940
either you can actually move aspects and
the network around next time

708
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:11,210
never controversial nation another talk
by ok action movie Democrat Ron Ely

709
00:44:11,210 --> 00:44:14,950
and then you can gain truly dynamic
inactive defenses

710
00:44:14,950 --> 00:44:18,650
where you can actually begin to have
been heard defend itself from these are

711
00:44:18,650 --> 00:44:20,230
really great things that you can do

712
00:44:20,230 --> 00:44:24,450
suffered from Hurricane so it's
important now we do it right

713
00:44:24,450 --> 00:44:28,440
but as it can go on there right he could
also go very wrong

714
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:32,440
am town service peering out

715
00:44:32,440 --> 00:44:36,549
wanna have our own gang up know what I
don't paint on tile from like that Ryan

716
00:44:36,549 --> 00:44:41,109
gang up on that one in a note how bout
an external node

717
00:44:41,109 --> 00:44:44,719
harsh want our network slamming against
the Nine Network

718
00:44:44,719 --> 00:44:48,339
a single host right next but now it's
not my place

719
00:44:48,339 --> 00:44:52,009
and of course the inverse which is
likely drop in traffic

720
00:44:52,009 --> 00:44:56,459
an important message this disappears
transaction

721
00:44:56,459 --> 00:44:59,719
goes away and let's talk about some
manipulation

722
00:44:59,719 --> 00:45:03,489
speaking at mandel man no internet work

723
00:45:03,489 --> 00:45:07,229
local subnet in a bid to host you get
very uninjured there

724
00:45:07,229 --> 00:45:11,229
you can start modifying transactions you
know drop a couple zeros of a

725
00:45:11,229 --> 00:45:11,759
transaction

726
00:45:11,759 --> 00:45:16,319
at a couple zeros on transaction change
the word send a message love to hate

727
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:21,150
you know puedo office for two things and
niece who can scary things amy Ried

728
00:45:21,150 --> 00:45:22,789
about these novels and books in

729
00:45:22,789 --> 00:45:26,119
futurist talk about new Dark Knight it's
now clear networks

730
00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:29,640
Bradman's cat creaking things yeah we
don't want these things

731
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:33,640
and so while and make a difference
traditional means of securing

732
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:34,759
controllers

733
00:45:34,759 --> 00:45:38,809
still apply and security needs to be
part

734
00:45:38,809 --> 00:45:42,589
our discussion to now it's really been
about how estan

735
00:45:42,589 --> 00:45:46,969
can help security and by and we need to
tell looking at escape national

736
00:45:46,969 --> 00:45:50,349
people ninety how secure is STN for

737
00:45:50,349 --> 00:45:53,809
the Cisco and they call it magic happen
now

738
00:45:53,809 --> 00:45:58,239
now sitting down but by outsiders and
for the most part now is in our tree

739
00:45:58,239 --> 00:45:58,660
national

740
00:45:58,660 --> 00:46:02,349
I think this is probably going to talk I
never seen the talks but this from the

741
00:46:02,349 --> 00:46:03,549
beginning and looking at

742
00:46:03,549 --> 00:46:08,119
I'll totality on the issues involved we
need to looking at more

743
00:46:08,119 --> 00:46:11,759
more this way and some in speaking at

744
00:46:11,759 --> 00:46:17,199
you talk about Caden you know that sir
suffered minor King being a recovery

745
00:46:17,199 --> 00:46:20,479
system to an extra training is a magnet
to cent at the end this

746
00:46:20,479 --> 00:46:23,910
is that any to secure a reference an eye
candy

747
00:46:23,910 --> 00:46:26,920
just like just an operating system issue

748
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,430
have the same place you need to make
sure that whatever changes

749
00:46:29,430 --> 00:46:32,950
is I'm a time are authorized they have
the rights to do this there's a

750
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:33,770
reference going on

751
00:46:33,770 --> 00:46:38,160
and then I came and I need to figure out
who made a change mean a change so this

752
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:39,069
is something

753
00:46:39,069 --> 00:46:43,250
that will be important going forward and
how thoughts on this

754
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:47,849
St and has a potential attorney entire
internet in the cloud

755
00:46:47,849 --> 00:46:51,240
and slicing everything up benefit would
be or some attitude about

756
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:55,329
above what we're seeing now but there's
a hole in the middle on it and dad can

757
00:46:55,329 --> 00:46:56,220
easily be shown

758
00:46:56,220 --> 00:47:00,290
I know the NSA is the bad guy today our
China question like bang on China

759
00:47:00,290 --> 00:47:04,119
but all nation's debt and everyone is
playing around even is

760
00:47:04,119 --> 00:47:08,589
conscious as small as Thailand they're
considering cyber operations

761
00:47:08,589 --> 00:47:12,050
and we do not want them involved in our
networks

762
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:15,940
mentally naked now get on it for two
