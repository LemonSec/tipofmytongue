8
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:29,250
I we're gonna talk a little bit about
the the current state

9
00:00:29,250 --> 00:00:33,180
about the arms race between cheaters any
the anti cheat software

10
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:37,270
thats I designed to prevent it I'll
we're gonna talk a little bit about

11
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:40,989
where we see the the future of cheating
going I

12
00:00:40,989 --> 00:00:45,059
from there or actual gonna talk about
some upon abilities that we found

13
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:48,590
in anti cheat software on and finally
we're gonna

14
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:51,910
talk about some potential solutions to
these problems and how to

15
00:00:51,910 --> 00:00:55,129
maybe prevent them going forward I

16
00:00:55,129 --> 00:00:58,320
art the first I let's talk a little bit
about

17
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,890
on money so as the gaming industry has
developed its turned into a a multibody

18
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,129
billion dollar industry

19
00:01:05,129 --> 00:01:08,770
over the past few decades a developers
in the space

20
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:12,880
make our money and in several different
ways a one of the most popular being

21
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,869
how the monthly subscription model that
you see in some other the massively

22
00:01:15,869 --> 00:01:17,259
multiplayer online games

23
00:01:17,259 --> 00:01:21,680
on in addition to this we actually have
professional gamers

24
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,790
that are making a considerable amount of
money now

25
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:27,820
of through international tournaments
throughout

26
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,229
streaming on sites like YouTube and
twitch I N

27
00:01:31,229 --> 00:01:35,049
at the that's generally through through
advertisement and corporate sponsorship

28
00:01:35,049 --> 00:01:38,720
are finally in in some of these games
have actually seen a rise

29
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,899
a kinda grey market where virtual items
currency account anything

30
00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:47,460
I can be sold for for real world money
on

31
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,979
this is actually become a pretty
profitable space and some of the more

32
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:51,869
popular games

33
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:56,909
I'll art so that's really up you know
what a big reasons why some other stuff

34
00:01:56,909 --> 00:02:00,930
actually matters but let's take a look
at our house cheating has is going to

35
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:01,479
affect it

36
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:05,149
its first I just heard through get some
common ground

37
00:02:05,149 --> 00:02:08,890
how what we define as cheating so I we
generally think this

38
00:02:08,890 --> 00:02:12,690
as you know somehow gaining an unfair
advantage against the other players in

39
00:02:12,690 --> 00:02:13,230
the game

40
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:16,310
on this can take a few a few different
forms I'll

41
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:19,840
the first one here also be abusing our
game logic

42
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,049
in in one way or another of for instance
you could use are multiple accounts to

43
00:02:24,049 --> 00:02:26,549
play the game at the same time to get
the advantage that way

44
00:02:26,549 --> 00:02:31,420
I you can actually create box or scripts
that will automate some other more

45
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:35,140
repetitive parts in a game are or you
can actually take advantage if somebody

46
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:36,480
Xtra clients: I data

47
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,139
that is that is president and some I
different genres such as first-person

48
00:02:40,139 --> 00:02:40,780
shooters

49
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:44,939
I it's also possible to to find bugs or
glitches

50
00:02:44,939 --> 00:02:48,900
in the system I'd actually let you know
it's like the client-server maybe other

51
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:49,480
players

52
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:53,569
but for the purposes of this %ah really
focusing on on the first category here

53
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:56,669
on its ok so they've using about game
logic

54
00:02:56,669 --> 00:03:01,139
right %uh so I'll but a brief history of
cheating

55
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:04,669
I in in early single-player computer
games I

56
00:03:04,669 --> 00:03:07,569
cheating you know simple as that
actually patching the the coder the

57
00:03:07,569 --> 00:03:08,120
source

58
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,849
are the application I and it's actually
pretty somewhere with modern games

59
00:03:11,849 --> 00:03:13,280
because I mean at the end of the day

60
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,790
who really cares if you cheat the single
player game right I loved about

61
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,349
developers have actually

62
00:03:18,349 --> 00:03:22,479
are treated cheat codes in their games
that basically allows a player to

63
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:25,629
to go ahead and cheat you know at their
own discretion %uh

64
00:03:25,629 --> 00:03:29,269
as as multi-player games began to emerge
however are cheating

65
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:32,870
really became a large issue I but as as
time has gone on

66
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:35,930
they've actually learn to cope to the
point where

67
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:40,409
i watch either still exist there they
released on not as rampant as they were

68
00:03:40,409 --> 00:03:43,669
you know about a decade or two ago up

69
00:03:43,669 --> 00:03:46,370
as we're talking about that the money
aspect of things you know this cheating

70
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:48,760
can actually have real consequences in
these games

71
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,750
I do to get to the large amount of money
involved a successful cheek and

72
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,299
actually be sold to different players I
and can also

73
00:03:56,299 --> 00:03:59,829
impacted the gamers that are making a
month are living

74
00:03:59,829 --> 00:04:03,650
of a you know playing the game at the
professional level on

75
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:06,790
it's also when we talk a little bit
about some some real-world examples

76
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:11,849
I so what are the most common or popular
ways to cheat in different games are I

77
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:14,479
we consider speeder movement tax and so
these are

78
00:04:14,479 --> 00:04:19,130
I be sort broadly defined as moving
outside how the game

79
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:22,219
I intend you to so this could be moving
faster than normal

80
00:04:22,219 --> 00:04:25,219
I could be teleporting around may be
flying through the sky

81
00:04:25,219 --> 00:04:26,450
I can take a lot of

82
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:30,690
in forms in different genres of games I
N in other games we see

83
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:33,700
what we guide guess probably cost
scripting hear that

84
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:38,719
are you can use to II guest script
specific actions in the game so that you

85
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:41,180
can actually play it at a higher skill
level than you might

86
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:45,520
I normally be able to so so cut
combining several actions at one so that

87
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,210
you have to play

88
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:51,320
Press won t for instance I also we
actually from from the beginning we've

89
00:04:51,320 --> 00:04:54,030
seen a big problem with botting so in a
lot of these games you

90
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:57,200
can actually I collect

91
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:00,200
our resources a currency through some
some really repetitive

92
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,490
I always and box allow you to automate
that process

93
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:07,190
you can leave the running for hours at a
time and they was king like that for you

94
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:11,010
a oh man that's kinda dark but

95
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:14,190
I something you might recognize that
game so so a Botar

96
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:18,020
might for instance a travel around a map
and

97
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,820
go to these different corresponds to to
gather or

98
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:25,370
notice do that for hours on end are
collect as much as they can then they're

99
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,410
going to sell that for the in game
currency

100
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:31,520
and that in turn can actually be sold
through those are virtual grain markets

101
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,120
and turn it into real-world money

102
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:36,560
also definitely you know a big issue
undermines the

103
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:39,990
at players that actually wanna play the
game I

104
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,890
from there we also have a player or item
finding hacks that are

105
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:48,990
I think most common in some first-person
shooter so on the next one we have here

106
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:52,720
is a a survival horror game and this one
I

107
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,530
if you if you die in this game its
permanent death items are very hard to

108
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,890
come by you're constantly trying to stay
alive

109
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:03,270
and this this hack actually will are
find all the items that

110
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:07,560
I have been a sent to your client so
your client has the date on where these

111
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:08,020
are

112
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:11,440
and this just highlights them see you
know exactly where they are it's not

113
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:12,870
pictured in in in here but

114
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:16,880
it actually works for for other players
as well and so I can use that I don't

115
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,370
sneak up on other people and

116
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:22,380
you note element take their stuff it

117
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,680
in addition this we also have some
things I like wall hacks or

118
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,260
X three months and he's I let you

119
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:33,890
and some I guess see-through to rein in
general as a way to

120
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,920
describe it so it's it's kinda similar
to the one we were just talking about

121
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,740
I but your for example

122
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:42,039
the if some love you are familiar with
with Minecraft

123
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:45,090
are this is what the game typically
looks like so we've got

124
00:06:45,090 --> 00:06:48,810
player in a cave here there's they're
stoners or

125
00:06:48,810 --> 00:06:53,410
you know all that great and good I but
once you install one of these extracts

126
00:06:53,410 --> 00:06:56,720
I we've got a player here on the surface
and they've just wiped away everything

127
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,250
that's not interesting to them so in
this case you know maybe they want an

128
00:06:59,250 --> 00:07:00,300
overall though or is

129
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,090
I in some different mode you know maybe
they're trying to find just the blonde

130
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,620
other players to rate their bases or
something like that

131
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:10,400
all this information is being sent to
the client and so we can

132
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:14,349
you know leverage in as at our
discretion right right

133
00:07:14,349 --> 00:07:17,460
up over the years on to help combat

134
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,550
against the people treating these games
we've actually seen the rise in a lot of

135
00:07:20,550 --> 00:07:22,110
different anti-cheat sweet so

136
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:25,960
I wanted the the more popular ones with
the the blizzard series game so I think

137
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,909
it started with World of Warcraft but
it's it's I think in most of their games

138
00:07:28,909 --> 00:07:29,569
now

139
00:07:29,569 --> 00:07:32,880
called the warden I built in 2004

140
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,770
on the and several other South series
games we have %uh the valve anti-cheat

141
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:41,250
or back and that's in used in %uh
franciscan the counter strike series

142
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:46,620
Team Fortress 2 among others I would
actually see some completely third-party

143
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:51,349
anti cheat engine so for instance battle
I is one of the ones that I can

144
00:07:51,349 --> 00:07:55,139
the integrated with whatever game you
want but I think its most are commonly

145
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:56,320
known for I

146
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:00,130
the the arm a series and the day Z mod
for that and

147
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:03,949
the stand alone now and he's all have
some some similar

148
00:08:03,949 --> 00:08:07,840
I qualities so one day they all tender
to run

149
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,090
in New Zealand so there's not a colonel
I component in there though some of the

150
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:12,710
attitudes

151
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:17,380
do do leverage things in kernel space
they tend to be very active so

152
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:21,780
are to find out about a cheat bill I you
to figure out how to detect it and then

153
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,199
they'll push that detected detection
mechanism

154
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:28,949
out to their clients quite get detected
they get bent they're also all really

155
00:08:28,949 --> 00:08:29,449
only

156
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:32,510
you know meant to be a medication they
they want to stop as many cheaters as

157
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:33,140
possible

158
00:08:33,140 --> 00:08:36,969
by comprehensively stopping them is is
not really are something that they

159
00:08:36,969 --> 00:08:37,550
consider

160
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:41,599
you know possible and in this model
right up

161
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:46,079
so gonna talk a little bit about where
the the current state cheating in Ganges

162
00:08:46,079 --> 00:08:46,529
and

163
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:49,589
I'm actually gonna pass it over to
attorney go here to talk about

164
00:08:49,589 --> 00:08:54,029
can can you hear me OK helpful so
another josho knew what the

165
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:56,950
the cheats currently look like we're
going to take a look at how they

166
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:57,940
actually implemented

167
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,170
and then we'll look into how and H its
cash them

168
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:05,720
and then will taken just one step
further and look at how we can

169
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:09,209
you know prevent a cheese from figuring
out that to police shooting

170
00:09:09,209 --> 00:09:12,560
so arm the cheese usually up

171
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:15,420
you know the following two or three
categories are you have the internal

172
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,360
cheats the Excel sheets and the

173
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,769
network once so are the most common one
is probably our the 111 direction

174
00:09:21,769 --> 00:09:25,889
so intriguing as a familial injection
windows it's their usual or you know I'm

175
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:28,430
up some memory create remote red load
the DLL

176
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:32,070
and everything so this she's coming to
party have a loader and the cheat itself

177
00:09:32,070 --> 00:09:34,000
the cheese logic is implemented in the
DL

178
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,199
so are you know daughter

179
00:09:37,199 --> 00:09:41,949
loads third GDL into the game and then
of course you know that she larger than

180
00:09:41,949 --> 00:09:44,180
has full access for Ian right to the
entire

181
00:09:44,180 --> 00:09:47,870
you know game after space so pretty much
anything goes arm

182
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:51,250
in order to display are usually Michael
menu

183
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:54,310
how all these you know a cheat actually
have a menu so you can select what you

184
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:54,820
want to do

185
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:58,839
arm a a year the hooker directed did
direct recalls

186
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:02,070
and I

187
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:06,070
that's pretty much it really arm so I'll
another thing is the network back in

188
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:07,540
many places and so these ones

189
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:12,010
arm actually you're a little less common
arm one thing that they do for insist

190
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,510
they can introduce artificial leg

191
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:16,510
so if you're playing an FPS in all
things just for you really quick

192
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:19,990
I so if the cheat delays

193
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:23,589
or you know blocks were just drop the
packet that sense new position from the

194
00:10:23,589 --> 00:10:26,180
client the client is legitimately trying
to send to the server

195
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:29,760
then all the sudden into your open and
see your car to looks like it's

196
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:30,430
teleporting

197
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,769
if is displaying at all arm I repeat
back its

198
00:10:33,769 --> 00:10:36,870
so you have a packet let's say I me know
depending on the integrity level

199
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:40,050
identically checking that's done at the
server level you know these Menomonie be

200
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:44,089
might or might not be possible out but
are let's say that there is a

201
00:10:44,089 --> 00:10:48,130
Tom I don't know damage back at your
signing in Oak Park 10 damage to what

202
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:48,680
every player

203
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,279
are you repeat the packet you get in a
lot of damage are or directly modify the

204
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,990
back is directly and change whatever you
can

205
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:58,780
I'm finally there's external cheating
Tom

206
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:03,260
it is believed that it shall sheets a I
have been developed in an attempt to

207
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:04,100
hide from

208
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:07,960
early and I cheats because well as the
name suggests

209
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:11,840
they're not i doing they're not you know
in process they're not in the game

210
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,590
process it's likely a separate process

211
00:11:13,590 --> 00:11:18,550
arm and so they access the game memory
by using our reprocess memory right

212
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,870
process memory which is an

213
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:23,180
hands up you know generating a system
called Windows which is likely terrible

214
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:24,010
for performance

215
00:11:24,010 --> 00:11:27,150
but a man its we're assuming that at
some point

216
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:30,810
it was able to go unnoticed by let me
know I do

217
00:11:30,810 --> 00:11:34,410
and a cheater the time are now not so
much as we'll see in the next light

218
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:38,060
on and in order to to renders thanks to
their to the player

219
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:41,970
they usually create a transparent window
on top of the game window

220
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:46,030
so that you can see up remember the law
ESP like extrasensory

221
00:11:46,030 --> 00:11:49,960
extra sensorial perception in a row for
the %uh the sure that we're sharing

222
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,110
trying you guys tho

223
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,280
now they do that be I transparent window
and set up directly cooking the pri

224
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,560
Qatar directory called

225
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:59,250
has in the up a interruptions um

226
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:03,140
so that's that's pretty much it for the
%uh the cheating in games are the

227
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,710
consider the cheaters gently

228
00:12:04,710 --> 00:12:08,450
like Neil the gently flowing while these
three categories arm

229
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:11,880
so and I cheats mile what do they do so

230
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,290
a belly the kinda follow an antivirus
are I'll

231
00:12:15,290 --> 00:12:18,970
model sometimes are they they have
confidence they relate directly into the

232
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:19,670
game process

233
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:22,780
often they have service running a system
up

234
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:25,790
but essentially what they will do is arm

235
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:29,000
scan game process I and II you know

236
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,110
became process out first and foremost
and redefine

237
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:36,290
up in a known signatures for a cheats
against like an antivirus would

238
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:39,839
on and then they have some games
specific she checks for instance when

239
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:40,220
you have

240
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:44,030
up games amount of games are held like a
should like a little scripting engine

241
00:12:44,030 --> 00:12:47,260
within so they can scan for you notice
that are related up

242
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:50,860
I am who detection so now this gets a
lil bit interesting

243
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:54,800
arm because the current I'm arm race
between she tonight I cheat

244
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,920
is member like the internal cheats the
most common ones they hook

245
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:02,930
DirectX calls right so arm so let's say
that usually

246
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:06,160
do the way that the point jane looks
like is that you have no C plus plus

247
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,819
object and you have a member that is
also supplied by sergeant

248
00:13:08,819 --> 00:13:12,289
so on and so forth with the tables all
over the place so the way the Hooksett

249
00:13:12,289 --> 00:13:16,389
is a place where the tables and 2.2 the
table that will

250
00:13:16,389 --> 00:13:19,999
call their stuff so you look at the
server level and then

251
00:13:19,999 --> 00:13:23,379
I and that that she comes in and expects
the know this this

252
00:13:23,379 --> 00:13:26,749
this only table this pointer to be
modified and then they detected so then

253
00:13:26,749 --> 00:13:27,589
what are the cheats

254
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:30,929
me know do well they say okay a little
bit earlier a little bit later

255
00:13:30,929 --> 00:13:34,959
so that's colonel in the Army is going
on arm so what then touches do now is

256
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:36,759
actually pick up in ok I never

257
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:39,769
for a bus early as possible in the end
the game code and then they just

258
00:13:39,769 --> 00:13:43,739
in a parse the whole point to change try
to find I'll a modification

259
00:13:43,739 --> 00:13:47,439
it's similar to out the windows
mitigation known as as he hop

260
00:13:47,439 --> 00:13:51,589
a4a as structured exception handling to
get a few more about

261
00:13:51,589 --> 00:13:54,949
I am then also another one that's
interesting as a cost tax

262
00:13:54,949 --> 00:13:59,579
periodic checks so what this does is arm
so the yard anti-cheat

263
00:13:59,579 --> 00:14:02,579
out now anti-cheat wait for

264
00:14:02,579 --> 00:14:07,220
one other I game threads to be are
either sleeping or otherwise non-active

265
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:10,739
maybe got rammed him or not but will
basically go through the stack and try

266
00:14:10,739 --> 00:14:11,229
to find

267
00:14:11,229 --> 00:14:14,689
a militia stack well achieve stacker
known she'd stock so

268
00:14:14,689 --> 00:14:18,449
that's also something that's in pre
advanced compared to just you know

269
00:14:18,449 --> 00:14:23,769
blunt our signature checking um so must
be nice then there's like debug related

270
00:14:23,769 --> 00:14:27,239
actions right some trees have been known
to can have a high denmark's by

271
00:14:27,239 --> 00:14:32,269
I leveraging you know XTC renewing trip
3 like debug debug mechanisms things

272
00:14:32,269 --> 00:14:32,669
like a

273
00:14:32,669 --> 00:14:36,859
I'll so a to the actually these these
debug related actions our

274
00:14:36,859 --> 00:14:40,319
you know their purpose is two-fold one
is to prevent this kind of things into

275
00:14:40,319 --> 00:14:43,889
is to hinder the development of sheets
because if you have the game process

276
00:14:43,889 --> 00:14:46,239
running and you know you put a
breakpoint doesn't get hit

277
00:14:46,239 --> 00:14:49,249
you know its annoying are so that's %uh
something

278
00:14:49,249 --> 00:14:54,419
arm and I'll process well well actually
it's like other processes so that it

279
00:14:54,419 --> 00:14:55,100
already decked

280
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:59,209
external cheats out then they out this
can you know but all the process and try

281
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:00,220
to find interesting things

282
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:04,589
are same thing signature detection are
some will go as far as actually checking

283
00:15:04,589 --> 00:15:07,689
r Memory sections that are not matters
dll's I

284
00:15:07,689 --> 00:15:12,560
you know because that's how they hide um
I

285
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:15,800
all the things that may be scanning for
and other processes handles remember the

286
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:16,520
external sheet

287
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:20,649
out there calling reporters memory right
process memory all the time are two

288
00:15:20,649 --> 00:15:23,959
update you know whatever data structure
the interested in everything so

289
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:27,230
arm for that you to handle to the
process

290
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:30,920
so that's something that's got four are
that's the

291
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:34,350
that's it oh and a couple of things that
we're listing here this is not an

292
00:15:34,350 --> 00:15:37,870
exhaustive list on this lot of things
but this is Discover's in almost most of

293
00:15:37,870 --> 00:15:38,120
it

294
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,010
arm things that have been there kinda
controversial you privacy issues

295
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:45,520
Anton anti cheat will actually scan
files on your desk

296
00:15:45,520 --> 00:15:48,899
and are me know then they will senate
out to their servers for further

297
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:49,550
analysis

298
00:15:49,550 --> 00:15:53,980
I must've it's probably automated but
I'm sure at some point and probably

299
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:54,810
comes manual

300
00:15:54,810 --> 00:15:58,100
anyway up that's Cup pretty how

301
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:01,220
then no to get at this report she
donates yep so

302
00:16:01,220 --> 00:16:04,230
because there's like a coffin on race
between the cheating and that sheets

303
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:07,560
arm well and I cheats sellers

304
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:11,270
I'm sorry sheet sellers in a cheating
people just you know

305
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,709
make and sell sheets out because we have
to update their

306
00:16:14,709 --> 00:16:18,940
software and they do that I by using you
know update service

307
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:22,589
because 10 that shit gets affected then
they go and can't make a

308
00:16:22,589 --> 00:16:26,720
a new one so for that you know that that
she said you know I've picked up on that

309
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,890
and so they're saying OK let's check out
the gym let's check the DNS history to

310
00:16:29,890 --> 00:16:31,140
see the request has been made in

311
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:34,320
oh this is unknown should server man the
player

312
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:37,709
marci to data released on the player arm

313
00:16:37,709 --> 00:16:41,570
so that's it for the year for the
anti-cheat so as you've noticed

314
00:16:41,570 --> 00:16:45,120
are most of these techniques have no all
these techniques actually

315
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:50,420
magkano start with are the idea that the
anti-cheat has the ability to

316
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:53,800
open up any process see what's in there

317
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,029
are open up files and everything which

318
00:16:57,029 --> 00:17:00,660
actually a.m. such an assumption that
just

319
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:04,500
could not should not be made I when
you're using would complement and and

320
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,150
and the

321
00:17:05,150 --> 00:17:08,350
Dr the user actually as

322
00:17:08,350 --> 00:17:11,600
controllers machine so

323
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:15,620
arm what we're proposing is something
that would be a lot harder pick up for

324
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:16,329
anti-cheat

325
00:17:16,329 --> 00:17:19,439
which is a rootkit like functionality to
hide

326
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,640
achieved activity so how does this work
well

327
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:26,860
arm two parts a crown driver and using
one executable

328
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:30,429
I am running own cheap completing
colonel

329
00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:33,630
as possible I s just well

330
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:38,320
if not annoying it's probably up you
know well yes should be that be annoying

331
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,190
I mean it's doable

332
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:43,160
but so I there's no need for that so
basically the uninteresting

333
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:46,040
the the contractual Chi logical be
implemented using more just like a

334
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:46,710
regular cheap

335
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:50,390
and the driver will do a few things and
will provide a few services to the user

336
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:50,720
mode

337
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:54,240
portion of the cheat to arm to to hide
it completely

338
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:58,780
from idea I'll move the technique to
mention before

339
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:01,910
so account over what to do so the first
thing you'll do

340
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:05,140
as the it will make out the user mode
portion a protected process

341
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:08,910
protector processors are the ASX feature
in Windows that was introduced and

342
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:11,910
this tie believe an aura to help the RAM

343
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:15,200
enforcement I mean they're all the way
that you could how to process i mean or

344
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:16,260
rude gets 90

345
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:19,740
been doing that for decades right you
could remove are you and she keeps a

346
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:21,309
list of all the processors you could
just

347
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:25,350
remove it from the double in class she
could have call backstop are used by

348
00:18:25,350 --> 00:18:26,140
antivirus is

349
00:18:26,140 --> 00:18:29,520
but we figured you know this only takes
for being one bit on the process block

350
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:33,130
so that on at some point of so when that
way um so

351
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:36,290
put a bit and are also in the process
protected

352
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:40,360
so are even if you haven't actually
running a system and tries to open up

353
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:41,820
the process to get access denied

354
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:47,220
arm so now the interesting part of the
driver what it will do is that

355
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:50,700
the usual executable actually be right
it's not ideal

356
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,860
it's actually the cable so only on a
separate process so in order to access

357
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:59,420
the game memory in a covered way arm so
the driver will provide this

358
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:02,540
a mapping mechanism while we were
actually I

359
00:19:02,540 --> 00:19:05,850
you get a request from the user mode
portion of the cheap I will map

360
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:10,460
directly page frames of manual Mac lol
Matt memory from the game process

361
00:19:10,460 --> 00:19:13,590
into the Chi process the drive a
boarded-up

362
00:19:13,590 --> 00:19:17,460
arm and so I'll another thing that would
do

363
00:19:17,460 --> 00:19:22,010
is the actually haven't actually merged
and but essentially to prevent Dr

364
00:19:22,010 --> 00:19:26,930
you know having a I'll Felber basically
that a cheap in a pickup of my hard

365
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:27,960
drive and is it you could

366
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:32,390
and send it to a server you could I just
install a filter driver that we have

367
00:19:32,390 --> 00:19:35,700
I will put am a filter device on the
filesystem stock

368
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:39,690
and returned from found when its gonna
request to examine how to need

369
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:42,920
to implement a I'll but its itself that
sir

370
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:47,070
Barca through the work I guess arm so
the usual executable

371
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:51,420
like I said before implement such logic
and I keep track of the game cheat

372
00:19:51,420 --> 00:19:51,890
mappings

373
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:55,240
right this is actually not complete
necessary but

374
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,460
it's just a performance improvement
because a once the

375
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:02,300
memory is mapped into the Chi process
you don't have to there's no need to

376
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:05,210
call the driver again stirring up this
memory remember this memory makers every

377
00:20:05,210 --> 00:20:06,950
time it's a simple so for performance

378
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:10,710
up you just keep track of it you can
just implement a logic in user mode as

379
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:11,150
we have

380
00:20:11,150 --> 00:20:15,490
so here's the way looks so this is how
you're a

381
00:20:15,490 --> 00:20:19,400
for this is how you know when you keep
using the heating the game are

382
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,900
and basically this memory I O X 42,000

383
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:26,810
much she gets can read I'll so this is
like game data that led to the cheese

384
00:20:26,810 --> 00:20:27,670
interesting right

385
00:20:27,670 --> 00:20:31,960
so when the CPU is running are the page
tables are there obstructed this is not

386
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:35,280
what page double look like but up this
basically show that day provide the

387
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:37,510
translation between virtual memory and
physical memory

388
00:20:37,510 --> 00:20:42,640
so you see that won the game is trying
to access this virtual memory up there

389
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,970
then the MM you will do the translation
based on the page tables before

390
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:50,710
the the read or write requests and on
the bus and

391
00:20:50,710 --> 00:20:53,720
it will actually map to let's say a bed
frame FTF

392
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,950
right so what will happen once the cheat

393
00:20:56,950 --> 00:21:00,920
according to the driver is this so

394
00:21:00,920 --> 00:21:05,170
majid virtual memory will be mapping to
the exact same

395
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:08,230
physical memory so this is complete
transparent

396
00:21:08,230 --> 00:21:11,320
a it will be very fast because the
hardest work

397
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:12,970
so basically it's accessing

398
00:21:12,970 --> 00:21:16,980
de memory as if you were arm if you were
tom

399
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:20,169
so 3.fast and a pre-concert

400
00:21:20,169 --> 00:21:25,370
so how the stocks or she goes the up
brief code snippet not gonna bore you

401
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:26,950
with that too much but the idea is out

402
00:21:26,950 --> 00:21:31,820
arm these APIs are documented and their
public

403
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,370
so there's nothing maybe there's nothing
like to crazy here out the first thing

404
00:21:35,370 --> 00:21:39,260
the first thing they almost the first
line PS look up process by process ID

405
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:42,480
so I this will basically fine are the
game process

406
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,990
I'll the second thing is a look at Andy
up to an MDL

407
00:21:46,990 --> 00:21:50,450
if you getting up tomorrow this is this
partially opaque out structure

408
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:54,720
a you can find a full description and as
the end what it does is it basically is

409
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:55,350
a on

410
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:59,070
think about it a little bit Rams its it
describes

411
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:02,179
like a range of physical memory thats
essentially what it is

412
00:22:02,179 --> 00:22:05,659
so now the interesting system cause I
mean and not the same cause when Colonel

413
00:22:05,659 --> 00:22:07,010
here this is what running driver

414
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:11,320
the interesting calls here RK stack
attach process because the what this

415
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:11,929
will do

416
00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:15,159
it will actually grab your spread so
we're talking about the driver thread

417
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:15,669
you know that

418
00:22:15,669 --> 00:22:19,190
handling the outdoor fan from the from
the from the Chi client

419
00:22:19,190 --> 00:22:23,169
I am any will jump this thread into the
address space

420
00:22:23,169 --> 00:22:26,880
of the above the love the game and so

421
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:29,950
once once this a success succeeded

422
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:34,590
then the mm for memory management
initialize MDL

423
00:22:34,590 --> 00:22:39,490
will I take a spry matter you'll see the
base address the second parameter is the

424
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:39,809
actual

425
00:22:39,809 --> 00:22:42,890
virtual address in the game that we're
interested they will

426
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:46,950
it will basically feel the MDL way if
the page frames doubt

427
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:50,900
are actually met their remember the the
FDF that thats identifies this

428
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:54,400
then when you call Katie and stacked the
Dutch process

429
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,990
when you come back into the cheap
process and then you call

430
00:22:57,990 --> 00:23:01,640
on mm not block-based this I cash which
will map and then you get

431
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,529
up basically that arm

432
00:23:05,529 --> 00:23:09,159
so and then basically unlike the pages
are free some memory and do some

433
00:23:09,159 --> 00:23:11,299
reference counting so the driver doesn't
you know

434
00:23:11,299 --> 00:23:15,059
blue screen on you and you're good to go
out that's now your memory

435
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:18,610
to have a little demo %ah only briefly

436
00:23:18,610 --> 00:23:21,610
at to demonstrate this and hopefully it
works

437
00:23:21,610 --> 00:23:25,950
so we're going to we're going to map
memory

438
00:23:25,950 --> 00:23:29,340
of this awesome game called not that
notepad um so

439
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:32,820
this is not the right here i cant was my
mouse

440
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,889
okay so this is not a year and

441
00:23:35,889 --> 00:23:42,889
on yeah

442
00:23:48,889 --> 00:23:52,340
are PC here so

443
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:56,870
um can really see

444
00:23:56,870 --> 00:24:00,490
can yes tell me when I hit not bad not
demo isn't it

445
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:04,090
okay thank you is a handles I can see
alright

446
00:24:04,090 --> 00:24:10,029
so he can see this no handle and there's
no handle to

447
00:24:10,029 --> 00:24:13,029
to the note that process and then when
you type here

448
00:24:13,029 --> 00:24:18,200
hello then

449
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:21,649
it shows up down there without anything
like so basically the memories will not

450
00:24:21,649 --> 00:24:22,950
and you can see it here

451
00:24:22,950 --> 00:24:25,950
and just to show that you can also write
to it

452
00:24:25,950 --> 00:24:29,889
I am posing in Matt me see

453
00:24:29,889 --> 00:24:33,830
your tell me there's a table

454
00:24:33,830 --> 00:24:40,830
are and used yes it does

455
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,250
books okay so you can also lead to the
memory

456
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:49,010
and you know from under the game speed
and he won't notice a difference

457
00:24:49,010 --> 00:24:52,110
I'll just tolerated complete so

458
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:58,190
ok thank you arm

459
00:24:58,190 --> 00:25:02,549
so that's the oh yeah and I got a ghetto
the VM

460
00:25:02,549 --> 00:25:06,530
okay

461
00:25:06,530 --> 00:25:09,960
so it's done so pros and cons

462
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,740
so the strength of this method is at its
complete genetic right you can do it to

463
00:25:13,740 --> 00:25:15,080
any game because it provides

464
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:18,090
you know unlimited access to the game in
a complete covered way

465
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:22,410
to the memory read/write it's fast so
you can apply to just anything

466
00:25:22,410 --> 00:25:25,790
i any type of game it will not matter is
not specific on

467
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:29,070
it you're trying to take people from
user mode I

468
00:25:29,070 --> 00:25:32,210
you guys can imagine just you know how
process tuck into a driver this process

469
00:25:32,210 --> 00:25:34,210
protected the file you cannot access

470
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:37,360
not gonna happen I mean and I cheats are
going to have a hard time

471
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:40,500
arm so one thing about this method is

472
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:44,320
you know interesting is that there's
actually a bunch of publicly available

473
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:48,730
up cheap sources on like the problem
with these public sources

474
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:52,640
obviously their public so anti cheat
snow of them and they can detect them

475
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:56,330
so arm with this we can do is simply

476
00:25:56,330 --> 00:26:01,210
grab a public source modify the course
to let an external cheat modify the

477
00:26:01,210 --> 00:26:01,590
source

478
00:26:01,590 --> 00:26:05,960
true to change are from using reprocess
memory right process member you change

479
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:08,010
them by calling the driver applying
whatever

480
00:26:08,010 --> 00:26:11,820
a member little memory management you
have going in your remote and

481
00:26:11,820 --> 00:26:15,490
that's what you can and detectable cheat
complex Priya

482
00:26:15,490 --> 00:26:20,000
and as I mentioned before it got pretty
good performance because simply there's

483
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:22,950
there's nothing I mean there's no
personal system call this there's

484
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:23,590
nothing to do

485
00:26:23,590 --> 00:26:27,030
let's remember have fun arm two
witnesses well

486
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:30,350
um it in car mod so it is a strong or as
weak

487
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:34,000
as anything else running internal I'm so
if you have a cheap an anti-cheat

488
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,290
that makes its way to to colonel then
out you have a problem

489
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:42,080
arm now as what email anti-virus is
until the mission got locked down with

490
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:42,650
farm

491
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:45,960
various McCann isms are colonel mode

492
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:50,809
battles usually end up with the winner
being clever loads first

493
00:26:50,809 --> 00:26:55,190
so but at least you know at least
another shot at it

494
00:26:55,190 --> 00:26:59,260
arm another think that would be a a
minor inconvenience will be there

495
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:01,929
of course you have to run in debug mode
or you have to get your driver side

496
00:27:01,929 --> 00:27:02,610
which is actually

497
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:06,270
not a big deal but arm it's not us
easiest

498
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:10,030
snow just running some executable um

499
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:13,090
okay so home

500
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:16,690
so this is it for the %uh the Ching
framework arm now

501
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:20,429
out we are going to take it just a
one-step which me know me on that and

502
00:27:20,429 --> 00:27:23,040
we're going to i mean we're going to
show you guessed that we

503
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:27,690
actually attacked the anti cheat
software itself arm so anti cheat labor

504
00:27:27,690 --> 00:27:29,040
is actually very interesting because

505
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:33,340
they provide an inch abandoned initial
attack surface that the interesting

506
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:35,919
thing about this attacks her face that
it's going to be running on the client

507
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,350
gonna be running on the server as gonna
be running across multiple games

508
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:42,580
so if our expert developer business-wise

509
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:45,730
this looks like a good target because if
you if she Papa home n/a

510
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:50,169
and a game men you can just attacked a
game if you have a vulnerability

511
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:54,640
in a on and then she'd software you can
use across a bunch of games

512
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,650
so you just have you know immediately a
broader audience

513
00:27:57,650 --> 00:28:00,760
arm so what happens when there's a
problem well

514
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:03,919
let's take a look at but ally so but
ally is

515
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,510
some has a written discover before an
anti-cheat the way it works is that

516
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:12,570
you have battle a global for out that is
used to keep track of bounds and things

517
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,000
like that

518
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,169
and then you have and then you have

519
00:28:16,169 --> 00:28:19,309
are you know to a server DLL that's
running in the game server

520
00:28:19,309 --> 00:28:23,809
and then you have a client DLL that's
running again client so far it's

521
00:28:23,809 --> 00:28:24,580
expected right

522
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:27,890
I now one thing interesting about it is
that actually hooks

523
00:28:27,890 --> 00:28:31,570
I who do with the way they communicate
is a piggyback on the already

524
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:32,480
established

525
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:35,559
communication between the game client in
the game server are

526
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:39,500
which is usually DP and so they hook

527
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:43,340
a receiver or receive from you know type
of Qom and then they basically parse the

528
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:45,190
back is to figure out whether they're
intended

529
00:28:45,190 --> 00:28:48,190
for the game itself or the internet for
the battle I a

530
00:28:48,190 --> 00:28:51,450
logic arm

531
00:28:51,450 --> 00:28:54,509
so out the way they are differentially
the packets is

532
00:28:54,509 --> 00:28:58,070
a is based off the packet structure
right so the first

533
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:01,230
the first to bites are just billion E

534
00:29:01,230 --> 00:29:04,250
as a signature and then you have liquor
hash

535
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:07,659
and then a lense that is also
occasionally use as a code and then

536
00:29:07,659 --> 00:29:11,200
that's that's it for the meta-data and
the rest this basically day out for %uh

537
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,860
the server to process

538
00:29:12,860 --> 00:29:17,480
the electoral process so um here's the
first thing that we noticed

539
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:20,480
are also just one thing like specify
would not do like a fool

540
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:23,490
and test on this it's just as we were
researching you know cheats an

541
00:29:23,490 --> 00:29:24,120
anti-cheat

542
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:27,639
just we just happen to like look a lil
bit into how this works and we just

543
00:29:27,639 --> 00:29:29,830
noticed so this is not expensive
wouldn't do

544
00:29:29,830 --> 00:29:34,100
funding within do anything like guys
desert just a couple bucks they're just

545
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:34,610
haven't

546
00:29:34,610 --> 00:29:38,029
arm so this

547
00:29:38,029 --> 00:29:42,129
this part is the actually the up it's
the

548
00:29:42,129 --> 00:29:45,879
out part up the packet parsing so the

549
00:29:45,879 --> 00:29:49,169
you see if you see in the first in the
first box the call to

550
00:29:49,169 --> 00:29:54,919
some 1001 by 4:30 exactly the hash check
so we actually had to reverse the house

551
00:29:54,919 --> 00:29:56,120
function to get

552
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,200
disco to except for packets arm

553
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:02,820
but if since we got it right then makes
it down to

554
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:06,620
the box to the left and then to the
other box with a laugh and then

555
00:30:06,620 --> 00:30:10,340
you'll see that yes I contains the head
of the packet a contestar the packet

556
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:13,700
and then you end up in the last box to
the left

557
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:17,370
all the way down here arm I think maybe
cut a little bit but hopefully guys can

558
00:30:17,370 --> 00:30:17,870
see it

559
00:30:17,870 --> 00:30:21,539
as you can see it then you'll notice
that there is a move Essex instruction

560
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:25,889
the the problem with this is dot up
while there's an error in the code where

561
00:30:25,889 --> 00:30:26,419
this is

562
00:30:26,419 --> 00:30:29,559
this Carter is assigned value and

563
00:30:29,559 --> 00:30:33,080
Owen now when they do the compares and
they basically to a movie Essex which

564
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,350
will sign extend it

565
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:38,259
all the way into the three to be
register your site so the magic value

566
00:30:38,259 --> 00:30:39,360
here is at seeing

567
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:44,490
which last bit signed a set but then you
end up with ffffff Etsy

568
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:48,159
which is if you look at as an answer and
I it's a really big number if you look

569
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:49,200
at assign value

570
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,340
it's just a negative number small
negative number the problem then is a JG

571
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:56,360
jage is a sign compares so they're
trying to do here

572
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:59,240
they're trying to do an upper bound
check except the trying to do an upper

573
00:30:59,240 --> 00:30:59,950
bound check

574
00:30:59,950 --> 00:31:02,520
on a sign value so R

575
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:05,870
big unsigned value which happens to be a
small negative value if you look at as

576
00:31:05,870 --> 00:31:06,310
an on

577
00:31:06,310 --> 00:31:10,790
as assigned which is what they're doing
you'll pass a check so

578
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:15,430
arm pass a check and then you end up a
couple function calls later

579
00:31:15,430 --> 00:31:18,500
down here so are bogus value are bogus

580
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:21,750
ffffff see value and up in a

581
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:24,850
in EDI so ideo plus for you end up with
zero

582
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:28,330
and then you call this a plus plus new
operator which interns will call

583
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:31,460
malloc Kamala 0 you get a really small
location

584
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:35,640
on Chevrolet small occasion then well
which succeeds

585
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:39,040
man you make your way to are to our

586
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:43,150
to the left fracture the Sony box there
is which make your way to the other box

587
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:46,360
and some and then the add

588
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,620
to are zero value which were stored in a
BP plus four

589
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:52,670
you can see it's the third line the top
box so then they pick it up again

590
00:31:52,670 --> 00:31:56,310
which is interesting to comply would do
that but whatever so you end up with EDP

591
00:31:56,310 --> 00:31:57,030
plus four

592
00:31:57,030 --> 00:32:00,320
we and in dcx and then this the

593
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,860
removed 7 and the problem is you end up
with at seven you end up with

594
00:32:03,860 --> 00:32:07,930
again a really big value ffffff you know
-6

595
00:32:07,930 --> 00:32:11,850
um and then that's what they used to do
the men copy so

596
00:32:11,850 --> 00:32:15,040
the result this bike is that you get a
really small allocation heap

597
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:19,370
and then you get basically a forget cops
as you can imagine this crashes

598
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:23,060
arm soap exploitable earlier this

599
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:26,310
a Dell services trivial obviously out
just NFC

600
00:32:26,310 --> 00:32:29,400
and palette hash an elbow up the server

601
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:32,620
this actually is already a problem
because we're talking about gaming here

602
00:32:32,620 --> 00:32:34,930
right so let's say you have a game with
permit death

603
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:38,650
and you find yourself in a quarter a in
a in a in a corner

604
00:32:38,650 --> 00:32:42,040
out of ammo zombies and players and
everybody hates you

605
00:32:42,040 --> 00:32:45,380
well magic packets kill the server
that's convenient

606
00:32:45,380 --> 00:32:50,480
I am so I now for the more juicy part
remote code execution

607
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:53,500
well are it's possible

608
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:57,800
be very tricky amino days you know be
exploits take

609
00:32:57,800 --> 00:33:00,990
I don't know 23 bucks to get anything
reliable

610
00:33:00,990 --> 00:33:04,300
which we don't have for this but this
would be a good start because you're

611
00:33:04,300 --> 00:33:06,920
writing he date up and %uh you

612
00:33:06,920 --> 00:33:10,460
our forgot one thing the thing that we
overriding the data with is actually

613
00:33:10,460 --> 00:33:11,280
attack a controlled

614
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,330
so thats

615
00:33:13,330 --> 00:33:16,750
of a convenient I'd be very difficult up
few reasons for this

616
00:33:16,750 --> 00:33:19,960
but the first one is that the up well

617
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:23,160
D and then she is actually were going up
the the end that you keep

618
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:26,490
by the creating their own private heap
they're not using the process heap are

619
00:33:26,490 --> 00:33:30,370
so I that he was actually pretty
anorexic I mean there is not much on it

620
00:33:30,370 --> 00:33:33,030
like know the table to function pointers
nothing lead you see so we actually

621
00:33:33,030 --> 00:33:33,890
wrote this little

622
00:33:33,890 --> 00:33:37,510
arm Pyke script very convenient elders
who pre-

623
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:41,160
and every time you know free happens in
your process than you actually check to

624
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,480
see if there's a the table or anything
interesting here so

625
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:48,130
out that there will be a with a couple
things we found arm

626
00:33:48,130 --> 00:33:52,210
what else do we find well with a couple
pointers but

627
00:33:52,210 --> 00:33:56,050
anyway another thing that would make
this from a correction very difficult is

628
00:33:56,050 --> 00:33:56,350
now

629
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:59,770
you actually have to race the thread
that's performing the copy before

630
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:01,000
crashing process

631
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:05,660
difficult not impossible arm

632
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:09,030
now how there's a second one ability

633
00:34:09,030 --> 00:34:12,670
how do you remember the left half the
you know the very beginning maybe not

634
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:15,900
I don't know have been looking at this
go too much maybe amp so a

635
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:20,240
well if back lock code happens to be in
FF in the packet that means

636
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:23,960
you're trying to log into the admin
console and that leads to the second

637
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,850
book which is in the Admin Console onion

638
00:34:25,850 --> 00:34:30,960
with up to 20 alright so the

639
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,500
next but here's actually I timing attack
on the remote console login for battle I

640
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,710
so odd sort of two-part on the first
party

641
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:42,680
we've got the assembly here for for the
login and the first thing they do

642
00:34:42,680 --> 00:34:46,800
is actually checked the link %uh
provided password against the

643
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:50,210
the link to the actual password and here
said i've it doesn't match up that just

644
00:34:50,210 --> 00:34:50,910
immediately

645
00:34:50,910 --> 00:34:54,170
bails out and so as you can imagine
that's a I

646
00:34:54,170 --> 00:34:58,330
pretty differing I sorta you know
function and so

647
00:34:58,330 --> 00:35:01,110
I we feed enough requested that with
different lengths and then we could

648
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:01,810
eventually

649
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:06,390
I figure out the at length for the
password off from that point i want

650
00:35:06,390 --> 00:35:08,770
sweet once we actually have the lake we
get into

651
00:35:08,770 --> 00:35:12,780
a string comparison against the password
eyes can see down here

652
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:16,110
I what eventually happens is we get a a
call to to stern copy

653
00:35:16,110 --> 00:35:19,120
I and thats actually not AI

654
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:23,460
a constant I'm operation so I we end up
passing something like half a million

655
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:27,460
the attempts for each character that's
not possible in the password

656
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:30,670
on there's definitely I noticeable are
different than the time

657
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:34,960
on and for the song actually have a a
demo as well

658
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:39,540
though it's it's just a video where's

659
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:45,400
there's and I think it might be a little
hard to see so on

660
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:49,900
I'm sorry about that but alright

661
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:54,300
so what we've got going here is up in
need the left we actually have the the

662
00:35:54,300 --> 00:35:55,490
configuration file

663
00:35:55,490 --> 00:35:59,930
for the remote console login are using
password safe to generate just a a

664
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:01,790
random 24 character password

665
00:36:01,790 --> 00:36:05,790
and then we say that in the the
configuration file here

666
00:36:05,790 --> 00:36:09,000
and then once were done with that

667
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:12,070
are we actually just launched the I

668
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:16,810
the the server using that password
that'll take just a moment

669
00:36:16,810 --> 00:36:21,130
this is actually against

670
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:24,520
are met to but it it would really apply
to any of the

671
00:36:24,520 --> 00:36:29,060
the battle I enabled games so once
that's going it it's been enabled using

672
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:29,820
that password

673
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:35,210
i win we hi star are tacky roaches I
just a a Python script and so

674
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:38,740
with we spent the SUP quite a bit I
think about or

675
00:36:38,740 --> 00:36:42,240
I don't know fifteen hundred percent or
something so that we can a actually

676
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:43,390
presented here in good time

677
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:46,850
by I it a little bit hard to see but
it's just going through

678
00:36:46,850 --> 00:36:50,630
I each character traits again like I
half-a-million iterations

679
00:36:50,630 --> 00:36:53,840
for the any any character they can be
used in a password

680
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:57,100
I and we don't have the numbers up here
but there's there's a

681
00:36:57,100 --> 00:37:01,250
I gap between the correct character I in
any of the other characters and so you

682
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:03,370
can see it just slowly waking

683
00:37:03,370 --> 00:37:07,310
working its way through I wish I could
zoom that and

684
00:37:07,310 --> 00:37:12,270
but up yeah

685
00:37:12,270 --> 00:37:16,150
so right about fourteen a double take I
you are a few minutes here but

686
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:19,650
100 take total it so that the

687
00:37:19,650 --> 00:37:23,490
attack %uh from from beginning to
completion takes all OVA 17 minutes

688
00:37:23,490 --> 00:37:26,530
so this is this is locally a bite

689
00:37:26,530 --> 00:37:29,820
they can be pretty easily modified to
work over the network I was just this

690
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:30,610
was for

691
00:37:30,610 --> 00:37:34,360
press to prove a concept the easiest way
to do it once you start doing it over

692
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,350
the network it's gonna take
significantly more

693
00:37:36,350 --> 00:37:40,050
attempts and so I A would take a little
bit longer but it's definitely so

694
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:40,700
possible

695
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:44,570
right so we've actually slow down here
we've we've just 23 of the characters

696
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:47,670
and the actual %ah battle I server up
there

697
00:37:47,670 --> 00:37:50,930
I you see in line so what they found the
right password I

698
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:54,390
into the admin login to the console in
now that the password

699
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:58,150
yeah I guess I'd to call 17 minutes so
on

700
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:01,760
I can start kicking people on yeah I
want once you're into I

701
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,330
into the in the console you can you can
kick people from the server you can

702
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:09,820
do all sorts of other fun things for me
from there but

703
00:38:09,820 --> 00:38:13,990
yep thats thats offer that one so for
for both these bugs

704
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:17,430
I we we found them in August this year
and her and

705
00:38:17,430 --> 00:38:21,140
reported them to the vendor the in the
in the same month the

706
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:25,060
the first to the bugs has actually been
been fixed and patches been released in

707
00:38:25,060 --> 00:38:26,010
which is which is great

708
00:38:26,010 --> 00:38:30,030
on there still working on on patching
the the the timing attack but they

709
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:33,860
definitely had that coming out soon I
hopefully so

710
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:37,250
alright so

711
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:40,660
I'll what we what we think to be done
you know the future

712
00:38:40,660 --> 00:38:43,660
%uh event I T so I'll one option here

713
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:47,320
is actually to to move that arms race
that we're talking about into into Carl

714
00:38:47,320 --> 00:38:47,790
space

715
00:38:47,790 --> 00:38:51,570
are problems as is it's gonna be I
incredibly tricky

716
00:38:51,570 --> 00:38:55,000
I and its it was definitely get not not
a comprehensive solution and what you're

717
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,100
working in that space

718
00:38:56,100 --> 00:39:00,310
i any problems there can you know and
set up getting an application bug you

719
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:00,730
end up

720
00:39:00,730 --> 00:39:05,090
you know with with was going to death so
art might be worth it

721
00:39:05,090 --> 00:39:08,580
I a second way I was actually to get
more a

722
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:11,760
human factor so so players policing
other players I

723
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,790
giving them the the option to actual
report players another and in their

724
00:39:14,790 --> 00:39:15,350
games

725
00:39:15,350 --> 00:39:19,420
and we're seeing more and more that as
are newer games are released

726
00:39:19,420 --> 00:39:23,740
%ah and it's great because it gives the
the players sorta a means of

727
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:25,110
self-regulation

728
00:39:25,110 --> 00:39:27,940
and it turns out that that you know
people tend to be

729
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:31,310
much better at catching cheaters then
then sum up the automated processes

730
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:36,380
on as far as I as full solution goes
there there are a couple different

731
00:39:36,380 --> 00:39:40,710
%ah ways that the I guess the model and
some of the genre's can be changed to

732
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:44,520
I help prevent against the sort of
attacks I'll wear these actually

733
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:48,850
the the full streaming up games are not
quite quite there yet but what we could

734
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:49,800
do is we could

735
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:53,240
have all of the the game logic
everything going on on a server sauna

736
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,550
trusted server that we have

737
00:39:54,550 --> 00:39:57,940
and then basically feed a video stream
to to our player

738
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:01,600
that the problem is that with this is
that it would take an incredible amount

739
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:01,970
of

740
00:40:01,970 --> 00:40:05,540
a band with and I just really not not
there yet

741
00:40:05,540 --> 00:40:08,700
I'll one other way is actually turned to
move

742
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:12,320
the the platform are to some sort of
clothes solution so you can think I've

743
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,790
I may be something a little more like I
like a gaming console where

744
00:40:15,790 --> 00:40:19,350
the underlying hardware I don't
necessarily control unless you know I

745
00:40:19,350 --> 00:40:20,060
open up that

746
00:40:20,060 --> 00:40:23,250
that box and find some some interesting
are bugs in their

747
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:27,230
but are the problem with with the open
platforms are you not the other day it

748
00:40:27,230 --> 00:40:28,430
is my hardware

749
00:40:28,430 --> 00:40:32,030
and you know I can I can do with it when
it with do with it what I well

750
00:40:32,030 --> 00:40:35,350
on by yeah just potential solutions

751
00:40:35,350 --> 00:40:38,700
not sure if I'll you know where all that
that's going but

752
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:42,850
so I I guess at two to conclude

753
00:40:42,850 --> 00:40:46,740
I'll you know at the end what does this
all mean so I'll

754
00:40:46,740 --> 00:40:49,920
we've we sort of established that you
know anti-cheat is is definitely a

755
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:50,570
mitigation

756
00:40:50,570 --> 00:40:53,620
at best it's not going to stop all the
two years it was never really

757
00:40:53,620 --> 00:40:56,810
intended to I we we've established that

758
00:40:56,810 --> 00:40:59,920
edit it actually creates additional tax
surf is not just for

759
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,700
you know the the game server but
actually for the people playing the game

760
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:03,790
on

761
00:41:03,790 --> 00:41:07,890
in addition to the state since the anti
Jia tends to run with escalate

762
00:41:07,890 --> 00:41:08,520
privileges

763
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:11,860
you know the something running out as
sistema service

764
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:15,020
if you do find expert in there the
impact can be

765
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:19,010
you know pretty severe to to the the
players in particular or i guest you

766
00:41:19,010 --> 00:41:19,840
know to the server

767
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:24,550
I'll also what one thing across her nor
mine obviously is once you pop the

768
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:25,100
server

769
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:28,320
then you can turn around an attack
clients I'll take more bugs

770
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:32,650
but you can get pretty insane but not
that way to

771
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:35,930
on we also talked about you know how the
current anti-cheat

772
00:41:35,930 --> 00:41:39,710
it's it's actually possible to bypass it
completely by by taking it all to crawl

773
00:41:39,710 --> 00:41:41,140
space it it doesn't take

774
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:44,450
that much code it's all out there and
it's it's really just a matter of time

775
00:41:44,450 --> 00:41:48,810
before people start doing it on finally
we will

776
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:52,250
we think some you know real fundamental
changes need to happen in the system

777
00:41:52,250 --> 00:41:52,720
because

778
00:41:52,720 --> 00:41:56,390
as we talked about before money is
becoming more and more apart these

779
00:41:56,390 --> 00:41:57,300
online games

780
00:41:57,300 --> 00:42:01,140
and as that incentive you know increases
we're gonna get not only

781
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:04,210
you know more cheaters but definitely
more sophisticated cheaters when

782
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:07,680
I they can move into the space and and
make you know quite a bit of money

783
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,900
up alright up so

784
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:13,970
thats that's about it I wanted the

785
00:42:13,970 --> 00:42:18,720
to say thank you to a couple people from
from our office are Rachel and Jason for

786
00:42:18,720 --> 00:42:19,550
for helping us

787
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:23,980
you know through all this and then I the
two interns we have

788
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:26,780
picture here that we wanted to get them
and they they actually helped us right

789
00:42:26,780 --> 00:42:27,600
the timing attack

790
00:42:27,600 --> 00:42:31,610
and no that turns are are people too
despite what some people say

791
00:42:31,610 --> 00:42:35,820
in-and-out just just too many our
coworkers to let back in our Seattle

792
00:42:35,820 --> 00:42:36,990
office that of you know

793
00:42:36,990 --> 00:42:40,100
help to helped us build the stalking 22

794
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,110
took what it is today but on but

795
00:42:43,110 --> 00:42:46,830
yep that's right that's it any any
questions for us about how

796
00:42:46,830 --> 00:42:53,830
any have and if this works

797
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:54,730
up

798
00:42:54,730 --> 00:43:00,170
but now it's else or snow it's close
source

799
00:43:00,170 --> 00:43:04,990
on with public

800
00:43:04,990 --> 00:43:08,710
I know you're asking the public you go
to the website you can tell the server

801
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:10,640
and the client it comes as a little DLL

802
00:43:10,640 --> 00:43:13,869
as secretary convenient you know you
have a game sorry just for the delay on

803
00:43:13,869 --> 00:43:15,010
there and it starts there

804
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:22,010
so I figured would take a look

805
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:38,440
so

806
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:41,870
at that a point like what we were
talking before becomes a game

807
00:43:41,870 --> 00:43:45,970
sorta similar to the entire space where
you know to look at first

808
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:49,270
and when you're a cheater are you can
you can basically always

809
00:43:49,270 --> 00:43:52,330
ensure that your kernel driver loads
first and so

810
00:43:52,330 --> 00:43:56,050
I had to flee trickier I had to do
something like that but they think of it

811
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:57,300
as anti-virus race

812
00:43:57,300 --> 00:44:00,700
except the users on the fireside that

813
00:44:00,700 --> 00:44:07,700
gotta boils down to back to yeah he can
do that problem there

814
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:14,500
is graphics yeah performance really

815
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:19,810
but once once you know this get solved
yeah I open up like a whole new area

816
00:44:19,810 --> 00:44:22,890
I exactly like we're getting worse than
before as follows:

817
00:44:22,890 --> 00:44:26,510
really the same pattern but yes that's I
would definitely do the trick if you get

818
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:33,510
if you can run your game more than 10
per second yes

819
00:44:38,089 --> 00:44:40,180
are so I mean in terms of love

820
00:44:40,180 --> 00:44:43,690
anti-cheat most the ones that we've
actually looked at heart I really in the

821
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:44,410
kernel space

822
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:48,280
at all we didn't have a chance to I
guess comprehensively look at all of

823
00:44:48,280 --> 00:44:48,650
them

824
00:44:48,650 --> 00:44:52,089
up by it I guess again getting back to

825
00:44:52,089 --> 00:44:56,210
you know the fact that I into the day
even if they're in work working and in

826
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:56,900
kernel space

827
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:59,990
you know within with enough work we
could still bypass them so

828
00:44:59,990 --> 00:45:03,859
I S part so was the other other half the
your question

829
00:45:03,859 --> 00:45:06,900
okay for sorry

830
00:45:06,900 --> 00:45:12,190
anybody else yes

831
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:16,329
onsite

832
00:45:16,329 --> 00:45:23,329
cracked I

833
00:45:27,079 --> 00:45:31,089
so we can hide it entirely it as far as
the energy goes it doesn't exist in the

834
00:45:31,089 --> 00:45:31,609
first place

835
00:45:31,609 --> 00:45:35,020
if you're operating in the kernel are
you can hide it

836
00:45:35,020 --> 00:45:38,109
doesn't make sense whether

837
00:45:38,109 --> 00:45:41,480
do the way the way we did originally in
and

838
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:45,869
is is to i make the process are
protected I you know with a deer and

839
00:45:45,869 --> 00:45:46,470
feature

840
00:45:46,470 --> 00:45:50,309
a window modern Windows are we basically
for a bit on on the

841
00:45:50,309 --> 00:45:53,609
on the arm on the data structure that
represents the process and and Windows

842
00:45:53,609 --> 00:45:54,450
kernel an anti

843
00:45:54,450 --> 00:45:57,530
and and in the process is not protected
you just can't open it

844
00:45:57,530 --> 00:46:01,040
even if your system on the machine but
that's just one method

845
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:04,500
I mean it's been done many times with up
either

846
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:07,540
I removing the process complete from the
doubly linked list

847
00:46:07,540 --> 00:46:12,020
or I mean thing cover think of the
untied she really is being the virus

848
00:46:12,020 --> 00:46:15,200
and are the driver as being the
anti-virus

849
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:18,440
you know the house kinda control over
you can just completely blinded

850
00:46:18,440 --> 00:46:21,240
you can contain it you can do anything
you want is two different public

851
00:46:21,240 --> 00:46:22,109
privilege levels

852
00:46:22,109 --> 00:46:26,930
some any other

853
00:46:26,930 --> 00:46:30,110
any other questions

854
00:46:30,110 --> 00:46:32,350
right will great thanks everyone for
coming thank you
