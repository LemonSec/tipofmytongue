00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:16,160
hi

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:18,560
everybody i'm sarah rampatsy assistant

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:20,720
professor at the university of florida

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,880
and today with the phd student benjamin

6
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:24,080
cyr we will present

7
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:26,800
like comments namely how to hack invoice

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,640
assistant using lasers this work is a

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,479
collaboration between university of

10
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,399
michigan and the university of electric

11
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,280
communication

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:38,399
in tokyo japan

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,200
in recent years we have seen technology

14
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,200
developed to give more and more power to

15
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,480
our voices

16
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:46,800
instead of using traditional mechanisms

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:47,520
like la

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,920
mice and keyboard we can now speak to

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,920
voice controllable systems such as

20
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:52,719
google home

21
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:55,760
amazon alexa or even to smartphones and

22
00:00:55,760 --> 00:00:56,399
tablets

23
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:59,520
they use voice assistant like siri with

24
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,079
them we can perform many operations

25
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,119
like setting timers ask the weather but

26
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,960
also making online purchases

27
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,280
and controlling other smart devices

28
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,479
around the home

29
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,520
such as thermostats smart locks and even

30
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,119
cars

31
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,520
these systems works by recording an

32
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,360
audio signal with a microphone

33
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:21,680
and uses picture recognition algorithm

34
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,520
to parse the words out

35
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,520
and then performing commands based on

36
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,680
that

37
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,680
to understand how to inject the light

38
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,200
signal into microphone

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,520
we first need to understand how a mems

40
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,200
microphone works

41
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,360
these tiny and cheap microphones are

42
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,759
used in many controllable systems our

43
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:40,240
phones

44
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,799
and tablets most voice controller

45
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,799
devices have acoustic ports

46
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,360
like tiny holes visible on the outside

47
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,880
of the device

48
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,880
these ports allowed acoustic pressure

49
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,960
waves to pass directly to a mems

50
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,840
microphone where they can be measured

51
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,320
in many of these microphones a parallel

52
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:00,479
plate capacitor is formed out of a

53
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:01,200
movable

54
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,079
diaphragm and a stationary back plate

55
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,320
whenever the diaphragm moves in response

56
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:07,759
to an acoustic pressure

57
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:10,239
the capacitance change then these

58
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:12,640
changes then convert to a voltage signal

59
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,680
by the onboard headaches

60
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,599
these voice controllable systems are

61
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,000
designed under the underlying assumption

62
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
that microphone can capture only

63
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,599
acoustic signal

64
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,120
but the reality is quite different

65
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,599
the hard truth is that mems microphone

66
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,319
can capture

67
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:33,760
acoustic signals and light signals

68
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,840
this sensor are actually capable to

69
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,080
perceive more than what we expect

70
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,239
leaving hoping a potential attack vector

71
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,120
during this talk i will show you how to

72
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,879
inject these light commands into

73
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:47,920
microphone

74
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,160
how to use this capability to send

75
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,560
inaudible command to voice assistant

76
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:55,440
system and to control third party system

77
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,040
connected to them

78
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,280
then then we will show you some new

79
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,280
demos of the attack

80
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,599
finally i will describe what has been

81
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,760
done by the major vendors to defeat

82
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,319
this attack and what is still left

83
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,958
vulnerable

84
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:14,400
so how this attack works we discovered

85
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,000
that mems microphones

86
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,239
are sensitive to light signals in

87
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:20,319
particular the output voltage of the

88
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,120
microphone

89
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:24,080
is affected by light irradiance which

90
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,959
can be thought

91
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,200
as the optical power density of the

92
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,239
light

93
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,879
by firing a focusing laser beam into the

94
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,000
acoustic port

95
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,400
at different bright intensity we can

96
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:36,400
change the microphone output voltage

97
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,120
accordingly

98
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,120
so if we amplitude modulate the light

99
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:43,840
beam

100
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:46,560
it generates a voltage on the microphone

101
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,120
output

102
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,280
that follow the input signal in the

103
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,400
audio frequency

104
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:53,439
range of the microphone the higher

105
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,599
is the amplitude of the lightest signal

106
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,040
in input the higher

107
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,360
is the amplitude of the output voltage

108
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:00,319
signal

109
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:02,560
with a very little distortion as you can

110
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,040
see in the second graph

111
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,439
this discover allow arbitrary audio

112
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,000
signal to be injected into microphone

113
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,799
and make the attack possible

114
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,399
so how we can inject these audio signals

115
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,478
we take the voltage signal from the

116
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:21,759
output

117
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,880
audio of the out laptop and fit it into

118
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:25,759
the modulation

119
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:28,560
input of a laser current driver the

120
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:30,639
driver simply converts the voltage

121
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,560
signal into a current signal

122
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:34,880
which is necessary since the optical

123
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,120
power of the laser diode is proportional

124
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,320
to the current across

125
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,280
it the laser current driver also add a

126
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,240
dc bias

127
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,400
to ensure that the laser diode stay

128
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,240
forward bias it

129
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,240
the laser is then hammered at the

130
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,479
acoustic port of the microphone

131
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,800
where it's generate a voltage signal

132
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:56,639
signal

133
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,880
after this surprising discover we're

134
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:00,960
wondering if a smart speaker

135
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,880
and other voice controllable system

136
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,440
could react to this signal

137
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,039
so using a laptop we record an audio

138
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:11,280
of someone speaking a voice command for

139
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,160
example

140
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,759
ok google what time is it we then play

141
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:16,880
this recording

142
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,120
taking the voltage signal from the

143
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,639
output of the laptop

144
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,520
amplify it with a simple audio amplifier

145
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,000
and then

146
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,080
feed the signal into the modulation

147
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:29,120
input of the laser current driver

148
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,280
the laser driver converts the voltage

149
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:32,720
into a current signal

150
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:34,800
and by driving the current across the

151
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,680
diode we generate an amplitude modulated

152
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,160
light signal representing the voice

153
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,759
command

154
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,440
when we aimed this laser at the

155
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,680
microphone port of a voice controllable

156
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:46,400
system

157
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,639
we verified that the device responded to

158
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,600
the light

159
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:52,880
as if someone had spoken the comment

160
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,759
we tested different laser sources for

161
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,440
different colors

162
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,560
from infrared to near ultraviolet

163
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,960
and the speaker replies to us every time

164
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,840
you may wonder how powerful is the laser

165
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,240
that we use for these experiments

166
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,360
the answer is not very powerful but

167
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,919
can still cause some hazard if you don't

168
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:17,600
use it carefully

169
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:20,000
laser can cause very severe high

170
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:20,720
injuries

171
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,520
and skin burns as well as permanently

172
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,400
damage your target device

173
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,120
so we always use the adequate protection

174
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,680
such as

175
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,199
laser gogos and lab coats in particular

176
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,520
during our experiment we mostly use

177
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,080
class

178
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,120
3 r laser namely laser

179
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,759
with the same power of a laser pointer

180
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,000
commonly used to play with your cats

181
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,840
or make presentations and we also use a

182
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:50,720
60 millivolt power laser classifying low

183
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:53,199
power class 3b devices

184
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,520
such as laser that are commonly used in

185
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:58,159
light shows

186
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,360
after testing short range attack we

187
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,680
sought to investigate the maximum range

188
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,039
of the attack

189
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,840
to do this we had octaves to the la to

190
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,800
the laser in form of a telephoto lens

191
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,280
this piece of equipment greatly reduced

192
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:13,919
the beam

193
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,720
area at longer ranges and increase the

194
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,840
radiance that heated the devices

195
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,639
with the help of this optic just using a

196
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,240
5 millivat laser

197
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,120
namely equivalent to a laser pointer we

198
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,960
were able to achieve a successful

199
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:30,080
attacked to a google

200
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,400
home device at 110 meters away

201
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,800
and we were limited more to the space

202
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,960
available for conducting the experiments

203
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,080
rather than the attack

204
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,400
so we tested 17 devices from google home

205
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,120
to various models of amazon echos

206
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,319
to facebook portal to google nest camera

207
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,639
and different models of smartphone and

208
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:55,599
tablets both

209
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:59,120
android and apple with a 60 milliwatt

210
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,080
laser all the devices were vulnerable up

211
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,080
to 50 meters away

212
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:06,560
and still this was more a space limit

213
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:12,160
more than attack limit

214
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,400
not only we were able to affect the

215
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,840
system itself

216
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,160
we were able to execute the unauthorized

217
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,520
operation and affect

218
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,919
iot devices connected to the voice

219
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,280
assistant

220
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,240
we were able to unlock front doors turn

221
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,199
on and off

222
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:30,160
lamps changing setting of a thermostat

223
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,919
and make purchases

224
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,320
and more worrisome we were able to open

225
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,279
garage door

226
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,839
unlock car doors and even start the car

227
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,200
hinging

228
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,839
but why we were able to attack all these

229
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:44,959
devices

230
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:46,720
is due to a combination of several

231
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,800
vulnerabilities that combined

232
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,279
can cause multiple security issues that

233
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:53,680
anniversary can exploit

234
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,600
first of all personalization and

235
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,120
authentication are two

236
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:00,160
very different concepts for example

237
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,240
smart speakers are designed to be used

238
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,760
by multiple users

239
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,760
so no authentication is present by

240
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:07,360
default allowing

241
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,080
any user to perform critical action such

242
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:10,480
as

243
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:13,519
unlocking doors only a personalization

244
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,519
feature can be activated on these

245
00:09:15,519 --> 00:09:16,959
devices

246
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:18,640
using this feature you can train the

247
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,560
system to distinguish your voice

248
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,600
from other people's voices personally

249
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:25,839
personalize the device responses and

250
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,839
execute selected action

251
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:29,680
like play a certain music when you

252
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,600
arrive at on

253
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,920
other verse assistant like siri use

254
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,080
speaker reconnection by default

255
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,640
however there are two main issues on

256
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,880
this type of authentication

257
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,040
first the recognition can be bypassed

258
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,800
using various online tools

259
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:47,279
like text-to-speech services for

260
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:49,519
mimicking the owner voice

261
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,120
second we discovered that the

262
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:53,360
recognition was limited to only the wake

263
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,240
up world

264
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,519
for example a siri ignoring the rest of

265
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,800
the comment

266
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,360
for example when i train the iphone with

267
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,399
my voice

268
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,120
and with my strong italian accent the

269
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:07,120
same phone recognizes me

270
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,680
the wake up words saved using five

271
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:10,320
different

272
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,760
us native speaker voices generated by an

273
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,200
online text-to-speech

274
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:17,360
algorithm and the rest of the comment

275
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,560
was spoke by ben

276
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:22,800
and male u.s native speakers

277
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:26,720
another factor that we exploit is the

278
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,160
present of the routines

279
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,480
an app that can allow the device to do

280
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,800
specific things they could not do

281
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,920
otherwise

282
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:36,079
such as as combining action that

283
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,399
involved multiple devices

284
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,040
usually some critical operation such as

285
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,839
unlock

286
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:44,399
a smart lock required the user to speak

287
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,079
a pin number

288
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,240
but with these routines or services like

289
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,079
ifttt is it possible to bypass these

290
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,000
security checks

291
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,720
for example i can set up my system to

292
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,000
unlock the front door

293
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:01,279
when i use the sentence i'm home instead

294
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:04,720
of asking for a pin code

295
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:08,440
finally we encounter common iot security

296
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,920
vulnerabilities

297
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,399
as i mentioned before some unlocking or

298
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,120
disarm

299
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:15,600
operation are disabled by default for

300
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,040
our security

301
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:19,680
and for execute demo you have to set a

302
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:20,800
n-digit pin

303
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,760
usually a four-digit pin which must be

304
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,519
spoken before the voice

305
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:28,480
assistant will execute the action we

306
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,160
discover that some smart

307
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,880
devices does not require a pin for

308
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,160
certain operation

309
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:37,360
even if they can open a security threads

310
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,600
like open the garage door or open the

311
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,360
trunk of a car

312
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:44,160
and usually we expect that after a

313
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,279
number of wrong pin

314
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,440
attempts the system will disable the

315
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,600
feature or rise an alarm

316
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,560
or block the operation however we were

317
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,040
able to brute force pin numbers

318
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,680
since there was no mechanism to stop the

319
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:58,399
attempts

320
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:01,200
after a wrongf of number of failed

321
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,800
trials

322
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,440
or it was possible to set a pin number

323
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,480
of just

324
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,279
one digit very easy to guess with few

325
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:11,839
attempts

326
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,079
for example when we attack a tesla model

327
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,240
we use the ev car application that

328
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,839
didn't require a pin

329
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,760
for a locking doors neither key

330
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:23,200
proximity

331
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,839
we discovered the summer issue with an

332
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,600
unofficial help

333
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,000
that it was promptly changed after the

334
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,920
lag commands release that you can see

335
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,240
here

336
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,639
in another example when we attack a four

337
00:12:36,639 --> 00:12:37,839
current

338
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:39,839
we discovered that the official hacker

339
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,920
has no mechanism to prevent brute

340
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,560
forcing when used with google home

341
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,320
allowing the attacker to execute

342
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,600
operation like

343
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,839
open doors and start the engine of the

344
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:53,600
car

345
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,839
but stop with the narrative let's do the

346
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:56,639
attack

347
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:58,880
now i'll hand the hoverband to show you

348
00:12:58,880 --> 00:12:59,760
new demos

349
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,240
on recent smart speakers and new iot

350
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:02,959
devices

351
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:07,839
not tested before go ben

352
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,200
hello my name is benjamin sear and

353
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,959
you're currently listening to the raw

354
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:15,040
unfiltered output of a memory microphone

355
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,720
that is under laser signal injection

356
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:17,760
attack

357
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,200
as you can see my voice is being

358
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,440
transmitted via laser into the acoustic

359
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:22,800
port of the microphone

360
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:24,160
where the microphone hears it as an

361
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,839
acoustic wave

362
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,360
if i stop the laser while doing

363
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,120
something like counting

364
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:35,839
so one two three four

365
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:40,560
9 10 11 12.

366
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,319
you can see that the sound stopped

367
00:13:46,839 --> 00:13:48,959
transmitting

368
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,959
hello everyone this is benjamin sear and

369
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:51,839
i'll be going through a few

370
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,920
demonstrations using light commands

371
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,440
that first demonstration was just to

372
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,959
show you what leica man sound like from

373
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,839
the microphone's perspective

374
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,519
the demonstration was completed in an

375
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,440
acoustic chamber that greatly attenuates

376
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:04,880
any sounds that enter or leave the

377
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:05,760
chamber

378
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,120
we just happen to have access to the

379
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:09,120
chamber in the room next to our lab

380
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,040
and a few of my demos will be using it

381
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:12,720
as there is a convenient window to allow

382
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,600
light commands to enter

383
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:17,120
this next demonstration is to give a

384
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,279
simple example of how we inject light

385
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,800
commands into smart speakers

386
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,959
for this example we are using a graduate

387
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,959
smart garage door opener

388
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:30,480
since i don't have a garage door in this

389
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,800
lab i constructed a miniature garage

390
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,079
door using an arduino

391
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,399
a servo and a sticky note just to show

392
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:39,839
when the door opens or closes

393
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,040
the garage it is closed controlled by a

394
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,800
phone app that also shows the current

395
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,680
status to the user

396
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,839
but the garage it also has a skill for

397
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,360
alexa smart speakers

398
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,959
where the garage door can be opened by

399
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:59,680
symbol command in this case we're using

400
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,839
an amazon echo generation 3

401
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:03,680
which is a device that we did not test

402
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,120
in the original publication of light

403
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,600
commands

404
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:11,600
to actually inject the command we need

405
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,279
four pieces of hardware

406
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,040
something like a phone or laptop that

407
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,720
can drive an audio signal

408
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,680
a laser driver capable of modulation a

409
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,040
laser diode

410
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:23,600
and some sort of focusing optics the

411
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,279
laser diode and focusing optics are

412
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:26,800
shown here

413
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:28,720
these laser pointers are sold on amazon

414
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,399
for around seven dollars or less

415
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,880
and are marketed as toys for cats we

416
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,240
just unscrewed the head of

417
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,320
the green laser and attached some wires

418
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,680
with alligator clips to where the

419
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:41,839
batteries would be

420
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,360
this is a laser driver i'm using for

421
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,800
this demo

422
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,839
this is an ld5 cha driver made by

423
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,600
wavelength electronics

424
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,399
its base price is around 340 dollars

425
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,839
while i'm using this driver for some

426
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,440
level of safety and control

427
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,800
there are cheaper drivers that are less

428
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,040
than a hundred dollars or more precise

429
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:04,720
lab grade drivers that sell for over a

430
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,320
thousand dollars

431
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,759
the output of this driver is connected

432
00:16:07,759 --> 00:16:10,560
to the laser head

433
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,240
connected to the modulation input of the

434
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,079
driver is the audio output of a

435
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:19,120
smartphone

436
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,959
i'll be using this phone to actually

437
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,479
record and send the commands

438
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:37,839
alexa tell smart garage to open

439
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,560
as you can see alexa opens the garage

440
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:42,560
door without requiring any pin code or

441
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:44,480
other authentication mechanism

442
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,360
i recorded the command to use later and

443
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,120
just reset the garage door using the

444
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,839
phone app

445
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:05,760
and here i am resetting it

446
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,679
and now i'm going to plug in the laser

447
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,559
in order to turn it on

448
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:19,760
and you can see it's on

449
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,959
just to give a little better

450
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,640
understanding of what is going on i'll

451
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,240
be using this speaker that comes with a

452
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:24,640
kit

453
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:27,919
called the light modulator this kit is

454
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,360
sold as an educational tool

455
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,039
and converts amplitude modulated light

456
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,799
signals that hit the solar cell into

457
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:47,840
sound signals out of its speakers

458
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,600
as you can see my command is being

459
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,360
transmitted by the laser

460
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,879
and now when we inject the command into

461
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,840
alexa

462
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,000
the garage door opens as if we had

463
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:14,559
spoken the command

464
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:15,919
in this next demo we're going to be

465
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,919
looking at why these smart devices are

466
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,520
vulnerable to light commands

467
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,520
i'll be using the blink security camera

468
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,760
which is a smart security camera a class

469
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,280
of smart device that we did not test in

470
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,840
the original publication of light

471
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:28,960
commands

472
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,120
whenever the camera is armed the camera

473
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:32,799
will save the audio and video for

474
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,080
several seconds if it attacks motion

475
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,720
[Music]

476
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:40,400
you will then give a notification to the

477
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:43,840
user smartphone

478
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,400
the blink camera can be controlled with

479
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,400
alexa but the interface between alexa

480
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,000
and blink requires a passcode to disarm

481
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:50,559
the camera

482
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,400
with a limit to the number of attempts

483
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,760
alexa

484
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,840
ask blink to disarm

485
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,120
[Music]

486
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,159
one two three four

487
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:05,840
sorry wrong pin please try your disarm

488
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,360
command again with the correct

489
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,640
pin this makes it very difficult to

490
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:11,919
attack with light commands

491
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,320
but the blink camera can also be used at

492
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:15,360
the google home

493
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,039
it just requires an extra step ifttt

494
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:21,440
ifttt is a framework that allows users

495
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,960
to interact with smart devices to

496
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:24,640
improve automation and create highly

497
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,320
customizable routines

498
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,840
it turns out someone has already made a

499
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,360
routine disarmed link with the google

500
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:30,960
home

501
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,000
so if we activate the routine in ifttt

502
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:35,919
and link google assistant in blink we

503
00:19:35,919 --> 00:19:37,280
can now control the blink camera with

504
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,320
google assistant

505
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:42,240
but this is a problem as you'll see

506
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,360
so i'll be shooting into the acoustic

507
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,039
chamber again just to show that is not

508
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:54,640
the sound of my voice that is activating

509
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:55,440
the device

510
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:56,799
and that the light signal passes through

511
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,120
windows

512
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:07,840
okay google disarm my blink camera

513
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:13,120
so i'm turning on the laser and it's

514
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:16,240
going into the acoustic chamber

515
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,840
and playing the command

516
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:27,520
and the google home has responded

517
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,440
here's the same demo but viewed inside

518
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:35,840
the chamber

519
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:42,720
blink is now disarmed

520
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,120
as you can see google home with ifttt

521
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,039
did not require any passcode to disarm

522
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:47,760
the camera

523
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,360
so someone could walk in without the

524
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:52,399
camera saving anything

525
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,080
now like commands also has a few options

526
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,000
to be more stealthy and not alert

527
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:05,280
an owner that is nearby one many smart

528
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,240
speakers have

529
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,039
very low minimum volume which makes it

530
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,640
makes it hard to hear responses to

531
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:16,990
commands

532
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:20,109
[Music]

533
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:30,159
okay google are my blink camera okay

534
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,679
google

535
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,799
set volume to zero

536
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:45,840
okay google disarm my blink camera

537
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:58,400
blink camera is now armed

538
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:02,000
so now we're setting the volume to zero

539
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:09,280
link is now disarmed

540
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,640
as you can hear there's a pretty big

541
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,080
difference between the default volume

542
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,960
and the minimum volume

543
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,440
some devices even support a whisper mode

544
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,960
where a whispered command will produce a

545
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,559
very quiet whispered response from the

546
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:21,679
smart speaker

547
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:23,440
this whisper can even be transmitted via

548
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,280
light commands

549
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:41,840
alexa tell smart garage to open

550
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,480
it's very difficult to hear that

551
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:55,840
response yet the command still works

552
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,760
in our work we also took a look at voice

553
00:22:57,760 --> 00:22:59,039
assistance on smartphones

554
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,559
as well as how you might unlock certain

555
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:09,840
smart locks

556
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,559
[Music]

557
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,080
your door is unlocked while this command

558
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,679
can be injected into the smartphone

559
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,200
be aware that voice recognition to

560
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:26,960
activate siri is always enabled

561
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,159
and the phone has to be unlocked to

562
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,840
perform critical actions like unlocking

563
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:32,158
a door

564
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,440
now that we've seen how light commands

565
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:37,039
works i want to show how light commands

566
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:39,120
can be accomplished at long range

567
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:40,320
by improving the optics for the

568
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:42,320
telephoto lens which

569
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,120
ours was around 300 we were able to

570
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,960
perform light commands at distances

571
00:23:46,960 --> 00:23:51,840
of 110 meters on some devices

572
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:00,240
it's 9 43

573
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,520
and finally i wanted to show you what a

574
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,200
realistic attack might look like

575
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,880
in this demo we performed light commands

576
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:10,480
by firing a 75

577
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,960
a laser 75 meters from a bell tower into

578
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:14,880
a room on the third floor of our nearby

579
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:16,080
office building

580
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:17,520
we injected the command to open the

581
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,520
garage it garage door and google home

582
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,080
responded

583
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,799
okay opening so those are all the

584
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,000
demonstrations i have

585
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,279
and i hope that gives everyone a better

586
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,720
idea of what it looks like to carry out

587
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,240
like commands

588
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:41,360
thank you and now back to sarah thanks

589
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,000
ben

590
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,000
after more than one year from the

591
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,440
vulnerability release

592
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:47,840
measure voice assistant and iot devices

593
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,679
vendor have applied some software

594
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,000
patches to the devices to mitigate

595
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,880
this attack first they augmented the

596
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,120
device personalization features

597
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,520
such as not allowing purchases if the

598
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,360
voice assistant doesn't recognize your

599
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,159
voice

600
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:04,480
and not allows not official hacks to

601
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:06,799
perform critical operations

602
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:08,880
smart the device manufacturer of the

603
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,400
tested devices

604
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,320
patches this software to not allow

605
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,760
pinball forcing adding some sort ok

606
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,720
some sort of multi-factor authentication

607
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:19,679
such as

608
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,919
pressing a button to confirm the voice

609
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:25,120
command for example

610
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,679
however as bennett showed in the demos

611
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:29,440
the attack is still possible in many

612
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:30,880
different ways

613
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:33,520
to increase usability for the final user

614
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:34,720
security checks

615
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,440
might be overlooked allow unauthorized

616
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,080
critical operations to be executed

617
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,240
as we have seen in the security camera

618
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:43,679
demo

619
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,400
still some iot devices operation do not

620
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:48,960
require a security pin to execute them

621
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:52,240
like the garage door also we saw that

622
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:53,200
even in new

623
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,760
generation devices they have a multiple

624
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:56,720
microphone

625
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,200
is just enough to attack one microphone

626
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,200
to compromise the device

627
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,320
and the smart system connected to it

628
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,400
but more important independently from

629
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,799
the type of mems microphones using

630
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:11,520
in this different worst assistance the

631
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,480
stack still

632
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,679
affected them whole

633
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,400
from the attacker standpoint instead the

634
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,640
main limitation to successfully perform

635
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,360
the attack

636
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,279
is related to the capability of the

637
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,400
attacker to aim

638
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,520
at the device acoustic ports as we saw

639
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:29,600
in the long range attack demos

640
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,679
the success strongly depends on the

641
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,200
ability of focusing

642
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,360
and to give the right amount of light

643
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,480
irradiance to the microphone furthermore

644
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,320
the attack needs line of sight to the

645
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:40,880
device

646
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:43,279
not only for conducting the attack but

647
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,200
also to observe the feedback from the

648
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:46,000
device

649
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:49,200
like observing the lights some

650
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:52,240
smart speakers such as google home mini

651
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,320
has a fabric layer that covers the

652
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:55,919
microphone ports

653
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,000
make it more difficult for the attacker

654
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,960
to find the right spot for the injection

655
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,200
however in our test with google home

656
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,600
mini we demonstrated that the attack

657
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:07,760
can still be successful if the

658
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,440
microphone's locations

659
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,919
are known and the layer of the fabric is

660
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:14,159
thin

661
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,559
more research questions remain to be

662
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,880
answered regarding this attack

663
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,120
one of them is to understand why mems

664
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,559
microphones react

665
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:25,520
to light in this way our preliminary

666
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:26,080
test

667
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:28,559
seems showing a combination of two major

668
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:29,279
effects

669
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,279
the photoelectric and the photoacoustic

670
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:32,880
effect in the first

671
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:35,679
day radiance my generates a photocurrent

672
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:36,880
on the asics

673
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,760
which can change the output voltage

674
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:40,240
second

675
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:42,480
in the photoacoustic effect the light

676
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,000
can cause vibration

677
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,000
on the diaphragm due to the thermal

678
00:27:46,000 --> 00:27:48,159
effects or other light material

679
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,440
interactions studies this effect

680
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,240
help to understand if microphones can be

681
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,799
affected by different injection attacks

682
00:27:56,799 --> 00:27:59,279
or interference that can cause other

683
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:02,559
security threats

684
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,960
another future research is focusing on

685
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,760
developing

686
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:08,159
software and other defenses that make

687
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,520
higher team microphones

688
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,159
reliable such as hardware design

689
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:14,559
solution that can prevent the attacker

690
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:16,080
to have the line of sight

691
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,240
to the microphone port without

692
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,559
preventing acoustic wave to reach the

693
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:21,440
diaphragm

694
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:23,120
and compromise the performance of the

695
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,799
microphone

696
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:27,360
a possible software solution is to use

697
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:30,559
multiple microphone data for recognition

698
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,960
checking if the signal captured by the

699
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,840
microphones

700
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,360
is legitimate or not

701
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:39,360
to conclude the leg commands

702
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,600
demonstrated that sensors can perceive

703
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:43,039
more than what we expect

704
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,080
and what we designed them for consumer

705
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,960
electronics

706
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,600
and sensors becomes less protected

707
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,000
against this type of malicious injection

708
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,880
attacks

709
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,279
because the systems blindly i know

710
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,799
sensor data

711
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:58,960
the smart speaker can be attracted

712
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,840
through these

713
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,480
weak channels safety critical

714
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,240
application and systems such as

715
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,880
car require a careful software design to

716
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,440
minimize every attack surfaces

717
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,799
including from iot connected to them

718
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:15,360
and finally sacrificing security for

719
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,200
promoting usability is not

720
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:20,000
always a good idea especially when all

721
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:20,960
the devices

722
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:24,240
are connected to each other

723
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,559
so this is like comments i hope you

724
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:28,000
