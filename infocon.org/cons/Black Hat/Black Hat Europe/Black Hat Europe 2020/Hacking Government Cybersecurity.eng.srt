moss welcome to day one

55
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,280
of black hat europe 2020 our first

56
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:57,040
virtual event

57
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,280
i'm jeff moss founder of black hat and

58
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,479
it's going to be my privilege

59
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,640
to introduce our day one keynote speaker

60
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,000
pete cooper

61
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,520
before i do that i'm just going to talk

62
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:07,439
a little bit about different communities

63
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,560
in our space

64
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,959
how i see them overlapping and where the

65
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,959
role of researchers and hackers

66
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,800
infosec collide create tension

67
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,280
with government and what we can do about

68
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,400
that

69
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,480
so first off i see there's primarily

70
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:24,480
four actors in our space

71
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,280
we have organized criminals mostly

72
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,640
interested in how to make the most

73
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,520
amount of money

74
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,680
at the least amount of risk and you can

75
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,879
see this trend with the way they're

76
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,280
approaching ransomware

77
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:37,680
second we've got governments now

78
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,200
governments are not monolithic

79
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,120
they're not as single-minded as a

80
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,560
organized crime group

81
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,680
because they have a lot of different

82
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,599
competing interests inside

83
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,080
one part maybe the intelligence agencies

84
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,040
are interested

85
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,640
in verifying that other governments of

86
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,480
the world are doing what they say

87
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:53,519
they're doing

88
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:56,000
and to verify this they may perform some

89
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
clandestine online operations

90
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,400
to steal some secrets is north korea

91
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,879
really complying with an arms control

92
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,800
is iran doing something it shouldn't be

93
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,720
doing right that's traditional

94
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,159
clandestine operations

95
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,480
but on the domestic front on the policy

96
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:12,720
front we see governments pursuing a

97
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:14,159
handful of different

98
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,599
agendas right to repair is it legal

99
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,680
or not legal are you allowed to hack

100
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,840
your own tv

101
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,680
what's the liability for an iot device

102
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,200
that bursts into flame

103
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,120
biomedical liability for an implantable

104
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,480
medical device

105
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,239
there's a lot of unanswered questions

106
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,519
right now

107
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,440
and where are the answers to some of

108
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,200
these policy

109
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,239
debates coming from well companies

110
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,120
a third community they are manufacturing

111
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,000
the product

112
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,120
they're the ones that have built the

113
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,280
infrastructure they're generally

114
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,760
interested in maximizing return

115
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:49,680
minimizing disruption minimizing

116
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,799
regulation

117
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,599
and minimizing embarrassment they're the

118
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:55,120
experts that built the product

119
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,360
so they're the ones that are mostly one

120
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,400
seen in front of government

121
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,680
lobbying to change a law at a law

122
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,840
and then the fourth community which i

123
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:05,599
think of myself is belonging to

124
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:07,920
the academic hacker and security

125
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,439
researcher community

126
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,400
we're the ones that are really

127
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,400
interested in trying to figure out how

128
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,400
does this product work what does it

129
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,079
really do

130
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:18,238
underneath the surface is it doing what

131
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:19,600
the manufacturers claim

132
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:21,440
and if it's not we want to tell the

133
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:23,199
world about it and

134
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,479
through this kind of very energized

135
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:28,560
cyclical process we've come up with

136
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,520
disclosure

137
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,280
which led into commercial bug money

138
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,919
programs right we act as sort of a

139
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,320
a third party a neutral third party

140
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,320
telling policy makers

141
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,919
what is and isn't possible and this

142
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,639
leads to tension a tension between

143
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,520
the researcher community and government

144
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,639
on one hand government

145
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,840
really wants to understand what's

146
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,919
possible they need another voice to tell

147
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:51,280
them something different that's not

148
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,199
coming from the lobbyists

149
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,440
but on the other hand if the way you're

150
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,199
coming up with that information

151
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,720
maybe violating copyright that might be

152
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,840
uh not acceptable right you can't

153
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,320
legislate based on stolen information

154
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:07,680
maybe

155
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,039
so what do we do about this

156
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,680
we have historically moved more and more

157
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,039
into the realm of policy

158
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,960
if you look at the trajectory of hackers

159
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,880
and infosec over the last five to ten

160
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,600
years

161
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,680
we are now providing that information

162
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,039
policy makers have grown up with

163
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,320
technology and computers

164
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,039
and they're asking us our opinion this

165
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,880
is a really dangerous time for us right

166
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,440
now

167
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,280
on one hand because they're finally

168
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:33,520
asking us our opinion

169
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,080
so great opportunity great risk though

170
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:36,720
is

171
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,800
they're asking us our opinion and if we

172
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,720
screw this up we may not be taken

173
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,759
seriously

174
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,199
so it's very important that the

175
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:45,039
community of the infosec researcher

176
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:47,840
the community of government we learn

177
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:48,720
from each other

178
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,479
and we learn how to work through this

179
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,639
tension right

180
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:53,600
governments have been around for

181
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:54,960
hundreds thousands of years these

182
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,960
technology researchers were pretty new

183
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:59,199
and we're not steeped in the ways of

184
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:00,000
sort of this

185
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,800
political navigation and so we need to

186
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,720
be cut a little slack but we also don't

187
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,000
need to be guided

188
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,600
and shown how to properly get the most

189
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,280
out of our knowledge shared with

190
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:13,600
policymakers and that's why i find this

191
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:14,639
keynote

192
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,680
so interesting so it's now my honor to

193
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,560
introduce

194
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:21,199
pete cooper day one keynote who's a

195
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:22,319
deputy director

196
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,360
cyber defense in the uk cabinet office

197
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,639
and he's the lead for the government

198
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,479
sector for the national cyber security

199
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:30,000
program

200
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,360
he was ex-military a fighter pilot

201
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,080
turned to cyber operations advisor he

202
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,759
also was the first

203
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,199
to create in 2016 the uk's

204
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:41,440
multidisciplinary

205
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,479
cyber strategy competition integrating

206
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:47,199
a competition within the uk community

207
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,479
he's known for

208
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,479
leading security change across the

209
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,400
aerospace sector his specialty

210
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,880
but also with work across the industry

211
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:55,440
private

212
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,240
and government sectors so he's a pretty

213
00:06:58,240 --> 00:06:59,199
big

214
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,400
view of how security influences

215
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,520
government private

216
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:05,599
but for me my first interaction with

217
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:07,840
pete was at defcon

218
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,160
you may not realize this but but pete

219
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:10,880
created

220
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,599
and ran the defcon aerospace village

221
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,919
really making aerospace technology

222
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:18,000
accessible

223
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,880
average kids hackers researchers could

224
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:23,199
get our hands on avionic systems

225
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,280
and with helping hand with some guidance

226
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,560
he really helped

227
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,800
foster a global community now three

228
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:29,840
years old

229
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,759
right it's gotten its own legs under

230
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:33,680
itself and is really helping to try to

231
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,240
improve

232
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,520
aviation security it's fantastic

233
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,240
pete will explore with us uh how we can

234
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,000
work through our challenges to reduce

235
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:42,960
risks

236
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,400
to our societies so it's my privilege

237
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,680
pete take it away good morning

238
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,520
uh welcome to black hat europe

239
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,000
for me hacking as a mindset trying to

240
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,319
understand how something really works

241
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,560
finding ways of improving it being

242
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,400
resourceful being innovative and finding

243
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,680
solutions

244
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,199
and that's pretty much the way that i've

245
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,599
approached everything through my career

246
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,360
and now i'm starting the next phase as

247
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,400
i'm taking up the role of deputy

248
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:11,759
director cyber defence

249
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,280
in the government security group within

250
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:15,840
the cabinet office with an amazing team

251
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:17,199
incredible world-class partner

252
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,120
organizations such as ncsc

253
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,080
and a hugely critical mission having

254
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,680
only started the role three months ago

255
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,440
in august i've been leading the second

256
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,840
aerospace village at defcon

257
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,639
jeff you might also know as dark tangent

258
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,840
asked me to come and talk about the

259
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:32,559
journey

260
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,159
as i'm starting back at the government

261
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,159
and what shaped my thinking as i start

262
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:40,240
my next chapter

263
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,159
the government security group is led by

264
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,599
the government chief security officer

265
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,080
the gcso and the mission is a critical

266
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:46,959
one

267
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,040
we enable government to protect citizens

268
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,360
and provide vital public services

269
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:52,800
by understanding and managing the

270
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,399
security risks

271
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:56,240
by overseeing the day-to-day operations

272
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:57,920
in support of security across a whole of

273
00:08:57,920 --> 00:08:58,800
government

274
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,560
including the response to serious and

275
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:01,920
across the environmental security

276
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,399
incidents

277
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,440
as you can see from the scope and this

278
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,120
is a snapshot of some of the scope that

279
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:09,839
we look at

280
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,279
there's a huge variety of critical

281
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,519
organizations and services we cover

282
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,120
beard across a huge number of civil

283
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,720
servants and services that they're

284
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:17,839
looking after

285
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:20,320
whether it's buildings an estate and the

286
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,519
amount of professionals that we have

287
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:23,920
doing the job

288
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,720
and it's set out in four pillars it's

289
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:28,080
set out in physical

290
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,600
looking after the physical security of

291
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,760
buildings and all the services and

292
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:32,640
assets

293
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,040
technical really looking after the the

294
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,800
key technical aspects

295
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,399
personnel to look after the personnel

296
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,640
within the business and i'm also honored

297
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:40,959
to

298
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,640
lead the cyber insurance team in the

299
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,320
government security group which looks

300
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:45,519
after the government sector of the

301
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,440
national cyber security program

302
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,440
so that's all the policies the strategy

303
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:51,200
the standards into response to the

304
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,000
government red team

305
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,320
and much more but like most people in

306
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,600
the industry i've not had a straight

307
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:56,800
path to this role

308
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,320
and it's been a huge learning journey at

309
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,560
every stage

310
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,720
rewinding the clock so the 80s were

311
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:05,839
great

312
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:08,560
this was my first um we called a

313
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:09,839
computer i'd probably call it a

314
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,079
raspberry pi for old people

315
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,040
they had a luxurious 16k of ram and

316
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,320
coding was something that you did

317
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,600
because it would take about 10 minutes

318
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,959
of listening to the tape loading your

319
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,480
program to find out that it hadn't

320
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,839
actually worked

321
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,519
so it was a great start to actually

322
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:26,880
understanding some of the technology

323
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:28,720
and around that time we also had some

324
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,800
great hacker

325
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:32,240
movies starting to come out and a lot of

326
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,240
my thinking was shaped by um films such

327
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,200
as wargames

328
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,640
and about how to actually start looking

329
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:39,120
at looking at problems and digging into

330
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,760
um what the art the possible was but

331
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,560
then

332
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,480
top gun happened and like a cat with a

333
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,839
laser pointer i was off

334
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,160
and after a lot of training i ended up

335
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,920
as instructing the tornado ground attack

336
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:53,120
fast jet aircraft

337
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,959
having done quite a few operations along

338
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,800
the way and when looking at something

339
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,839
sharp and pointy

340
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,680
it's really easy to get focused on the

341
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,279
cool stuff

342
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:03,040
but running around at 100 feet at low

343
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:05,040
level is amazing going up against a

344
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:06,800
massive adversity air package

345
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,200
in a large exercise is amazing and

346
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,480
that's the cool stuff

347
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,120
but behind that is the time spent

348
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:14,399
learning the basics

349
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,480
and building apps and building those key

350
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,240
critical skills

351
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,680
because you've got to learn how to fly

352
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,240
and do the fundamentals every single

353
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:24,240
time without thinking about it before

354
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,160
you learn how to fight

355
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,240
and the fundamentals have to become

356
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,000
second nature

357
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,600
so that irrespective of what the

358
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,120
adversary throws at you

359
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,800
you've got to be able to keep being able

360
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,640
to do the fundamentals

361
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,640
basics such as being able to do night

362
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,399
air to review fueling as an amazing

363
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,000
skill but it took practice to get it

364
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,519
right so you could do it every single

365
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:43,920
time

366
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,760
even if you had the occasional miss

367
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,440
because sometimes if you couldn't tank

368
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:48,640
you couldn't actually contribute to the

369
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:50,000
operation

370
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,760
so it all starts getting complicated or

371
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,680
going wrong it's your ability to do the

372
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:55,600
fundamentals without thinking

373
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,720
that are going to keep you moving

374
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:59,040
forward and doing the right thing

375
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,720
and across cyber security it's really

376
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,720
easy to get excited and distracted about

377
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,360
the latest

378
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,920
sharp and pointy thing but being able to

379
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,519
do the fundamentals

380
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,440
of managing cyber security risk

381
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,200
protecting against attacks detecting

382
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,160
those attacks

383
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,320
and minimizing their impact are the

384
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,079
basics that enables absolutely

385
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:18,719
everything else

386
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,440
and as much as the tornado might look

387
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,880
really advanced there was always

388
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,399
something out there that was way more

389
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,279
advanced

390
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,600
faster could fly higher and with much

391
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,040
better kit

392
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,800
but not at any stage did we ever turn

393
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,880
around and say our success was going to

394
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:33,760
be defined

395
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:35,519
by who had the best kit and the best

396
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:37,360
technology

397
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,279
because as much as technology is a huge

398
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:40,880
part of what we use both in flying and

399
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,720
also cyber security

400
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:44,320
we aren't going to technology our way

401
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,560
through and out of our challenges

402
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,240
because winning losing isn't defined by

403
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:49,839
our technology is defined by our

404
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,440
thinking

405
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:52,639
we need to actually get through our

406
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:54,560
challenges by

407
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,880
challenging our thinking and that will

408
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,079
allow us to actually

409
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:01,279
um defend against our adversaries and we

410
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:02,800
see that with the adversaries

411
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,560
in that success and failure isn't about

412
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,720
that technology they don't have access

413
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,959
to alien technology that we don't

414
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,120
we've all fundamentally got the same

415
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:13,600
underlying technology

416
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,839
much of the time success is about

417
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,680
understanding our risks opportunities

418
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:19,120
and knowing our strengths and weaknesses

419
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,720
and how to manage them

420
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,160
if our adversaries know our strengths

421
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,240
and weaknesses of our technology better

422
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:25,040
than we do

423
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:27,279
then you're going to have a bad day it's

424
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:28,720
our thinking that allows us to make the

425
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,760
most of our technology

426
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,720
one of the other key things that we also

427
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,880
did in in the aviation world and it's

428
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,920
the lessons that i've

429
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:41,440
rolled into the cyber world is

430
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,959
that when a new aircraft comes into

431
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,440
service it'll be thrown at a whole bunch

432
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,360
of independent and objective test pilots

433
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,320
who are going to take it through its

434
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,199
paces

435
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:52,320
and really find out what would happen if

436
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,639
their role and task is to challenge the

437
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,920
assumptions

438
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,519
discover what works discover what

439
00:13:57,519 --> 00:13:59,680
doesn't work and really explore the

440
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:01,279
envelope of what's safe

441
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:03,120
and find the edge cases of how the users

442
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,639
can potentially get themselves into

443
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:05,600
trouble

444
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,880
and then really understand those risks

445
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,279
and once they understand those risks and

446
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:12,240
that they discover that they're

447
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,680
appropriate

448
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,760
they they give it the okay to be brought

449
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,440
into service

450
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,639
and we see a lot of that in cyber

451
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:20,800
security bringing in new systems or

452
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,079
services

453
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,800
our users aren't cyber test pilots and

454
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,079
we need to make sure that everything is

455
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,600
secure out of the box and with great

456
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,800
instructions about how to keep

457
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,920
it and them safe and secure

458
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,920
but it's not enough to just do that

459
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,760
because we also got to communicate about

460
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:36,639
those risks

461
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:38,160
and make sure the users know where the

462
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,000
educators are and what they can do to

463
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,600
keep themselves safe

464
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,360
and once we've communicated about that

465
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,639
risk then we need to be able to build

466
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,399
trust in that system

467
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,480
because you really know that system and

468
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,519
know how it's going to work

469
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,760
and then that is the key element of

470
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,040
right at the very start of getting

471
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:55,839
everything right

472
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:57,680
but even with that and even with making

473
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,360
the aircraft as safe as possible

474
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,199
even with the right processes the user

475
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:04,719
can still accidentally get it wrong

476
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,920
human nature will always catch us out

477
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,120
this is one of the early training

478
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,880
aircraft i trained on initially

479
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:13,040
so single engine ejector seat lots of

480
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,320
safety systems

481
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,720
lots of procedures to keep you safe

482
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,240
check and cross-check

483
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,279
and uh standby systems but i still

484
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,800
managed to make a mistake where i

485
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,560
accidentally started shutting down my

486
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,560
own engine

487
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:27,920
which isn't the best thing to do when

488
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,040
you're flying in a single engine

489
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:30,160
aircraft

490
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,920
it was human error that i recognized

491
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,360
fairly straight away because the engine

492
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,040
started slowing down and

493
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,120
it was all starting to go wrong horribly

494
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,560
i undid what i did and bless the

495
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:40,720
aircraft and dug me out the poo

496
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:42,639
the system was designed to keep me safe

497
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,240
and i managed to make a mistake

498
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,440
but the training and the resilience

499
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,120
built into the system got me back to

500
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:47,839
normal

501
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,560
apart from my heart rate defence in

502
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,839
depth

503
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,240
is critical in both flying and also

504
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,600
cyber defense

505
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,600
because it's key to remember that things

506
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,279
will go wrong users will click

507
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,240
links back end team could potentially

508
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,279
set up a service

509
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:05,360
incorrectly and that resilience is going

510
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,279
to stretch across the people the process

511
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,839
and the technology and you've got to

512
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:11,360
design them down to

513
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,600
design them down a secure path without

514
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,560
technology being designed to fail safe

515
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,160
and you can only really gain confidence

516
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,079
in your resilience if you train

517
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:22,639
and exercise your people your processes

518
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:23,920
and your technology

519
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,279
and that will give you the confidence

520
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:27,040
that no matter what's thrown at you

521
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,639
you can get yourself back to a safe

522
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:32,079
state and a secure state

523
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,880
and then also what makes a great flight

524
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:36,320
it's really easy to get

525
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,399
distracted by the fast and the pointy

526
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,079
but it's the exercise the enterprise

527
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,480
behind it that really makes it fly

528
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,240
so supply chain the manufacturers the

529
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,920
services the engineers

530
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,360
those are all the key elements that made

531
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,519
the whole thing work and it's exactly

532
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:53,040
the same when it comes to cyber security

533
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:54,160
and having great and resilient

534
00:16:54,160 --> 00:16:56,000
organizations

535
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,399
the the full foundations of that are

536
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,399
based around having a fantastic supply

537
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:01,839
chain that you can work with

538
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,839
having manufacturers across hardware and

539
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:04,880
software

540
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,199
having services that are you're able to

541
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,119
really work with fantastically well

542
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,319
and then engineers that can pull it

543
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,559
together and much much more

544
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,640
and it's easy to forget about that when

545
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:15,839
we're looking at the sharp and pointy

546
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,559
thing on the coalface

547
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,240
but everything we've got has got some

548
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:22,000
element of risk

549
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,480
aviation had a really huge accident

550
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,280
rates until

551
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,359
the sector really started digging into

552
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,720
the culture and understanding of what

553
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,400
was causing those accidents

554
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:33,760
and it absolutely transformed safety

555
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,160
flight safety culture was key in helping

556
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,919
drive risk down to as low as reasonably

557
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,120
practical

558
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,840
as part of that role i was a flight

559
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:42,640
safety officer

560
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,360
in the air force which allowed me to

561
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,679
actually really understand and learn

562
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:49,360
about all of the key risks that were

563
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:51,280
around the organization

564
00:17:51,280 --> 00:17:53,520
and as part of that people could come to

565
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,880
me and chat about whether

566
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,320
whether formerly informally

567
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,480
confidentially or not to resist

568
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,799
risks and issues all the way through to

569
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:02,880
the top of the organization

570
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,240
and we always think about the incident

571
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:06,160
because the incidents get the headlines

572
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,160
but it's the events the near misses the

573
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,600
problems

574
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:10,880
all of that stuff that's happening

575
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,960
underneath the surface is all of the

576
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,400
activity and stuff that will actually

577
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,080
help you predict where your incidents

578
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:18,160
are going to happen

579
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,679
and that's exactly the same when it

580
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,120
comes to how we're defending ourselves

581
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,640
across cyber security

582
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,160
is that the more that we understand

583
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,840
what's happening below the surface helps

584
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,440
us better understand and predict where

585
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,880
those incidents are going to happen so

586
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,880
we can prevent them

587
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,360
but we can only start doing that in an

588
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,840
appropriate culture

589
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,480
and for this um a lot of the reading and

590
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,160
research i've done previously was around

591
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:42,160
james reason who did a huge amount of

592
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,880
great research in safety culture and

593
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:46,720
that it's all equally applicable into

594
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,320
cyber security

595
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:49,840
and what he talked about was the fact

596
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,720
that to have a great engaged culture

597
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:55,200
it really started off with a reporting

598
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:56,000
culture

599
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,600
an organizational climate where people

600
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:59,840
can readily report problems errors and

601
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,520
near-misses

602
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:02,960
but it can be really hard to put your

603
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,480
hand up to error but that's why you

604
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,280
really need

605
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,200
a just culture where personnel can

606
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,400
understand the boundary between

607
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,400
acceptable and unacceptable behavior

608
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,400
and are willing to report those errors

609
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,160
or potential errors or those near misses

610
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,280
or those problems

611
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,640
because that's where you really start

612
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,720
getting the value

613
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:20,320
but if your organization and your team

614
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:22,559
are raising these issues

615
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,880
then you need to have a flexible culture

616
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,720
our adversaries evolve and therefore we

617
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,000
have to as well

618
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,080
security isn't a static task we need

619
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:31,440
that flexibility

620
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,840
at both the technical and organizational

621
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,000
layers to respond to our challenges

622
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,440
and when we've actually started looking

623
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:41,440
at those challenges we need to have a

624
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:43,200
learning culture so that it's more than

625
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,240
just fixing it

626
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:46,640
but also understanding why and how

627
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,840
something happened

628
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,600
so that we can change and adapt all the

629
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:51,600
way through

630
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,760
and really the final keystone of that

631
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,640
culture is that questioning culture

632
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,480
empowering individuals to speak up if

633
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,919
they see risks mitigations or

634
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,280
opportunities

635
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,120
and if they think something isn't right

636
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,799
even if they don't know the solution

637
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,159
it's really important to hear their

638
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:08,480
voice

639
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:11,200
and all of this brings the power of the

640
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,480
individual

641
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,919
to the organization when it comes to

642
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,240
cyber security

643
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,679
it really brings a key level of

644
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,360
understanding what your risks are

645
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,720
and it helps to be able to help you

646
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:22,960
identify and drive it down

647
00:20:22,960 --> 00:20:24,799
but it's more than that because when we

648
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,240
talk about culture we always think about

649
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,039
people

650
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:28,240
but it's the culture that's going to

651
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:31,280
really help you gain that unique risk

652
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,760
insight across all of your data at scale

653
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:34,640
and pace

654
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:36,720
and move beyond the stove pipes we often

655
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,760
see in cyber security

656
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:44,320
so one of the amazing things about

657
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,159
being in the air force at the time was

658
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,520
actually getting to go out and do things

659
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,679
like the large flag exercises

660
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:51,520
so one of the one one of the amazing

661
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,520
ones i did was in

662
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:56,480
las vegas so in the ranges above nellis

663
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,080
up against air threats surface-to-air

664
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:00,559
threats big formations and heavy weapons

665
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:02,480
and this was back in 2000 and if you

666
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,520
really think about the aims and

667
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,720
objectives of what we were trying to

668
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:06,240
achieve in that exercise

669
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,440
it was finding out what the art of the

670
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,440
possible was really not taking

671
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,840
anything for granted learning the

672
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,120
technology had limits

673
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:15,280
exploring those limits and learning that

674
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:16,640
mindset was as important as the

675
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,240
technology

676
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,320
knowing that teamwork had to be built

677
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,720
and grown throughout working together

678
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,400
and building out that camaraderie

679
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,320
community and it was an amazing

680
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,679
experience

681
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:30,880
but then at the same time as green flag

682
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,320
in the same hotel that we're staying at

683
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,559
at the alexis park one weekend

684
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:37,200
defcon08 arrived and i was thrown back

685
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,960
into my technical routes and realised

686
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,120
how much i've actually missed it

687
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,480
but as i was sitting there swapping

688
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,080
flying stories for hacking stories late

689
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:45,039
into the night

690
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,120
i realized that what i was at green flag

691
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,640
for was exactly the same as the

692
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:50,799
community at defcon was there for

693
00:21:50,799 --> 00:21:52,159
and they were finding out the art that

694
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:53,919
possible not taking anything for granted

695
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:55,760
and all of the same things

696
00:21:55,760 --> 00:21:56,880
right down to including camaraderie

697
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,960
camaraderie community that they were

698
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,480
looking at and actually growing across

699
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,679
defcon

700
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,720
it was just different domains and it was

701
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,720
a huge eye-opener to me and actually

702
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:07,440
really

703
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,000
started me back on that technical path

704
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:11,440
another thing that really stood out at

705
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,000
that time

706
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,400
as well and we've got we it's trying not

707
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,400
to be really careful with language

708
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:19,039
which is a pilot is just a pilot if that

709
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,640
pilot is attacking you then their class

710
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,760
is your adversary

711
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,200
if the pilot isn't attacking you then

712
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,799
they're likely an ally and then you

713
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,480
treat them as such shooting down

714
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,320
friendly forces is a really uncool thing

715
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,360
to do

716
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:30,640
and when it comes to the terminology

717
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,360
around hackers a hacker is just a hacker

718
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,640
and it depends how you class yourself

719
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,400
whether it's a research or researcher or

720
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:36,799
not

721
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:38,640
but that terminology doesn't necessarily

722
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,320
make you an adversary

723
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,679
and that's where we actually really have

724
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,120
to work together on clearing up a

725
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,559
language about how we actually work

726
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,879
together

727
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,679
but then taking those experiences and

728
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:50,559
learning more about

729
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,280
what collaboration really meant i did a

730
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,000
tour supporting

731
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,919
joint ops where i'd be in as the air

732
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,840
advisor working with all the ground

733
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,840
forces and all the other air forces

734
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,600
hugely international multi-domain with

735
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:04,240
different languages units capabilities

736
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,400
priorities and making life critical

737
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,200
decisions every single day

738
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,640
to communicate you need to be able to

739
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:12,640
communicate sorry to collaborate you

740
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:14,320
needed to communicate

741
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:16,400
and that wasn't just technical because

742
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,919
we're separated by more than just our

743
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:21,200
languages our specialisms and our moral

744
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,120
we all have diverse perspectives on what

745
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,240
our challenges are

746
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:26,480
and we all have our individual horizons

747
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:28,559
and the real value of collaboration

748
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:30,000
comes through seeing the world through

749
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,240
those diverse perspectives

750
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,919
because by doing that you then start

751
00:23:33,919 --> 00:23:36,000
creating shared perspectives

752
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,440
and you start pushing out your joint

753
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,679
horizons so you can see further

754
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,120
and develop a much better joint

755
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,520
understanding of everything

756
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,440
and once you start having that joint

757
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,279
horizon and once you start having those

758
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,279
shared perspectives understanding

759
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,679
it transforms how you see risk it

760
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,360
transforms how you can actually

761
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,120
use the resources and the actions you

762
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:56,640
can achieve from them

763
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,039
it creates a unique collaboration so you

764
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,640
can identify those opportunities and

765
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,840
ideas that you would not have been able

766
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:03,600
to do previously

767
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,960
and that's what it really means to

768
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,799
collaborate and if we look across

769
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:08,880
everything we're doing in cyber security

770
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,080
be that in organizations be that in the

771
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:14,159
defensive teams or the offensive teams

772
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,520
or internationally

773
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,360
it's how we collaborate together across

774
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,559
all of our partners that makes a

775
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:19,279
difference

776
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:20,799
and seeing the world through diverse

777
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,440
perspectives

778
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,360
and in collaborating across those

779
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:26,640
diverse teams

780
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,240
as i've said the best solutions are

781
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:29,760
those joint solutions

782
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,159
and it takes that collaboration an

783
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,440
orchestra is made up of different

784
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,200
sections strings woodwind

785
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,120
brass and percussion but if you want to

786
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,120
create a symphony every single element

787
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,480
is woven together

788
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:43,600
no one section can do it by itself but

789
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,200
it does need a bit of structure

790
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,720
it's difficult to scale a jamming

791
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,159
session without a losing rhythm and

792
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,159
becoming a cacophony

793
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:51,520
and also while we're here let's talk a

794
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,240
little bit about the imposter syndrome

795
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:56,080
just because we can't play the violin

796
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,600
doesn't mean that we should feel like an

797
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,799
imposter

798
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,880
if we're playing in the same orchestra

799
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,120
it's possible to appreciate and really

800
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,200
understand the artistry

801
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,880
but we all bring and play to our

802
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,120
strengths and bring something different

803
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,600
and it's how we actually bring that

804
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,200
harmony together

805
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,880
because the best technology in the world

806
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,720
needs the best policy and strategy to

807
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:18,320
support it and bring it forwards and get

808
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:19,600
the most out of it

809
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,200
the best policy and strategy is

810
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:23,200
delivered by best technology

811
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,880
and it's how we weave all of that

812
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,440
together that makes the difference

813
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,679
so when we talk about the the challenges

814
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,360
of getting policy and technical to work

815
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:32,000
together

816
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,440
and the different landscapes across

817
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,840
there then the key element to this is

818
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,240
bringing the harmony and working it as a

819
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,480
team

820
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:42,720
and in doing that and then building

821
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,799
those teams the skills

822
00:25:44,799 --> 00:25:46,159
and the people that you have in those

823
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:47,919
teams are

824
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,080
ultimately the critical enabler to all

825
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,000
of that

826
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,440
and we've got to really focus on

827
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,279
creating those opportunities

828
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,400
for the next generation coming forwards

829
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,480
i was honored to have founded the uk's

830
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,080
first cyber strategy competition for

831
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:03,679
university students

832
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,440
to really try and help focus on building

833
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,200
those diverse pathways

834
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,039
building those diverse teams and opening

835
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,720
up the aperture of what it means to have

836
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,159
a cyber security skill and a cyber

837
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,760
security career

838
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,240
and we would bring them into uh bt tower

839
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:16,799
in london

840
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,799
and uh and following off the great

841
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,120
atlantic councils like framework

842
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,400
and we'd put them into the role of

843
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:23,840
advisors to the prime minister during an

844
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,919
escalating cyber attack on the uk

845
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:27,600
we've really tested them and we really

846
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,200
gave the opportunities to show what

847
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:32,559
their skills were now normally for a

848
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,080
cyber security competition

849
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,279
we think about the skills and

850
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,480
technical abilities that you have to

851
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,320
demonstrate but for this

852
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,400
we only put the entry criteria as a

853
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,080
passion for the subject

854
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,679
and we really opened up that aperture

855
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:47,279
and really encouraged the diverse

856
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:49,279
disciplines and diverse backgrounds and

857
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:50,240
everybody

858
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,159
to come in and form joint teams and work

859
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,480
together and learn from each other

860
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:56,720
and we've really discovered an amazing

861
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,760
set of competitors

862
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,159
and amazing diversity out there and on

863
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:01,200
gender alone

864
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,279
year on year we had a gender split of 50

865
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:06,000
50 and has become the start point for

866
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,520
many cyber careers that haven't

867
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,279
previously been imagined

868
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:11,760
and in the photos there you can see the

869
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,440
the year one winning team as they won

870
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,679
the cyber security student of the year

871
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:17,600
the photo on the right hand side is from

872
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:18,880
ainsley who

873
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,039
didn't start off her career in cyber

874
00:27:21,039 --> 00:27:22,559
security but she's now definitely doing

875
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,000
cyber security

876
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,840
and only by coming into the competition

877
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:27,360
and and experiencing it and getting

878
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,440
excited about it building that passion

879
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,880
and now she's doing amazing stuff in the

880
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:34,000
industry if we want to have diverse

881
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,159
teams and if we want to really learn

882
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:37,279
from each other

883
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:38,640
then we've got to open up the apertures

884
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:40,559
and create those diverse pathways into

885
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:41,360
the industry

886
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:43,360
because that diversity allows us to

887
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,559
learn from each other

888
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,559
and throughout it's critical that we are

889
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,320
going to mentor and bring on that next

890
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:50,159
generation

891
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:51,679
we've always got to be thinking about

892
00:27:51,679 --> 00:27:53,840
how we can help them get to where we are

893
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:54,720
now

894
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:56,559
there is no set pathway for cyber

895
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:57,840
security

896
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:59,520
the best description i've had so far is

897
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:00,880
it looks a little bit like the london

898
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,080
underground map

899
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,679
and there's so many different stops to

900
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:05,279
get on so many different stops to get

901
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:06,480
off and there's a thousand

902
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:07,679
million different routes that you can

903
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,600
actually take in the middle but the

904
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,200
important thing is getting people in and

905
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:11,760
getting them

906
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,520
on their journey and helping them on

907
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,360
that journey all the way through

908
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,799
and that's why we have to really mentor

909
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,600
them and bring them on

910
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,279
and key to this is building bridges

911
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,760
across all of those communities

912
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,279
when we look across our challenges in

913
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,399
cyber security it's easy to sit

914
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,640
and look across and actually not

915
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:33,520
understand

916
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:34,559
some of the challenges that other

917
00:28:34,559 --> 00:28:36,960
organizations are seeing so critical to

918
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,039
this is building bridges

919
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,919
this photo was taken at the wrap-up of

920
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:44,240
defcon 27 at the end of the

921
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:46,240
first aviation village which i was

922
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,440
honored to have founded and led the

923
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,399
first one

924
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,559
a first and second one and it's with the

925
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,240
most amazing group of friends and

926
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,480
colleagues

927
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,080
when we initially looked at the aviation

928
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,000
sector there were challenges

929
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,880
across who was actually working together

930
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:02,320
who wasn't working together why they

931
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:04,399
weren't working together

932
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,320
and really trying to understand how to

933
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,480
make a difference a lot of the time

934
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:10,880
it's really helping to understand those

935
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,039
those viewpoints in those perspectives

936
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,039
because we really all want the same

937
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,240
things when it comes to

938
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,960
security and building and managing great

939
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,720
cyber security and secures and safe

940
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,080
services

941
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,240
but it does take effort to build bridges

942
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,320
and trust to create those diverse

943
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:27,919
pathways

944
00:29:27,919 --> 00:29:29,279
because there's a lot of really good

945
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:31,039
people doing really good things

946
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:32,960
in the community industry and across

947
00:29:32,960 --> 00:29:34,399
government

948
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:35,760
and we need to put that effort into

949
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,440
building bridges

950
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,279
but to start you really need a vision

951
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:40,799
that people can understand

952
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:43,840
and see and get behind irrespective of

953
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,520
where they're from

954
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:47,039
and you need to start laying out into a

955
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,039
strategy to see how

956
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,480
you can start bringing everything

957
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,480
together and sometimes that's really

958
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,000
hard but sometimes that could be just a

959
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:55,679
basic strategy just to get yourself

960
00:29:55,679 --> 00:29:57,200
going the right direction

961
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,279
and start aligning um what everyone's

962
00:29:59,279 --> 00:30:01,360
doing

963
00:30:01,360 --> 00:30:03,120
but then you also need to have dialogue

964
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,640
because dialogue allows you to

965
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:05,760
understand

966
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,000
and dialogue allows you to see through

967
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,440
those different perspectives and build

968
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,640
those partnerships

969
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,720
and critically start building the trust

970
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,000
across all of those different

971
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,200
partnerships

972
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,559
because that's the thing that is going

973
00:30:16,559 --> 00:30:18,240
to be underpinning all of it which is

974
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:20,640
trust

975
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,880
and that trust is going to be the thing

976
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:24,399
that allows you to create that community

977
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:26,000
and camaraderie

978
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,120
and allows you to have that

979
00:30:27,120 --> 00:30:29,120
collaborative and positive space and

980
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:31,120
then the community starts forming around

981
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:32,640
you and the passions that everybody is

982
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:34,240
bringing to it

983
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,679
and those passions are then the thing

984
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:38,000
that leads to change at least to action

985
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,320
and needs to change it can be really

986
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:42,000
easy to have loads of dialogue

987
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,440
and then not quite get around to the

988
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:45,760
action and change but the passions and

989
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,279
creating opportunities to actually do

990
00:30:47,279 --> 00:30:48,480
something with them

991
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:51,520
is key all the way through we started

992
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:52,240
with little

993
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,159
little in the way of aviation industry

994
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:56,080
partnerships but then after the first

995
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:56,559
year

996
00:30:56,559 --> 00:30:58,559
not just helped build trust across

997
00:30:58,559 --> 00:30:59,679
industry and government

998
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:01,679
and all of the rest of the community but

999
00:31:01,679 --> 00:31:03,120
it also helped shape some

1000
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,799
industry perspectives on how they

1001
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,159
approach and engage

1002
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:07,600
with the research and hacking community

1003
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,039
and actually help really improve a lot

1004
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,320
of the way that we were thinking about

1005
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,600
that

1006
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:12,880
we started building that shared

1007
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:14,880
perspective and that shared vision of

1008
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:15,840
how to move forward

1009
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,360
together and it really proved that

1010
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:22,159
from those early days of a small village

1011
00:31:22,159 --> 00:31:24,080
with a few people involved to

1012
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,760
this year where it involved the first

1013
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,720
ever on orbit

1014
00:31:28,799 --> 00:31:31,840
ctf involving a satellite aircraft

1015
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:34,960
industry and it shows that actually

1016
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,440
with not much in the way of resource or

1017
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,720
direct levers

1018
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,799
it's possible to achieve huge huge

1019
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:42,320
amounts if you've built up if you've

1020
00:31:42,320 --> 00:31:46,399
built up an amazing community

1021
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,559
and a great example of what a difference

1022
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:51,279
passion and community can do

1023
00:31:51,279 --> 00:31:54,559
is the sign of volunteers when covert 19

1024
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:55,039
hit

1025
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:57,120
this year and the world pivoted to

1026
00:31:57,120 --> 00:31:58,320
coping with the huge healthcare

1027
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,000
challenges that it brought

1028
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:02,080
lots of people across both the private

1029
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:03,600
and public sector

1030
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,000
pitched in to make a huge difference as

1031
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,080
well as the volunteers

1032
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,600
but with critical services dependent on

1033
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:11,360
cyber security this year a new

1034
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:14,080
generation of volunteers emerged the

1035
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,360
cyber volunteers

1036
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:18,559
founded by dan and lisa have achieved

1037
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:22,880
immense immense results

1038
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,320
they've supported healthcare services

1039
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:26,080
around the uk and europe on a voluntary

1040
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:26,640
basis

1041
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:28,799
pulling together a huge amount of

1042
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:29,840
diverse

1043
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,320
groups people individuals that care

1044
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,360
passionately about

1045
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,919
defending what is as critical they set

1046
00:32:35,919 --> 00:32:37,519
up an amazing cyber threat intel and

1047
00:32:37,519 --> 00:32:39,360
awareness campaign they helped over 700

1048
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,880
healthcare organizations in all the

1049
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:42,480
major european countries

1050
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:44,799
in nine different languages analyzed

1051
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,720
thousands of ips and i identified and

1052
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,279
helped

1053
00:32:47,279 --> 00:32:50,559
on hundreds of critical vulnerabilities

1054
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:54,840
when we talk about building passion time

1055
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,000
and when we talk about taking things

1056
00:32:58,000 --> 00:32:58,799
forward

1057
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:00,880
when we talk about making a difference

1058
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,880
the passion time and effort behind these

1059
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,080
initiatives

1060
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,840
to build an international community

1061
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,840
around a common cause

1062
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:11,120
is amazing and i think that everybody

1063
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:11,840
should

1064
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:14,000
give huge thanks to them and everybody

1065
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,279
that's made such a difference in the

1066
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:17,279
battle against kovic 19

1067
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:18,720
because across especially in the cyber

1068
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:21,279
domain it's innovation like this

1069
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:25,760
that makes such a difference

1070
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:29,440
and really in bringing it all together

1071
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,960
there are so many similarities across

1072
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,799
all of the different domains that we

1073
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,039
look at and care about

1074
00:33:37,039 --> 00:33:39,760
when i started off my flying career i

1075
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:41,039
didn't really think that

1076
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,640
a lot of that knowledge and a lot of

1077
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:44,559
that experience i built up there

1078
00:33:44,559 --> 00:33:45,840
would help me in my cyber security

1079
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,240
career

1080
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:50,159
but it was absolutely critical and it

1081
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:52,240
shaped a lot of my thinking both as i've

1082
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,600
gone through the journey and i'm going

1083
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:56,080
forward in this new journey

1084
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,000
and it's the basics such as staying

1085
00:33:58,000 --> 00:33:59,600
absolutely focused

1086
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:02,480
on the fundamentals making sure that

1087
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:04,000
absolutely it doesn't matter

1088
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,240
what your adversaries throw at you you

1089
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:07,440
can keep going back to those

1090
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:08,639
fundamentals

1091
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:10,399
and managing to keep just plugging

1092
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:13,440
through and keeping on the path

1093
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,679
remembering that incidents are just the

1094
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:17,679
tip of the iceberg

1095
00:34:17,679 --> 00:34:18,960
and that we've got to have a great and

1096
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,599
engaged culture to see under the surface

1097
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,320
to understand what the problems are to

1098
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:26,239
understand what the events are

1099
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:27,918
and understand what the ideas might be

1100
00:34:27,918 --> 00:34:30,159
to help see them and actually bringing

1101
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,119
together

1102
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,480
huge amounts of skills knowledge

1103
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:36,879
and thinking of data to really start

1104
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,320
breaking through those stove pipes to

1105
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:38,960
work

1106
00:34:38,960 --> 00:34:41,679
together but to do that we need to

1107
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:42,560
communicate

1108
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,239
collaborate and explore those different

1109
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,719
perspectives and that takes time and

1110
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,800
effort but it is so so valuable in

1111
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:49,839
everything we're trying to do across

1112
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,918
cyber security

1113
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:53,918
because if we can do that we then start

1114
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:55,918
forming those shared perspectives

1115
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,440
and we expand out what looks like our

1116
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,960
horizon and we start forming joint

1117
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,240
horizons

1118
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,000
and it's across those joint horizons

1119
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,599
that we really start making a difference

1120
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:04,560
be that

1121
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:05,920
be that across even the government

1122
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,000
community the industry

1123
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:10,400
community and partnership the research

1124
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:11,680
community the hacker community and the

1125
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,200
international community

1126
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,480
the more that we form those joint

1127
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,800
horizons by working together

1128
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,320
the better it is for everybody as we try

1129
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,000
and tackle the key risks that we have

1130
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:22,000
going forwards

1131
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,839
and really we've got to keep remembering

1132
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:25,520
that winning or losing is not defined by

1133
00:35:25,520 --> 00:35:26,880
our technology

1134
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,240
winning or losing is defined by our

1135
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,800
thinking we're not always going to have

1136
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,720
the best technology we're not always

1137
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:34,720
going to have everything we need

1138
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:37,200
but with creativity and great thinking

1139
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:38,320
and teamwork

1140
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,079
we can actually achieve huge huge

1141
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:42,079
amounts

1142
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:43,680
and in doing that we can really start

1143
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,000
transforming how we defend and move to

1144
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:47,440
that picture where we can really start

1145
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:48,320
defending as

1146
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:51,280
one by weaving together all of that

1147
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:54,240
diverse resource that is out there

1148
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,000
by having capability and perspective

1149
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:58,160
that we can weave into it as well

1150
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,920
building out that clear vision that

1151
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,079
strategy and that culture so we can work

1152
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,280
together

1153
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,480
that's going to allow us to build the

1154
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:06,720
partnerships and the teams that will

1155
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:08,480
allow us to create the opportunities to

1156
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:09,520
understand

1157
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:12,960
and reduce risk proactively and at scale

1158
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:15,119
because as we look forwards our cyber

1159
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:16,800
security challenges are not getting

1160
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,920
smaller

1161
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,520
attacks are getting larger attacks

1162
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,520
getting more complex and attacks are

1163
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,200
impacting larger and larger amounts of

1164
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:25,599
people on critical issues

1165
00:36:25,599 --> 00:36:27,520
we have to be able to keep transfer

1166
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:28,640
transforming

1167
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:31,119
how we think and moving forwards so that

1168
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:34,079
we can defend as well

1169
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:38,560
so thank you very much i really look

1170
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:39,200
forward to

1171
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,640
my next chapter and everybody else's

1172
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:42,960
next chapter and i look forward to

1173
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,720
working with all of you

1174
00:36:44,720 --> 00:36:54,000
thank you
