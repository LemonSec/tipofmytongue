00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,119
everyone i'm mark stream from tx1

4
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,199
networks hi i'm patrick from ts1

5
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:21,920
networks

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,920
today we are honored to have an

7
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,840
opportunity to share with you about our

8
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:28,240
hunts for major league iot accessories

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,880
deep dive into iot suite room in this

10
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,800
talk we will share in detail how we

11
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:33,360
built

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,040
automatic large skill search hunting

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,480
system and give a deep

14
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,719
div into looking into our overall

15
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,440
situation as well as trends we observed

16
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,760
over the past year along with six

17
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,600
hunting example to demonstrate those

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:46,399
strengths

19
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,640
we will share benefit from our research

20
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,719
as well as response to stress

21
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,920
we find and finally the next step

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,120
for our hunting and hunting projects

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,120
who are these one networks here's one is

24
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,879
a joint venture company by trim micro

25
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:01,600
and moza

26
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,760
and we focus on providing cyber defense

27
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,959
and visibility for operational

28
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,560
technologies networks

29
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,720
cher michael has over 30 years security

30
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,159
knowledge in ice

31
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:12,640
and insert research while marsa has over

32
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,720
30 years of rt knowledge

33
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,759
in ics infrastructure and protocols tx1

34
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,040
networks was developed

35
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,880
with least severe security and ot

36
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,240
knowledge

37
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,200
currently i'm the researcher for tx1

38
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,280
focusing on iot ics data

39
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,040
enterprise analytical security and

40
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,320
service search

41
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,560
i have also shared the result of my

42
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,640
security research and major

43
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:35,920
cyber security conference such as

44
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:38,000
hitcons tour hacking a bus conference i

45
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:38,640
say

46
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,840
service credit commerce in asia and i am

47
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,680
also the general coordinator of the

48
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,320
hackers in taiwan conference 2021 become

49
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,439
2021

50
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:50,240
and later my associate patrick will be

51
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:52,079
here to explain some key

52
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,960
uh consultation about our hunger hunting

53
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,520
process

54
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:59,040
works his research uh specially

55
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,200
specialties are malicious payload

56
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,640
malware insurance

57
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,799
and he was this developer of our

58
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:05,680
automatic

59
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,920
analyze process as well as the designer

60
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,200
of our hunting engine and system

61
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,360
and today's outline is basically diving

62
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,800
into the three parts

63
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,959
first we will describe why we want to

64
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:18,400
build an automatic

65
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,959
hunting system and why what a benefit

66
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:21,520
for it

67
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:24,560
and second while we will include today's

68
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,000
focus and an enemy's

69
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,040
anatomy of our hunting system it was not

70
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,800
easy to build an automatic surrounding

71
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,519
system

72
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,200
and it is english power we were fully

73
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,120
share the fundamentals

74
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:39,440
of english construction in the third

75
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:40,800
part we will show

76
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,440
how we use this system by sharing six

77
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,400
examples

78
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:46,640
of discovery from our third hunting and

79
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,519
finally

80
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,239
based on our observations we will

81
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:51,599
outline the next

82
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,319
steps for our for the future of our

83
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,440
ielts hunting systems

84
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,760
introduction first so why did we why did

85
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,879
we decide to create

86
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:04,319
automatic threat hunting systems first

87
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:06,400
we notice the steady increase of iot

88
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:07,920
history and ddw

89
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,840
dos attacks as well as the rapid iot

90
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,319
bonus and mailways

91
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,440
back back when we started golan has just

92
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,000
predicted

93
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,440
that 25 of attacks in 2020 are related

94
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,040
to iot

95
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,040
and other results also predicted the

96
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,680
size of the iot market

97
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,360
and the world will be the 75 billion iot

98
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,360
devices by 2025.

99
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,519
it's considerable that the manual

100
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,519
hunting is no longer possible

101
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,959
on such a lux lock screw so look at the

102
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:41,680
list

103
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:44,000
developing automatically hunting things

104
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,040
like a

105
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,840
good nest up

106
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,159
and what the benefit of automatic

107
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,720
history hunting automatic detection and

108
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,319
real-time blocking

109
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:57,840
of various various rays in

110
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,720
instantly located various straight

111
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:01,920
strands

112
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,480
and search analysis can quickly focus on

113
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,000
the specific stress

114
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,879
and that's one and the cost of human

115
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,560
maintenance is extremely

116
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,040
low and we will show the concept related

117
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,680
to this paper list later

118
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,798
and next next let's talk about the

119
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:22,000
enemy of our hunting system

120
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,639
and to clear show how we create

121
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:25,440
architecture of

122
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,000
iot licensure hunting system we use a

123
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,680
data flow to start

124
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,320
pinpoint our hunting engines are

125
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,560
responsible in

126
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,560
interacting with attack recording all

127
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,960
traffic receive and land standing it on

128
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:39,759
the

129
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,520
hunting engine hunger agent mainly a

130
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,240
great

131
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,960
a great great gate the traffic captured

132
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,479
by multiple engines with

133
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,919
malicious fire and that uh divided the

134
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:53,919
land into male weight or suspicious fire

135
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:54,320
and p

136
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,600
cap after ensuring their integrity in

137
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:58,960
unity of ours

138
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,800
and logo are transformed to the hunting

139
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,479
system cloud

140
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,199
and in step two across the process and

141
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,960
cross and compares

142
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,720
the male weight and peak cap before

143
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,400
uploading land to

144
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,160
iws s3 in step 3 we focus on

145
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:18,720
preliminary analysis of pcap and malware

146
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,840
content

147
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,240
and earth is passed on the session

148
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,120
process again

149
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,840
on url and cnc server the malware

150
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:26,479
browser

151
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,400
is tweeted on hunting engine hourly

152
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,560
instead before the process mainly

153
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,600
produced

154
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,960
list of malicious ip and url which used

155
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,280
to

156
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,240
generate a block list to ensure a visual

157
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:40,639
map

158
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,639
of attacks actually step four and step

159
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,520
five long at the same time and they are

160
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,120
shown spread separately

161
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,639
here for clear t simple to say this step

162
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,560
is response for unknown ignoring

163
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,199
compassion of a male way

164
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,919
step one to step before a all-hourly

165
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:01,360
automatic process

166
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,440
in other words those processes are

167
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,400
basically do not need human intervention

168
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,680
to run from step six

169
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,400
three analysts conduct a manual analysis

170
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,280
of

171
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:15,759
various threats and then produce

172
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:18,400
corresponding threat intelligence

173
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,120
as for step seven it is based on our

174
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,639
implementation of hung

175
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,440
engine against the very various

176
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,720
vulnerabilities

177
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:28,720
some vulnerabilities require us to

178
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,800
modify our hunting engine

179
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,120
at this time we will create a new image

180
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,080
and use one click

181
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,160
invoice deployment and we will show this

182
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,319
later

183
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:41,520
we have deployed more than 350

184
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,880
hundred engines globally but how does

185
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,919
one design

186
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:48,800
and deploy hunting engines to explore it

187
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,919
for us

188
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:54,080
our third hunting expert patrick

189
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,840
hi i'll describe how this is an

190
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:02,160
architecture in this station

191
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,319
when hanker discovers our engine the

192
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,000
first thing we they will do

193
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,160
is try to send attack traffic to our

194
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:09,919
hunting engines

195
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,240
because we want to hunt various protocol

196
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,479
space attacks through hungary engines

197
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,440
we develop and implement multiple iot

198
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:19,599
and ot3 hunting engines

199
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,919
shift traffic handlers help us to assess

200
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:22,639
basic

201
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:24,880
specific protocol pedals to correct

202
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,039
hunting engines

203
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,680
after the action is complete the hunting

204
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,080
handler

205
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,160
it will get the attack pedal from

206
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,759
multiple honey engines

207
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,759
the hunting handler uses the malware

208
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,599
hunting engine to clear malware

209
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,319
or other malicious files from a text

210
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,840
panel

211
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,160
finally hungry handle uploads leads

212
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,160
these pedals and the mirrors to hunt

213
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,160
on the agent for data transferring

214
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,520
here is the simple source code for our

215
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:54,879
hunting engines

216
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,080
a source called shot we added features

217
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,759
to enhance hunting engines

218
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,319
as the left figure showed we added

219
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,639
interaction for different s7 commands to

220
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,039
our

221
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,240
hundred engines this led how the engine

222
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,639
shows just the current response when it

223
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,280
received

224
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,560
specific s7 command as the right feature

225
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,440
shows

226
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,800
we added a fish a feature to

227
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,199
to attack information when attacks

228
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:22,000
interact with

229
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,879
with our honey engines this has at least

230
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:25,280
helps

231
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,000
our hunting system build relationship

232
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,800
tempo

233
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,440
about malware and attack but an attacker

234
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,120
easily

235
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,120
this figure this figure is about the

236
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,399
malware handler of

237
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,799
our hunting engine through the mail

238
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:39,519
handler

239
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:41,440
the hunty engine downloads malware

240
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,799
animations files from

241
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:45,839
a text a text panel as a figure

242
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,240
the hunting header will create process

243
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,720
from a text panel and

244
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:53,440
download animations files because memory

245
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,399
hunting engines

246
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,440
are responsible for for collecting these

247
00:08:57,440 --> 00:09:00,320
malicious files this list is measured

248
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:00,800
files

249
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,120
can be tagged with a text information in

250
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,320
real time

251
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,480
this is text also help us stress the

252
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,680
malware back to

253
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,279
its source here is the process of

254
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,240
uploading the

255
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,320
attacks pedal and malware from the

256
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,959
hunting engines to the hunting system

257
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,320
here is the hunting handler before

258
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,360
uploading the

259
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,040
attacks pedal and the malware to the

260
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,360
hunting system the handheld handler will

261
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,080
transfer

262
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,080
these pedals through the hunting edges

263
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,080
we'll build some tools for our hunting

264
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,519
engines there

265
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,240
there are firewall and split tool to

266
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,680
avoid the hung system

267
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,160
being broken by ddos by those ordered

268
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,200
those attacks

269
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,080
the firewall is responsible to guard and

270
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,279
monitor

271
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:48,080
the accessory history of hunting agent

272
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,360
the final demand keep

273
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,360
external attacks away from the hunting

274
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,720
system

275
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,200
to avoid larger parallel tube impacts

276
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,760
provide performance of honey season

277
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,880
split 2 is is responsible to divide the

278
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,680
original pedal into multiple sections

279
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,720
and low balance and the lowest noble

280
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,279
low balance of hung system can collect

281
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,760
the section which is belong to it

282
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,480
next i will return to mars he will

283
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,279
install the

284
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:19,839
architecture on the aw database clearly

285
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:23,760
thanks patrick and when those files are

286
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,959
uploaded to s3

287
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,120
long downward trip will be triggered to

288
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,640
perform its male weight and session

289
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,160
closer procedures

290
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:31,839
so we're deploying the male rate and

291
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:33,600
station curves to ecs

292
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,360
the hunting system can handle larger

293
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,600
diet hubs from our hunting agent

294
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,240
yet ecs allowed us to overcome a limited

295
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:40,959
economic

296
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:44,160
communication no resources

297
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,640
the memory across the connection status

298
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,079
of the cnc server

299
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,560
and download sample from the server it

300
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:52,959
will always analyze race with the newest

301
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:53,839
material

302
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:56,959
and information from the cnc server

303
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:58,959
since this system browser is responsible

304
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,519
for processing the content of pcapp

305
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,160
well it attempts to find a specific

306
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,640
command injection ui allows and anything

307
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:07,920
else later may be

308
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:11,040
considerably strange

309
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,880
after the hunting system analyze the

310
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,279
pkfml weight its procedure list

311
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,079
of a malicious ip and url at the same

312
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,920
time it will also trigger london to

313
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:21,440
conduct a more in-depth

314
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,399
blacklist production process we will

315
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:25,360
compare it

316
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,839
with a very straight into ensure that

317
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:28,880
our block list

318
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,920
is able to block real attack or bonnet

319
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,959
members

320
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,279
the hunting system will create internal

321
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,560
services to confirm

322
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:40,320
if each ip belongs to azure ip or not

323
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,880
even iep belongs to republic or share

324
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:43,839
the ip

325
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,800
it means that the attacks is hidden

326
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:48,240
behind its ip

327
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,000
and the hunting system will filter

328
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,600
latest ip and to avoid

329
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,959
the ip being inserted into the block

330
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,480
list

331
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,120
in the in the end of this process we

332
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,040
will update the final block list

333
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,160
to s3 to interface with relay

334
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,720
to the productions protection service at

335
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,040
the same time we will visualize

336
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:11,279
like snooze attack on our global three

337
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,519
map

338
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:17,040
our manual analyzer analyzer will create

339
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,680
everything related to main way basically

340
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:21,920
we compare the status of the main way

341
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:23,360
with wireless total

342
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,360
right so the let us know how many

343
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,399
totally new

344
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,959
memories we get from our hunting agent

345
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,480
each hour

346
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,959
such as automatic assassin's automatic

347
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:33,519
process

348
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,440
effectively reduce malware investigation

349
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,519
time spent by our internal search

350
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:42,160
researchers

351
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,120
let's show our normal web receive every

352
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,680
day

353
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:47,760
and we will our answer researcher will

354
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,720
do a lot of time to analyze it

355
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,680
and after analyze and the integration of

356
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,560
relevant

357
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,720
information the complete information

358
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,920
will be sent

359
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,279
back to s3 for subsequent analysis

360
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,120
and you will see this page is used to

361
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,200
asina to query it

362
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,440
and three analysis will

363
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,760
more deeply automate the content based

364
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,639
on our signal

365
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,519
let they want to hunt and analyze

366
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:18,639
accurately

367
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:21,120
find the facilities the entire list of

368
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:22,160
analyses

369
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,399
for example every day we monitor

370
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:26,000
international information security

371
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:26,639
incident

372
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,240
and the status of a malabiadis

373
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,079
notification and release

374
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:32,079
we will conduct a deep endless a

375
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:33,279
different analysis

376
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,920
of loss rates and determined whether or

377
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,639
not

378
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:39,120
we need to update our hunting engine

379
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:41,120
around the world to ensure that we

380
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,920
are capable to detecting those race

381
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,120
and the last depth of the whole process

382
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,760
this is a function set up to strong land

383
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:52,720
our

384
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,079
on automatic process in response to

385
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,600
constantly up updated um trades we often

386
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,920
need to deploy the new hunting engine

387
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:02,959
image to our

388
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:05,839
hunting systems in order to make it

389
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:06,800
clear

390
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,519
we have prepared one click deployed

391
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:11,440
video demo for display

392
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,839
this video starts from one click

393
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:14,560
deployment

394
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,240
and run step one to simplify

395
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:18,320
automatically

396
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,839
and here is our video demo

397
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,880
so this is our architectural review

398
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,800
again

399
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,880
and step one we will deploy our new

400
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,000
hunting engine

401
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:35,199
with a new image here no me image here

402
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:38,320
no instance here and we use our to check

403
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,680
our um video here so here we will

404
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:44,480
check our um configuration json file and

405
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,240
make sure all we need to deploy

406
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,560
10 new hunting engines and we try to

407
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,800
deport release

408
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,839
for red hat so we create 10 instance and

409
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,760
the slowing stance will deploy to the

410
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:56,959
global instance

411
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,880
now so here we just review this again

412
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,880
and we find a running the following

413
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,079
instance well to

414
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:07,040
10 devices so there are 10 devices out

415
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,959
there wrong instance

416
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,519
and it's our new image and then the data

417
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,000
will flow

418
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,639
to collect data and from home to the

419
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:15,760
hanging agent

420
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,959
so in our agent we'll click load the

421
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:19,680
capitals

422
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:23,680
file image log and any every information

423
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,040
well um just to transmit to our hunger

424
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:27,760
agent

425
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:30,880
and to analyze to generalize it

426
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,480
so in this process they usually live

427
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:35,360
around one hour 1.5 hours because they

428
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:36,399
need to collect

429
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,120
visibility to our global global our

430
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,160
global

431
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:44,160
arm hunger engines and then just like to

432
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,000
check our

433
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:49,040
upload to s3 and this s3 bucket will

434
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,959
trigger lambda and trigger to our

435
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:53,360
emr container and do the memory and

436
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:54,800
station browser

437
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,959
and in the session closer and for the

438
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:59,120
session counselor he will upload and

439
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:03,040
try to um download the pcap and try to

440
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:06,839
um cross the session and to build a new

441
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:10,079
session and transaction log and to run

442
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,360
our

443
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:14,480
analyze process so i'm i'm sorry for

444
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:14,800
that

445
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,800
we need to mask some information because

446
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,279
it is for us it's a very sensitive data

447
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,839
so we cannot disclose late but we still

448
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:23,600
want to um discuss some

449
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:27,040
our um hunting process with guys so

450
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:29,680
so we we should use masks every

451
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,399
information

452
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,600
of here so we are wrong

453
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,240
sealer i'm sorry so many login here in

454
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,680
the wrong session browser

455
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:40,160
and after the session crowds do list and

456
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:41,600
he will store the data

457
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:44,880
to the s3 bucket again so we will have

458
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,240
a let the data analyze data and

459
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,440
and to um to our sm bucket and then when

460
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:53,199
that time will trigger our um

461
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:56,160
london again when the data located here

462
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,839
to progress here

463
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:00,000
to our hunter hollows and we'll trigger

464
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,360
our um london

465
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:05,520
to run the um our um

466
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:09,280
ioc generator ioc process

467
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:12,640
so here is well we'll trigger our um

468
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,959
devices here so it's locus

469
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:20,240
and it is here we will make sure our

470
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:23,520
output up location and we'll trigger

471
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,079
some

472
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:28,000
instance to run the ecs and emr

473
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,840
to run it in different process in this

474
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,360
process

475
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,320
in this process will generate ic ioc

476
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:34,799
list

477
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,360
or black list again but in this process

478
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,480
they will um

479
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,360
compare more signature more so intel

480
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:42,640
internal

481
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,200
internal cell intelligence again and try

482
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,160
to figure out

483
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:49,200
the materials um blacklist the ip block

484
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:49,840
ip

485
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:53,039
is real attack or bonnet member

486
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:55,440
so we we do a lot of inter things to

487
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,679
compare and to make sure this ip this

488
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,000
information is real

489
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,039
and then we will install to our

490
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,480
export data and check out this hour

491
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,960
and we will find all our pocket already

492
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,600
deployed

493
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:12,720
and we can create this quickly of which

494
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,919
signature and which ip address for what

495
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:18,799
for block which i prefer blacklist and

496
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:20,000
we can also choose

497
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:23,520
um for our analyzer and sorry analysis

498
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,559
to to do this and like a black hat image

499
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:29,600
it's a new image and we modify the

500
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:32,320
hunting engine location to the black

501
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:32,799
head

502
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:36,240
but in real in normal hunting engine

503
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:38,960
they will um they were wrong this is

504
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:39,840
normal

505
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,320
hong kong region like um maybe from

506
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,039
canada from china from everywhere

507
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,679
so we just want to trigger lease and

508
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:49,840
step five and more men will analyze when

509
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,120
railway locate

510
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:53,200
upload to s3 and make it a successful

511
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,600
flag they will trigger as some market

512
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:56,000
and to

513
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,480
run the container and this process level

514
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,760
around our scanner

515
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,880
to compare with virus total to make sure

516
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,400
everything is is which one is unknown or

517
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,600
no and male way

518
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,240
and which main way we need to um head

519
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:11,440
over to our three

520
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,160
researchers to analyze it and also we

521
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:14,720
can use

522
00:19:14,720 --> 00:19:17,760
um signal to create it to compare

523
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,240
to the right turtle which one is no one

524
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,240
or how many vendors which

525
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:25,280
or known male way english asthenia

526
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:27,679
table it's very quickly also we will use

527
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,160
the if lost a male is unknown

528
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:32,240
we will run our internal process to send

529
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,679
our analyzer

530
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:37,440
and to do the more um research

531
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:41,120
so this is our i'm sure is our um

532
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:44,559
process to the show is and just to recap

533
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,640
our highlight of our iot access hunting

534
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,600
systems

535
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,360
and first one our hunting engine can

536
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:52,080
hunt more than 30 protocols across

537
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:55,360
across iot and ics and for dynamic

538
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,840
adjustment the system can automatically

539
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:58,559
dynamic

540
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,280
adjustment and this process based on

541
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,960
hourly traffic size

542
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,760
and we do not need dedicate a lot of

543
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:07,120
powerful machine

544
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:10,960
to do data processing this is called

545
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,080
cut down costs and indeed analysis

546
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,080
allowed us to provide external

547
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,400
externally um critical and deep

548
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,039
information about cyber strains

549
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:23,360
and one click deployment which you just

550
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,240
said each

551
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,159
solid and and our um we

552
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:30,159
we have classified a large number of

553
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,559
payload through our classification

554
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:35,440
mechanism and the parallel of the same

555
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:36,640
type of attack

556
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,320
um after they aggregate together to help

557
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:40,640
us

558
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:43,840
to uh to help us identify no one an

559
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:46,960
unknown attack situation in a short time

560
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:50,159
due to the time construction constraints

561
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:53,280
we will not explain more about payload

562
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,840
classification at least time

563
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:59,120
also on cost reduction

564
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,440
cost reduce allow us to continue to

565
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:02,559
improve

566
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:05,600
research we want to do

567
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,559
and after introduce our hunting system

568
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:08,960
let's

569
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,320
quickly see six hunting examples to see

570
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,600
what this intelligence can do

571
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,960
first ioc hunting service from september

572
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,320
2019 to the first week of october 2020

573
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,240
we analyzed true 20 plus tv of traffic

574
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:30,080
in fact if we come to all the way back

575
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,880
to the beginning of 2019 our energies

576
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:33,840
will exist

577
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,000
45 tb of data which is also due to the

578
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,280
plus pressure modulation of our archaea

579
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:42,960
and attack situation

580
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:47,039
however we make sure this from september

581
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,480
follows um 20 tv traffic

582
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,840
will have detected over 1.2 billion

583
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:56,799
attacks from over 200 countries

584
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,159
and we hung over 70 million this team

585
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:01,760
malicious ig

586
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:06,799
and 15 distinct suspicious demands

587
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,360
then after indeed analysis of hunting

588
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,240
systems

589
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,640
we successfully blocked 37 plus million

590
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,799
malicious ips

591
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:19,919
and 2.1 plus medium malicious demand

592
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,120
find 1.4 plus million past possible

593
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,559
bonding devices

594
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,600
and find 2.6 plus million piece

595
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,960
of mailway also

596
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,520
um on average about three million

597
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,440
attacks are detained per day

598
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:39,679
more than 117 seventeen thousand

599
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:42,720
malicious ip are detected per day and we

600
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,159
block more than

601
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:47,600
93 thousands malicious ip every day

602
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:51,120
it's a very big number second

603
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,000
global bond analysis and alert this is

604
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:54,799
chance of

605
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:57,600
of bonnet measure by date and our

606
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,000
definition is that when attacks want to

607
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,360
separate or infect

608
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:04,240
externally we define it as part of my

609
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,039
net

610
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:08,400
it consists here let us are all

611
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,480
trying download suspicious script or

612
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,159
mailway from other

613
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:15,280
source in various phones

614
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:18,880
trying to carry out various privileges

615
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:22,080
or controlling behavior

616
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,880
you see real case we provide consumers

617
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:25,360
three

618
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,640
a lot to public for example when we

619
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,440
detect some

620
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,919
attacks from taiwan's government service

621
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:32,559
network

622
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:34,640
we perform energies and provide feedback

623
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,080
to consumers

624
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,960
who had to reach out a emergency

625
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,440
response

626
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,799
and here are some basic um counts like

627
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:47,600
top 10 countries with the most devices

628
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:48,799
on bonnets

629
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,760
top 10 attack source country and top 10

630
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:52,960
attracted countries

631
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:56,400
just for reference absurd the anonymous

632
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,679
plague

633
00:23:57,679 --> 00:24:00,640
here we see the total number of ignorant

634
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:01,840
piece of mailway

635
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,120
hunt per day on average we hunt more

636
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,159
than

637
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,120
12 hundred piece of mailway in a day

638
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,000
however

639
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:13,520
during um from january to april 2020

640
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,440
the number of unknown male weight was

641
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,720
much smaller

642
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:19,279
regardless later this may be related to

643
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,799
global culminating situation

644
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,559
however but um if we look at the

645
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,679
normal ratio predict we will find that

646
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:32,400
the difference is not the lead big which

647
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:32,799
is

648
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:37,360
in line with the overall trend we see

649
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,679
and you will find that the number of our

650
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:40,559
normal way

651
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:43,679
in the front is very scary scary

652
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,200
but after removing duplicates and

653
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,559
leaving only erf files unless will be

654
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:51,520
about

655
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,279
18 thousand unique unknown male weight

656
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:57,760
frequently speaking its number is still

657
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,120
very large

658
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:03,039
but in terms of architecture i3a6

659
00:25:03,039 --> 00:25:07,760
on and makes their account for the build

660
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,039
of course we will conduct simple

661
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,200
automatic analysis on

662
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,640
way we find or manual analysis

663
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,400
sometimes you will find a lot of

664
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,279
interesting things

665
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:25,600
and further let's take a look one day on

666
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,520
your mountability hunting

667
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:30,640
with so many vulnerabilities how do we

668
00:25:30,640 --> 00:25:31,600
know

669
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,400
on the status of one day multiplicities

670
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,799
so we create a signature for various

671
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:37,919
vulnerabilities and

672
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:41,039
observe whether there is any change in

673
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,279
the tram

674
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,840
for example here's a chart showing an

675
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,120
increasing trend of

676
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,440
web remote file execution if you see

677
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:50,960
password

678
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,000
so it's always well monthly or

679
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:57,200
unlikely to keep which was quite well

680
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:57,840
known late

681
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,240
last year blue keeps showing very high

682
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:03,039
trend at the end of the last year

683
00:26:03,039 --> 00:26:04,960
and it sure decreased it at the

684
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,159
beginning of this year

685
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,640
however for unknown attacks or

686
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,840
vulnerabilities

687
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,200
we regularly classify various parallels

688
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:18,080
and automatically send out the mail so

689
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,080
let us trade analysts can quickly

690
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,279
determine whether lay a new attack will

691
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:24,080
not

692
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,760
so we will just need to feel the loss

693
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,279
parallel we can find

694
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,919
we can check at least it's unknown or

695
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,520
some which one might abilities will

696
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,158
be find it

697
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:37,600
 attack transactions as early

698
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:38,000
warning

699
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:40,320
systems understand it's true for

700
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:42,240
different protocols such as a

701
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,679
squishier telnet

702
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,120
or http but for example in calnet

703
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:52,240
we will find some information here

704
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,559
like it's very high we will monitor what

705
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:57,760
happening about a telenet protocol

706
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,320
or http such as a trend graph help us

707
00:27:00,320 --> 00:27:01,760
quickly classify

708
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:04,960
when we find that amount of attacks on

709
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,240
a particular protocol increasing we will

710
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,200
quickly coverage

711
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,200
and conduct in cape investigations

712
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,240
and regulate regarding

713
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:19,200
the next generation of threats we have

714
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,640
also observed a

715
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,600
increasing trend of detection or attack

716
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:24,159
traffic

717
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:28,000
against iocs or scada protocols

718
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:31,600
so in our determinate the detachment has

719
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:33,120
included hunting

720
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:35,919
based on the content of the protocols

721
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:36,880
for example

722
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,200
the workshop screen on the right is part

723
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,240
of our hunt

724
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:43,600
is our pcap so you will find our

725
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:45,760
signature will recognize it's a robust

726
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,440
protocol also welcome categorize it

727
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:52,320
and finally what are the next steps for

728
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,399
the next generation iot history hunting

729
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:55,919
systems

730
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:59,440
so mostly i'm focusing on iot and ics

731
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,159
rate

732
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:02,720
and recurring observation about overall

733
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,279
chance

734
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,360
we expect to bring the complete

735
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:06,399
industrial

736
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:09,840
4.0 environment into our hunting systems

737
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,240
of course certainly betterment will

738
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,360
never stop

739
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:16,480
for a short turn we plan to input

740
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,600
import real ics and scala environment

741
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:22,960
to our hunky engine and use related um

742
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:26,399
technology to enable our hunting engines

743
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:29,120
around the world to interface with real

744
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:31,520
attacks

745
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,840
and in the long term the rear devices is

746
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:35,840
sometimes difficult to maintain

747
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,960
so it's bad to use visualize a high

748
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:41,679
interaction hunting engines in the

749
00:28:41,679 --> 00:28:43,039
future

750
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:46,480
so next we will share demo of our height

751
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:46,880
into

752
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:51,360
action and engine sample we built

753
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:55,279
and we will take on s7 sims x7 as a

754
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,320
sample

755
00:28:56,320 --> 00:28:58,480
and the first one was compart but it

756
00:28:58,480 --> 00:28:59,360
does not meet

757
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:02,399
our needs contract can response the um

758
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:05,200
to the scan from a map but cannot um

759
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:06,240
conduct deep

760
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,360
interactions so you will if you read or

761
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:09,760
write

762
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:13,440
well failed but the example we provide

763
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,320
here is highly interactive hunting

764
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:16,880
engine

765
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:19,760
that means some our needs so you can you

766
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,559
can use a map

767
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,720
and you can use uh radio right coming

768
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,480
with sims a7

769
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,120
so this will be help us to um hunt

770
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,399
something

771
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:32,399
by attackers so you can use a map

772
00:29:32,399 --> 00:29:33,600
scanner anymore

773
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,679
and more many times and you will

774
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,279
recognize this is a real

775
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,720
um you are like it's like a real um 7

776
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:43,279
plc

777
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:47,200
also the next generation of our hunting

778
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,399
engine will be

779
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:52,240
co-extended with our iot honey engine

780
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:55,360
fully coveraging the scope of iiot

781
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:58,080
but for more in-depth analysis for

782
00:29:58,080 --> 00:29:59,520
in-depth we will

783
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,960
do many research on machine learning for

784
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:06,159
traffic analysis and malware analyses

785
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:08,880
so we believe believefully can make our

786
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,080
hunting more

787
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:14,880
precise and now close the remarks

788
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:18,080
um we believe three terms

789
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:20,559
um first one is automatic street hunting

790
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,320
system is very

791
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:25,679
excellent too to help us to hunt

792
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,200
the continuously expansion of iot and

793
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:29,840
iot

794
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:34,320
rates and here's six example of a chance

795
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,360
for our hunt are only a small product of

796
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,520
the results ever

797
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:42,320
available in the hunting systems so this

798
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,840
is still more treasures

799
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:47,039
waiting for us to discover

800
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:48,799
and the next generation of straight ir

801
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,720
history is coming so an early

802
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:52,640
preparation is a way to deal with

803
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:57,440
it we believe it will be degree update

804
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,440
and this is the end of our our

805
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,600
presentation and thanks for listening

find a white paper in our

810
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,720
official website so this is a joint

811
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,399
venture research is

812
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:16,399
joining me research by trump tx100

813
