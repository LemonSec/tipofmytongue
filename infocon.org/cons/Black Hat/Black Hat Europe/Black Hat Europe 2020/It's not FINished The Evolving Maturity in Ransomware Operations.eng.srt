2
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,840
good morning ladies and gentlemen my

3
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,680
name is mitchell clark i'm joined by tom

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:20,640
paul

5
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,119
today we'll be talking about ransomware

6
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:24,560
attackers that we've seen in europe and

7
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:25,199
globally

8
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,960
in 2020. it's been a big year for

9
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,279
ransomware i feel like every other day

10
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,000
we have a

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,399
new story about a company being affected

12
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,280
in the media

13
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,280
uh devastating consequences large

14
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,680
ransoms and large payouts so

15
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,920
today we'll be talking about two two

16
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,040
groups reveal

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,879
and doppel payment we'll be talking

18
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,079
about their

19
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,320
uh changing tradecraft the evolution of

20
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,640
their operations and development of

21
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:50,239
your ransomware as a service and and

22
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:52,000
some predictions into what happens

23
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,280
uh into 2021 and going forward

24
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,000
uh i'm with mandiant based in the uk

25
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,680
i've been with mandiat for two and a

26
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:01,359
half years now i'm coming across from

27
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,039
australia and australian government

28
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:06,720
and i'll hand you across to tom

29
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:10,240
hi everyone i'm tom hall blank mitch i'm

30
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:11,840
a principal consultant based here in the

31
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,080
uk needs a response team

32
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,080
i've been imaging now for five years and

33
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,439
i head up our europeans

34
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,880
response function i'm going to start

35
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:22,080
today by giving you guys

36
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,600
an overview of what we're seeing from

37
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,720
trends and operations over the years

38
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,640
as you can see here from the top left we

39
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,560
have self-propagating malware

40
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,439
so this is uh like wannacry not patcher

41
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:35,360
uh somebody executes it in environments

42
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:37,439
and it's one like it's behavior

43
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:39,360
there's no control over it and the

44
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:40,560
actors don't know

45
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,079
where it's going to move to which

46
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:44,000
networks which domains

47
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:45,759
are joined to the environment they're

48
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,759
executing their knowledge

49
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:48,960
this can be very difficult when they

50
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,880
have large blowouts like we've seen in

51
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,320
news

52
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,759
we've then seen a move towards one

53
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:56,240
manual destination because of this

54
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,040
this broadly falls into two counts you

55
00:01:59,040 --> 00:01:59,520
have

56
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,240
pretty wide-ranging uh top untargeted

57
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,520
campaigns so kind of

58
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,079
spray and pray if you'd like typically

59
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,280
using things like

60
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,399
exploit kits hoping to get lucky by

61
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:13,120
putting out as many places as possible

62
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,400
on the chances that

63
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,760
one victim organization will get

64
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:17,840
compromised

65
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,200
what we're going to focus on really is

66
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,879
on the targeting deployments

67
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:23,840
so these are operators who are following

68
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,480
kind of

69
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,680
an apt-style life cycle so

70
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:30,160
they have a number of organizations

71
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,680
they're targeting

72
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,360
but their campaigns will be very

73
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,519
specific to each organization

74
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,120
usually things like fishing campaigns

75
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:40,800
there are two spheres really this falls

76
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,440
in you have kind of self-managed

77
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,239
operators

78
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,720
so they'll go through that initial phase

79
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:49,120
of compromise and sales

80
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,560
they'll get persistent within the

81
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,800
environments they'll move around

82
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,400
they'll execute the ransom and then

83
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,080
they'll put the demands through to the

84
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:58,800
victim organization themselves what

85
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,920
we're going to focus on

86
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,040
is on the partnership models so these

87
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,200
are operators who will target a number

88
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,480
of organizations

89
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,159
and then sell on access to ransomware

90
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,599
developers

91
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,720
we're going to talk you through kind of

92
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,200
two uh two different styles that we see

93
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,560
so we have kind of ransomware as a

94
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:17,040
service whereas a platform that the

95
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,800
operator has and they sell access

96
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,120
through that the ransomware developer

97
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,800
doesn't have to do too much hard work by

98
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,400
themselves

99
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:26,720
and the second one will be kind of

100
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,640
selling on of access only so the

101
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,319
ransomware developer gets access to an

102
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:30,959
environment

103
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,560
but after that it's completely up to

104
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,680
them how they deal with them

105
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,319
so as i said we're going to be looking

106
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,159
at apt-style like

107
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,879
intrusions now what's important i guess

108
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:44,799
to cover is what does that look like for

109
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,560
an organization

110
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,239
well more than likely they're going to

111
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,680
have domain admin access to your

112
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:50,720
environment

113
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,560
this means they can move around freely

114
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,239
execute their tooling

115
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:55,840
in order to remove that access we have

116
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,319
to take pretty broad ranging changes

117
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:00,239
such as an enterprise-wide password

118
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,879
reset to remove that access

119
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,280
they'll probably have back doors across

120
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,519
the environment in multiple forms

121
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:09,040
so i have to run an investigation or

122
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,959
just find all that access to remove this

123
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,200
and they've probably taken some form of

124
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,478
data with them

125
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,639
usually in these campaigns there always

126
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:19,918
is the threat that

127
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,280
we have data as well as encryption now

128
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,680
there are regulatory and reputational

129
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,520
repercussions because of this

130
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:29,520
as a business we need to understand what

131
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,720
data is left

132
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,280
has it even left at all in order to be

133
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,239
able to cut this off

134
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,520
now we had on the ransomware angle well

135
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,120
we have exactly the same issues with a

136
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:43,199
traditional apt-style intrusion

137
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,440
except all of your ic infrastructure is

138
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,759
probably not functional

139
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,880
you may want to recover systems but

140
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,280
basic things like the environments you

141
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,840
build systems from may not be working

142
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,280
you may not be able to even pull out

143
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,960
patches on an automated basis like you

144
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,320
would normally do

145
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,680
this would make it really difficult to

146
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,759
perform recovery in the environment

147
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,919
in this manner and then we have the

148
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:07,520
business side of it

149
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,840
we've seen in 2020 lots of organizations

150
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:10,800
across europe

151
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,520
who after being ransomed on day one

152
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,639
haven't been able to function as a

153
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:15,919
business

154
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,199
this could be a real problem for the

155
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:19,759
board because particularly if you're

156
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,120
relying on specific income set times

157
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,759
maybe you're servicing clients this can

158
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,360
be very difficult for a business to

159
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,440
operate under

160
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,000
and now what makes this even more

161
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,520
difficult is we have to deal with these

162
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,080
two issues at the same time

163
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,919
we can't just solve the problem by

164
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,160
recovering all of our systems

165
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,800
yes okay we may get initial um

166
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,759
functioning

167
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,400
of the business but we still have the

168
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,680
looming threat that somebody's within

169
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:48,720
your environment

170
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,360
for access to it so we have to both work

171
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,479
an investigation

172
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:54,000
and start to recover the business in

173
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,080
tandem it's not until we get two of

174
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,680
these pieces working together

175
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,360
we can really remove the problem of

176
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,919
ransomware

177
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,240
so that's the overview uh mitch now is

178
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,360
going to talk you through one of the

179
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,680
groups that we see operates in regal

180
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,280
and go through that in a bit more detail

181
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,000
thank you tom so let's get into rival

182
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,600
reveal are interesting because they run

183
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,080
a ransomware as a service platform

184
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,520
a platform with many different

185
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,840
affiliates or other attackers that join

186
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,240
in

187
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,000
to to use the same malware and use the

188
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,560
same platform so rival first appeared in

189
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,479
early 2019 and was created by an

190
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:29,840
attacker called unknown

191
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,080
unknown began recruiting for other

192
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,680
affiliates other attackers to come and

193
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,120
join the platform

194
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,560
the benefit for the affiliate is they

195
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,560
get access to the automation

196
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,080
functionality of the platform but the

197
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:41,759
downside is they have to pay for that so

198
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,039
they're only able to keep

199
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,199
a little bit of their payouts that they

200
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,120
extort from their victims

201
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,960
so why would an affiliate do this why

202
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,479
would an affiliate join into a

203
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,800
ransomware as a service platform

204
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,560
the answer is the platform provides a

205
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:56,160
whole bunch of efficiencies

206
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,400
and gains that in traditional ransomware

207
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,479
operations would be very

208
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,520
time intensive a lot of effort for for

209
00:07:03,520 --> 00:07:04,720
these groups

210
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,800
so the platform provides the affiliate

211
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,800
with the ability to generate malware

212
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,800
certain akibi malware in the case of

213
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,800
rival it lets the affiliate

214
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,199
set their ransom demands and do and

215
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:17,199
conduct negotiations with the with the

216
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,880
victim organization

217
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,759
it lets them extort and and prove to the

218
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:23,440
victim that they've stolen data

219
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,560
and ransomware them um so there's a

220
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,759
threat from the rival groups that the

221
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:30,880
attackers will release

222
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,360
stolen data to the general public and

223
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,039
lastly there's a coin laundering service

224
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,199
so any bitcoin or monero

225
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,360
paid into the platform can be obfuscated

226
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,319
and transferred to

227
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:43,120
to different wallets to pa as part of

228
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,360
you know a laundering process to reduce

229
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,080
the risk

230
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,840
to the affiliate that someone can trace

231
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:51,199
their coins when they cash out

232
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,520
um so the real crew used a piece of

233
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,000
malware called sodomy we won't cover the

234
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,759
ins and outs of it here it deserves its

235
00:07:57,759 --> 00:07:58,479
own talk

236
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,240
but essentially it's it's very good

237
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,479
malware it leaves networks largely

238
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:03,599
functional and that's a key

239
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:04,960
differentiator between different

240
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,800
ransomware groups and reaval

241
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,720
arrival deployment will typically leave

242
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,639
a network running systems will still be

243
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,560
online because the ransomware doesn't

244
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,680
target

245
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:16,319
system files system extensions so this

246
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,520
makes it easier for

247
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,800
victims to recover from a ransomware

248
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,960
event if they pay and if they're able to

249
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:26,720
get that decryption tool

250
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,160
being an affiliate model time to

251
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,000
ransomware deployment varies between the

252
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,800
different

253
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,679
individual affiliates some choose to

254
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,559
only encrypt

255
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,640
or deploy ransomware to small parts of

256
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,080
victim organizations

257
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,679
but other affiliates choose to take

258
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,440
their time and gain access to the

259
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,200
entirety of a corporate network we're

260
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,720
talking different domains

261
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,240
different network segments you know

262
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,839
global lateral movement

263
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,839
into the rest of the organization and

264
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,200
mass deployment of

265
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,279
the southern nakibu ransomware across

266
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:54,800
the entire fleet so devastating

267
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,959
devastating ransomware deployment

268
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,720
of concern or interestingly um

269
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,000
some of the affiliates seem to have a

270
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,320
backlog of victims mandiant is a

271
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,640
incident response company with a global

272
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:08,640
presence so we deal with lots of victims

273
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,640
around the globe and sometimes we see an

274
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,320
affiliate working through their victim

275
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,200
backlog

276
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,360
we'll see them prioritize and triage

277
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,560
potentially based on

278
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:17,920
revenue how much they think they'll get

279
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:20,000
out of the victim publicity

280
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,200
and a whole bunch of other factors

281
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,839
presumably um to to choose who

282
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:28,080
is who they're going to ransom first

283
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:29,920
so that's a bit about the platform uh

284
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:31,279
it's remarkable uh

285
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,120
in terms of development and how

286
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,720
ransomware crews are

287
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,720
evolving now let's talk about how

288
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,240
arrival breach

289
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,240
will occur what steps the attackers will

290
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:42,320
take and what tradecraft we see

291
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,360
and again we're talking about an

292
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:45,760
affiliate model here so each affiliate

293
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,200
will conduct their breach

294
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,760
differently so we've bought all of the

295
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,040
tradecraft that we've seen from the

296
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,800
different affiliates all into one

297
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,839
one talk one section so

298
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,080
what's also interesting about rival is

299
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,880
that they're

300
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,680
conducting mass exploitation against a

301
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:04,000
whole bunch of organizations at once so

302
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,360
they're gaining access to many many

303
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,279
different organizations using high

304
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:08,800
profile vulnerabilities

305
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,880
that came out you know late 2019 early

306
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,160
2020.

307
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,279
these vulnerabilities got a lot of no

308
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,279
attention in the infosec community

309
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:18,720
because of their severity

310
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,880
they essentially allow unauthenticated

311
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:21,920
remote access

312
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:24,399
to that edge device so when we're when

313
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,160
we're saying edge devices we're talking

314
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,800
vpns sharepoint servers remote desktop

315
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:29,920
servers

316
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:32,079
remote access applications like citrix

317
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:34,880
so all of those

318
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:36,800
types of edge devices had really high

319
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,839
profile and high critical

320
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:39,120
vulnerabilities

321
00:10:39,120 --> 00:10:41,040
rival exploited them you know weeks and

322
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:42,800
months after those vulnerabilities came

323
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,560
out so it's not like we're talking about

324
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,959
a vulnerability coming out on monday and

325
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,279
rival mass exploiting and gaining access

326
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,880
to a whole bunch of organizations using

327
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,399
that vulnerability

328
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:54,640
on the tuesday we're talking weeks and

329
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,640
months after these vulnerabilities come

330
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:57,519
out

331
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,040
rebels also gaining access to

332
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,800
organizations through third parties

333
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:03,200
and this is another evolution in the

334
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:05,120
ransomware

335
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,680
playbook it comes straight from the apt

336
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,240
playbook

337
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:10,959
in 2017 we saw operation cloudhopper

338
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:13,440
come out from pwc and bae which exposed

339
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,320
a whole bunch of

340
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,360
apt-10 chinese group a whole bunch of

341
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,040
activity from from those folk

342
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:20,480
where they were compromising victims

343
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,160
through managed service providers

344
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,760
so we saw that that trust and that

345
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,360
third-party relationship being leveraged

346
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,560
there to gain access

347
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,200
and here we see reeval doing it in 2020

348
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:29,760
rival

349
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:33,120
uh getting extra victims by leveraging

350
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:33,839
that trust

351
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,640
that domain um into connectivity that

352
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,360
networking

353
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,680
interconnectivity and moving laterally

354
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,320
into those other organizations we also

355
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,839
see traditional methods of compromise

356
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:45,360
you know credential stuffing password

357
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,200
spraying as well as phishing against

358
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,440
organizations

359
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,120
so after getting initial access most of

360
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:52,880
the reveal affiliates will spend a

361
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,519
little bit of time establishing foothold

362
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:57,440
so this could be installing malware on a

363
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:58,800
few extra systems

364
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,680
it could be continuing to abuse the vpn

365
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,920
or the remote desktop

366
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,880
exposed system or the citrix farm on the

367
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,320
edge

368
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,200
as well as deploying web shells so again

369
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,480
straight out of the apt

370
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,320
playbook you don't want to have a single

371
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,480
access method into an organization

372
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:19,200
you want several so so the attackers are

373
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,720
shoring up their access

374
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,200
to victim orgs this is where we'll

375
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,320
usually see a pause

376
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:25,920
for some of these affiliates that have a

377
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,399
lot of victims and a mass exploiting a

378
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,480
whole bunch of organizations

379
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,000
and this is essentially to leave them on

380
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,680
the shelf and come back to them later

381
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:36,320
when they're ready so when they do come

382
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,680
back we see

383
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,880
again the typical apt style escalation

384
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,800
of privileges so the attackers need

385
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,800
domain admin or a service account with

386
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,560
you know admin privileges to be able to

387
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:47,120
continue

388
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,040
continue their operations and move

389
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,560
laterally within the environment

390
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,519
so seeing standard uh apt tools we're

391
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:54,000
standing

392
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,839
seeing standard penetration testing

393
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:57,680
tools being used by these groups

394
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,320
such as mimikats processdump and we're

395
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,600
also seeing the attackers leverage

396
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,120
passwords stored in places they

397
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,000
shouldn't be like

398
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:06,560
group policy preferences or maybe maybe

399
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,600
in scripts

400
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,040
on group on domain shares or simply

401
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,519
passwords being stored by users where

402
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:14,639
they shouldn't be you know

403
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,079
in text files on their desktop or

404
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,399
spreadsheets or whatnot

405
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,880
so once the rival attacker is is

406
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,519
privileged

407
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,200
they are now just as privileged as any

408
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,880
admin within the environment

409
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,399
we're seeing them step into the

410
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,399
reconnaissance phase where they'll use

411
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,160
you know open source or commercial or

412
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,760
freemium network scanners

413
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,240
to map out the victim estate to

414
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,600
understand how

415
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,519
big the environment is what are the

416
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,040
trust relationships

417
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:41,600
how would the attacker move globally to

418
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,079
gain access to the rest of the network

419
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:46,000
to enumerate the windows active

420
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,279
directory environment they're using

421
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,079
bloodhound

422
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:49,440
everyone's using bloodhound is such a

423
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,440
great tool to map out those domain

424
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:51,920
trusts

425
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,839
pull all you know computer information

426
00:13:53,839 --> 00:13:55,120
and user information

427
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,519
it's a really great tool to understand

428
00:13:57,519 --> 00:14:00,639
the structure of a domain

429
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,440
after reconning the network it's time

430
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,040
for the attacker to

431
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,480
establish more presence within the

432
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,160
environment and to do this they have to

433
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,040
move laterally

434
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:11,279
so after discovering the environment

435
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:13,199
it's now time to go move across to that

436
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,160
environment

437
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,839
and the tools we see being used to

438
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,000
conduct it conduct this

439
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
are the same tools that we see you know

440
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
north korean attackers use chinese

441
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,079
attackers use russian attackers use

442
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:26,720
we're talking wmi exec and smb exec from

443
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:28,000
from impact we're seeing

444
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,480
crack map exec which is essentially a

445
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,360
remote

446
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,600
process execution tool ps exec for

447
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,959
microsoft as well as

448
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,040
remote desktop to move laterally and log

449
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,399
in to additional systems in the

450
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,880
environment

451
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,800
so we're not seeing crazy tradecraft but

452
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,839
it's effective and it works

453
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,160
so after scanning the environment it's

454
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:50,240
now time for the attacker to set up shop

455
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:51,920
in these extra networks they've gained

456
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,360
access to

457
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,519
so to maintain presence again it depends

458
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,519
by affiliate some affiliates are using

459
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,600
cloud remote desktop software this is

460
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,120
remote desktop software that lets you

461
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,199
log into a system across the internet so

462
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,560
things like

463
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,680
teamviewer anydesk log me in those sorts

464
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:08,399
of

465
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,639
software tools we're also seeing use of

466
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,079
cobalt strike beacons some

467
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:14,560
malware sorry some attackers some real

468
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:16,720
affiliates prefer to use cobalt strike

469
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,480
while others prefer to use web shells or

470
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,480
to continue abusing those legitimate

471
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,079
services that they've gained access to

472
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:24,079
lac vpn lac

473
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,639
on-premise virtual remote desktop

474
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,320
appliances

475
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,600
so this is where we usually see the

476
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,519
second pause so the first pause was

477
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:32,800
after gaining initial access and

478
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,160
establishing a foothold

479
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,079
and this is the second pause before

480
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:37,759
final ransomware deployment and

481
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,800
potential data theft

482
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,519
so when reeval are stealing stealing

483
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:44,480
data

484
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,480
the sometimes using traditional methods

485
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:47,759
of compressing

486
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,839
targeted data and exfilling it out of

487
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:52,079
the corporate network with their malware

488
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:54,079
but interestingly we're seeing them use

489
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:56,160
cloud data synchronization platform

490
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:56,880
tools

491
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,759
so things like mega.nz and pcloud which

492
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:01,440
are cloud storage solutions

493
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,600
along the same lines as google drop

494
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,600
sorry google drive or dropbox or

495
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,279
or microsoft onedrive and they're using

496
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,880
these cloud data synchronization

497
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,079
platforms to suck up

498
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,160
all of that data up into the cloud for

499
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,240
them to take a copy of and then extort

500
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,240
the victim

501
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,759
so after stealing data it's time to

502
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,440
deploy ransomware soda nakibi is

503
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,560
detected by a lot of

504
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,959
antivirus vendors most antivirus

505
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:26,800
software will pick up suddenly kiwi

506
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,160
so instead of changing their malware

507
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,920
what the attackers are doing uh using

508
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:30,399
their

509
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,199
admin privileges their their presence

510
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:34,240
within the environment

511
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,320
to disable anti-virus across the entire

512
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:38,800
estate they're looking into the consoles

513
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:42,320
of anti-virus software to disable

514
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:45,279
anti-virus across the entire environment

515
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,560
if they're not able to access the

516
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,079
corporate console or the cloud console

517
00:16:48,079 --> 00:16:49,279
to disable av

518
00:16:49,279 --> 00:16:51,279
across the estate then they're deploying

519
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,720
scripts from github

520
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,639
to every windows machine in the estate

521
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,759
to disable the

522
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,399
ransom sorry to disable the antivirus

523
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:00,079
here we see a script pulled from github

524
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,600
where the attacker is disabling the

525
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:05,280
asset antivirus tool

526
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:07,439
after disabling antivirus most of the

527
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,359
rival attackers will delete backups file

528
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:10,079
backups

529
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,000
archives and virtual machine snapshots

530
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,559
to prevent recovery this is all about

531
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:17,280
securing more payout for the ransomware

532
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,640
attackers

533
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,079
when it's time to deploy ransomware

534
00:17:20,079 --> 00:17:21,760
we're seeing tool we're seeing most of

535
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,280
the real attackers use the tried and

536
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,199
true method of creating an open smb

537
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:26,799
share to host the malware

538
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,240
and then pushing out scheduled tasks

539
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,160
using group policy to download and

540
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:30,960
execute

541
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:33,280
that ransomware so as systems update

542
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:34,320
their group policy

543
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,840
they pull down their scheduled tasks

544
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,200
they create a scheduled task and they

545
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,799
download and execute the ransom

546
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,160
ransomware and then encryption begins

547
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:44,160
most affiliates are also using ps exec

548
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,200
and other remote

549
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,160
execution tools like smb exec to mop up

550
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,919
any systems that were missed so systems

551
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,440
that didn't download and execute the

552
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:52,880
subnet key ransomware

553
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,280
the end product is most systems within

554
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,799
within the entire environment are

555
00:17:56,799 --> 00:17:57,679
ransomed

556
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,400
here is a ransom message showing um what

557
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,760
that looks like

558
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,000
and every ransom message also includes

559
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,919
this nice infographic that includes

560
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,919
contact information and points victims

561
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,679
towards the onion

562
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:11,440
site to begin negotiations to the

563
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,760
ransomware platform

564
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,520
so rival are pretty interesting because

565
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,200
they have that platform

566
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,880
because they're very effective but

567
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,000
essentially what we're talking about

568
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,760
here is an attack life cycle that

569
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,919
looks like any other attack life cycle

570
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:25,440
you have the attacker stepping through

571
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:26,960
the stages of compromise gaining

572
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,880
privilege scanning the environment

573
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,200
moving laterally within the environment

574
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,440
the only difference between real and an

575
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,600
apt crew is at the end you get a ransom

576
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,000
event

577
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,400
you get data theft followed by a ransom

578
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:39,039
so at each

579
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,600
point of this at each point of this life

580
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,840
cycle is an opportunity for us to detect

581
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,120
them as defenders

582
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:46,320
and and that's really what we're trying

583
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,160
to get across that the tradecraft that

584
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,520
they're using at the moment is highly

585
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,440
detectable highly signaturable

586
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:52,880
and we shouldn't see them being as

587
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,720
successful as they are

588
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,000
so that's a little bit about rival and

589
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,679
their ransomware as a service platform i

590
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,280
now head over to tom who will cover

591
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,720
catbot and doppelpema

592
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,919
which uses a different model for ransom

593
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,840
and intrusion thanks mitch

594
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,320
so second set activity our work is a set

595
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,000
of campaigns where organizations being

596
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,600
affected by kakapo

597
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,760
and access is then sold on to a

598
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:16,640
secondary group

599
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,320
who are encrypting the environment

600
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,600
double payment ransomware

601
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,600
historically uh cad by itself is more of

602
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,120
a banking trojan

603
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,039
it's modular by design which we'll cover

604
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,880
later it really lends itself to this

605
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,200
kind of partnership

606
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,280
what we're seeing though in 2020 is

607
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,960
these organizations who have been

608
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,440
infected with catwalk

609
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,520
being infected across pretty much a wide

610
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,039
range of their environment

611
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,160
where diet is then sold on to a

612
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,720
developer who's deploying double payment

613
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,559
encrypting the environment and then

614
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,120
placing the ransom demand to them

615
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:52,480
slightly different from what we've seen

616
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,360
with rival though where in this model

617
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,280
uh the cankerbot operators are selling

618
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,720
on access

619
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,559
it's then on to the ransomware developer

620
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,240
to encrypt the environment

621
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:03,600
and to deal with any uh ransom

622
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,080
negotiations there's no platform or as a

623
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:08,960
service model here

624
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:10,720
so talking through kind of a typical

625
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:12,559
life cycle i've

626
00:20:12,559 --> 00:20:14,000
i've put a line here on the right so you

627
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,760
can see on the left-hand side these are

628
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,200
all the responsibilities of the cat

629
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,240
parkway

630
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:19,760
whereas on the right hand side you have

631
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:22,000
to run somewhere developer

632
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:23,760
what we're seeing typically is uh

633
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,039
initial intrusion

634
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:28,320
uh by phishing emails um pretty targeted

635
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:30,559
for the specific users

636
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,120
this only affect the system with cadbot

637
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,480
fairly quickly after that we'll see

638
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:37,679
cobalt strike drops

639
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:38,880
they'll then do some form of

640
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:41,039
reconnaissance across the environment

641
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,720
they'll bring in tools like bloodhounds

642
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,520
so enumerate kind of domain structures

643
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:47,360
they'll use kind of living off the land

644
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:49,280
binaries to understand

645
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,720
where they are and to ping to other

646
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,280
systems and i don't see some form of

647
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,480
lateral movement

648
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:56,320
typically this is a combination of ps

649
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,919
exec or on my desktop

650
00:20:57,919 --> 00:20:59,520
kind of using credentials they've taken

651
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:01,440
from the environment and i think using

652
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,520
these credentials using things like

653
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,440
proc dump so another system internals

654
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,480
tool to get a copy of lsat's memory

655
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,240
and then use mimikats to extract any

656
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,559
credentials in clear text

657
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,320
the ultimate aim though is to

658
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,919
effectively push out kakba

659
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:17,600
as widely across the environment as

660
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,679
possible followed by cobalt strike as a

661
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,080
secondary persistence mechanism

662
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,559
they're fairly noisy in this but

663
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:25,919
successful in that

664
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:27,600
not all systems across the environment

665
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,919
may be fully patched with antivirus or

666
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:31,200
may not be working on some

667
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,840
in some cases this gives them a foothold

668
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,559
across many systems

669
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:38,320
what we're seeing though in 2020 across

670
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,400
europe is in a pause

671
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,039
so it could be a few weeks a few months

672
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:44,640
but we're then seeing a second stage of

673
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,600
activity

674
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,320
where access is being sold on and coming

675
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:49,520
in through one of these cat bot

676
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,919
connections we see ransomware developers

677
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:54,640
executing their double panel binaries

678
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,679
and sort of things

679
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,520
and this is then followed by uh

680
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,559
ransomware demand

681
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,679
so to give you a view of what this looks

682
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,919
like you know for compromise as i said

683
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,360
typically it's a targeted efficient

684
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:08,640
campaign

685
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,640
a fairly unsophisticated as you can see

686
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:12,799
here it's purely a hyperlink

687
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:15,360
the user would click this but then

688
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:16,000
fetching

689
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,919
a remote resource in this case a zip

690
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:19,520
file

691
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:21,360
the zip file contains visual basic

692
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:22,720
script which is effectively a second

693
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,240
stage loader

694
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:27,280
upon execution it takes a a catwalk

695
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,159
binary from a

696
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:31,039
right resource executes this giving the

697
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,600
operator persistence in that system

698
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,200
this then is running at system levels

699
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,159
they have the highest level of

700
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,080
privileges they can to that endpoint

701
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:42,960
so catwalk well i said it's modular by

702
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,760
design

703
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,640
um this means that selectively you can

704
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:48,159
choose which modules to load

705
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:50,320
based on what you're trying to achieve

706
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,159
but the default configuration

707
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,799
gives you a c2 channel where you can

708
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:56,720
upload download and execute files on

709
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,240
that system

710
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,360
and which could talk you through a few

711
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,720
of the modules we see being used

712
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,200
currently

713
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,960
so primarily in these campaigns the data

714
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,559
theft side

715
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:11,600
of the ransom typically comes via email

716
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,120
we're not seeing too much interaction

717
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,880
with file based

718
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,880
taking of files but there's a module

719
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:18,480
that catwalk gives you

720
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,799
which really helps the attacker's

721
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,200
service purpose

722
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,720
so in this case what are they doing well

723
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,640
it's initializing a happy connection to

724
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,640
the local outlet clients

725
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,559
this is really useful because it allows

726
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,720
you to take a copy of all the emails

727
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:35,120
locally on outlook and it places them in

728
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:36,080
the user profile

729
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,039
as msg files as a defender this is quite

730
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,400
helpful for us

731
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,400
because we now have a log of what's

732
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:45,039
being staged in that system

733
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,200
once this is complete the data is then

734
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,080
compressed and sent

735
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,200
upstream to the c2 channel and if you

736
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:53,039
in your organization don't have any form

737
00:23:53,039 --> 00:23:55,200
of kind of network based monitoring

738
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,120
have no validation that data's actually

739
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,480
gone under the staging

740
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:01,279
system itself

741
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:04,320
as i said uh like many other operators

742
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:05,600
both nation state

743
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,000
red team financially motivated groups

744
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,440
we're seeing a lot of use of cobalt

745
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,799
strike

746
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,559
it's really successful it's really

747
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:14,159
simple um

748
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,360
and there's two ways you can load this

749
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,679
with capture we can see arbitrary kind

750
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,360
of file downloads so you can take

751
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,120
you can take your cobot strike you can

752
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,360
pull it to the system execute it

753
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,600
uh the challenge here is antivirus can

754
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:26,559
catch this

755
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:29,200
so there's a module where catbot can

756
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,799
then load the module

757
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,400
and you can execute cobalt strike

758
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,080
running in memory to give you a

759
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:35,760
secondary persistence mechanism

760
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,279
to a different c2 channel this means

761
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:40,159
that if uh

762
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,480
the organization notices kakapot on one

763
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:43,679
of their systems

764
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,520
they find the c2 chart is working on a

765
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,679
block hit on the proxies of firewalls

766
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:49,440
you've got a secondary method back into

767
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,080
the environment

768
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:53,600
and then finally we see a web inject

769
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:56,080
module this is kind of remnant really

770
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,760
from the banking trojan days of uh

771
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,600
kakapot

772
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,279
two purposes for this obviously

773
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,200
financially motivated still

774
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,279
um if you as a user are browsing to a

775
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,480
site and you have your credentials

776
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,760
captured

777
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,720
they can use that for financial purposes

778
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,880
but also people reuse credentials right

779
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,440
so if the user is using the same

780
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:17,120
password for their banking site as they

781
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,360
are for their logons and environments

782
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,400
that's useful information it's fairly

783
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,159
simple the module effectively

784
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:27,200
injects into explore.exe iterates

785
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,640
through pre-configured

786
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,000
um sites mainly noting that even in the

787
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
european breaches we are seeing

788
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,559
primarily north american organizations

789
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,880
within these lists

790
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,880
and they inject javascript elements to

791
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,080
those sites so

792
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,840
when the user is entering the username

793
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:46,080
password is then captured by the module

794
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,279
sent back on the screen so that's

795
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,320
kakapot

796
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:52,559
let's talk about double payment dom

797
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,880
player is interesting for us

798
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,320
there's a few different um delivery

799
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:58,960
mechanisms typically what happens on the

800
00:25:58,960 --> 00:26:00,559
handover process is they're giving

801
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,720
access to a system running catalog

802
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,480
they'll move pretty quickly to a domain

803
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,000
controller which is a popular

804
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,360
kind of method of choice for most

805
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:09,039
phantom operators

806
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:11,919
another group policies firstly they'll

807
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:13,919
push our script to disable antivirus

808
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:15,360
from the endpoints

809
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,120
unlike reaval they won't really be

810
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,880
interacting with the antivirus server

811
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:20,320
itself

812
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:22,240
and once this is done but an iterate

813
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:24,080
through a list of computers

814
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:26,720
of their target choices and they'll push

815
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:27,600
out again

816
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,520
via scripts with group policy with three

817
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,640
methods

818
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,919
we see assistant tunnels use ps exec

819
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:36,320
takes a binary moves it across executes

820
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,600
it

821
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,840
we see bits jobs so built-in windows

822
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:41,760
based functionality slightly less quiet

823
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,600
than pierce exempt

824
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,279
and finally we see scheduled tasks which

825
00:26:45,279 --> 00:26:47,520
is pretty common across most groups

826
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,880
a bit noisy but really successful

827
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,559
so now they've got a double payment on

828
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:54,559
on an endpoint there's four stages to

829
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:56,960
encryption

830
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,440
firstly um double payment will enumerate

831
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,760
all of the local users on the system

832
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:03,919
there's a pre-configured string within

833
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,000
the variant you can see here in green

834
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,240
and it concatenates this with an md5

835
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,000
hashtag computing

836
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,600
and it will then reset all of the

837
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,360
passwords for the local accounts

838
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,559
with this password the idea being here

839
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:17,200
that

840
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,840
they want to lock you out from the

841
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,840
system

842
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,880
stage two it says it's after service

843
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,039
so identify a core windows service

844
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,320
running system32

845
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,480
and make a copy of this uh it'll append

846
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:32,480
it with dash one both the service name

847
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:34,960
and the binary and they'll then take the

848
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,480
dopamine binary which they've copied

849
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,240
across in the script

850
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,799
and they'll overwrite the legitimate

851
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:41,440
binary

852
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,760
for that original service this is

853
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,840
important for the next stage

854
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,279
bearing in mind it's a legitimate

855
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,520
windows services running

856
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,520
because stage three we start to see

857
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,279
configuration changes to the boot

858
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,960
database

859
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,799
now firstly they disable startup repair

860
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:00,559
this is a common tactic

861
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,559
you'll see used to recover an operating

862
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:04,559
system they'll remove that option from

863
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:06,480
the system

864
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,320
another big change is that under safe

865
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,640
boots the core services

866
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:13,360
are set to run now as you remember from

867
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,279
the last stage we now have double panel

868
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:16,559
running as a core service

869
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,240
this means that if you as a user go into

870
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,240
safe mode you're still running

871
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:22,080
the binary and the actions are still

872
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:24,159
going on in the background

873
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:26,000
and the final part of this stage is

874
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,000
they'll make a change to group policy so

875
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:28,720
that if you

876
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,480
try to log onto a system you get a

877
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,000
splash screen saying the system's being

878
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,480
encrypted

879
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,159
the final stage and kind of really where

880
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:37,520
it's most important because this is

881
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,799
where you can stop the encryption

882
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,159
happening

883
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:41,919
is where it reboots the system so if you

884
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,919
can catch a system before it reboots you

885
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:44,240
can

886
00:28:44,240 --> 00:28:47,760
typically recover however upon starting

887
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:48,640
reboots

888
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:51,440
all of your files are then encrypted it

889
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:53,120
will overwrite the extension to the dot

890
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:53,679
dot

891
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,679
to indicate that file has been encrypted

892
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:57,440
it'll be a corresponding file the same

893
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,600
file name the extension how to decrypt

894
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,039
text which will contain the decryption

895
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,880
details

896
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,720
at this point all of your files once

897
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:06,080
you've gone through institute process

898
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,440
will be encrypted

899
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:09,039
and the only way to recover is restoring

900
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:12,799
from backup or dealing with the operator

901
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,960
so takeaways well it's a highly

902
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,080
effective campaign

903
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:17,760
catbot's been around for a while now

904
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,760
they're very good at what they do

905
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:21,520
so as a partner in work it makes sense

906
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:24,480
for ransomware developer

907
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,880
it's very high impact i like reaval

908
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,480
where you can still access the systems

909
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,200
but

910
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,120
the files are encrypted double payment

911
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,520
removes that move from you

912
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,399
the idea being that it's high impact and

913
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:40,559
your pressurized zones are dealing with

914
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:43,039
and they're very highly active because

915
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,640
catbot's so effective that sony

916
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,559
organization is compromised

917
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,399
we're seeing over periods of 20 20 as

918
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,080
many as one organization of day being

919
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,840
compromised by top payment

920
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,279
and we expect to see this carry on

921
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,840
growing

922
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,760
so now mitch is going to wrap up our

923
00:29:57,760 --> 00:29:59,840
talk go through the conclusions on what

924
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:00,960
we think is going to happen

925
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:03,440
moving forward in this environment and

926
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:07,279
ransom operations as they move forward

927
00:30:07,279 --> 00:30:09,039
thank you tom so we've looked at rival

928
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,399
we've looked at doppel payment

929
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:12,720
two different ransomware operators but

930
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,159
you know generally indicative of the

931
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,080
wider ransomware industry and how it's

932
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,159
developed in 2020.

933
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:20,159
so going into 2021 and going forward

934
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,200
unfortunately

935
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:23,279
it's probably a continuing problem this

936
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,360
year it's the biggest it's ever been in

937
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,799
terms of damage and impact

938
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:29,279
to organizations and industry and that

939
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:30,640
trend is only upwards

940
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,720
so we're probably going to see payouts

941
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,640
increasing both in size and the number

942
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,039
of

943
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:37,840
organizations paying out as ransomware

944
00:30:37,840 --> 00:30:39,440
deployments get more effective and it

945
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,120
gets more and more difficult to recover

946
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,559
without paying

947
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,399
we'll see the number of victims increase

948
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,240
as ransomware operators continue to

949
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:47,600
scale up

950
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,520
and recruit more people as well as

951
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,120
improve their platforms and create some

952
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,880
automation and efficiencies

953
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,600
to improve their business so you know

954
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,600
we're using language that we use to talk

955
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,600
about how a startup scales up

956
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,440
in the early phases of business

957
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,640
development

958
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:04,240
and we'll see that with with ransomware

959
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:06,000
operators we'll see the damage to

960
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,360
organizations increase

961
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:09,440
as ransomware attackers get better at

962
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,440
deploying their software deploying their

963
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:13,919
malware across an entire organization

964
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:15,440
they'll get better at deleting backups

965
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:16,799
and getting that ransomware out there

966
00:31:16,799 --> 00:31:18,399
which will increase the damage to

967
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:19,519
organizations

968
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:20,799
potentially we'll get to a point where

969
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:22,880
the only way to recover is either to to

970
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,440
pay the

971
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,480
ransom or to have good backups and

972
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,399
recovery mechanisms in place

973
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:29,840
which you know might be a little bit

974
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,000
rare at the moment we'll also see

975
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,320
the extortion of stolen data increase in

976
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:35,840
terms of the effectiveness

977
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,559
of that technique so a lot of ransomware

978
00:31:38,559 --> 00:31:39,600
attackers at the moment are

979
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,840
opportunistically stealing data

980
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,679
during a breach they'll identify data of

981
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:45,120
interest and take it out of the

982
00:31:45,120 --> 00:31:46,159
environment

983
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:48,080
but sometimes that data isn't that

984
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,600
impactful you know there's no breach of

985
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:51,360
regulations there's no personal

986
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:53,200
information in the data stolen

987
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,640
you know you don't want it out there in

988
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,480
the general public but in terms of

989
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,080
damage to the business or damage to

990
00:31:58,080 --> 00:31:58,960
reputation

991
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,039
maybe it's not so impactful so

992
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,240
potentially we'll see attackers get

993
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:03,919
better at choosing which data they

994
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,840
they choose to take which data they

995
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,279
choose to steal

996
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:09,279
which will increase the pressure on

997
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:11,039
victims to pay

998
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,440
which means more profit so with all of

999
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:14,320
these factors

1000
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,399
profits are only going to increase with

1001
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,000
so many victims

1002
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,840
so much compromise going on for

1003
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:22,000
ransomware unfortunately the only trend

1004
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,880
is upwards

1005
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,279
without much down downwards pressure

1006
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,360
from law enforcement agencies

1007
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,960
we just don't see ransomware stopping

1008
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:31,200
anytime soon so 2021

1009
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:34,159
will likely be bigger than 2020. on the

1010
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:34,799
flip side

1011
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:37,440
and in a positive note ransomware is now

1012
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:39,120
a boardroom risk in a lot of corporate

1013
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:40,559
risk registers

1014
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:43,760
cyber cyber risk registers ransomware is

1015
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,279
now the number one threat

1016
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,360
to business because it's impactful and

1017
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,360
it's potentially business stopping

1018
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,000
so the ups upshot here is either you

1019
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:53,039
know more

1020
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,960
uh investment in cyber security or

1021
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:57,279
realistically better targeted spends

1022
00:32:57,279 --> 00:33:01,600
of of corporate cyber security budgets

1023
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:02,799
technically i think we'll see

1024
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,720
improvements to tradecraft

1025
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:08,000
we see probably more stealth happening

1026
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,480
being included into the tactics

1027
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:12,240
techniques and tradecraft of ransomware

1028
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,120
attackers

1029
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:15,120
at the moment they're very very fast but

1030
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,240
they're very very loud

1031
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:17,840
and at each point of that attack life

1032
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:19,760
cycle they're extremely detectable

1033
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,240
so as we as you know a defensive

1034
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:24,240
industry get better at improving our

1035
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,919
network security hygiene

1036
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,760
potentially we'll see attackers have to

1037
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,080
shift their tradecraft to adapt to that

1038
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:31,679
and with that comes tooling improvements

1039
00:33:31,679 --> 00:33:33,200
you know less reliance on

1040
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:35,919
open source or freemium or corporate

1041
00:33:35,919 --> 00:33:38,000
penetration testing tools and research

1042
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:41,200
software and more bespoke malware

1043
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:43,360
or bespoke tools that attackers are

1044
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:44,960
creating themselves

1045
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,120
we'll see faster transition to domain

1046
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,799
admin you know they're already fast but

1047
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,799
they're quite noisy and they do make a

1048
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:51,600
few mistakes

1049
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,440
but they get there so we'll see them

1050
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,720
increase their speed

1051
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,600
which means time between initial access

1052
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:59,279
and ransomware deployment will continue

1053
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,279
to decrease

1054
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:03,279
we'll see increased ransomware

1055
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,279
deployment methods group policy objects

1056
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:07,200
are not the best way to get ransom out

1057
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,440
across to a victim organization so we'll

1058
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,960
likely see the attackers shift using

1059
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:11,599
tools like

1060
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:13,839
sccm or other corporate software

1061
00:34:13,839 --> 00:34:15,280
deployment solutions that are more

1062
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:17,280
effective for getting that wide spread

1063
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,079
faster and of course we'll see increase

1064
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:22,079
effectiveness to delete backups

1065
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:24,480
we'll see more time potentially or more

1066
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:25,440
effectiveness

1067
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:27,679
in in deleting those backups to prevent

1068
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:29,760
recovery

1069
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,359
so lastly what's next we'll see

1070
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:33,359
continued focus on mass exploitation of

1071
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:34,960
edge devices you know a lot of security

1072
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:35,918
research is

1073
00:34:35,918 --> 00:34:38,320
going into edge devices at the moment

1074
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,918
we've seen this in the past and it seems

1075
00:34:39,918 --> 00:34:41,199
to have made a comeback in terms of

1076
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:42,320
research focus

1077
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:44,079
so we're probably going to see more of

1078
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:45,918
these high impact

1079
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:48,800
edge vulnerabilities in 2021 so we'll

1080
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,159
see the attackers likely

1081
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,480
exploiting this quicker and more

1082
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:54,480
effectively

1083
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:57,359
attackers have some limiting factors

1084
00:34:57,359 --> 00:34:58,480
there are too many victims they're

1085
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,480
getting access to too many organizations

1086
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,839
and they don't have enough people enough

1087
00:35:01,839 --> 00:35:03,520
operators to properly

1088
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,480
leverage these accesses into payouts so

1089
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,160
as they recruit as they improve their

1090
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,680
platforms as they automate

1091
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:11,920
they'll be able to hit more victims in a

1092
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,839
shorter amount of time with with

1093
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:15,280
um you know less resources more

1094
00:35:15,280 --> 00:35:17,040
efficient use of resources

1095
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,040
so in these cases we'll see the

1096
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:21,040
attackers ramp up their capability into

1097
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,560
2021.

1098
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,000
similarly at the moment there's not a

1099
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,760
lot of down pressure on

1100
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:28,079
on ransomware attackers from law

1101
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:28,880
enforcement

1102
00:35:28,880 --> 00:35:31,520
they operate in jurisdictions where uh

1103
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:32,000
there's

1104
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,520
there's essentially no pressure on them

1105
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,359
to stop their operations

1106
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,760
and they're very successful so you know

1107
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:39,520
the best we can do as defenders is make

1108
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,040
sure to improve our network security

1109
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,400
hygiene

1110
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,400
the basics would stop a lot of these

1111
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,240
ransomware attackers from

1112
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:48,320
from being successful at the moment so

1113
00:35:48,320 --> 00:35:49,520
unfortunately without that law

1114
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,119
enforcement downwards pressure

1115
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:52,960
that's the best we can do when you know

1116
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,800
that current law enforcement pressure

1117
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:57,119
pressure uh from those jurisdictions is

1118
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,240
probably not enough to

1119
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:01,280
decrease the um the the cost benefit

1120
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,440
analysis for the ransomware attackers

1121
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,359
so that's our that's the conclusion of

1122
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,119
our presentation um thank you very much

1123
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:07,520
for

1124
00:36:07,520 --> 00:36:09,280
for listening to our talk about rival

1125
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:11,280
and double payment i believe we have a

1126
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:14,160
live question and answer session so

1127
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:15,359
we'll now go to that

1128
00:36:15,359 --> 00:36:18,880
thank you
