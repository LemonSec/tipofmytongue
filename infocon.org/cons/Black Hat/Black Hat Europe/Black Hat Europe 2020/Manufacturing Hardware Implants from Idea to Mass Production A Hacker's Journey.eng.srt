00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:16,560
good day everyone

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,640
i'm luca head of offensive security at

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,160
bentley systems

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,520
this presentation wants to be a

6
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:23,199
motivational talk

7
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,000
for all those hackers out there that

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,599
always wanted to share some cool

9
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,119
hardware advice

10
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:31,359
with the community but didn't know how

11
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,600
or hesitated to avoid any sort of

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,200
financial risk

13
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,960
after this presentation you will know

14
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,280
more how challenging and painful

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,200
is to mass-produce hacking devices what

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:42,640
to do if you have an idea and want to

17
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,079
bring it to life

18
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:45,840
what to avoid in order to increase the

19
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,360
chances of success

20
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,360
and a bit more about with injector with

21
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,960
elite and the upcoming potterbox

22
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:55,600
once upon a time many engagements ago

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,160
back in 2010 i wanted to turn this

24
00:00:58,160 --> 00:00:59,359
weaponized mouse

25
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,559
into a remotely controlled one sadly

26
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:03,199
failed

27
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,920
for many reasons lack of time for our

28
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:06,720
ending

29
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,760
lack of a miniaturized rx module

30
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:12,400
not enough room inside the the mouse and

31
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,280
eventually

32
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,360
the idea ended up in my never-ending

33
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,280
to-do list until

34
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,799
2016 i've witnessed

35
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,080
the presentation from rogan and dominic

36
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,200
at dafgon called universal serial abuse

37
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:32,479
what is this this is a marvelous piece

38
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,119
of

39
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,079
software that was exactly what i always

40
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:37,840
wanted to see from the

41
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:40,159
free open source community an exact

42
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:40,880
replica

43
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,479
of the cotton mall functionality

44
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:44,720
described in the nsa leak

45
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,399
from 2013 by adversity at this point i

46
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:50,799
had enough momentum to start working on

47
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,560
my very initial idea

48
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,960
a piece of hardware now also compatible

49
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,079
with us abuse

50
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:58,320
that will also have features like mouse

51
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,840
jacking remote control

52
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,719
easy to weaponize usb gadgets and that's

53
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,520
how the very first idea with injector

54
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,720
which means wireless heat injector

55
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,440
came to life and i cannot thank enough

56
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,560
rogan

57
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:14,640
for that presentation at afghan because

58
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,680
it was like

59
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,480
mind opener

60
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,319
now that we got an early stage idea uh

61
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,200
that of what we want what's next well in

62
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,400
my case i call it the napkin sketch

63
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,560
uh what is the napkin sketch well it's a

64
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,400
dirty cheap approach

65
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,319
that brings your initial idea to a more

66
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,920
tangible point

67
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,239
it's the cheapest and fastest way to get

68
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,760
a better feeling of what you have in

69
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,959
mind

70
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,680
usually in this space in this phase i

71
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,599
start adding the features i'd like to

72
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:48,879
see in the final product

73
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,440
even though some of them will be dropped

74
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,200
during the next phases due technical

75
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,800
reasons or lack of space

76
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,519
as it happens with injector so in my

77
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:58,159
case

78
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,519
i i worked on

79
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:03,519
on two phases the first phase was to

80
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:04,720
release

81
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,760
an initial product called with injector

82
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,879
which then i enhanced by creating with

83
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:13,040
elite

84
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,640
once we got a sketch of what we want to

85
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,800
create we need some validation right

86
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,879
in order to easily validate an idea do

87
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,319
not start immediately we are india

88
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,720
prototyping i know that's hard

89
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,440
as a engineer for me it's way easier

90
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:27,599
just to you know have an idea

91
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,720
and start to create a prototype on it

92
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,720
based on it and then you know eventually

93
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:33,840
create a final

94
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,040
working product well sometimes happened

95
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,400
in in the past that um that that was

96
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,959
sort of failure because i'm doing that

97
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,080
in my spare time

98
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,480
so time is limited and since time is

99
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,280
limited

100
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:49,599
um sometimes happens that you need to

101
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:50,879
put a project uh

102
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,080
half done on on on hold

103
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,680
and then eventually you will either

104
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,599
forget about it or you will never be

105
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,879
able to complete so

106
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,040
my idea is instead of jumping

107
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,200
immediately after the idea from

108
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,840
the idea to id and prototyping you may

109
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,680
waste a lot of time in something that

110
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,040
may lead to a data so

111
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,200
prototype instead prototyping is a term

112
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,319
that i've read

113
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,880
for the first time in the book titled

114
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:17,918
the write it

115
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,478
written by alberto savoya if you're

116
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,560
planning to challenge yourself

117
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,800
in creating something for the market i

118
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,880
strongly recommend to have a look at it

119
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,880
because it's really really

120
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,520
interesting from many aspects from any

121
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:31,919
part

122
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,120
many points of view what is in few words

123
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:36,720
a prototype

124
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,199
well it's sort of physical but in my

125
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,240
case

126
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,080
cheap mock-up of the product i want to

127
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,320
create that allows to quickly gather

128
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,560
feedbacks and validate my assumptions

129
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,080
in a cheap and easy way one example

130
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,120
provided in the book

131
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,600
is called binocchio which was nothing

132
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,520
but a can of beans as you can see in the

133
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,600
image

134
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,759
colored in black that had to resemble an

135
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,360
iot home assistant

136
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,160
back in time when alberto envisioned

137
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:04,639
this

138
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,680
defy iot device there were not yet

139
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:11,039
things like alexa nest and so on

140
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:13,520
so he just wanted to validate if that

141
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:14,320
idea of i

142
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,400
o of an aot homa system was worth it

143
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,160
so alberto practically envisioned what

144
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,160
later would have become the well-known

145
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,160
amazon alexa in this way he managed to

146
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:26,240
easily validate that idea

147
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,520
with just simple can of beans it's an

148
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,560
amazing approach

149
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,440
i i strongly recommend you to have a

150
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:33,919
read

151
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:36,080
read about you know the full story in

152
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:37,440
the book because

153
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,759
it will give you like the feeling of why

154
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,759
prototyping is so powerful

155
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,880
another example of prototyping is uh

156
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,400
regarding the palm pilot jeff hawkings

157
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,560
designed one of the very first tablets

158
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,080
in the history

159
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,880
the great pad it was an engineering

160
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,160
marvel

161
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:58,800
but a market failure because it was

162
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,880
still too big we are talking about 90s

163
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,400
if i remember correctly

164
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,479
so determined to not make that mistake

165
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,000
again he decided to change

166
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,600
approach instead of spending a lot of

167
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,680
time in r d prototyping

168
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,000
he took it simple he took a wooden

169
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,919
tablet

170
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:16,080
sticked on it a piece of paper

171
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,280
assembling the ui

172
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,560
of his ideal pawn pilot ui and then

173
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,720
started to bring it everywhere

174
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,560
for a couple of weeks every time he had

175
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,840
to take a note

176
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,240
uh check emails schedule a meeting he

177
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,120
was taking out

178
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,160
this piece of wood and imagine that he

179
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,160
really had to

180
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,560
he really had in his hands a working

181
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,080
version of it

182
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,960
eventually after days of usage he

183
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:43,120
managed to get enough data

184
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,199
to end the prototyping phase so he

185
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,319
validated

186
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,919
that the idea of having a pawn pilot uh

187
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,280
like was you know good enough to proceed

188
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,479
further so it was

189
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,240
satisfied enough to continue with our

190
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,000
ending and as you can see here in the

191
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,039
image

192
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,080
after the mock-up of the ui that's the

193
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,680
very first prototype

194
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,919
board of the pawn pilot and of course

195
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,800
the final product

196
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,560
in my case i needed something a bit

197
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:13,280
bigger than a classic usb flash drive

198
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,319
because you know components uh that i

199
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:18,160
used were commercially available

200
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,919
and were were not that small

201
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:26,799
i mean that it's really small so

202
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:29,039
still i needed something smaller than a

203
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,120
raspberry pi zero as you can see here is

204
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,440
some example of other

205
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,599
offensive devices i created

206
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:40,560
with based on raspberry pi zero that

207
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,680
would have also

208
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,919
an external antenna since i was planning

209
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,520
to add mouse jacking capabilities

210
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,199
and radio hacking once so looking around

211
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,039
my lab

212
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,599
some option appeared as you can see from

213
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,159
the images

214
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,479
the goal here is to validate my idea and

215
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:00,160
see if the plant size

216
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,000
would fit my needs right because you

217
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,599
know during a pen test you need

218
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,280
still a quite a noticeable stealthy

219
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,599
device right so eventually i was

220
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:10,800
satisfied

221
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,199
uh of that and decided to proceed

222
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,000
further so

223
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,000
those mock-ups those prototypes

224
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,039
were enough to validate my idea so what

225
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:21,919
i was doing is

226
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:23,840
from time to time i was fake imagine

227
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,680
imagining that one of those

228
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,759
dongles were my usb with injector or

229
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,879
with elite

230
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,679
and you know i was plugging around

231
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,159
colleagues

232
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,159
my office and see if they were noticing

233
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,479
it behind their computer or laptop

234
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,880
and you know those the the data i

235
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,159
gathered was enough to

236
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,399
to confirm that they made this may be a

237
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,000
good idea

238
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,320
at this point we reached a certain level

239
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,440
of confidence

240
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,000
that the product is doable and they find

241
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:54,640
it useful

242
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,160
but what about others what about

243
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,080
potential customers remember

244
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,920
if no customer is interested in it

245
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,000
it's very unlikely a manufacturer will

246
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,440
invest time and money on it

247
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:08,720
right therefore the next step was to get

248
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:09,920
some market analysis

249
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,320
in order to validate as well from that

250
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,120
side

251
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,160
uh this idea so the fastest and the

252
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:18,160
cheapest way i found

253
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:19,920
of course i'm not a marketing guy i'm

254
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,760
not a business guy i don't have an mba

255
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,760
so i needed to find the cheapest and

256
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,959
fastest way

257
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:27,519
to validate the idea from a market

258
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:28,959
perspective so what i've done

259
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,320
it was a simple twitter poll which

260
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:36,399
gave me enough inertia momentum

261
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,680
to get uh to go on so in that case

262
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,240
that simple question simple paul uh

263
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,880
gathered like 93 percent of consensus

264
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,839
among possible customers or users so in

265
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:48,720
that case

266
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:52,080
you know was enough to keep me going

267
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,200
further so after confirming that the

268
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,200
product may be of interest for potential

269
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,720
users i had a couple of ways how to

270
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,000
approach it

271
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,680
jump straight on keycad and start

272
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:03,600
working on the schematics

273
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,040
or create a 3d concept the engineer that

274
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,079
is me and maybe you

275
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,079
would have jumped straight through to

276
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,240
keycard and start to design the pcb

277
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,240
and the schematics right eventually i

278
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,000
opted for the latter because i love

279
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,360
sketching and they had finally and i had

280
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,120
finally the excuse to learn how to use

281
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,760
ketchup so

282
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:30,480
the pro of starting with this approach

283
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:30,959
is

284
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,880
less seeker of time than designing from

285
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,200
scratch a schematic pcb

286
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,959
since it doesn't require yet digging

287
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,040
into data sheets electrical and radio

288
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,000
specs

289
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,920
or other constraints but goes directly

290
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,399
to the point of having a 3d model

291
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,480
of your product at your disposal why

292
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:47,519
it's so useful

293
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,120
well beside being a good way to

294
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,640
brainstorm and detect

295
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,519
eventual pit fails or constrain me

296
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,680
missed during the napkin sketch

297
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:58,720
it also allows you to use 3d such 3d

298
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,920
model

299
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,920
as a early visual representation of your

300
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,920
idea for potential meetings with

301
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,519
customers or

302
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,600
sorry manufacturers or investors

303
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,839
so and here comes the most challenging

304
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,600
part of the from a technical point of

305
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,079
view the

306
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,519
prototyping phase in this phase you will

307
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:17,839
be

308
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,720
designing coding banging your hand on

309
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:22,079
the table when you're stuck

310
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,120
debugging redesigning almost giving up

311
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,279
and eventually getting something working

312
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,880
out

313
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,920
out of all these process so here

314
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,160
the costs depends on what you're

315
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:35,920
planning to design in my case

316
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:38,959
costs were quite reasonable so less than

317
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:40,160
100 euro

318
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,640
approx to get the first you know

319
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,360
assemble

320
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,680
prototype and the time needed was around

321
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:47,120
15 days

322
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,600
you need to count 15 days as not person

323
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,399
days

324
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,920
but let's say in a month or more because

325
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,040
i was not doing that

326
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,240
as you know a daily job it was just a

327
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,760
spare time so

328
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,440
i would say in one month and a half

329
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,519
probably i achieved a full working

330
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:04,480
prototype

331
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,639
with related uh proof of concept as you

332
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:07,680
can see here i

333
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:10,800
added the proof of concept video

334
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,720
we delete just to show you how it looked

335
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,160
like was very rough but

336
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:18,160
you know it was working fully

337
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,160
so with a working prototype at your hand

338
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:21,519
and some market analysis

339
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,040
we are ready to start hunting for

340
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:25,440
manufacturers right and this is the most

341
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,639
critical part of

342
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,399
the whole journey i would say from an

343
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,680
unknown technical point of view so and

344
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,480
this is the most

345
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,920
critical part that will define the

346
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:37,600
success of the project if you want to

347
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,959
bring it to life to

348
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,839
you know mass production first of all

349
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:42,959
why i opted for

350
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,519
this um business deal because as you

351
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,600
know

352
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,320
the sales of with injector with the lead

353
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,920
and the upcoming potterbox

354
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,320
are only based on nonprofits so i'm not

355
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,519
getting any profit from

356
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,399
out of the sales that manufacturer makes

357
00:12:58,399 --> 00:12:59,040
so

358
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,720
the reason is simple i already have a

359
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,320
job in the infosec industry

360
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:04,399
so i was not looking for yet another

361
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,320
duty or job or tasks

362
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:08,800
to you know to stress me out i just was

363
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,240
looking for something challenging

364
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:13,120
during my spare time that would involve

365
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:14,639
hardware hacking

366
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:16,399
and most importantly i wanted to give

367
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,320
back something to the community

368
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:21,040
without profiting it right like you know

369
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,000
all these researchers that release

370
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:26,800
software i wanted to release something i

371
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,399
love to make

372
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,120
personally i love more to make hardware

373
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,880
so i wanted to release a hardware

374
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:36,720
that is still easily available and you

375
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,120
know

376
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:40,639
i release it for free so creating the

377
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:41,680
perfect initial

378
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,519
email takes time and good amount of

379
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,839
revisions look at it as a sort of

380
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,199
sales pitch you have to you have

381
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:51,920
very few sentences and a couple of

382
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:52,800
images to

383
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,440
catch the interest of the manufacturer

384
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,760
usually i add the 3d concept here at

385
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,600
this point

386
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,160
and the market analysis server results

387
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,040
you don't have to

388
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,000
be much verbose for two reasons to not

389
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,880
annoy the reader

390
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,800
and do not lick too many intellectual

391
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,320
property details

392
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,800
uh before an eventual nda why i'm saying

393
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,160
that well

394
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,440
there are plenty of copycats around or

395
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,519
people that want just to profit out of

396
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:20,560
your idea so

397
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,360
better protect your intellectual

398
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,079
property as much as you can

399
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:27,760
you know even if you will release in

400
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,000
open source open hardware or for

401
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,560
free doesn't mean that you need to make

402
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,360
easier the life of copycats right

403
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,120
in my experience i noticed that the best

404
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,800
time to send the email

405
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,639
is around wednesday and thursday why

406
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,399
because

407
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:45,839
from my experience i noticed that

408
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,959
mondays no one

409
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,839
respond to you or they respond badly or

410
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,519
just ignore your email

411
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:57,120
so just trust me and have faith and

412
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:59,120
try that wednesday and thursday work

413
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,440
best at least in my case

414
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,519
provide also an alternative way for the

415
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:04,880
initial call because

416
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,800
especially when you're dealing with

417
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,600
chinese manufacturers

418
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,240
they may not have access to microsoft

419
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:12,959
teams

420
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,320
skype or you know more

421
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,680
western type of

422
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,720
communication mediums

423
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,880
another important point is avoid

424
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:25,760
mentioning the

425
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,680
undeal so the thing that you will do it

426
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,279
for a profit

427
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:31,120
on the kickstart email because sometimes

428
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,880
may happen that they will think you have

429
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,600
either mental problems or is a sort of

430
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:36,480
scam

431
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,639
so usually people tends to to be

432
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:40,160
suspicious when you tell them

433
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,639
look i'm doing for free they will say

434
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:44,880
that that doesn't make sense even if

435
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,279
you know you explain them especially

436
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,160
from a chinese

437
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,199
culture point of view

438
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:53,600
so and most important be persistent do

439
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:55,040
not give up after

440
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,920
the first manufacturer refusal i mean

441
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:58,959
that's normal

442
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:01,360
i mean that's how it works the business

443
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,720
so

444
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:04,880
and don't hesitate to repeat twice the

445
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,120
concepts

446
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,759
to the audience because if you see they

447
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:12,000
are hesitating to take you seriously

448
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,720
just that's normal as well so just be

449
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:16,000
persistent

450
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,360
so once you will manage to find a

451
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,360
manufacturer believing in your project

452
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,360
you will probably start to work with him

453
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:23,839
in developing the very first revision of

454
00:16:23,839 --> 00:16:24,959
your product

455
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:27,279
and with that the very first bugs may

456
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,320
appear

457
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:31,440
example during the design of the first

458
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,600
of the first review or vision of we

459
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,519
delete i was so focused on getting

460
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,120
everything fitting in the pcb

461
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:38,720
that i forgot to expose the interrupt

462
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,959
pins for conducting radio attacks

463
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,519
uh and extend the usb pins in order to

464
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,440
make the weaponizing process

465
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:49,440
easier so what i've done i had three

466
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:53,279
well not fully redesigned but you know

467
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,839
heavily modified the layout of the pcb

468
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,360
in order to accommodate

469
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:01,680
my to fix those bags bugs

470
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,920
once most of the bugs will be fixed and

471
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,119
you will see

472
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:06,959
that the priority reached a certain

473
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,439
level of amount of stability is time to

474
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,199
involve beta testers

475
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,039
in this phase you have to put particular

476
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:15,119
attention on picking beta testers

477
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:18,480
why well because most of them we see and

478
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,640
promise everything

479
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,039
uh just to get a free cool device but

480
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,959
then they will disappear like tears in

481
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:26,319
the rain

482
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:29,919
by by that i mean that

483
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,240
many people would say yeah i want to be

484
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,120
a better tester i'm a super hacker i

485
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:36,080
want to try it

486
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,320
yeah we give you feedback and so on and

487
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,280
blah blah blah

488
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,039
but then some of them they will just

489
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:43,120
disappear without even saying thank you

490
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:44,720
so they will get the package they will

491
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:45,679
get the

492
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:47,840
advice and then we'll follow your

493
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,080
thorough documentation with videos

494
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:50,799
tutorials

495
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:52,320
and then they will never come back so

496
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,320
select wisely better tester

497
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:56,720
another hint is do not have high

498
00:17:56,720 --> 00:17:59,440
expectations anyway people are busy so

499
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,480
here and suggesting is usually i divide

500
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,320
the beta tester in two parts

501
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,360
two kind of people the security experts

502
00:18:07,360 --> 00:18:10,720
that i know they are reliable

503
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:14,000
and students sometimes happens that a

504
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,360
young student in computer science has

505
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,919
higher motivation and of course more

506
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,000
free time than professionals

507
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,919
and even if they are not as skilled as a

508
00:18:23,919 --> 00:18:26,799
professional or do not understand how

509
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,160
fully how your device works they can be

510
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:31,200
very helpful

511
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,320
so that was very

512
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:36,880
good results i didn't expect another

513
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,080
hint is prepare

514
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:41,039
prepare easy to digest documentation

515
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,000
this is the key for

516
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:45,679
success it's also vital

517
00:18:45,679 --> 00:18:48,400
for both actually beta test and post

518
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,240
release phases that you will product

519
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:55,039
produce a properly documented um

520
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,440
a set of information for your product in

521
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:58,559
average users

522
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,160
skilled or not have limited amount of

523
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,080
time right so if you want your product

524
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,520
to be successful

525
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,360
uh you have to provide at the same time

526
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,120
an exhaustive and easy to digest

527
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,160
documentation

528
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,000
eventually also supported the video

529
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,080
tutorials in this way

530
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,600
i mean documentation must be dumbproof

531
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:19,520
in a way that everyone can get up and

532
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,320
running

533
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,000
in as fast as they can and you know the

534
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,160
you cannot you can just ignore

535
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:27,440
eventually tickets like

536
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:29,760
i cannot use it or you know those dumb

537
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,799
tickets just

538
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,480
i i automatically close them because

539
00:19:32,480 --> 00:19:34,480
there is enough information

540
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,520
to know how to modify the firmware

541
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,200
how to update the firmware how to flash

542
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,559
the device uh

543
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:43,520
how to get it run how to troubleshoot so

544
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,120
proper documentation

545
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,240
is a must to succeed on after

546
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,320
in post release and here a little bit of

547
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,440
uh zen time so

548
00:19:55,440 --> 00:19:58,720
more features may lead to more bugs

549
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:01,280
this is a fact i remember when i started

550
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,200
designing we delete

551
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,200
i want a certain amount of features and

552
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,039
while developing

553
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,000
the the pcb and the schematics i started

554
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:10,559
to think

555
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,720
maybe i can add also radio capability

556
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:14,640
radio hacking capabilities

557
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:17,200
maybe i can add also that and that and

558
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,480
then

559
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,360
bugs started to appear here an example

560
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,678
um

561
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:27,840
i needed an interrupt pin for receiving

562
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,440
ask amplitude shifting shifting key

563
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,400
signals right to start conducting radio

564
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:35,200
attacks

565
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:37,440
so at that time by looking at the

566
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:38,640
schematics of

567
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,600
arduino at mega 32 u4 i figured out that

568
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:45,200
there is d7 so interrupt pin 6

569
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,919
available that is never used during in

570
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,520
other arduino boards i didn't

571
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,960
care about that i just thought he's

572
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,280
there why not using it well

573
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,520
i got a new pcb revision and apparently

574
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,679
it is the most painful interrupt pin

575
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,960
of all of the mega mcu

576
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,919
so just to keep the story short what i

577
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,919
had to do was to after debugging

578
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,280
figuring out why

579
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:09,840
i had to re-engineer so redesign again

580
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,120
the pcb so just

581
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,840
be careful of how many features you want

582
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,200
if there are not the many

583
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,440
the main features and but you won't

584
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:18,400
still in

585
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:20,559
in your product just you know study it

586
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,559
better during the feasibility part

587
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,480
rather than the implementation or design

588
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,000
phase

589
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,240
eventually long story short after the

590
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:30,159
feedbacks gathered from the beta tester

591
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,280
and the bugs fixed

592
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,120
the product was released to the market

593
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:34,960
by the manufacturer

594
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:36,799
and then everyone was able to enjoy the

595
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:38,000
final version of it

596
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:42,640
in a post release

597
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:44,480
just some numbers to give you an idea of

598
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,080
the entity of these

599
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,320
uh of these products that were sold in

600
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,000
with this unbusiness deal so

601
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,919
um before this presentation i asked the

602
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,919
manufacturer to give me some numbers

603
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:56,720
after two ish years of with injector

604
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,280
shells

605
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:58,880
so the number of the units sold by the

606
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,360
manufacturer until now are around

607
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:03,840
10 plus thousand pieces for weed

608
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,720
injector

609
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:09,360
and 1000 plus 1100 plus species for

610
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,159
units for weedily that was released last

611
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:12,640
year

612
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,679
so that that this gives you an idea of

613
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,679
the achievement the results achieved

614
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:20,159
but please don't tell my wife about that

615
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:22,240
otherwise we'll think that my profit

616
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:24,799
no profit deal will with the

617
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:26,320
manufacturer was not a very wise

618
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,720
decision

619
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:31,679
are there similar uh success stories was

620
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:33,840
my journey the only one successful

621
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,400
nope at least couple of people i helped

622
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,919
followed my own business approach and

623
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,919
hopefully more will come in the future

624
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:42,080
as you can see here are some devices

625
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:43,840
hardware hacking devices that were

626
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,799
developed um

627
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,039
following and released by following the

628
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,240
undeal process

629
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,159
so that that's pretty astonishing as

630
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:53,679
well i'm pretty

631
00:22:53,679 --> 00:22:56,320
you know glad that that i'm not the only

632
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:56,720
one

633
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,799
thinking that it's possible to achieve

634
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,440
that so just to recap a bit

635
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,360
um what are the lessons learned

636
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:07,120
well validating the idea is a

637
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,799
prerogative do it

638
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:11,280
do it yourself market analysis and

639
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:12,320
prototyping

640
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,520
are a must for succeeding in uh

641
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,200
in this case at least from my point of

642
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,480
view don't give up at the first

643
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,320
manufacturer refusal is normal

644
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:22,000
they some of them will not understand

645
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:24,159
some of them will not have time

646
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:26,159
just never write them on monday an email

647
00:23:26,159 --> 00:23:28,080
they will just somehow

648
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,880
it happened that always got ignored

649
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,640
documentation is vital

650
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,520
and pick wisely beta tester that's very

651
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,559
good tip

652
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,039
listen to your user as well as well

653
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:40,720
because i got plenty of improvement

654
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,600
derived from

655
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,720
from this point um prioritize action

656
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:45,279
items

657
00:23:45,279 --> 00:23:47,760
i usually follow the divided in pera

658
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:48,559
approach

659
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,520
so dividing a main goal in some subset

660
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,080
of them

661
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,559
and then again and again iterating until

662
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,120
you know i

663
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,039
i managed to complete in a fashionable

664
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:00,000
time a certain small task in a way that

665
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,240
you know i can easily escalate and you

666
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:05,760
know reach my goal in a faster way

667
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:07,679
and finally beware of some human beings

668
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,600
copycats and intellectual property

669
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:10,480
thieves

670
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,480
are always behind the corner so

671
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,320
suggestion ndas

672
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:18,880
and opsec are your friends

673
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:21,440
just last finally i just wanted to show

674
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:22,640
you

675
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:24,400
what i'm working on right now it's

676
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,159
called patabox it's a multi-purpose

677
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:27,279
single board computer

678
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,960
designed to fulfill offensive security

679
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:31,440
needs and much more so if interested of

680
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,960
its development be sure to follow

681
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:34,799
potterbox on twitter

682
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:38,640
and i really hope sadly time is

683
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:40,880
is over so i really hope you enjoyed
