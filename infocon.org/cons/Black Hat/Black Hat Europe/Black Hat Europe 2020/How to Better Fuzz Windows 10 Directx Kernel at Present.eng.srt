2
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:17,199
hello everyone

3
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,480
i'm shaolin from i'm very hyped to

4
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:23,680
black hai to share my topic today the

5
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,279
topic of my speech

6
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:28,320
is how to bite fast direct

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,000
x count at present okay

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,520
this is my introduction i am a

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,559
security search of shiho

10
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,920
i swear i will be main focus

11
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,039
background windows and the links

12
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,520
uh this method if you are interested

13
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,640
you can twitter with me you can you

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,960
you can follow me on twitter okay

15
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,680
about s1 ib which led by this pi

16
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,519
okay we know

17
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,760
there has been a lot of research on

18
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:09,119
directx

19
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,000
this time i will instance three text

20
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:12,880
surfaces

21
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,360
to dis discuss the design of us

22
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,040
let's first look at the architecture of

23
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:23,840
directx

24
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,159
this is a text diagram from the

25
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:31,600
application layer to the kernel layer so

26
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,960
a system call such as gdm

27
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,640
function such as direct

28
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,159
direct sandy and other okay

29
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,759
and there are three uh drivers the entry

30
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,119
controller dng mms one java

31
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,880
dng mms2 driver

32
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:56,079
okay and the other some

33
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,079
drivers such as vmware driver

34
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,840
the nest there has a function

35
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,040
exported the inside recon driver

36
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,318
there their many functions became fuzzy

37
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:14,160
and same time it also generated

38
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:19,040
a lot of pyramids and objects

39
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,400
and as okay

40
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,680
such as the sjk map gpu visual

41
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,040
address function the next

42
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,800
this is the explanation of objects

43
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,840
there are many tabs um objects

44
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,040
this tab shows the relationship

45
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,760
between the application layer and the

46
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,959
corner

47
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,720
and who created these objects

48
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,239
okay the figure on the right shows them

49
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,000
the appearance in the camera

50
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,120
how to apply for memory and you know

51
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,720
emotionalize memory use the uses

52
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:08,159
and destroy disguise okay the next

53
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,480
i will start the reality related

54
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,080
attack surfaces we know

55
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,239
monsanto has many bugs caused by system

56
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,360
mechanisms such as

57
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,400
kuzaki kobak so what about

58
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,120
directx

59
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,519
[Music]

60
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,200
uh we decided to explore the directx

61
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,319
system mechanism first

62
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,920
attack service i call it looking

63
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,959
for us released memory find

64
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:51,120
where some unreleased memory is released

65
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,319
we know directx use dsjk object

66
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,159
function or some function with different

67
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,319
with shared flags to get shared memory

68
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,519
and use it in the corner but

69
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,640
we didn't finally find any

70
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,040
functions to discharge these shared

71
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,480
memories

72
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,000
so research we found that

73
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:21,199
while it was a system to destroy these

74
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,199
shared functions certian memory

75
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,320
once the process is destroyed the

76
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,680
process causes them for cause them to

77
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,960
release the shared memory such as

78
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,240
the sjk display manager delete procedure

79
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,280
function

80
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,919
and the sjk share the protected

81
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:42,800
assumption of

82
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,919
ob delayed proceed function

83
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:50,240
okay and there may be

84
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,960
some surprise if the finder is called

85
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,840
displayed

86
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,040
to use the system to release memory

87
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,560
i believe there are

88
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,080
other system mechanisms which maybe is a

89
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,000
good director

90
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:10,960
extensions for directx

91
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,240
okay the second

92
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:17,440
text surface i call to get

93
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,320
i called getting more pests with

94
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:22,320
different flags

95
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,280
okay i've we found that the direct

96
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,000
function has many flag settings which

97
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,800
can create

98
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,080
different corner objects

99
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,520
that's affecting the corner such as

100
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:38,000
great

101
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,280
sosc object

102
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,400
it has many it has

103
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,639
different flags over these

104
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,840
different flags allow it to repre

105
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,680
represent the different contents in the

106
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,039
corner

107
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,479
it can represent object

108
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,080
of its or project project

109
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,720
level um we mean

110
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,639
we call it object mark

111
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:20,400
and in other functions

112
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,199
it can get more pass in the same

113
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:23,759
function

114
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,960
because of its different flags

115
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,800
use these different flags to generate

116
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:34,400
different objects these objects

117
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,360
take different paths when they are

118
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,639
referenced

119
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,479
in other functions so this can increase

120
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:47,280
our feedback rate coverage feedback rate

121
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:50,560
okay the figure shows

122
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:53,919
the flag extract authorities functions

123
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:59,520
and the object marked in the corner

124
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,360
such as the ijk create contact

125
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:06,400
with your function objects marquee s7

126
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,599
and flag design d ddi and create

127
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,440
counter flags okay

128
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,560
the next is content

129
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,440
in the counter after setting the flag

130
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:20,400
his con

131
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,599
a function can have different permits

132
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,800
a function can create objects of

133
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,360
different

134
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,479
flags the flag means they are

135
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:34,800
copies and attributes in the comment

136
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,000
the figure on the right shows this model

137
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,840
the object 2 and the objects

138
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,199
is the same same object with different

139
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,199
flags and referenced

140
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:55,759
in the same functions

141
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,319
so this this object can have different

142
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,960
object masks object marking the corner

143
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:09,360
okay last

144
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,400
using citing a flag to generate more

145
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:13,120
paths

146
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,800
such as setting flags from a function to

147
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,199
b

148
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,560
function and general generate from b

149
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:24,080
function to save function

150
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,240
uh where it means a function

151
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,759
decided to save function

152
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,039
decide the c function okay the flight

153
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,839
means a lot of paths uh

154
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,839
parents

155
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:45,519
parents function some function create a

156
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:50,160
sum function with me

157
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,360
and the next rewards

158
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,640
we found that the structures of some

159
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,160
function of directx

160
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:04,080
is not public or has been changed

161
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,200
so a lot of these words and

162
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,480
we can't private state structures

163
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,240
and assembly tourism that's brilliant in

164
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,279
the fields

165
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,800
that the people hadn't explored before

166
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,360
in public

167
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,519
uh take the opportunity to studies

168
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,600
these pyramids and to capture the bug

169
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,080
such as this series

170
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,120
this is is this tv

171
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,640
or we found this uh we found it

172
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,160
the left side of its thumbpace

173
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,080
refunction the picture in the

174
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:53,279
upper right corner is a screenshot of

175
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,120
bug

176
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,480
and the following the bug after

177
00:09:58,480 --> 00:09:59,760
initialize through

178
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:02,880
mem set function which

179
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,160
is well

180
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,680
it is passed by

181
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:13,040
a site function yes

182
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:17,040
it's simply that the memory is not

183
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:20,720
initialized and then goes to

184
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:23,839
uh application layer say

185
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:26,880
this page is from the slow

186
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:31,360
as it was okay

187
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,480
when we have discovered some get

188
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,160
some text surfaces we use these attack

189
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:39,680
surfaces

190
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,719
to design first

191
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:48,880
let's let let's start too fast

192
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,800
then we found this downfall

193
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,839
and the next

194
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:59,040
we know the system fast about the lynx

195
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,760
cone

196
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,399
has talked about our loved ones things

197
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:02,880
about

198
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,640
blocks like this

199
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,680
open read and close

200
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,800
we think it is very important for our

201
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,360
files

202
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,880
so we have also contained a lot

203
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:22,000
of blocks and

204
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:25,279
random calls sometimes a function is

205
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,000
selected sometimes b function is

206
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,440
selected but

207
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,480
some function must be called such as

208
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:37,440
open open function okay

209
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:44,240
the last the next is our first framework

210
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,279
the first the first year was the first

211
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:48,160
design

212
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:52,480
based on the afm model

213
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:55,839
and we have we have

214
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,399
we have to write right the most seed and

215
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:58,880
a

216
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,240
blog blog state and

217
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,760
read read the memory page patch the

218
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:06,880
pyramids

219
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:10,480
and the motivations apartments

220
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,639
the perm the motivations mutation comes

221
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:17,200
from the mutation idea comes from this

222
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,160
color

223
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,839
of other and into the first loop

224
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:25,200
but we have a unicorn first model

225
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:28,560
we have new idea it's

226
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,720
it's a fast model we have a first model

227
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:36,560
similarly into mosaic bike

228
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,760
which means the first attack and

229
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:44,720
we have first mode two for flag

230
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:48,399
uh we use different flags to

231
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:52,000
create different objects and

232
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,480
rewards

233
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,279
we also we also have a log

234
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:02,320
we have logger to record function

235
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,560
uh which means record a lot of blocks

236
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,120
and uh the same time recorder permits

237
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:14,880
okay the next

238
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,800
that this is flowcard

239
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,519
okay uh let's

240
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,639
let's look at a few series that's the

241
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,079
first

242
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:29,519
uh it's dumbfell

243
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:35,839
we can look it and

244
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,000
and this and this

245
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,480
this is poc

246
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:50,720
we can we can see the kind of design the

247
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,000
chemically

248
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,560
created pinch cool function is a

249
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,279
permanent

250
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,480
preparement of designed camera

251
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:02,800
this can be create protected function

252
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,839
and designed the camtasia objects

253
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:08,880
reference the handle of designing

254
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:09,760
committee

255
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:13,920
protected sanction function and

256
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:16,480
design the chemistry of and disturb and

257
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,240
release the object

258
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,800
of the sandy cavity create create a

259
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,320
pinch kill

260
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,360
object and

261
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,120
and when when does destroy window

262
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:32,079
release the object created by the sandy

263
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,680
county create

264
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,040
a pinch qr function because after

265
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,079
descending community

266
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,279
create protected solution is called by

267
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:45,600
designing chemistry objects

268
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,519
designed chemistry share projects

269
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,639
doesn't

270
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:51,680
has a special function to release the

271
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:53,120
memory

272
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,839
when the process is destroyed the

273
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:58,560
function in the first

274
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,199
the first attack service is called to

275
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,240
process

276
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:05,519
uh this memo this shared memory

277
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,279
this function is designed

278
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:12,959
the sjk shared protected search op

279
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:16,720
delete procedure okay

280
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:19,920
then the memory

281
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,120
of design dkmt create pinch

282
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:25,720
function has been released in the

283
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:26,959
re-reference

284
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,000
of designing chemistry objects function

285
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,320
the destroy window is called this genre

286
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,440
window will

287
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:37,040
call this the sjk share the protected

288
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:38,160
assumption

289
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,600
obituate proceed function and release

290
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:46,240
this object's memory and close the path

291
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,720
okay the output is plc

292
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:54,160
and

293
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,800
the next

294
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,920
uh let's talk about other assignments in

295
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:05,199
the corner

296
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,399
otherwise on the left

297
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,519
it is inertialized over correct as well

298
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,279
as object memory

299
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,959
in the corner and on the right

300
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,040
the corner object of design the

301
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,720
committee creates

302
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:24,320
so create a pencil in gsg

303
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,600
protected social initialize

304
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,120
is assigned to the memory of

305
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:36,160
designed company create protected search

306
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,720
and when descending chemistry share

307
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,560
objects function

308
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,079
was called for the false term the sjk is

309
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,560
where i'm showing someone's object

310
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:48,000
struct

311
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,600
which which is on the right the sjsync

312
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,759
object struct was released

313
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,160
when destroying the window was called

314
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,079
the ngk shared

315
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,560
protected essential ob delete procedure

316
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,519
function was

317
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,959
checked finally

318
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:10,480
it were it was caused to density global

319
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,480
disjoint isolation object

320
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,079
to release the

321
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:19,199
same memory again and

322
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,439
caused the direct fluid okay

323
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,439
this is the first attack service

324
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:30,640
uh cost the tax so

325
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,679
i think maybe uh direct the x

326
00:17:33,679 --> 00:17:36,799
system mechanism has

327
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,559
some has more surprise

328
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:44,320
okay for the next

329
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,919
to the end i was against shared

330
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:52,320
series with claire's recognized

331
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,760
that the counter has allowed a larger

332
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:58,960
memory a large num

333
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,400
remember of memory applications and

334
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,600
releases so after

335
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:08,640
memory is released if

336
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,720
if if it is not to set zero

337
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:16,080
if you find another release

338
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,200
pass even where it will cause

339
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:23,280
sector release uh the following

340
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:26,400
bug is three mms

341
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,679
two java uh dsj counter driver caller

342
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,360
calls the three ms2 driver okay

343
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,480
uh where the mml process phone

344
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:40,080
storage allocated for instance

345
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,240
the results unlock memory

346
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,679
that's first and uh

347
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:50,240
when the mml phone storage page

348
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,000
initially is called

349
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,160
free storage release

350
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,679
the log t the memory and where the mlm

351
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:03,120
from storage pins link

352
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,880
uh destructor uh

353
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,480
also called freestyle to

354
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:13,760
release the same system memory

355
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,039
so we know we first know

356
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:22,160
the way id mmf storage page initial is

357
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:25,600
construct and there's where the mmf

358
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:28,559
storage page the link destruct function

359
00:19:28,559 --> 00:19:29,520
is

360
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:32,799
destruct so uh

361
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:36,000
so the construct and the distracted

362
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,200
phrase the same

363
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,320
object and this uh

364
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,640
phrase the same memory and this memory

365
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,080
is not

366
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,559
is not set zero it's amazing

367
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:53,120
okay we can see the red picture

368
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,400
uh way too is where dmi

369
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:00,960
fonts uh story page freestyle

370
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,159
function is not clear to zero after

371
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:04,960
release

372
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,880
the memory and we know to

373
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,799
to pass so after the construct

374
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:16,640
is called we can call the construct

375
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,559
where trigger post

376
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,600
and because the other three

377
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:28,480
okay the next

378
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:31,520
uh this is stump

379
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,679
we can clear seat

380
00:20:35,679 --> 00:20:38,720
locate and the next

381
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,919
uh results we have

382
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,679
some similes and some bugs

383
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,039
we will we will uh

384
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,960
struggle to get more crazy or

385
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,280
some important bugs okay

386
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,880
the next uh i want to

387
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:04,799
see coverage uh

388
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:07,360
first i want to see coverage comments

389
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,960
feedback on

390
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,080
windows account driver because it's

391
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:17,120
not open uh just saw some windows corner

392
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:20,159
comment further back i think we maybe

393
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:23,440
should have different feedback models

394
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:23,760
for

395
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,679
different drivers purpose

396
00:21:27,679 --> 00:21:31,280
currency feedback for function called

397
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:34,320
templates is also a good idea

398
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,600
which means we can get more

399
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,280
blogs we can get more

400
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:44,320
blogs or maybe

401
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:47,679
of course we can use pt drummer to

402
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:51,039
increase the coverage or permits

403
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:54,559
permits and

404
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:59,360
i think blog is important for the

405
00:21:59,360 --> 00:22:04,240
system called fuzzer and the next

406
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:09,440
new attack service i think maybe

407
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,640
direct system mechanism

408
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,400
is a good idea

409
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:21,679
maybe maybe it will give

410
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:26,000
us some surprise

411
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,240
okay uh maybe we

412
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,840
also we also researched the driver of

413
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,720
one stock drum

414
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,200
and as a driver to get more

415
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,240
more news research and uh

416
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,000
okay the next uh this is my account

417
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,799
okay i can manage munch okay

418
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:54,400
uh pgi and adventure

419
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:58,640
and the next 6 6 error one

420
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:04,159
uh if if you have any questions you can

421
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:08,240
