00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,119
hello everyone

3
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:18,640
my name is jason and i'm the director of

4
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,240
the strategic threat advisory group at

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:21,119
crowdstrike

6
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,320
today we're going to talk about north

7
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,000
korea's rapid ascent to becoming a

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,920
global cyber superpower

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,599
so like i said i lead something at

10
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:29,039
crowdstrike called the strategic threat

11
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,000
advisory group

12
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,599
and basically what our team does is we

13
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,280
help our customers operationalize their

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:35,040
threat intelligence capabilities

15
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,480
prior to crowdstrike i used to work for

16
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,239
a big four consulting firm where i built

17
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,840
threat intelligence programs for fortune

18
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,160
500 companies and government agencies

19
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:43,440
prior to that i was in the army for

20
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:45,039
approximately seven years where i held

21
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,800
assignments at places like the nsa

22
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,800
and united states cyber command and now

23
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:52,000
over to my colleague josh burgess

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,920
hey everybody so josh burgess i lead the

25
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:55,840
technical science chief director team

26
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:57,600
sounds like an arbitrary long title but

27
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,120
i'm the person helps people action

28
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,239
intelligence from a technical

29
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:01,039
perspective

30
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:02,800
integrate automate it and build it into

31
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:04,559
your workflow i've been at crowdcheck

32
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:04,879
about

33
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,680
three years um running this program part

34
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:08,159
of that

35
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:10,560
working as a lead technical officer at a

36
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,240
major credit card processor was there at

37
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,920
about four years prior to that

38
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,439
u.s intelligence community doing that

39
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:17,439
for about 10 years um

40
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:19,280
in private military what i've learned

41
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,560
along the years is

42
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,840
it's not necessarily about how much

43
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,600
money you spend sure you could dump

44
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,799
millions and millions of millions of

45
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,960
dollars in infosec program or millions

46
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,880
of dollars into an intelligence program

47
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,880
but it really won't make you better the

48
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,000
idea is to learn

49
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,880
from history learn from the tax and the

50
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,079
techniques that we've seen

51
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,159
build that into your intelligence

52
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:40,240
program and help you get to the point

53
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:40,720
where

54
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,920
you're predictive instead of reactive

55
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,399
awesome thanks josh so here's the agenda

56
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:47,840
that we're going to be reviewing today

57
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:48,720
we're going to start off with an

58
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,479
executive summary that reviews over all

59
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,079
the patterns that we've observed from

60
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,119
north korea

61
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:54,320
and then we're going to talk about their

62
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,240
evolution throughout their cyber journey

63
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,040
across a three-phase process phase one

64
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,799
is where they focus on military-focused

65
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:01,680
targeting

66
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,600
phase two is much more so about currency

67
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,960
generation operations

68
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,960
and phase three more about dual focused

69
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,360
operations finally we'll conclude by

70
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,720
giving a few predictions

71
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,080
about where we think north korea might

72
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,920
evolve to in the future

73
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,200
so let's go ahead and start off with the

74
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,200
executive summary and

75
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:18,400
probably the best way for us to

76
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,920
characterize north korea's path to

77
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,160
becoming a global cyber superpower is

78
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:22,640
across

79
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:24,480
these three phases of their evolutionary

80
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,640
process in the first phase

81
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,200
we're looking at the the kim il you know

82
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:30,480
the kim jong-il

83
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:32,560
dynasty kind of regime during that time

84
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,319
frame and during that time frame they

85
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,080
were very much so focused on

86
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:38,239
power projection really going after

87
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,599
military targets

88
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,040
also during that time frame they were

89
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,560
demonstrating the beginnings of their

90
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,840
nuclear program

91
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,280
and so again in this phase they're

92
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,640
really focused on kind of really

93
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:47,760
projecting power

94
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,120
and really pushing back some of the

95
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,280
regional adversaries to include the

96
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,239
united states

97
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,120
south korea and japan in the next phase

98
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,160
we're going to talk about currency

99
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,680
generation operations

100
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,920
and this basically came as a result of a

101
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,440
lot of the sanctions that were put on

102
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,239
north korea

103
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:05,120
as a result of their nuclear program so

104
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,239
in order to bypass

105
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,000
some of the financial hardships caused

106
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
by these sanctions we observed north

107
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,680
korea engage in a variety of different

108
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:13,680
types of currency generation operations

109
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,560
to include fraudulent attacks ransomware

110
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,760
attacks against the swift banking

111
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:18,400
systems

112
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,720
and more and then lastly we're going to

113
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,879
talk about dual focused operations which

114
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,280
is where we see them as currently being

115
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,560
and this is basically where they have a

116
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,120
dual focus priority the first one being

117
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,799
really still going after these economic

118
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:32,159
targets and still some of the currency

119
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:33,120
generation targets

120
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,280
but also really expanding their global

121
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:36,400
targeting apparatus

122
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,920
to go after more international

123
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,000
organizations such as the un

124
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,920
and other similar type organizations

125
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,599
so before we dive into talking about the

126
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:47,280
phased approach that we saw in north

127
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,159
korea leverage

128
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:50,799
let's do a brief history and review so

129
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:51,599
with the first

130
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,360
few kind of attacks that we're observing

131
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,959
here what you'll notice is that for

132
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,640
these four that i'm showing here

133
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,480
it's really much more so about lashing

134
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,680
out and

135
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,439
in large part i would i would argue that

136
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:03,439
a lot of the attacks they did early on

137
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:04,560
their days were fairly

138
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,319
ineffective they engage in a lot of

139
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:07,599
different ddos attacks

140
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,200
they attempt to use wipers on several

141
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,040
different occasions however they weren't

142
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,200
able to really do any serious damage in

143
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,400
the beginning of their military

144
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:15,920
targeting phase

145
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,440
and then as they kind of progress

146
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,358
throughout this phase what you'll notice

147
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:20,880
is that the attacks become much more

148
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:21,600
targeted

149
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,479
as well as more focused so here's what i

150
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:25,440
mean by that

151
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,040
whereas in the first phase you see a lot

152
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,199
of ddos attacks and a lot of lashing out

153
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:30,960
in this subsequent phase you see a lot

154
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,120
more focus for example the exfiltration

155
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,960
of 200 gigabytes of data from the south

156
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,479
korean ministry of defense

157
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:38,000
which you know again that's a that's a

158
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,919
major victory for the north korean

159
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,639
cyber capability you also see them hold

160
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,720
at risk the korea hydro and nuclear

161
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,600
power plant

162
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:46,880
you see them continue to go after

163
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,320
critical infrastructure by going after

164
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,520
the seals the

165
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,000
seattle subway system and then of course

166
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,160
culminating in november 2014 with

167
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,080
you know a very significant attack

168
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:58,000
against sony pictures

169
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
in the next phase of operations we see

170
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,919
north korea focus much more on currency

171
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:02,880
generation

172
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,199
and that's what this these blue uh you

173
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:06,639
know these blue little snippets here

174
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,600
really mean right

175
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:08,800
and this is where they're focused much

176
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,720
more on engaging in attacks that allow

177
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,400
them to generate currency

178
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,360
such as atm cash out schemes fraudulent

179
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,000
attacks

180
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,160
the use of the wannacry capability as a

181
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,360
sort of ransomware

182
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,759
as well as stealing approximately 60

183
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:22,800
million dollars

184
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,880
from taiwan far eastern international

185
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,919
bank

186
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,120
and then the last phase of their

187
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,199
operations what you see them now do is

188
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,560
really engage in sort of this

189
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,199
dual focused type of activity where

190
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,880
they're not only focused on still the

191
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,639
currency generation operations as

192
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,160
indicated over here where i'm circling

193
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:38,880
my mouse

194
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,160
with the you know the stealing of seven

195
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:41,680
million dollars from the cryptocurrency

196
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,479
dragon x

197
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,639
cryptocurrency exchange but also attacks

198
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:45,919
against critical infrastructure

199
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,440
such as the one i'm illustrating here in

200
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,960
october 2017

201
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,720
as well as attacks against international

202
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:52,080
targets such as the one they were

203
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:54,880
illustrating over here in august 2020

204
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,639
so again we're looking at sort of this

205
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,479
evolutionary phased approach

206
00:05:58,479 --> 00:05:59,440
where they start off with

207
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,600
military-focused targeting then evolve

208
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,520
towards currency generation operations

209
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,960
and then lastly leading them to where

210
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,800
they're at now with as where they sort

211
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:07,039
of

212
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,080
dual focus in their operational stature

213
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,680
so now let's talk about the individual

214
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,039
phases and we're going to start off with

215
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:14,880
phase one which is military focused

216
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:15,759
targeting

217
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,680
and again with from a military focused

218
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,800
targeting perspective

219
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:20,479
here's some of the big areas that we saw

220
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:22,720
them focus on the first one being around

221
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,919
the use of personas

222
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,600
so josh is going to describe this in his

223
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:27,199
slide but basically what we saw north

224
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:28,560
korea do early on

225
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,120
is use various personas in order to

226
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,160
avoid blame

227
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,080
or avoid taking too much credit for some

228
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,680
of these malicious attacks

229
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,680
like i said in the overview slide we saw

230
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,960
them engage in a lot of different

231
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,759
operations

232
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,680
against both south korea as well as the

233
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,800
united states

234
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,560
particularly ineffective operations

235
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,160
especially in the early days

236
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,919
and then lastly i would characterize

237
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,919
this phase as being really much so about

238
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:50,240
how

239
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,319
very much so about power projection so

240
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,240
the ability to project power

241
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,639
to push back regional adversaries to

242
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:57,919
demonstrate to the world

243
00:06:57,919 --> 00:06:59,919
that they are this you know extremely

244
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:01,280
powerful regime with all sorts of

245
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,160
capabilities

246
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,919
and this is very common for different

247
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,440
types of countries who are trying to

248
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:06,560
engage in deterrence

249
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,680
in order to basically get the

250
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,599
international community to kind of go

251
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:10,800
more their way

252
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,319
so now over to josh where he'll talk

253
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,680
about some of the personas and some of

254
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,440
the more nuanced aspects of this phase

255
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,840
of the north korean operations

256
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,680
thanks jason so a couple of different

257
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,360
phases like when you look at the initial

258
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,840
campaigns all the way from 2009 2011

259
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,919
independence day 10 days of rain

260
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,240
really no misdirection they didn't point

261
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:30,080
to hey we're this group or that group

262
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,319
or a fake activist group they just smash

263
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,000
stuffed and they tagged it but they

264
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,759
didn't tag it as north korea

265
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,680
dark soul was the first time that they

266
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,440
actually misdirected

267
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,120
the eagle is it who is team there's some

268
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,639
references to roman foot soldiers that

269
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:43,759
they messed up and i'll show you what

270
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,360
that looks like in a second

271
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,120
in operation high anonymous because you

272
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,440
know what anonymous is still big in 2013

273
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,199
let's go ahead and ride that train if we

274
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,160
still can

275
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,680
and they utilize that as their big

276
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,479
persona guardians of peace the sony hack

277
00:07:56,479 --> 00:07:58,479
now guardians of peace was interesting

278
00:07:58,479 --> 00:07:59,520
because again

279
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,000
fake this persona but they utilize a lot

280
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,080
of the same artistry and same imagery

281
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,759
from the previous campaigns like dark

282
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,599
soul and high anonymous so i guess

283
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:09,120
the uh the artists there really weren't

284
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,800
feeling too original

285
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,199
with the latest campaign the last one

286
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:14,560
that we saw with some real big

287
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,440
misdirection

288
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,000
was who am i and that who my campaign

289
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,759
was launched against the korean hydro

290
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:20,800
nuclear program

291
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,919
or nuclear plant excuse me and they bent

292
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:24,560
what like

293
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,000
as a traditional definition of a

294
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,520
hacktivist they didn't just go in and do

295
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,879
something for ideology

296
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,720
they went and did something for ideology

297
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,719
but they also had an e-crime slant and

298
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:34,159
espionage slant so

299
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,360
it's a little interesting and that's

300
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,760
really where the um where the personas

301
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:41,760
kind of stopped after that

302
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,599
so let's talk about military targeting

303
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,360
of south korea this is where they were

304
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,640
first all kicked off 4 july 2009

305
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,120
dozer dozer is a multi-pronged malware

306
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,760
approach

307
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,600
the first thing dozer does is ddos

308
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,959
attacks and the first one is leveraged

309
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,160
that was u.s targets

310
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:58,800
on the fourth of july then you know we

311
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,160
saw on the 7th of july

312
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,080
going against 7th or 9th of july going

313
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,519
against korean targets

314
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,440
this these targets going after gov

315
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,720
mill.com

316
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,080
banking sites um ddos you know

317
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,640
fairly effective not particularly great

318
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:13,360
and then

319
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,200
came the wiper component on the 10th day

320
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,279
the wiper command goes in

321
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,320
and smashes stuff 10 days away the next

322
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,399
evolution 2011.

323
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:26,000
cordos create a botnet and be our wiper

324
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,600
now this one was a little more tailored

325
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:28,959
a little more customized this is when

326
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:30,640
they first started building obfuscation

327
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,320
encrypting their malware

328
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,760
the other thing they did was interesting

329
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,680
they look for files very specific to

330
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,000
south

331
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,720
korean systems files like dot hwp or

332
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,080
hangout word processor

333
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,760
or files like g well or azp or some of

334
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,519
the other south korean tools

335
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,920
again though a lot of the mostly ddos

336
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,279
attacks with a little bit of white brown

337
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:50,640
tail dark soul

338
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,320
this is when they really started making

339
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:55,120
web um the steedy and who is wipers

340
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,320
used against atm systems um

341
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,440
servers workstations multiple big huge

342
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,440
south korean banks were hit pretty hard

343
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,959
tens of thousands of systems

344
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,200
were wiped this malware worked on

345
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,279
windows as well as linux environments it

346
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:10,640
really wasn't specific to one

347
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,320
platform or the other the other thing

348
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,160
that's interesting about this malware

349
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,000
is you know the references to histidi

350
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,600
and principles they kind of messed up

351
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,680
those references those are basically

352
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,240
um forms of old roman soldiers they kind

353
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:24,800
of mix

354
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,800
mix and match the definitions mix and

355
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,920
match how they were used

356
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,360
really didn't read their textbooks quite

357
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,519
right operation high anonymous

358
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,040
you know again why not ride the

359
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,120
anonymous train that's big back then

360
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:37,279
core high malware used against mostly

361
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:38,880
south korean government well as needed

362
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,839
targets

363
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,920
things interesting about this campaign

364
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:44,399
is a lot of the malware that we saw

365
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,519
that we took apart the amount

366
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:51,680
the malware specifically had

367
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,680
the credentials hard coded into it so

368
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,519
they knew what they were breaking into

369
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,440
before they broke into it once they got

370
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,800
into systems

371
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,040
wipers perform change administrator

372
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,240
passwords from

373
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,680
whatever they already knew it was to

374
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,000
hide on 2013

375
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,640
and cause impact the last big one

376
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:09,920
kimonsky

377
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:12,640
kamonski targeted korean hydro nuclear

378
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:13,519
plant

379
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,720
and this malware did extensive recon

380
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:18,800
help ahead of the you know actual

381
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,200
infection the reason this is a big deal

382
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,600
and it ties all three together it goes

383
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:25,040
you know the e-crime side when they

384
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,079
broke in they demanded

385
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:28,480
millions of dollars millions of dollars

386
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,519
in order to

387
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:31,200
disable you know in order to re-enable

388
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,680
systems they also demanded that

389
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,360
you shall um shut down three reactors

390
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,040
as a part of our demands not sure where

391
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:40,880
that demand came from but they also had

392
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:42,000
an espionage piece

393
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,720
so the kamatsuki malware was designed to

394
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,560
steal information about nuclear power

395
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:48,560
generation because if you've looked at a

396
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,040
map of north and south korea north korea

397
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,480
is really dark at night

398
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:54,240
south korea not so dark so they're

399
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,079
trying to you know

400
00:11:56,079 --> 00:11:58,079
push through military targeting but also

401
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,839
kind of straddle all three lines along

402
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,639
with their attacks

403
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,680
last one power projections the sony

404
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:08,240
attack um retribution for the interview

405
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:10,800
the james franco and seth rogen movie

406
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:11,839
that basically

407
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,880
uh made fun of the um kim jong-un and

408
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,320
later led to his assassin you know

409
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,839
assassination

410
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,079
they got in and this was an all hands on

411
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,800
deck they utilized malware from multiple

412
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,079
different subgroups

413
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:26,000
to get in and really smash things around

414
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,240
one of the best tools was bramble

415
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,959
um and then core high for smb spring

416
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:31,360
these

417
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,360
tools were used like years and years and

418
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,440
years prior to the attacks

419
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,639
so get in spread around utilize

420
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:42,160
smb ports to move and move loudly

421
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,560
then utilize tools like mac truck which

422
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:46,959
was used in swift targeting nest egg

423
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,040
also in swift targeting and the atm

424
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:50,639
attacks

425
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,760
get in steal information they stole

426
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,360
employee information from every sony

427
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,120
entertainment employee under the sun

428
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,600
they also stole all the future movies

429
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,040
before they were even released

430
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,720
posted them all out again it goes back

431
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,240
to that projecting power

432
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,639
you shall not mess with us we don't take

433
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:07,360
kindly

434
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,160
to your slights and our leader um and

435
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:10,959
that's how they

436
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,839
did those attacks

437
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,360
[Music]

438
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:17,440
so the first movie first movie i'm sure

439
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:18,639
you guys first demonstration i'm gonna

440
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,000
show you guys is dozer

441
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,639
dozer was the original destructive piece

442
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,440
of malware

443
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,399
that we saw from north korea let's go

444
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,959
ahead and roll it

445
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,120
so this is the first of three different

446
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,240
malware samples we're going to

447
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:33,600
demonstrate for you guys

448
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,880
this is the og of the dprk destructive

449
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:37,839
malware

450
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:39,920
what we're going to walk through is my

451
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,880
doom

452
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,440
now dozer was the first real campaign

453
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,199
they did the first real malware family

454
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,120
my doom is the destructive side

455
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,040
the reason we're doing my doom is

456
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,279
because my doom operates really well on

457
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,600
windows 7 and windows xp where dozer

458
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,600
really only works on windows xp

459
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,240
to do what we really wanted to do so

460
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,480
since windows xp license keys are nearly

461
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:01,760
impossible to get a hold of at this

462
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,279
point which is a funny story because my

463
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:04,320
wife just threw away

464
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,680
the last of my old witness copies a

465
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,600
couple weeks ago but

466
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,440
since we don't have a copy of windows xp

467
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,959
we're gonna run this on seven it's gonna

468
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,000
work just fine

469
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
now as i detonate this couple things to

470
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,600
think about again this is the original

471
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,320
stuff

472
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,560
not particularly quiet arp requests are

473
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,240
going to go crazy with this thing trying

474
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:21,839
to move all over the network as much as

475
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:22,639
it can

476
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:23,839
the other thing that's interesting about

477
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,839
this is despite the fact

478
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:27,760
that it's the early campaigns there is a

479
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,160
couple anti-virtualization

480
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,600
tricks and techniques that they use in

481
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,440
there this is an obfuscated version of

482
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,160
vm

483
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:36,320
so it works just fine but there is a

484
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,680
little bit obfuscation to do

485
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,360
the other thing they do is the mutex

486
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,519
that the malware creates is ahn

487
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:45,440
underscore v3 pro so kind of a nod to

488
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,399
south korean um

489
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,000
antivirus you know when they launch the

490
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,600
campaign the other thing that's

491
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,480
interesting about this

492
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,480
is when they go through and they execute

493
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,399
a lot of 10 files are dropped

494
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:57,199
unpacked dll comes down more tim files

495
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:58,959
loud beacon out back to

496
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:02,800
um a a get request that's really obvious

497
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:05,519
the get request is slash china slash dns

498
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:06,560
the uh

499
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,720
the 200 you know marking is google.com

500
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,720
exclamation point which is interesting

501
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,720
but you know again not particularly well

502
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:14,320
written but it does its job so we're

503
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:15,519
going to go and execute this and you're

504
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:16,720
going to see what it does so we're going

505
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,880
to give this next pupil name

506
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,079
go run

507
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:25,760
quick comb through all the files are now

508
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:26,880
locked

509
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,040
we don't need to do any more as you can

510
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,120
see can't do anything with it it's a

511
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,000
gzip file

512
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,759
the gzip file's encrypted the only thing

513
00:15:33,759 --> 00:15:36,000
that remains is a beautiful picture of

514
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,120
this nice man

515
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:38,959
right here on my desktop that's the only

516
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:40,320
thing that lasted from the encryption

517
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:41,199
process so

518
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:42,240
that was the first thing we're going to

519
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,279
show you guys there's a couple more

520
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:45,680
coming your way

521
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,920
awesome good stuff josh so in this next

522
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,199
phase we're going to talk about the

523
00:15:49,199 --> 00:15:50,880
transition from the military targeting

524
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:51,519
phase

525
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,839
much more towards a currency generation

526
00:15:53,839 --> 00:15:55,759
type targeting aperture

527
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,360
and really what we're looking at here

528
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,800
and the reason that this happened

529
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,720
is because as a consequence of a lot of

530
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,240
north korea's actions

531
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,399
during the you know kind of the the 2008

532
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,240
to 2014 time frame

533
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,320
north korea well the international

534
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,920
community imposed a variety of different

535
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,880
sanctions

536
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,279
on north korea so the way we saw north

537
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:14,240
korea respond

538
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,480
was by engaging in cyber operations that

539
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,320
allowed them to generate currency

540
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,920
the first of those was against the

541
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,440
targeting against the swift banking

542
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,079
systems

543
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:23,920
where they were able to basically engage

544
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:25,199
in a global fraud

545
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:26,399
against several different banks

546
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,959
throughout the world the next was an atm

547
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:30,160
jackpotting technique

548
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,079
where uh during some of the subsequent

549
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:33,040
slides josh is actually going to

550
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:33,519
describe

551
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:35,279
how they how they used fast cash to

552
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,040
engage in banking entities throughout

553
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:38,240
asia and africa

554
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,079
and then lastly we saw north korea

555
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,519
actually also engage in ransomware

556
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,399
operations

557
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:45,040
via wannacry where they use ransomware

558
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,320
in order to fulfill some of their

559
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,040
objectives

560
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,519
and again to make uh to make money in

561
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,440
order to fund the regime's illicit

562
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,399
activities

563
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,160
and now over to josh thank you jason so

564
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,199
swift targeting where it all started um

565
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,440
actually the first yeah incident that we

566
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,319
saw was the bangladesh bank targeting um

567
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:06,400
they actually made quite a bit of money

568
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,760
well into nine figure

569
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,959
kind of um revenue from that now the way

570
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,880
this initial attack happened was

571
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:15,039
you get into systems and they had deep

572
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,199
knowledge deep deep knowledge of these

573
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,240
targets um

574
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,679
well ahead of time so get in modify the

575
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:22,720
swift you know swift

576
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,119
transactions delete the records behind

577
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:25,760
you

578
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,880
and then you know some additional steps

579
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,240
and additional steps especially in the

580
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,240
beginning was super interesting because

581
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:34,799
they actually had programs designed to

582
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:35,280
steal

583
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,240
information as it went from the system

584
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,480
process the transaction to the printer

585
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,720
they don't want anybody to have any

586
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,320
record of these attacks

587
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:46,080
later on the vietnam attack which is the

588
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,160
next one that we tracked they modified

589
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,440
the foxit reader

590
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:52,720
to to obfuscate and change the message

591
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,160
as it went out

592
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,600
it kind of shows you that that deep

593
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,360
knowledge this wasn't like

594
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,520
uh e-crime attack it was a spray and

595
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,280
prey trying to hit whoever they could

596
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,039
they knew what they were targeting over

597
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,799
the years they made over two billion

598
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,720
dollars in these campaigns

599
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,960
um the the other piece that goes along

600
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,160
with this you know because this is north

601
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:10,960
korea

602
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:13,200
is the white papers the wipers were part

603
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,280
of a highly modular framework going back

604
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:17,120
to the two-pence power framework

605
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:20,480
that was deployed in the end to

606
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,559
mess up forensic evidence or mess up you

607
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,240
know tracking of actually what happened

608
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,679
and hopefully they get to keep their

609
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,280
money sometimes they did

610
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:30,480
and then sometimes they did

611
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,480
the next one i want to talk to you guys

612
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,120
about is atm jackpot

613
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,520
operation fast cache again starts with

614
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,280
two pins framework get a beach head

615
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:39,840
there

616
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,640
deploy modular framework once the module

617
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:43,440
framework was in

618
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,600
again highly targeted really capable

619
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,360
stuff this wasn't like a spray and prey

620
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,080
attack

621
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,720
they actually targeted the aix operating

622
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,120
system which is owned by ibm

623
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,720
now if they you know a lot of these

624
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,320
banks that they had the current version

625
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,000
of it they didn't use legacy software

626
00:18:58,000 --> 00:18:59,280
that was end of life

627
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:01,440
by years a lot of these attacks wouldn't

628
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,960
have been a possibility so they targeted

629
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:03,919
vulnerabilities

630
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:06,799
in these older um these older operating

631
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,240
systems so

632
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:09,840
when the matter got in the first target

633
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:12,400
swiss the swiss application servers

634
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,799
intercept the cash withdrawal and delete

635
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,720
the record of it in the tail end

636
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,559
they also built that as they went

637
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,080
through this a very

638
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,480
um high level of social engineering in

639
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,080
one case they went after a

640
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:26,320
major chilean bank when they hit the

641
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:27,520
chilean bank

642
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:28,960
um i guess they didn't get in the way

643
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:30,160
one two or they wanted to get in a

644
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,360
different way they actually

645
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:34,080
recruited an individual from a linkedin

646
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,480
post

647
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:35,840
found an individual that worked there

648
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,760
that was network administrator sent him

649
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:39,120
a fake job interview

650
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:41,760
actually held a job interview over skype

651
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:42,880
in spanish

652
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,520
um a job interview went really well hey

653
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,039
you got the job just download this

654
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,160
executable to help you fill out the

655
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:48,960
application

656
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,520
executables the back door as a result of

657
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,640
these attacks and

658
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:54,080
much of them like that we've seen over

659
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,240
30 countries be involved in ap and

660
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:57,200
jackpot

661
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,640
again you want to show like the amount

662
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,039
of time resources in one case we

663
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:01,679
actually saw

664
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:04,400
10 000 fraudulent cash withdrawals these

665
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,320
cash withdrawals were spread across 20

666
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:07,440
different countries

667
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,520
all over the world all these different

668
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,520
cash withdrawals all happened

669
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,840
within five hours high level

670
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,000
sophistication high level of capability

671
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:18,400
it's definitely uh shows that you know

672
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:20,000
they're broke they need to make money

673
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:21,280
they need to get their fun you know

674
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,640
their finances up to where it needs to

675
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,799
be

676
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,480
the last one this is the dawn of the

677
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:29,520
ransomware

678
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:32,080
wannacry wannacry actually started back

679
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:32,960
in february

680
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,159
um of 2017. february 2017

681
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:38,799
um malware was pretty well written had

682
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,159
some obfuscation

683
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,520
had a little bit of you know

684
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,919
misdirection in there um

685
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:45,200
antoine house wasn't particularly

686
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,440
difficult then we saw two more in march

687
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:49,280
start introducing things like tours of

688
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,600
back in start building an encryption

689
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,720
then we saw more in april april again

690
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,960
kind of the next evolution we saw smb

691
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,559
spreaders be put in there

692
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,679
but in may that's when you know

693
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,440
it went that's when it went nuclear

694
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:05,280
that's when we saw um

695
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,600
all the effects that happened from it we

696
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,120
still don't know the initial infection

697
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,799
maker we think the core dll framework

698
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,240
because in some cases

699
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:14,080
um some of the initial victims had

700
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:16,559
dusted over on their network so earlier

701
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:19,120
targets the reason that the may one was

702
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:20,000
such a huge deal

703
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,760
obviously is they incorporated an

704
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:24,480
internal blue into their attacks the smb

705
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,240
you know vulnerability thank you shadow

706
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,159
brokers for releasing that to the world

707
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:30,000
and that you know caused a huge impact

708
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,159
200 000 systems were infected

709
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,000
all over the world now the interesting

710
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,080
thing about that is 200 000 systems

711
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:38,080
that's a lot of systems right

712
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,240
but they only demand about 300 to 500 in

713
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,280
bitcoin depending on the flavor you got

714
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,799
thousand systems plus three hundred

715
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,000
dollars should have made a lot more

716
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,120
money than a hundred thirty nine

717
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,400
thousand dollars in revenue

718
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,720
but it really did so you know that was

719
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:52,159
the there was a genesis

720
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:55,280
of their ransomware campaigns now we'll

721
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:56,799
go ahead and show you guys

722
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,320
the next video and what i'm going to

723
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,480
show you is the early the february

724
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,840
evolution of wannacry

725
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,039
and where it really came from

726
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,600
so what we're going to show you now is

727
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,440
this second piece of now that we plan on

728
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:12,000
demonstrating

729
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,760
today what we're going to go through is

730
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,600
the original version of wannacry the

731
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,080
wannacry that was first um discovered

732
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,720
on february 9th not the ransomware

733
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,640
campaign that we all know and hate that

734
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:25,280
happened on friday thank you kim jong-un

735
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,280
on may 12th so we're going to walk

736
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,039
through the malware and see what it does

737
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,480
a lot of similarities with the other

738
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,280
stuff um aes 128 encrypted

739
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,120
file structure and file extensions are

740
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,720
pretty much the same the biggest

741
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,480
difference between the two

742
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,280
is really kind of around the propagation

743
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:41,840
method

744
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,840
the reason the propagation method's

745
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,679
different because the earlier version

746
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,679
was found on february 9th the shadow

747
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,360
broker the release of the smb

748
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,440
vulnerability the smb worm that we all

749
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,919
also hate wasn't you know really the

750
00:22:53,919 --> 00:22:55,520
release until march so kind of a little

751
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,720
before that

752
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,080
so we're going to kind of walk through

753
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,840
the malware and see what it does

754
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:01,039
the other thing i want to kind of

755
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,480
highlight is what's interesting about

756
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:03,919
this malware commonality between the

757
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,280
recent wannacry

758
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:08,799
is in this case along with the previous

759
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:09,600
case

760
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:12,000
when you kind of take apart the malware

761
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,919
and you look at when it was constructed

762
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,640
constructed or compiled it's utc plus

763
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,200
nine

764
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,039
the reason this is interesting is utc

765
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:21,600
plus nine is south korean time

766
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,320
not north korean time north koreans in

767
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,640
2014

768
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,559
made their own time zone how north korea

769
00:23:26,559 --> 00:23:28,000
them their own time zone

770
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,960
utc plus eight and a half so this sample

771
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:32,320
doesn't fall along with the right time

772
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,000
zone the reason for that likely

773
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,320
is they're rocking pie rated software

774
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:37,120
who would have thought they weren't

775
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:38,000
paying their bills

776
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,760
so let's watch this thing execute what

777
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:41,440
it does

778
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:44,960
here it goes puts everything with wry

779
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:47,279
extension encrypts the files

780
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:49,039
pops up with a pretty ransom note that

781
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,320
all your files have been safely

782
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,120
encrypted

783
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,360
and now your computer is unusable

784
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:58,320
all the data is largely encrypted and

785
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,159
gone so

786
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:02,080
that is the second sample hang with us

787
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,279
in a few minutes we're to

788
00:24:03,279 --> 00:24:07,200
show you the third great thanks josh

789
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,799
and that takes us to our third and final

790
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,480
phase where we assess north korea to

791
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:11,440
currently be at

792
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,520
whereas we're kind of see them right now

793
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,200
it's sort of in this dual focused

794
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,600
type operational stature and when we say

795
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,039
dual focus what we're really talking

796
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,799
about here is sort of a combination

797
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:23,440
of that traditional military focus but

798
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,400
also focused on

799
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,640
economic operations as well things to

800
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,240
not only enhance their national

801
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,000
economic priority areas such as

802
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,159
agriculture power generation

803
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,760
and similar types of critical

804
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,760
infrastructure but also still continuing

805
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,640
along the vein

806
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,880
of currency generation operations

807
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,480
however one of the things that we see

808
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,840
with these new currency generation

809
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:44,000
operations is now the targeting of

810
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,480
non-traditional targets such as several

811
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,080
cryptocurrency exchanges

812
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,000
especially those located in the east

813
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:52,000
asia region you know within south korea

814
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,880
as well as japan like i said we also saw

815
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:55,919
a lot more focus

816
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:58,000
during this phase on economic growth

817
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,919
targeting and you know one way to think

818
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:01,600
of this is sort of like they took a

819
00:25:01,600 --> 00:25:03,760
page out of china's playbook whereas you

820
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,600
know whereas china engages in a lot of

821
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,840
economic espionage in support of their

822
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:08,640
own economy

823
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,799
we're now seeing north korea do the same

824
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:11,760
and like i said

825
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,159
it appears to be focused on the sectors

826
00:25:14,159 --> 00:25:15,840
and particularly critical infrastructure

827
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:16,400
sectors

828
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,640
where they need a lot of help so things

829
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,760
like agriculture

830
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,440
things like you know power generation

831
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,960
you know you heard josh say earlier

832
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,240
that if you were to take a satellite

833
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,919
image of both north korea and south

834
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:26,559
korea

835
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,400
at night you would see all the lights on

836
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,919
in south korea and then you would see

837
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,600
barely anything in north korea

838
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,000
so in response now you see north korea

839
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,080
focused on espionage operations

840
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:38,400
to try to basically empower that aspect

841
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,600
of their economy

842
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:41,279
and then lastly beyond the economic

843
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,640
growth targeting operations and then

844
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,720
beyond the expanded criminal operations

845
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,159
now we're seeing them targeting

846
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,159
government-related entities but going

847
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:49,840
much further beyond the traditional

848
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,440
government entities and when i say

849
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,799
traditional i mean kind of like the

850
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,159
traditional adversaries

851
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,559
so like the united states south korea

852
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:57,360
japan

853
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,039
and now we're seeing north korea think a

854
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,559
little bit bigger right so now they're

855
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:01,200
going after

856
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,120
international organizations such as the

857
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,360
united nations uh recently we even saw

858
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,240
them go after

859
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:08,799
the israeli defense industrial base and

860
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:10,080
what that really indicates is an

861
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,520
increased amount of confidence

862
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,360
on the behalf of the north korean regime

863
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:15,039
and at this point they really do believe

864
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:15,679
that yes

865
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:17,039
they've succeeded in the past they've

866
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:18,240
been able to kind of get to the point to

867
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,200
where they're at now

868
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:20,480
and now they're really taking it to the

869
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:22,559
next level so now for this final section

870
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,000
i'll pass that over to josh to talk

871
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,360
about some of the more specific use

872
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,678
cases

873
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:33,600
joshua muted thanks

874
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,520
yeah always going to slip maybe at some

875
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,279
point

876
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:39,279
so so economic growth targeting one of

877
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:40,960
the biggest areas we've seen them focus

878
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:42,720
in on is energy production but not just

879
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,559
energy in the form of nuclear

880
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,919
uh oil and gas you know coal multiple

881
00:26:47,919 --> 00:26:48,400
different

882
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,120
groups so in 2017 we saw a target in

883
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:53,440
north america pretty heavily

884
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,120
a lot of different organizations got hit

885
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:56,559
one of the biggest one was in houston

886
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,159
texas and goes to oil and gas

887
00:26:58,159 --> 00:27:01,360
not everything is nuclear now these

888
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:03,120
these campaigns they all built

889
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,200
in malware that was designed to steal

890
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,120
stuff it had destructive back ends of it

891
00:27:07,120 --> 00:27:08,799
but it was more designed to steal than

892
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:10,240
anything else

893
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,840
especially in the most recent you know

894
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:13,360
oil and gas campaign

895
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:16,320
it it was designed to go through pilfer

896
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:17,520
the information out

897
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,159
throw the wiper on the end and then you

898
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:21,120
know make a

899
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,799
make it seem like they could actually

900
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,480
control power fortunately

901
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:26,640
in every case that we've seen um from

902
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,600
then until

903
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,919
even the most recent 2019 attack

904
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:31,520
everything was designed

905
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:34,720
to be more business focused disabled

906
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,520
business not

907
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,720
ics sca systems 2018 we saw the us

908
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:39,440
really stopped

909
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:41,520
getting targeted europe and asia kind of

910
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,440
took up in its place

911
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:45,440
as a result the biggest most notable

912
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,760
attack though is the 2019 targeting

913
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:50,640
a major indian power plant this indian

914
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,960
power plant supplies power for most

915
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,440
of southern india so a huge deal when it

916
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:58,159
hit the maori utilized that was d-track

917
00:27:58,159 --> 00:27:59,520
the reason is cinching is because

918
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:01,360
d-track's been used multiple times in

919
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,080
the past

920
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:04,880
detroit atm stole information from

921
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:05,919
indian

922
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:09,840
atm systems detract you know in the

923
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:12,960
early 2010s was utilized against korean

924
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:13,760
banks

925
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:15,279
you know again we're using the malware

926
00:28:15,279 --> 00:28:17,120
over and over again if they broke don't

927
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,559
fix it let's just keep you know

928
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,480
operating the same way we were the other

929
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:21,440
thing that's interesting about this

930
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,399
attack is

931
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:25,120
india is a major trading partner with

932
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,640
north korea so i'm not really sure what

933
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,320
they were thinking of this one

934
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:29,600
kind of you know something to watch to

935
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:31,440
see where the effects come

936
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,240
fall out from that

937
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,520
last one and jason was mentioned this

938
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,600
earlier crypto target

939
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:42,000
these crypto targeting operations

940
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,520
involve a high amount of social

941
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,480
engineering

942
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:46,399
you know in some cases you know

943
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:48,000
targeting individuals via linkedin

944
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,760
recruiting them fake job applications

945
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,679
like we've seen before but in some cases

946
00:28:51,679 --> 00:28:53,679
they actually create legitimacy or

947
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:55,200
what looks like legitimate fund

948
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,200
companies jht trading

949
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,679
um silas trade pro they actually created

950
00:28:59,679 --> 00:29:01,360
these organizations created these fake

951
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,799
companies with you know

952
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:06,320
shells and whole back stories in order

953
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:06,720
to

954
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,840
be more appear more legitimate the other

955
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:10,799
thing that's interesting about what

956
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:11,440
they've done

957
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:13,440
is collaboration with known russian

958
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:15,120
e-crime groups groups

959
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:17,840
like trickbot and ta505 trickbot for

960
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,039
those that don't know

961
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,799
it is a malware as a service you have to

962
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,000
be a highly vetted criminal to get

963
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,440
access to the malware but it's still

964
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:24,960
malware as a service the trickbot got

965
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,559
the initial foothold network

966
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:29,600
foothold was established um connect is

967
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,760
different systems get full access

968
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:34,559
then that access was sold to lazarus

969
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:35,440
toolsets

970
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,240
which did later monetary um scraping and

971
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:39,679
data collection often

972
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:41,520
the last one is the new evolution of the

973
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,600
ransomware vhd

974
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,159
vhd we believe was deployed via

975
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,840
vulnerable vpn gateways

976
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,320
once the vpn gateways were exploited the

977
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:51,679
matanet malware

978
00:29:51,679 --> 00:29:54,480
moved around and gathered information

979
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,919
this magnet malware

980
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,000
is highly versatile highly modular it

981
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:00,399
works on windows works on macs works on

982
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:02,480
unix there's multiple different

983
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,840
operating systems shows that they're

984
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,279
maturing their operations

985
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:06,840
and they're confident in where they're

986
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,360
going the next slide i want to show you

987
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,520
guys though this one's super interesting

988
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:14,159
because this is kaminsky north korean

989
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:15,200
apt

990
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:17,440
going after russia not just going after

991
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,240
russia

992
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:19,919
writ large but going after russian

993
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,520
aerospace and defense

994
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:22,720
i'm not sure what they're thinking

995
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:24,960
because most of their armament most of

996
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,799
their arms and their military equipment

997
00:30:26,799 --> 00:30:29,039
comes from russia so i'm not really sure

998
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:30,480
what they think of this one

999
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:31,679
but it's definitely something

1000
00:30:31,679 --> 00:30:33,200
interesting to watch so what happened

1001
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:33,760
you know

1002
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,039
we saw or you know there were

1003
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,360
phishing emails were observed targeting

1004
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,279
these aerospace and defense contractors

1005
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,600
these these phishing emails look a lot

1006
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,799
like what target u.s

1007
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,399
and europeans european defense

1008
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,640
industrial base fake job application

1009
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,399
because code is a thing what's up why

1010
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:52,240
not use cobit as well so

1011
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:54,720
utilize the um the fake job location of

1012
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:55,279
the

1013
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,559
covet operations then drop the malware

1014
00:30:58,559 --> 00:30:59,919
and then you know move around the system

1015
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:01,840
to try to build for data it also goes

1016
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:03,279
back to the reconnaissance effort so

1017
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,120
we've seen them as they mature

1018
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:06,720
it's not just get in there smash and

1019
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,480
grab and kind of feel your way around

1020
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,919
there's a lot of scanning that was

1021
00:31:09,919 --> 00:31:11,840
observed from april to september

1022
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:14,159
against russian systems as well as yes

1023
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:16,320
you know u.s and eu systems

1024
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:18,240
that correlates along with these attacks

1025
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,960
so highly you know high's fist hit

1026
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:22,960
great social engineering around it not

1027
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,720
sure what to think of going after russia

1028
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,000
but you know something worth watching

1029
00:31:30,799 --> 00:31:31,919
so the last piece we're going to show

1030
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,320
you guys is another version

1031
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,519
of ransomware from north korea again

1032
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,120
this isn't highly widespread like

1033
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,320
wannacry this is more

1034
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:42,399
targeted and more moving into the big

1035
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:47,840
game big hunting operations

1036
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,559
so this is the third and final piece of

1037
00:31:50,559 --> 00:31:52,080
destructive north korean malware we're

1038
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,279
going to be showing you guys

1039
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,200
this one's a little bit different unlike

1040
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,880
wannacry which is strictly revenue

1041
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:58,960
generating this is more of a smokescreen

1042
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,799
this is designed to lock systems down

1043
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:03,279
and it's a wiper not ransomware

1044
00:32:03,279 --> 00:32:04,880
it's designed to lock systems down and

1045
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,640
distract incident responders from what's

1046
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,480
really going on in this case stealing

1047
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,679
millions and millions and millions of

1048
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:12,399
dollars from the taiwanese far east bank

1049
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,640
so the malware is going to execute um it

1050
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,080
comes along as a package i shouldn't say

1051
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:17,760
that first it comes along as a package

1052
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,679
and this comes along with the whole two

1053
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:20,880
pins framework

1054
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,399
hermes is just a piece of it it's an

1055
00:32:22,399 --> 00:32:23,919
instructor piece i would demo the whole

1056
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:24,799
package but

1057
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:27,120
two pins not quite as cool to look at so

1058
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,799
this power is going to go through and

1059
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:31,279
do what all ransomware does first thing

1060
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:32,960
gets on or almost all

1061
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,559
first thing gets on the system it'll

1062
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,000
check for language artifacts it's

1063
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:37,840
designed um it has code in there to look

1064
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,039
for ukrainian

1065
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:41,840
belarusian russian however it only

1066
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:42,640
really checks

1067
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,320
and stops the process if it finds

1068
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,840
belarusian ukrainian

1069
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:47,360
not russian which is a little

1070
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:49,440
interesting then it'll do all the normal

1071
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,799
things yes admin

1072
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:53,519
delete shadow copy so for backups code

1073
00:32:53,519 --> 00:32:54,960
through every drive letter

1074
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,960
use the windows crypto api to come with

1075
00:32:56,960 --> 00:33:00,080
the key pair crypt things over as256

1076
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,000
and then do all the normal smash things

1077
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:04,080
that we uh we all know and love at this

1078
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,600
point from ransomware

1079
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,720
so nothing really new or novel or

1080
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,080
interesting about this ransomware the

1081
00:33:10,080 --> 00:33:12,559
biggest thing that makes this you know

1082
00:33:12,559 --> 00:33:14,799
something to look at is again it's not

1083
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:16,880
really designed to give

1084
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:19,760
garner ransom this is only designed to

1085
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,039
distract

1086
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,640
instant responders away from what's

1087
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:24,240
really happening on the system

1088
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:27,039
so we'll watch it execute give a few

1089
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:27,600
seconds

1090
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:29,600
and then everything becomes unusable

1091
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,360
deletes itself

1092
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:34,159
and one two three everything's gone and

1093
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:36,000
then there's your pretty ransom note

1094
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,840
you don't pay me money you never get

1095
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:39,440
your data back blah blah blah

1096
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,880
blah all the meanwhile everything

1097
00:33:42,880 --> 00:33:46,720
is encrypted nothing works

1098
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:50,840
so thanks everybody hopefully you

1099
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:52,000
enjoyed

1100
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,600
all right awesome thanks josh and now

1101
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,799
we'll finish off with the conclusion

1102
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:55,679
where we're going to make a

1103
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:57,519
you know a few uh possible assessments

1104
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,039
of the direction that north korea might

1105
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:00,320
go in the future

1106
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,760
so the first one that we have up all the

1107
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,440
way to the left is around the potential

1108
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:05,519
use of advanced ransomware operations

1109
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,200
so as josh and i demonstrated throughout

1110
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,960
this brief we've seen north korea use

1111
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,480
ransomware for a variety of different

1112
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,679
reasons in the past

1113
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:12,719
whether it be for the currency

1114
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,800
generation elements of the ransomware or

1115
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,159
for the potential destructive elements

1116
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:17,599
of the ransomware attack

1117
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:18,719
what we think north korea could

1118
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,320
potentially consider in the future is

1119
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:21,359
the addition of

1120
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,199
two new ransomware techniques that we've

1121
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,719
observed over the last year and a half

1122
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:26,000
two years or so

1123
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,800
and those are one data extortion and two

1124
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,239
ransomwares of service

1125
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:32,000
with data extortion basically what the

1126
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,839
threat actor does is in addition to

1127
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,440
engaging in the ransomware attack

1128
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,520
they are now stealing valuable personal

1129
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:39,679
data during the course of the attack

1130
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:41,520
and then after locking down the systems

1131
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,040
what they do in addition to sending the

1132
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,918
ransom node

1133
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:46,079
is they also extort the victim with

1134
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:48,239
additional information such as

1135
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,719
pii or intellectual property or other

1136
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:51,679
sensitive data

1137
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,199
and they basically threaten the victim

1138
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,639
and say that if they don't pay up

1139
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:55,119
they'll

1140
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,200
essentially release that data on a daily

1141
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,520
site so that is one possible option

1142
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:01,040
another possible option is we could

1143
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:03,119
potentially look at and see north korea

1144
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,960
engage in you know business models such

1145
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,320
as ransomware as a service

1146
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,920
where they can potentially outsource

1147
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:09,280
large portions of their ransom

1148
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:10,160
operations

1149
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,079
to third-party affiliates thereby

1150
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,760
allowing them to increase the volume of

1151
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,560
their attacks

1152
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,480
and therefore also likely the amount of

1153
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,720
profit that they get from the attacks

1154
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,400
the second prediction or assessment that

1155
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,160
we have is that they will likely

1156
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,680
continue to take a page out of china's

1157
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:25,040
playbook and we can see them really

1158
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,720
investing in this area

1159
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,079
so you know we've said throughout this

1160
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,760
brief that obviously you know

1161
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,680
north korea's economy is struggling it's

1162
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:32,880
struggling in a variety of different

1163
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:33,359
ways

1164
00:35:33,359 --> 00:35:34,960
for a variety of different reasons

1165
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,720
whether it be because of having you know

1166
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,960
being ran by a dictatorship or some of

1167
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,240
the you know some of the conditions that

1168
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:41,359
have been imposed upon them because of

1169
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:42,640
the international sanctions

1170
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,160
we do see a lot of you know struggling

1171
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,920
within north korea and one thing that we

1172
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:46,960
could potentially see

1173
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,839
the kim jong-un dynasty our regime do is

1174
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:50,480
go after

1175
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,680
you know continuing to go after these

1176
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,760
economic targets and we've seen north

1177
00:35:53,760 --> 00:35:55,440
korea issue five-year plans

1178
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,440
very similar to what china does and

1179
00:35:57,440 --> 00:35:58,640
whenever china has issued these

1180
00:35:58,640 --> 00:35:59,520
five-year plans

1181
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,720
what we have observed trying to do

1182
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,960
immediately after the plans is engage in

1183
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,119
espionage in support of those particular

1184
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:05,920
objectives

1185
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,320
so it is very possible that we will

1186
00:36:08,320 --> 00:36:10,240
likely or potentially observe north

1187
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,240
korea do the same thing and then our

1188
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:13,200
last prediction

1189
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,440
is around the uh the notion of cyber

1190
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,400
brinksmanship

1191
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,119
so brinksmanship is basically a term

1192
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:19,760
used in

1193
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,920
deterrence strategy where two sides are

1194
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,119
going against each other

1195
00:36:23,119 --> 00:36:24,400
and they basically want to see who's

1196
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,839
gonna kind of call chicken first who's

1197
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:27,359
going to kind of chicken out first

1198
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,040
and that's sort of basically what we see

1199
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,880
them doing we see them bringing

1200
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,480
their regional and international

1201
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,480
adversaries all the way to the very edge

1202
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,720
and then potentially using capabilities

1203
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:37,760
such as cyber

1204
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,920
or nuclear capabilities to achieve those

1205
00:36:39,920 --> 00:36:41,200
deterrent effects

1206
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,960
uh we do believe that they're likely to

1207
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,640
evolve more towards the cyber side of

1208
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:45,119
the house

1209
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:47,040
as opposed to using continuing to use

1210
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,119
nuclear the nuclear option as their sold

1211
00:36:49,119 --> 00:36:50,480
to turn capability

1212
00:36:50,480 --> 00:36:51,520
and one of the reasons that we think

1213
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,200
they're going to use cyber more is

1214
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,000
essentially it's just

1215
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:56,079
safer for them the more they play around

1216
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:57,520
with using nuclear weapons as a

1217
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,720
deterrent capability

1218
00:36:58,720 --> 00:37:00,560
the more they re the more they kind of

1219
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,800
uh you know the higher the chances that

1220
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:04,320
one of their adversaries like the united

1221
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,160
states might engage in a preemptive

1222
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:06,720
attack

1223
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:08,320
and obviously north korea does not want

1224
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:10,800
that if north korea were to go engage in

1225
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,880
kinetic conflict with the united states

1226
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,480
north korea would lose and not only

1227
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:16,320
would they lose uh their you know the

1228
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:17,680
regime would potentially also be

1229
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,280
replaced and they want to avoid that at

1230
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,160
all cost

1231
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,560
so given that logic it is very likely

1232
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:23,200
that they will

1233
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,359
instead kind of go the cyber route which

1234
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:27,280
still allows them to project power

1235
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,880
still allows them to kind of take swipes

1236
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,720
at their adversaries but does so in a

1237
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:31,200
much

1238
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,760
safer way for them that not only has a

1239
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:34,800
lower risk of

1240
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,960
kinetic retaliation but also a lower

1241
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:38,079
risk of having

1242
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:40,079
the kim you know the kim dynasty being

1243
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:41,200
replaced

1244
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,040
so that is all we have thank you for

1245
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:44,240
watching our black hat

1246
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:45,920
talk and please enjoy the rest of the

1247
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,359
presentations at black hat

1248
00:37:47,359 --> 00:37:51,839
thank you
