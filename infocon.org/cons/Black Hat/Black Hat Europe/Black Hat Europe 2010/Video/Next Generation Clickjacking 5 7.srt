1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,100
Chris Brown's a specific methods I'm so
pretty

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:07,419
probabilities that prevents prevent a
site from

3
00:00:07,419 --> 00:00:11,080
from I'm busting I'm in Firefox

4
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:15,360
we can actually disable Javascript in an
iframe for any site that uses Javascript

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,220
to protect a tough job scripts

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,730
up you he stops to protect itself from

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:24,609
attacking I'm well actually that fell

8
00:00:24,609 --> 00:00:27,869
in this case this thing you can do in
Firefox

9
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:31,640
is you can in an iframe you can

10
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,090
load up a page and abuse or sometimes
the RL

11
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:38,270
that to be the same thing that's what
happened

12
00:00:38,270 --> 00:00:41,770
as when you pencils for page I miss
inside my friend

13
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,110
so we could use the content extraction
method to to get about

14
00:00:45,110 --> 00:00:48,660
I'm instant and an explorer

15
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:52,449
I'm you can actually let up sites in
design mode

16
00:00:52,449 --> 00:00:56,440
but I mean to pick up an iframe into
export editable website

17
00:00:56,440 --> 00:00:59,680
any actual outpacing out in there will
be you can edit

18
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,840
and we can go to another site in there
ands

19
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,210
by can still be in design mode sire

20
00:01:07,210 --> 00:01:10,600
with a contract to the site with
javascript disabled

21
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:14,430
sir any I'm any kid i can text might
work

22
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,040
and with a consummate forms the
committee's content extraction

23
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,689
to get that get a better so

24
00:01:22,689 --> 00:01:25,979
at the moment not many sites have been
for men to keep checking protection

25
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:29,960
and with a love the high-profile

26
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,860
sites that helps suffocating attacks
have actually put in some protection

27
00:01:33,860 --> 00:01:37,979
and pushing much they sites s two-run
double in one way or another

28
00:01:37,979 --> 00:01:41,479
many the large sites have mobile
versions

29
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:46,000
that a.m. but the main sites are for
example twitter has a mobile site

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,869
I'm and it said think I would say it
didn't help that simply taken texan

31
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:53,000
perhaps the main site us

32
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,149
and also to I'm

33
00:01:56,149 --> 00:02:01,009
very sites have widgets or gadgets and
these are things that can be included in

34
00:02:01,009 --> 00:02:04,450
I'm in frames some from the I'm

35
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:08,020
do has a page that lets you have

36
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:11,069
press which its new on the home page and
so on know each other is

37
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:15,760
are in an iframe so they caught actually
is que te contesting the compass that

38
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,750
at prevent themselves being framed I'm
so that I double

39
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:22,800
and this is Twitter that got to you

40
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,129
may well sites need to them have to
check in protection

41
00:02:26,129 --> 00:02:29,239
a this is Facebook again

42
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:32,720
I'm no text on that although I think
they I'm

43
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,360
I think that at now included texan that

44
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:39,810
and this is the you know catch it was a
show you an idea

45
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:42,900
again this is a protected her from being
framed

46
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,560
I'm the contest is

47
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,330
and for testing sites when check if the
site is as Peyton

48
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:55,489
keep checking texan I'm you basically
need to see scan cute and I find

49
00:02:55,489 --> 00:02:59,599
I'm now cuts is a menu penetration
testing tool that

50
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:03,640
I'm comtex is released and the latest
version that is being released today

51
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,099
about the value of my web site and
square feet and features

52
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:10,140
as that you can I'm check

53
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,849
to septic page ir allowed except frames

54
00:03:13,849 --> 00:03:18,470
say that quickly

55
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:21,670
I'm this the tool

56
00:03:21,670 --> 00:03:27,230
and for this is a page

57
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:32,629
again is offline I'm and we want to
check if its

58
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:39,629
and keep checking protection sire

59
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:44,440
I'm now we posted at set up the process
so that any request a great

60
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:48,200
till yep just it that's something we can

61
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,320
at a particular quest and

62
00:03:51,320 --> 00:03:55,650
back it up and him to defend russian
number in fashion and can see that

63
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:02,650
something happening at event attacking
okay

64
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:08,180
say now I'm gonna show you the should
check into that made

65
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,210
and lets you take all the mess it up
methods are shown you

66
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:14,550
ands try to nap see how they work

67
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:17,750
and espresso-based

68
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,980
and that moment its works best in
Firefox

69
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:24,440
I'll be updating its in so the networks
copying other browsers

70
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:28,430
I'm either through the techniques shiny
work every browser

71
00:04:28,430 --> 00:04:33,000
I'm but the moment is very stable issues
in the two were prevented from working

72
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,630
completely outside to see how it works
in in Firefox

73
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:40,560
say

74
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,740
this is the tracking tool in this area
here

75
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,350
we have I'm site and had any site into
her

76
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:50,510
and she had that now you play so that we
can move it around

77
00:04:50,510 --> 00:04:53,850
with interacting with the site I

78
00:04:53,850 --> 00:04:57,350
alongside here we have we have various
tools I'll show you how these can be

79
00:04:57,350 --> 00:04:58,030
used

80
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:02,470
so

81
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:06,270
can we use this site but I sent you an
idea and

82
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:10,400
see how we can you through on this site
to the very things

83
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,180
cite press one can ease the load

84
00:05:15,180 --> 00:05:18,200
URL at all

85
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:25,200
flow that page into this crime that
wants to

86
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,730
is get the chance to text into the text
field and then click the Update button

87
00:05:30,730 --> 00:05:34,290
Festival where you sit and text tool

88
00:05:34,290 --> 00:05:40,600
hands contract this was the text field
inside this is where I want

89
00:05:40,600 --> 00:05:44,220
this is the first target and

90
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:51,220
up

91
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,750
this the text I want to enter for this
we use the

92
00:05:55,750 --> 00:06:00,630
Java tracking for teenagers February a
thinking gonna do

93
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:05,229
is click on the Update button there
again

94
00:06:05,229 --> 00:06:08,830
and no replay this says to you

95
00:06:08,830 --> 00:06:12,669
ways we can reply first with a visible
replay say

96
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:16,360
we've got the iframe the targets putting
the mouse cursor we catch see what's

97
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:16,850
going on

98
00:06:16,850 --> 00:06:20,360
yes it can see how this works and this
is really useful if you

99
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:24,400
to get an idea if Howell

100
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:28,800
the techniques work as you can see
what's going on in background the

101
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,340
festival

102
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:32,530
and per click tonight again

103
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:37,470
never K that's that's been that which
will save you

104
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:41,789
the texan closer to an invisible replay

105
00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:45,380
and services bit more like what happened
a and will attack

106
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:49,800
I'm obviously have got a blank page here

107
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,080
I'm referee kick it will actually I'm

108
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:58,020
to become almost targets any real attack
or should there be something to interact

109
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,650
with has to be some sort of game or

110
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:05,140
whatever say again click click and I he
gets into that

111
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:09,460
so I mentioned before about

112
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:13,370
using factor positioning now that can be
useful

113
00:07:13,370 --> 00:07:16,539
I'm if the content on the page is moving
around

114
00:07:16,539 --> 00:07:20,740
talks moving around suffered another
apps

115
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:23,760
another version this page

116
00:07:23,760 --> 00:07:27,490
that has this kind it appears and
disappears randomly

117
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:31,360
say I'm using the current I'm

118
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,470
the current target decisions decisions
pixels

119
00:07:34,470 --> 00:07:37,979
say I'm replace play this here

120
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:42,610
yep that works

121
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:47,760
because this moves and that we didn't
know that's going to happen swore to me

122
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:51,370
what we can do is to use the ID's on the
page I mentioned before

123
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:54,530
I was quickly show you through to this
page

124
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:59,130
so you can see here hopes

125
00:07:59,130 --> 00:08:02,190
this is this this is the state field

126
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:05,419
so this has I'm an idea status

127
00:08:05,419 --> 00:08:09,180
and we have that but the question here
that's not the update

128
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:12,410
so he's a fucking positioning method

129
00:08:12,410 --> 00:08:16,610
to you I'm to talk

130
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:20,780
nice this week's pretty easy to do that
we don't have to look at the source the

131
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:21,310
page

132
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:24,790
we can actually you just get pregnant
wasn't here

133
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:28,080
to work in a button that removed the
outlay

134
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,490
and I have to manually dist a flexible

135
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:35,200
and then tracked this 16 little white
square hair

136
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,370
say

137
00:08:38,370 --> 00:08:41,589
yet you can see that that

138
00:08:41,589 --> 00:08:45,410
is detected that with the ID's positions
at the ID's on that page

139
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:50,000
so status him to update got the at one
here and got pretty damn head

140
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:53,920
so I can say okay I want to you

141
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,449
is relative positioning as talk these

142
00:08:57,449 --> 00:09:02,140
so first walk in the state spilled

143
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:05,760
a a market here second track

144
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:10,420
for this is saying I want to you kick at
these coordinates relative

145
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:13,760
to position the state's field

146
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,980
and again with the Update button

147
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:22,280
I want to kick I'm at this position
relative to the Update button

148
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:26,380
so I for replay this

149
00:09:26,380 --> 00:09:32,199
group I can actions and texten on

150
00:09:32,199 --> 00:09:35,300
say replay this and benefits that

151
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:38,300
I'm and that works

152
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:41,420
and again every play without a banner it
was still work

153
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:45,829
say let pages moving around I'm

154
00:09:45,829 --> 00:09:50,910
you can still to acquisition Inc

155
00:09:50,910 --> 00:09:54,260
the for me think I'm gonna show you with
this tool

156
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:58,020
is extracted the content now I'm

157
00:09:58,020 --> 00:09:59,790
I was attended Katia didn't say a damn
