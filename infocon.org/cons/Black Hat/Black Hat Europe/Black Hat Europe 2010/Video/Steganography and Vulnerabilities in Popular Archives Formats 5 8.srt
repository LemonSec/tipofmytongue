1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:03,320
but now we can show few more things

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:06,899
so another we say with it is the 11:01

3
00:00:06,899 --> 00:00:11,370
at this is the one did yes uses the
extra fields

4
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:15,540
so you can see that this particular file
which is also

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:19,560
computer sample right here at

6
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,590
its file name: is the be

7
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:27,560
which should be 11 along but we only
declared it is seven so first seven

8
00:00:27,560 --> 00:00:29,130
letters up this word

9
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,010
are finally and the rest as the fine
here

10
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:36,630
is just extra leader and by processing
the Heather

11
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,260
at zip within the snow where the next
file in your car this

12
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,690
and thats decided that local Heather
plus-size

13
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:48,410
up to name string plus size MD extra
lead applies the size of the

14
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:51,649
file comments now

15
00:00:51,649 --> 00:00:56,140
didn't send some Southard imposes that
correctly they wouldn't be able to find

16
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:57,010
the next file

17
00:00:57,010 --> 00:01:03,440
in line already and the archive is the
same thing

18
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:07,290
a with the second version on the same
vulnerability

19
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,170
but here we didn't hide

20
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:15,010
the militia sample we height hidden we
have hidden the file

21
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:21,270
before that so by adding this extra 256
zeros

22
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:26,020
we were six you're able to break some I
coprocessors because

23
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:31,060
we'd ought that the sum them with
generically search for the next the

24
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:34,100
and three in the central directory so we

25
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,290
as some space at just just out what's

26
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:41,750
was their tolerance for this kind of
stuff and is it turns out

27
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:47,950
it said 150 psi six fights between

28
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:51,420
now talking about the zip file format

29
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,710
at this is that particular file as a
text file we talked about so

30
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:59,380
if I was to open this file with the

31
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:02,909
let's say WinRAR think I would find

32
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:06,509
is this image which was appended to the
S fix file

33
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:11,610
and this my good friend okay now

34
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,050
up if I would since the start this as a
text file

35
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:19,120
the data that would be extracted to it
in your folder

36
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,790
wouldn't be

37
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:26,239
and picture of my good friend

38
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,420
but it would be the malicious payload we

39
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:32,510
compressed so

40
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:35,690
seen you you fuller see something happen

41
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:42,690
okay

42
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:48,460
so inside the folder you have marveled
at bin which is

43
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:52,050
compressed public your sample so the SFX
executable itself

44
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:55,870
knowles the direct contact decompress
but as a

45
00:02:55,870 --> 00:02:59,420
because we are searching for to this
particular content from

46
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,720
the end of an archive we weren't able to

47
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:05,950
find that back content we found

48
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:09,920
the picture Michael front now a we could

49
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:13,580
really go into detail of inventor of all
four months here

50
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:17,150
but we're not gonna because we kinda
long time at

51
00:03:17,150 --> 00:03:21,970
what you gonna show is the modification
of the

52
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:27,040
SFX martial Solal inside the model of
course there's an archive which is to be

53
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,690
the compressed

54
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:31,370
and we changed pretty much everything to
the layout that the archive now

55
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:35,090
40 s effects model to be able to you

56
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:38,710
decompress that kind of content it to
your needs to be aware

57
00:03:38,710 --> 00:03:43,210
up to a file format type so the binary
itself the SFX module

58
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:46,590
was changed at do you recognize this

59
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:50,730
new format we went that and if you try
to open the suspect executable

60
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,180
with any software is gonna tell you that

61
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,480
it has no idea what it is course

62
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,990
but if we started we are able to

63
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:04,130
decompress to protect content

64
00:04:04,130 --> 00:04:07,580
and this why this is why no

65
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:12,110
also offered it works with archives

66
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:16,830
will be able to success with school the
compressive

67
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:20,130
and here again is the on Flickr sample
but

68
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:23,520
you we were surprised to find that some

69
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,660
anti-virus vendors were able to scan
this particular archive

70
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:32,010
and their way he did they did this is d2
looked forward to compress data itself

71
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:35,190
so we didn't change a compression
algorithm or anything like that to see

72
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,330
how the heathers look

73
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:39,580
and someone to a swingers your even to
the

74
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:46,580
detect that can be compressed data
correctly so

75
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,419
when talking about rar file format this
is what the talked about

76
00:04:50,419 --> 00:04:54,490
by declaring this first block as a
temporary one we can protect this

77
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,940
archive for modification

78
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:00,040
so we face was to start this archive it
shows forty percent will buy

79
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:05,020
despite any new file to it we will
successfully

80
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:09,010
break it and it's broken

81
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:12,290
so you can protect your eyes from being
modified like this

82
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:16,270
if you really want to but this process
can be reversed

83
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:22,560
and show hide do that right now so we
just

84
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,229
to look at the Texas think no big deal

85
00:05:26,229 --> 00:05:29,250
so we switched of that them for

86
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:32,460
by exceeding your size which is no he is
not 11

87
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,690
so DnB you really need to you

88
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:39,910
correct the had to check some for this
particular bit

89
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:43,610
so we compute hash see that it's

90
00:05:43,610 --> 00:05:46,729
CF 90

91
00:05:46,729 --> 00:05:52,650
which was default in value

92
00:05:52,650 --> 00:05:55,930
if we see that we will be able to

93
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:01,510
see both the malicious payload and the
one we have

94
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:06,830
from Preston income course works so this
is reversible

95
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:10,600
BBQ

96
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:13,910
que tus the first the demonstration have
another one

97
00:06:13,910 --> 00:06:17,970
but to get the gonna get there so a to
get there

98
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:21,200
we have to talk about the next engine
and that's all we are presenting today

99
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:25,289
at what's important about it extension
is

100
00:06:25,289 --> 00:06:28,880
who is next in line with have we chosen
her so

101
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,930
next is to Greek goddess of night and we
thought it would be kinda

102
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:36,450
fun if you have a Greek goddess of night
watching over files

103
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:41,000
so what does it do it does OK

104
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,900
pre-processing so this isn't an
extraction tool though it does have an

105
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:46,310
ability to recover data

106
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:49,580
so recovery is done by

107
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:53,789
extracting the data without really
expecting sold to deter you

108
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:57,700
recover is still a in same format as

109
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,409
the archivist so if you recover damaged
files from ZIP their skills at

110
00:07:01,409 --> 00:07:05,010
you have to decompress them either but
their headers have been fixed

111
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:08,520
and you can use that kinda files now

112
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,169
it acts like an exploit shield in the
process of building this particular

113
00:07:13,169 --> 00:07:16,770
engine we wanted to in have an engine
that's

114
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:21,979
able to process the entire archive and a
look for these anomalies

115
00:07:21,979 --> 00:07:25,669
and skip over them and make us feel safe
because

116
00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:29,070
there were some exploits in the wild
that a.m.

117
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:34,610
acted like eggs using remote code on
your machine

118
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:37,950
if you were to process these con Marcos
going to be see from this

119
00:07:37,950 --> 00:07:43,029
we also want it to you be able to
generically detectable him dating site

120
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:47,789
tell how can you use it it's a free
labor it comes did

121
00:07:47,789 --> 00:07:52,090
with its is the case going to be
available on our website soon

122
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:57,169
it has an X console which is an example
of how to use in is the key

123
00:07:57,169 --> 00:08:01,710
and it's a we converted to a plugin
portal commander and power archiver

124
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:05,990
so if they cannot process the archive
our pledge is going to step in

125
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:09,300
and enable you to view the content

126
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:12,310
and recover data now

127
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:16,210
with the functional groups are of course
we supporting

128
00:08:16,210 --> 00:08:20,140
educational the apiece for file formats
it says the prior cat

129
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:23,659
and to use it p

130
00:08:23,659 --> 00:08:27,110
been able a Quentin Bryce which means
you can

131
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:30,990
traverse the archive one pilot time
soldiers be calling get next file

132
00:08:30,990 --> 00:08:35,270
for example you would be able to go
through each and every file we found in

133
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,860
the archive

134
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:40,800
you also get all the information
possible about back on 10 sold the

135
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,870
compressed size decompress solace

136
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:46,279
file time filed a attributes

137
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:50,170
the is it possible protected his name
unique old

138
00:08:50,170 --> 00:08:54,839
everything about the archive does it
this week to multiple volumes

139
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:58,820
everything about the archive it is
present in heathers invalid

140
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:03,360
already give back to the user

141
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,390
use the archival the nation's so what
you need to know

142
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:09,990
is if the arc I was corrupted

143
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,279
and if it was you cut the corrupted
beyond recovery

144
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:18,150
so this is a pretty simple process in
which we determine if the damage

145
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:22,500
the is beyond any any kind of useful
data recovery

146
00:09:22,500 --> 00:09:26,490
and the ok but you get these either yes
the archive is valid

147
00:09:26,490 --> 00:09:29,670
no it's not a valid but yes you can fix
it

148
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:33,100
or the archivist so broken that

149
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,290
there's no use of doing anything with
this file

150
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:40,810
now we also did of course search for
steganography content and

151
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:44,560
we did this generically so the idea
behind it is

152
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,290
you can two genera P support any kind of
stable

153
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:51,560
implementation done to the archive and I
we do this

154
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:56,270
by basically mapping out the file and
the scene which parts of the archive are

155
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:57,500
attributed to the fact

156
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:59,930
content if there's anything between the
back
