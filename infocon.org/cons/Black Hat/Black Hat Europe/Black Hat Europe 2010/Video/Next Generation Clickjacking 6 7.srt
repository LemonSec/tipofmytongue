1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:04,290
can demonstrate fairly well using this
tool say

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:08,040
that's a look at the source that page
again sleep

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:11,349
you go say this

4
00:00:11,349 --> 00:00:15,130
sites have protection against cross at
Chris for it because had this random

5
00:00:15,130 --> 00:00:16,000
type

6
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:21,439
now word is shown you injecting the
Texans the FiOS

7
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,119
thats okay I'm but if we actually still
this

8
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:29,460
and this when taken then we could
potentially do many requests and too

9
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:30,279
many updates

10
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:35,700
on his page not for these interaction in
this case it's updating status on some

11
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:36,880
social networking sites

12
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,469
but that I'm there many situations wat
you can still

13
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:44,920
that that taken you potentially bad
things for example webmail accounts

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,260
and potentially you could forward emails
freeze account to you

15
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,020
another email address I'm but in Costa
Chris forgery

16
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:58,250
if we can get this taken okay

17
00:00:58,250 --> 00:01:04,049
say his out and do it we can use the
other two tours have you got

18
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:09,540
and drexel and we can use this to you

19
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:13,229
to to track from any point another point
so in a track from here

20
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:17,560
times ahead the hidden don't have taken
isn't is in the form around here

21
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,040
somewhere

22
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:21,299
so out

23
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:26,150
when these does this when a track it
walks like this this except and then

24
00:01:26,150 --> 00:01:26,900
extract

25
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,159
that selection say I replace a recent
text

26
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:35,320
we selected income for that now every
play this

27
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,430
I safety this is starting station

28
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,110
some hold down the mouse button and to
attract so you can see that's me the

29
00:01:43,110 --> 00:01:44,000
most ill bet

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,430
at work text we selected and now I'm
going to you

31
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:52,649
to second track and it's gone extra
content 16 this little red square head

32
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:56,049
is the test headed to pool I'm a shemale

33
00:01:56,049 --> 00:02:01,990
coat almost turned out that seven judges
had a

34
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:06,329
was at that and that conduct and has
been started

35
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:09,470
say still there

36
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:12,720
actual state's books on here particular
got Asian out

37
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,930
this is the actual content it's been
silent

38
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,390
so this common-sense to you attack St
something bad

39
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:22,830
to this is this is what physical and
this is the actual stores

40
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:26,629
that's been stolen they can see here
this the taken

41
00:02:26,629 --> 00:02:30,450
say attacking get can get hold this they
can then do it and automate across at

42
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:31,500
Chris Porter attack

43
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:38,500
and you what about things okay so that's

44
00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:43,879
everything a for this through one other
function is the crash

45
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:47,510
export happened in court this the state
ahead

46
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:50,650
say and this has all the positions and
the ID's

47
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:55,290
targets and so on so I'm want to build
something like sliding block puzzle

48
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:56,239
rotated beginning

49
00:02:56,239 --> 00:03:00,450
I'm week at the state and incorporated
in some kind of game

50
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:04,959
I'm or whatever amicable satellite data
to back it up

51
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:11,959
okay so

52
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,620
think I'm doing okay but I'm I'm special
reason things besides coveted

53
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:20,580
I'm along the way this research say

54
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,790
and dissonance next door on a policy
that was fast recently

55
00:03:24,790 --> 00:03:29,340
I'm what going to happen for $200m a
test case

56
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,569
that question in text on this laptop is
a been patched obviously

57
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:35,790
butts we can I'm

58
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:39,640
you can drag and drop and job that's
because she'd write

59
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:42,709
a smell content in turn I find on the
site

60
00:03:42,709 --> 00:03:46,150
now if you remember

61
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:50,069
I said before I'm in the various ways to
prevent

62
00:03:50,069 --> 00:03:53,170
I'm keep checking protection from
working

63
00:03:53,170 --> 00:03:57,920
catch a late any so it's into as to
promote I'm

64
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,939
essentially what that means is that we
making a page

65
00:04:00,939 --> 00:04:04,780
on any two main adjustable you can edit
the HTML I'm contract

66
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:08,659
drop a steamer into that so sensitive
you cross site scripting against that

67
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:09,110
site

68
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:14,060
by I'm droppings mission now into that I
was alleged to do with

69
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:17,759
pretty much I duke a site scripting on
any sites I'm

70
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:21,370
despite moving the mouse an easy for
striking dropping that

71
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:24,740
from a jog wrapped up I'm

72
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:28,100
this is a Firefox policy which can I
report it has been fixed

73
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:31,400
and get it uses Java drag and drop

74
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:37,710
I dot job democrats socially you

75
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:44,710
weapons festival for heavy items can
kick on this possum

76
00:04:45,710 --> 00:04:48,870
and the guys that command prompt popped
up that

77
00:04:48,870 --> 00:04:52,520
I'm some say have think that you have
been that

78
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:57,400
I'm what I found was that I'm before
striking drop

79
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,509
for it and feed reich a

80
00:05:00,509 --> 00:05:03,810
URL for a job that the browser what she

81
00:05:03,810 --> 00:05:08,400
late that your own I'm closely actually
that happens in

82
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,669
Firefox and its next door now in Firefox

83
00:05:13,669 --> 00:05:17,070
I'm the user interface is made up a
special

84
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:21,190
are crying web pages that have their own
URL's

85
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:24,870
and hands what this does is

86
00:05:24,870 --> 00:05:27,889
the first time I click it will lose page

87
00:05:27,889 --> 00:05:31,479
and this in as we know it behind

88
00:05:31,479 --> 00:05:34,949
this Wednesday to this light up the
facts about page

89
00:05:34,949 --> 00:05:38,870
10 hat no special about crime pages is
that

90
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:42,300
any JavaScript execute on them watch %um
with full privileges

91
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:46,449
so you can access a file system it can
do pretty much anything

92
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:49,520
so that's the first I've loaded this
crime your outfit Intel with necessarily

93
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,800
a bad thing

94
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:54,270
so somehow we need to get some
javascript XQ on this a moment where we

95
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:54,910
can do this

96
00:05:54,910 --> 00:06:01,580
is by talking in a javascript Europe
search type

97
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:05,210
got my ski and sure what happens

98
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:08,750
in here is when I

99
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:12,410
group back and has it top 10 I'm

100
00:06:12,410 --> 00:06:16,259
he said a second tracking drop for
striking drops to drop this transcript

101
00:06:16,259 --> 00:06:17,100
into the are about

102
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,960
which then executed Sep I'm

103
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:27,960
so it's quite fun

104
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:32,600
okay say that is next-generation keep
checking say

105
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:36,400
the tennis that's a Tuesday I'm are you

106
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:39,500
pretty much beyond what was the reason
the possible

107
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:43,440
sorry we got techniques for improving
the precision position about toxic

108
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,180
elements on the page

109
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,690
we can detect up to text into your web
page if it's not

110
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:52,490
fun to go to and from across at
Crestwood re I'm could also use

111
00:06:52,490 --> 00:06:56,580
I'm go beyond I cause I cross border to
catch

112
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:59,580
extract content on the page if it's not
funny water cross-site scripting

113
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,949
anything like that

114
00:07:01,949 --> 00:07:05,460
I'm and between also use the I'm

115
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,470
for composition text messages to I'm

116
00:07:08,470 --> 00:07:11,729
tell Perry sings about what's inside an
iframe say

117
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:18,729
a that's it they don't have any
questions

118
00:07:24,099 --> 00:07:27,470
yet the kid checking through is
available on on a Web site

119
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:30,569
which was for that

120
00:07:30,569 --> 00:07:35,650
and yep so you can you can't come down I
dot is it policies such extractor

121
00:07:35,650 --> 00:07:38,750
and can run into any browser I'm I'll be

122
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,069
releasing updated versions of it I'm

123
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:45,430
to make it work better in other browsers
I'm and

124
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:48,550
possibly include some other techniques
some the formspring

125
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:51,599
at the moment when you injecting texans
have failed I'm

126
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:55,550
you happy is one one click power I'm
details

127
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:58,889
I'm hoping I'll be up to improves
outside

128
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:01,889
to have one potentially one click an
animal

129
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:05,770
protections months ago say I'm keeping
on that

130
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:10,509
on on this page and that after the
update I D

131
00:08:10,509 --> 00:08:17,509
yep

132
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,639
and my not the for the question was

133
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,500
I'm conduct set done in the at any
numbers on

134
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:33,880
and the a popular web sites are unable
to detect

135
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:37,890
techniques I'm sick in these new
techniques don't reside

136
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:42,130
i'm eddie looked at a few a few sites
and the mobile site I showed you how to:

137
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:47,060
where I'm with of sites quickly knocked
out last week to see what was possible

138
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:50,230
I'm the answer is that

139
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:54,029
lots of sites haven't implemented cross
and to Deccan protection

140
00:08:54,029 --> 00:08:58,100
possibly because the kinda keep checking
that was possible before

141
00:08:58,100 --> 00:09:02,010
but if you can inject X you can inject
extra fields that new things are

142
00:09:02,010 --> 00:09:02,620
possible

143
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:06,779
and the vast majority cites happen for
any for the protection so

144
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:13,779
yeah it's pretty much a site that I want
to this kind of attack the

145
00:09:17,209 --> 00:09:20,220
at the moment and there's no one hundred
percent

146
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:25,770
I'm method protect everyone so my
recommendation would be to you include

147
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:27,589
extreme options have no no yes I it's

148
00:09:27,589 --> 00:09:33,089
I'm fool site four pieces that don't
have the new browser still include the

149
00:09:33,089 --> 00:09:34,240
JavaScript action

150
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,279
I'm and

151
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:41,329
hopefully browsers will sort out their
money or she is that

152
00:09:41,329 --> 00:09:44,810
I'm ally to disable transcripts and so
on ands

153
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:48,640
eventually I P events to rouse who have
that that

154
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,910
support extreme option set up so at
moments know that there but

155
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,880
should improve very rapidly
