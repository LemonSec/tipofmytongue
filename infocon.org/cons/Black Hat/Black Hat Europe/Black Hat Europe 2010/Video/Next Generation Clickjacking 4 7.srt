1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,569
say harry gets me and that surrounds and
is entering text that

2
00:00:04,569 --> 00:00:08,960
I'm again this is baseball after it
could be a an iframe and you be filling

3
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,370
in

4
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:13,540
fields and it for one another site

5
00:00:13,540 --> 00:00:17,010
I'm actually in Firefox's just got a bit
crazy and it

6
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:21,170
work in there as well yep that's

7
00:00:21,170 --> 00:00:25,570
head and

8
00:00:25,570 --> 00:00:32,570
okay 13 at 10 you could just showed you

9
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,469
and could forbes ranked say it's a new
point and click

10
00:00:37,469 --> 00:00:41,350
each after what we want it to end we can
ask the

11
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:45,969
display in Lhasa books appeared among
gay and

12
00:00:45,969 --> 00:00:49,680
know the details disparity between
various browsers

13
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,180
some browse and some roses you have to
use a mouse between

14
00:00:53,180 --> 00:00:56,980
each drop I'm for some without that's
the case for crime

15
00:00:56,980 --> 00:01:00,500
say I should carry this out attack
carrying out this attack

16
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:03,680
maybe no tricky but its I'm is that
possible

17
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:07,420
at this will save does work phone

18
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,850
on max with 34 job once on that but it
doesn't work on the next

19
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,270
on the next ratchet ass off to do you
agree with drag-and-drop meeting a mouse

20
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:16,090
for this to work

21
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:19,470
okay

22
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:24,450
say that was techniques for

23
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,540
injected a sensual web page an
extraction they get better from a

24
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:28,189
webpage

25
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:32,689
said were the days I'm like normal kid
jacking require using trash into work

26
00:01:32,689 --> 00:01:36,159
we say something a little different hat

27
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,240
and this is something which but she
discovered to nichols' preparing

28
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:44,799
this presentation ans

29
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,899
it allows us to you get some information
out love

30
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:52,259
frame automatically member to start the
presentation I said that

31
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,229
the same origin policy prevents at one
site from accessing

32
00:01:56,229 --> 00:02:00,950
the contents a frames page that's not
entirely true

33
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:04,960
say

34
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,619
if you'd like to see midst of the
presentation

35
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:12,319
I'm Commission fragment positioning
methods that was using

36
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,670
I'm ID's in the page and using the

37
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:21,349
fracking identified and Paro to make the
iframe scroll to protect adamant

38
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:25,750
without knowing exactly where it was in
the page no

39
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:28,950
pic checking uses nested iframes so
we've gots

40
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:33,250
the I'm we've got in an in the right
frame that has

41
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,510
a particular site in and I'm happy
outright my friend is cropping it

42
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,760
and positioning it on the page no

43
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,480
with the proper positioning what happens
when you loads

44
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,739
you're out with friends on it it to the
browser will scroll

45
00:02:47,739 --> 00:02:51,720
iframe to make that particular and
visible now

46
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,879
because it's white frames what the pros
like she does is

47
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,810
scrolled also I fame and that's
controlled by the

48
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:02,519
attacker and

49
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:05,760
and because for that reason I was
actually read-back

50
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,129
the scope position of the iframe and

51
00:03:09,129 --> 00:03:12,590
text position particular elements on the
web page

52
00:03:12,590 --> 00:03:16,599
I'm so this is how it's done

53
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:20,700
we lead page in the a the iframe make
you very small

54
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:24,519
we not get a particular euro I'm Thank
You fragments yen's

55
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:28,060
a new ID that we I'm we might be in the
page

56
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:31,470
and you can read Scopus you do it
friends tell whether or not

57
00:03:31,470 --> 00:03:35,430
it's in the page and oxide position okay
on the page

58
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:41,030
now what use is this actually this in
various research

59
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:45,000
to you time in I'm

60
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:51,159
from a brown stuff whether or not use is
locked into a particular site

61
00:03:51,159 --> 00:03:54,689
this is worth that much kick ducking

62
00:03:54,689 --> 00:03:58,599
because it requires you to is in
traction now let's say

63
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:03,209
someone was trying to target use webmail
accounts these I might use do you know

64
00:04:03,209 --> 00:04:04,709
they might use your he

65
00:04:04,709 --> 00:04:08,939
they might use Hotmail no

66
00:04:08,939 --> 00:04:12,709
because I'm attack attack points using
traction

67
00:04:12,709 --> 00:04:16,269
we don't want to talk excited and not
much into that and not using

68
00:04:16,269 --> 00:04:20,130
so if you can tell without looking for a
particular site

69
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:24,380
that potentially very useful this first

70
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:27,680
current techniques that trying to do
this using I'm

71
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,060
method such as seeing if a particular
day

72
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:35,460
I'm pages cashed in the browser and also
to

73
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:40,160
things like loading trying to load an
authenticated image

74
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,350
I'm if your friend Katie Mitchell load
if it's not white light

75
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:46,850
nice I'm techniques at the WAC

76
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:51,680
but that is very different how it works
each site this methods

77
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:55,139
back to Houston every laundering to
sites because

78
00:04:55,139 --> 00:05:02,139
media everywhere page has an idea net so
these are the kind of things we can do

79
00:05:02,259 --> 00:05:02,770
with this

80
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:08,270
the most basic we can do look infection
so we can tell whether paid

81
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:11,690
user is locked onto a particular web
application

82
00:05:11,690 --> 00:05:16,620
so we can say okay let's look into
claims que tu pais in your friend

83
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:20,380
and if you look ten at that page will
load if you know pretty redirect

84
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:23,970
to a login page so we can pick and

85
00:05:23,970 --> 00:05:27,360
by D on the page and week

86
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,979
on authenticate page and we can say is
this

87
00:05:30,979 --> 00:05:34,360
by the present in the page and if it is
then he's locked in

88
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,430
if it's not Fernando

89
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:41,500
no notice checking Wilson AP can tell
not only that

90
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:45,810
at ticket and in particular ideas on a
page which also tell

91
00:05:45,810 --> 00:05:49,370
its position on the page click meets
proposition

92
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:52,770
simply Candi more interesting things as
well so

93
00:05:52,770 --> 00:05:56,310
for some cool if there's a first on the
page that has

94
00:05:56,310 --> 00:06:00,370
and I D weekend lead page and tell how
far down the page

95
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:04,240
that for tourists so pages very well
thanks we can tell things like

96
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,500
how many I'm emails read user's inbox

97
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,789
in various things say

98
00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:14,419
there many occasions this Bianca
checking I'm

99
00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:17,600
I'm sure people come in with type
interesting things we can

100
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:21,340
we can pic done with its am

101
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:27,229
as quickly show you

102
00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:34,229
how that could work

103
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,580
okay so this is I'm

104
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:41,400
This is page this is cop it's sick leave
a page in offline copy

105
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,860
both the gmail inbox as repair and if
you catch it

106
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:51,479
now this very ID's on this page and we
can detect various things

107
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:56,880
so him K I'm when applied to this page

108
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:01,330
its because they don't tell you I
frame-up at and that's what I page in it

109
00:07:01,330 --> 00:07:04,849
ands by choice not get picture ID's

110
00:07:04,849 --> 00:07:09,259
they can't overstates sire itself was
not is no idea the page click on Maple

111
00:07:09,259 --> 00:07:13,080
committees that detect attacked if the
user is logged in on

112
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,160
also each message down head at ID

113
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:20,310
that like this their checkbooks there a
check for

114
00:07:20,310 --> 00:07:23,699
Swan I'm catch detect how many

115
00:07:23,699 --> 00:07:26,960
emails in the Inbox ands

116
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:31,479
here you can see 5 I'm it will save that
position a picture ID

117
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:38,479
that's at the bottom of the page

118
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:46,740
okay so that was some new checking
techniques

119
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,830
props that the most important thing is
how sites can protect against these

120
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:52,530
attacks

121
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:58,410
so the moment there too ways to protect
the site and keep checking

122
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:01,319
the first issue some quick extreme
options and this was introduced by

123
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:02,050
Microsoft

124
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:05,490
and Internet Explorer 8 and various
other browsers have

125
00:08:05,490 --> 00:08:09,030
I'm committed this as well and what he
says is it

126
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:12,120
especially to be had at and sight sets
this had a

127
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:16,069
the basic says do not allow my site to
be included in an iframe

128
00:08:16,069 --> 00:08:19,099
and you can see here this its is what
happens next Explorer

129
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:24,800
between the decisive my friend has had a
set

130
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,150
now this is pretty the best method to
protect against keep checking

131
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:31,509
but unfortunately autographs then scored
twice and sacked five folks didn't get

132
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:32,640
scooted

133
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:36,320
I'm that working on it but it's not
there yet

134
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,260
so to protect eases who uses 0 other
browsers

135
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:43,570
are we have to use JavaScript that same
way ways

136
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:46,790
I'm use JavaScript to prevent
hitchhiking

137
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,230
the first issue spring busting what that
is

138
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:53,850
is site will say fun frames then

139
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:58,519
break out at the prime and replace the
pages that spring as

140
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:02,200
the other thing you can do is to try to
break an a-frame

141
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,870
is you just you can hide the if I can
hide its own content

142
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:09,269
safer to text being framed it can
prevent losing traction with that said

143
00:09:09,269 --> 00:09:10,930
he's a complicated buttons

144
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:14,310
and nothing bad can happen you can see
here

145
00:09:14,310 --> 00:09:17,519
I'm this is Twitter and Facebook

146
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:21,480
but the sites have slight differences
second texan will face because it

147
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:24,730
a semi-transparent overlay every page is
being framed

148
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:28,839
and when you click on that I'm it which
one frame us

149
00:09:28,839 --> 00:09:32,399
Twitter when that happens it rose to
fame us all the time

150
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:35,800
if that doesn't work and there s ways to
prevent free Mustang

151
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,610
it was quite content

152
00:09:39,610 --> 00:09:46,610
unfortunately jobs protect protection
isn't 100 percent effective

153
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:50,880
one method to you pin cycle for
investing issues

154
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,170
I'm HTTP redirects to stop by my page
