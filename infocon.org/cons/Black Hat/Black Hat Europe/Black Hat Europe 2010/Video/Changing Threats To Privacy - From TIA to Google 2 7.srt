1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,709
that are required by law to reveal that
information to

2
00:00:03,709 --> 00:00:07,109
eavesdroppers and governments worldwide
on

3
00:00:07,109 --> 00:00:11,750
so what's the difference meters

4
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:17,449
you can lead to something at home but
you probably don't

5
00:00:17,449 --> 00:00:19,270
it's not mandatory red

6
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:24,250
red choice this is the difference

7
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,610
you choose to carry a cell phone

8
00:00:27,610 --> 00:00:30,759
whereas you would be forced to carry

9
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:34,030
a tracking device why I have a little
fun

10
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,190
never in my wildest dreams did I think I
would have a fun

11
00:00:37,190 --> 00:00:40,400
10 the mobile tracking device it

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:43,610
communicate different your protocol is
potentially a mobile Bob

13
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:48,210
and yet I have so did I cheat

14
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:53,489
to have a little fun maybe I think you
look at the weighted

15
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:56,839
people and organizing groups and
communities they're often

16
00:00:56,839 --> 00:01:00,229
sort informal communications networks
that bind together

17
00:01:00,229 --> 00:01:03,309
that allowed to communicate make plans
for detective

18
00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:06,710
and introduced sorta something like the

19
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:09,710
Jess and cellular network a

20
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:13,630
to this router and if I start using it

21
00:01:13,630 --> 00:01:18,130
I am on subject to something that's very
well known for the new network effect

22
00:01:18,130 --> 00:01:21,149
right where I'm the only one with the
Sahara

23
00:01:21,149 --> 00:01:24,149
it's really not worth much that the
value

24
00:01:24,149 --> 00:01:27,490
the network isn't the number people that
are connected to it and that if

25
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:31,049
I'm the only one I can really
communicate with anyone however if I

26
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:32,770
somehow managed to get everyone

27
00:01:32,770 --> 00:01:37,579
to start using my communications network
it becomes very effective and very

28
00:01:37,579 --> 00:01:40,310
valuable but there's an interesting side
effect

29
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:43,819
which is that the all informal
mechanisms the people use to communicate

30
00:01:43,819 --> 00:01:47,189
ivory disappear that they are destroyed

31
00:01:47,189 --> 00:01:51,079
by the introduction a technology the
technology actually change the social

32
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:51,619
fabric

33
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:55,439
help people communicate important Anna

34
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,959
and mobile phones there many obvious or
two you know many examples right

35
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:02,969
and people use to make plans right to it
said

36
00:02:02,969 --> 00:02:06,229
I meet you on the street corner at this
time on this day

37
00:02:06,229 --> 00:02:09,890
and you know will do something another
say I'll call you when I get enough for

38
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:13,450
and all tested and

39
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,690
if you don't have a mobile phone can't
really participate in just

40
00:02:16,690 --> 00:02:20,000
type of organization and so you began to
find yourself

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,319
on kinda low because if I now

42
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:27,090
make the choice not to be a part of this
so the network this sort of an

43
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:28,099
interesting thing where

44
00:02:28,099 --> 00:02:31,620
once again I am subjected to the no
network effect because

45
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:35,650
the network that used to exist this
informal communications channels

46
00:02:35,650 --> 00:02:39,480
have been destroyed so yes

47
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:42,519
I made a choice to have more fun but
what kind

48
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:46,000
a choice too many and I think that this

49
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,110
is so interesting phenomena where what
happens

50
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:53,459
is a choice is introduced and it starts

51
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:57,280
as a very simple choice a choice whether
or not to have a mobile home

52
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:01,250
a simple is a technology but slowly
things happen

53
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:05,709
to expand the still have that choice
until eventually

54
00:03:05,709 --> 00:03:10,680
its sold a as to encompass not just
whether you have a little fun in a

55
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:14,379
but whether or not you want to be a part
of society that in some ways

56
00:03:14,379 --> 00:03:18,110
the choice to have a mobile phone today
has become a not necessarily

57
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:22,310
just what do you have keyser consent
like consumer electronics in your pocket

58
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:26,329
but whether or not we're even apart
society Anna

59
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:30,310
much better choice and needy not one
that we should have to me

60
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:35,019
or at least not one that's really it was
all so i think is having a small

61
00:03:35,019 --> 00:03:38,810
choices the coming the choices is
actually everywhere at once you start to

62
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:39,370
look at

63
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:43,760
and I've arts my most favorite

64
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,760
recent example is with this %uh Firefox
add-on call

65
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:49,959
Adblock Plus people familiar with this
very popular

66
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:53,370
it allows me to block at and

67
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,420
who

68
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:00,930
the way this works is by a defining a
and with regular expressions

69
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:05,670
which specified euros like to talk andy
is with great expressions

70
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:09,159
you can probably at Target most at the
euros that will be

71
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:13,760
serving at the problem is that like
these URLs are so accustomed to change

72
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,260
into that network server

73
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:19,450
introducing new things and so you wanna
be's updating and maintaining this

74
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:22,740
the list of things that you want to
block and so not everyone wants to

75
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,300
simply keep on this game

76
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:28,590
and so what at what class is done is
ideally the system up subscription

77
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:31,840
we can subscribe to a list that someone
else maintains

78
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,130
up on euros that are likely at

79
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,220
and this is a few populist

80
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,389
and then there's also a few populists
for blocking traffic

81
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:44,400
so these are things like web clubs and
stuff they're tracking your movements

82
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,440
around the internet

83
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,340
and so I and tried to list that's on

84
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:52,819
updates you know the your health for

85
00:04:52,819 --> 00:04:55,919
the tractors that I would like to block
and one day

86
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,940
well and so of course wanna be major

87
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:02,550
things in this list I was interested in
walking is a Google Analytics

88
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:05,970
because you know what is worse

89
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:09,650
then what tools are you doing that
Google Analytics anywhere monitoring

90
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:12,440
your movements on the internet even when
you're not listening and services

91
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:15,870
and a so one day

92
00:05:15,870 --> 00:05:19,530
Google Analytics disappear from mine

93
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:25,120
subscription lists if you think about
the whole way

94
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:29,910
know so the old world you imagine that
there was some Google all executives who

95
00:05:29,910 --> 00:05:34,729
and I found the maintainer this list and
you know showed up with a briefcase full

96
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:36,860
of cash in a shook hands and

97
00:05:36,860 --> 00:05:40,099
you know the has bad 2009

98
00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:44,479
convinced the the guys making this list
to remove Google Analytics

99
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,819
but as far as I can tell that's actually
not what happened

100
00:05:47,819 --> 00:05:51,319
and Google Analytics works the in
javascript

101
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:54,410
where you if you wanna hold

102
00:05:54,410 --> 00:05:57,479
be trashing the people to visit your
website new import a little the

103
00:05:57,479 --> 00:05:58,590
JavaScript for me

104
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:03,690
you're eligible hosts and automatically
the statistics are crude

105
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:08,699
and what Google started doing was saying
all right you're putting this javascript

106
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:11,720
and as long as you're importing and here
are a few

107
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:15,400
such as useful JavaScript functions
that's a

108
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,750
many people will probably want just to
make their

109
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:23,129
website work just if they're going to
employ some jobs within their website

110
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:26,430
and will just put some useful functions
in our

111
00:06:26,430 --> 00:06:29,660
dressed up in the air are importing
which you can then use for the

112
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:33,240
the actual functionality your website
you know for the convenience than

113
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:37,039
you know they're going to do it right
now mister friend and but so this

114
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,509
is very interesting because what they've
done is expand the spill

115
00:06:40,509 --> 00:06:43,860
a choice you have to me because now

116
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:47,440
if you block Google Analytics you're not
just stopping

117
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,860
the statistics from accruing you're
actually breaking the functionality of

118
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,389
the website

119
00:06:52,389 --> 00:06:55,740
because now the website doesn't have his
bout JavaScript functions that it uses

120
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,930
for its core functionality

121
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,930
and so what happened was the person was
maintaining this list

122
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:04,319
and had to remove Google Analytics
because to block it was actually

123
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,690
breaking web sites

124
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:09,970
and services diabolically clever

125
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:13,659
on happened to the right has weathered
understand discover the choice you have

126
00:07:13,659 --> 00:07:14,090
to me

127
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:18,129
from not just whether or not you want to
participate in the statistics

128
00:07:18,129 --> 00:07:21,360
a accumulation Google Analytics but
whether or not

129
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,699
you want to use the Website at all if
you

130
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:27,990
don't participate Google Analytics you
can use the Website anymore if you want

131
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:31,470
looks like you have to present the
violence

132
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:35,419
souter why is the significant for us

133
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:39,530
all this man's name his john poindexter
is incidentally

134
00:07:39,530 --> 00:07:44,560
a the person was found to be mostly
responsible for the alarm contra scandal

135
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:47,629
he was convicted of lying to congress
but

136
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:51,860
of course I never went to jail and 2002
he introduced

137
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:56,000
a government program call Total
Information Awareness

138
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,479
and a in the United States and

139
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,159
he on gives each one was injured in this
program

140
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:06,759
and he says dealers unit made available
in large skillet other words with

141
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:07,379
enhanced

142
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:10,919
semantic content for easy analysis

143
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:15,419
what he was proposing is that this
government program with just store

144
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:18,889
all email to all amtrak all credit art
history

145
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:22,169
all everyone's medical records that
works let all this

146
00:08:22,169 --> 00:08:26,189
without worrying about analyzing in real
time or pulling information out to

147
00:08:26,189 --> 00:08:29,340
figure out what's going on just dumping
and all into one

148
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:32,570
large saying and then they would develop
the

149
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:35,599
technology or the algorithms to really
efficiently

150
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:39,580
mine data at the Spitfire to build the
profiles

151
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:42,780
and a generator statistics on
relationships

152
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:45,980
that they might lead a lot and so this

153
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:49,390
was sorta the totalitarian future it was
a psychopath night

154
00:08:49,390 --> 00:08:52,829
and it was what they have been preparing
for what they had imagined

155
00:08:52,829 --> 00:08:55,970
that we were going to get and why they
were so interested
