1
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,890
hello everyone I we are here

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,110
to talk about so hiding in the familiar
steganography animal and abilities and

3
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:11,360
popular archive formats

4
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:16,190
my name is Mario ok sign and I'm here
with comes with a rich and we are found

5
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,720
this of reversing laps

6
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,439
a company that a is working on

7
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:24,560
up file analysis and the

8
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,990
unpacking frameworks and we have company

9
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:33,780
worries this up a we have presented a
class black had to open source

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:36,850
engine called opens project called Titan
engine

11
00:00:36,850 --> 00:00:41,580
that has become really popular art tool
for our final analysis

12
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:44,880
so the

13
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:47,940
I have been since the working on the
some

14
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,220
interesting technology and have find the
process discovered

15
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:56,240
someone abilities in their popular
performance like guys the Ferrar

16
00:00:56,240 --> 00:01:03,200
I G zip cabin 7-zip and they're here are
joint with Bryan Kearney quarries

17
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:08,600
a CEO of our or I world's leading the
visual Francis company

18
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,870
axes data that has helped us a lot to
know with

19
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:13,890
up putting together

20
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:17,040
this research so

21
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,620
just two move forward on this a our
goals today is to just give you

22
00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:26,040
really brief introduction to
steganography as it raced our price:

23
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:29,160
then to I'll give you all

24
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:33,300
%uh some ideas on how we could I'll

25
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:37,020
obtaining malformations inside before

26
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,820
different file formats and the talk
about

27
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,780
so there's they're gonna graphic
implications as well as vulnerabilities

28
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:50,869
thats are a natural byproduct after that
we will move on to demonstrating

29
00:01:50,869 --> 00:01:54,190
are some African 30 a

30
00:01:54,190 --> 00:01:57,570
hex editing and a a

31
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:01,470
how to create your own other file
formats

32
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:05,860
by modifying the very astonished and
mister and will finish with the

33
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:09,850
fever tool it's going to be available
today which we call mix engine

34
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:13,390
are which has been specifically designed
to the tact

35
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:16,720
malformations in standards archive
formats

36
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,930
and then also to detect all the
vulnerabilities that

37
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:23,209
who will be talking today sorrow

38
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:26,910
principal topic is thinking of you saw
what that is

39
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,010
many of you know that's just simply
getting to the

40
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:33,549
basic the verbage definition it is the
art

41
00:02:33,549 --> 00:02:37,760
and science writing hidden message in
messages in such a way that no one

42
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,150
apart from the sender intended recipient
suspects the existence of the message

43
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:47,750
are it's really are for all of our our
security through obscurity

44
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:52,430
its across it has been around for a long
time you know %um

45
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:55,950
want to talk about you know it's ancient
& the historic

46
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:00,040
predecessors but really when it comes to
digital stuff it comes to with this

47
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:03,790
take one image in this case you know we
will re-air

48
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:07,140
removed for %uh some pizza the caller
mad

49
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:11,950
the result will be a black image we were
all our change the brightness

50
00:03:11,950 --> 00:03:15,130
the by eighty-five percent and then we
get a hidden message

51
00:03:15,130 --> 00:03:19,940
order image that's being are a very into
it so I arm

52
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:23,010
when you're talking with another fee
it's really

53
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:27,349
images has been historically RTR has
been recently dr.

54
00:03:27,349 --> 00:03:30,819
but today we were really focused on
archives

55
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:35,190
or always you can barry really big
payloads into

56
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:40,540
standard thinks steganography or are

57
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:43,620
shorter or for think you're

58
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,890
mister looks like on before is next or

59
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:51,599
just a I thought to have another slide
before that

60
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,650
are we missing a slight aren't

61
00:03:56,650 --> 00:03:59,959
does matter I'll I'm

62
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:04,390
anyhow so are when it comes to gonna be
there is the

63
00:04:04,390 --> 00:04:09,680
which intimate use their and religion to
use for us than our feet and

64
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:14,140
a stay or leave the word that in a press
community uses for the first time

65
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:14,660
graphic

66
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:18,590
or use when looking for the SoCal
contraband

67
00:04:18,590 --> 00:04:22,180
but a stenography

68
00:04:22,180 --> 00:04:26,000
is also a feature of in a watermarking
the air RAM

69
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:30,370
%uh cap for you know signing movies or
more recently for

70
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,950
embedding her are watermarked
information to the

71
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:38,199
medical image and church still %uh

72
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:41,290
people talk about thing on FB
principally for messages

73
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:44,790
hiding text within the text and images
media files

74
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:49,580
and reason for proliferation this is
that you know there are over 600

75
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:52,810
different tools available today to are

76
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:57,430
allow you to embed the material with
different sorts all returns

77
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,009
many these things have been open source
and as such

78
00:05:01,009 --> 00:05:04,830
a there has been for free proliferation
of commission

79
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:10,270
private tools a really focus on total
obscurity

80
00:05:10,270 --> 00:05:14,419
in embedding information principally to
more

81
00:05:14,419 --> 00:05:17,919
have a defection that in today's world
is done

82
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:21,729
really two different ways either you try
to inventory all the possible origins

83
00:05:21,729 --> 00:05:23,870
and i'm looking for. artefacts

84
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:27,350
are inside the images or media files

85
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:31,500
or you're just looking for the
president's of the tools that do

86
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,669
a encryption/decryption all the data

87
00:05:34,669 --> 00:05:40,110
many you looking for cash so far these
tools so

88
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:44,010
a such I affected by Brian to

89
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,160
to tell you about you know you know how
does this look like in real life

90
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:53,470
today thanks villagers enough we do
quite a bit to work not on identifying

91
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,130
tools but

92
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:57,659
opening up their payload the results %uh
I'll

93
00:05:57,659 --> 00:06:01,180
a stay those files but I

94
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:05,680
as part of this this project working
with reversing last team that we wanna

95
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:09,500
I set out to try to find some good
stories about steganography interests

96
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,370
enough I really couldn't find any good

97
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,960
good stories about it because we had
magically got files the times at which

98
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,500
we needed to look at but

99
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:20,340
on it could be due to the fact that it's
really not that prevalent in a while

100
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,770
I don't fully believe that that's true
but is obviously a possibility

101
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:28,669
are it could be a analysts are not
looking so they never find it right it's

102
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:30,810
like they're so many other things you
look at a

103
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:34,750
and you look at a hard drive it's got
half a million a million items on there

104
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:35,460
you see 'em

105
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:39,349
that matter are way file you know what
are the chances

106
00:06:39,349 --> 00:06:43,919
are it could be that most media are
based approaches have many weaknesses

107
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,680
sold the big thing is that when you
start shopping a lot of data in some

108
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:50,909
the traditional stengel carrier files

109
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:55,820
the start to get a little bit messy so
like the images get 50 the audio gets

110
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,779
more garbled

111
00:06:56,779 --> 00:07:00,919
and what not so you is not a good means
if you're really trying to take a fair

112
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:04,560
amount to date outside a little ditty
bits and pieces and stuff like that

113
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,700
on in that right now the best method to
identify Stanko is to find the tools

114
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:10,580
based off the hash

115
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:13,969
and a story it's pretty much sort of
what they do there's a few different

116
00:07:13,969 --> 00:07:17,419
cache database is out there in a few
different schools and stuff like that

117
00:07:17,419 --> 00:07:22,180
but up right now so is the best method
to identify staying on a machine is to

118
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:24,320
see first presents us to go to all

119
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:27,750
this presence in Steger jewel is a
possibility that their sons Daegu

120
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,639
payload are

121
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,270
there were some have potential
information that was staying at so

122
00:07:32,270 --> 00:07:36,300
on or it could be that steganography is
just so effective

123
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,090
that nobody really knows up so new
paradigm

124
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:45,190
forensic really from investigative
perspective obviously we talk about the

125
00:07:45,190 --> 00:07:50,210
traditional steganography is thought of
just in bed Indian media files audio JK

126
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:54,500
bitmap gifts and stuff like that again
things get a little bit does messy as

127
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:55,430
you start increased

128
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:59,210
payloads have on if you're really gonna
go through the effort aching stuffy

129
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:03,750
kinda wanna come to take a buncha stuff
with you so this related to the session

130
00:08:03,750 --> 00:08:06,370
is really about a new paradigm in
steganography

131
00:08:06,370 --> 00:08:11,070
which gets used a lot um which really
will be a shift away from the media

132
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:12,550
files probably

133
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:15,620
two more archive files zip cab 7-zip

134
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:18,770
are like the rest the team is talking
about

135
00:08:18,770 --> 00:08:22,690
so within these archive files why why it
should be

136
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:26,370
why it's relevant is because you can
start putting more data in the air

137
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:30,510
these days once you put data in these
archives you can still get stuff out to

138
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,039
ago

139
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,500
it's fine archives good are so it sort
of you don't really know unless you

140
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,740
really start to look into these
different archive files I'll

141
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:41,990
and there's also other purchasers
discussion about us take a filesystem

142
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:43,110
rar recently

143
00:08:43,110 --> 00:08:48,150
I which is basically a file system then
which sort of works like a TrueCrypt

144
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:52,180
where you basically open it up with a
regular password and then

145
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:55,680
because in the UK the recently passed a
law talking but you have to

146
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,110
you have to give up your password so if
that's the case

147
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:02,709
there you go they would say give your
password you given your password

148
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:07,220
with open after be benign files but
inside that archive for that file system

149
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:12,140
is a whole other set of things so on
that was called the stable filesystem

150
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:16,530
and then I also just the read about a
another approach for you can take a CD

151
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:17,420
filesystem

152
00:09:17,420 --> 00:09:20,990
the CDFS filesystem with the CD and you
can just

153
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:26,020
GM data into the CE but when you go to
read it looks like a regular play

154
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,280
and stuff like that but you need to know
to look outside of the storm

155
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:34,790
no no on normal bounds so I investigate
each day going archives

156
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:38,270
so why is really rolled from
investigators perspective is one

157
00:09:38,270 --> 00:09:41,459
it easier to hide larger payloads in
plain sight

158
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:45,360
I think that most relevant thing is it's
not easy to you identify using existing

159
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:46,400
methods

160
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:50,060
so all the existing methods are like
blind anomaly based approach

161
00:09:50,060 --> 00:09:53,890
are looking for things that aren't the
signatures image analysis using image

162
00:09:53,890 --> 00:09:56,089
filters audio analyzers

163
00:09:56,089 --> 00:09:59,699
and what not so those are all very much
media based approach

164
00:09:59,699 --> 00:10:00,040
and that
