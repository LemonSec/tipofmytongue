1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,669
get into multiple languages we realized
there's a lot more languages that we

2
00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:06,720
have people the company's speak this
language is how are we gonna do it

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,210
and the way that we did is we ask people
who were in

4
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:13,630
regions to help us so if you were in say

5
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:17,190
France love where we were starting

6
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:20,320
to see some articles I we ask people in
France they help us translate decided

7
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:20,859
the French

8
00:00:20,859 --> 00:00:24,289
we the registers translators would give
them a list of all the

9
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:28,170
the different streams and say tell us
what you think these are

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:32,829
and what happens at the low end if you
don't have a lot of a

11
00:00:32,829 --> 00:00:37,260
responses is people will make jokes and
put in all kinds of crazy stuff

12
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:42,489
but then we see that back in the Nasonex
person haters we think these are

13
00:00:42,489 --> 00:00:47,030
there are these right to and ultimately
will happen is the users have the same

14
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,270
vested interest you do

15
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:52,449
in your application for your site they
wanted to work they want to work for

16
00:00:52,449 --> 00:00:52,980
them

17
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,649
they wanted to be good invaluable and
provide

18
00:00:56,649 --> 00:00:59,859
a value in their life so they're gonna
help

19
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:04,140
and what we found is after a certain
threshold abusers have gone through

20
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:08,600
with fed back this information a we'd
get accurate translations

21
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:12,670
and no specific single person did it

22
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:16,979
didn't really depend on on one person's
interpretation with the language was it

23
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:17,479
was

24
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:20,890
en masse the users make a decision
asking for help

25
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:26,560
the hope you so we do the same thing
with fam users report spam

26
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,479
and if enough users report similar
pieces will just automatically start

27
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:31,630
taking it out of the system

28
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:36,110
in the way we talk about

29
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:40,479
spam and what it is is are these things
absolutely for a little more than

30
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,689
than your traditional email spam me
clearly there is your your traditional

31
00:01:43,689 --> 00:01:45,420
email classic messaging spam

32
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,509
with the this text URL so it goes around
but

33
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:53,390
repeated there's other things that we
consider spam they're really precursors

34
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:57,240
to that type for spam someone making
lotsa lotsa friend requests

35
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,009
I'll people who are going around and
kind of cherry-picking

36
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:05,750
friends that have large numbers a friend
so that they can be able send messages

37
00:02:05,750 --> 00:02:06,719
to friends of friends

38
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,140
things that nature and then the whole

39
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,430
creating fake accounts or compromising
the town's or

40
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:17,800
even there's been some attempted session
hijacking but they're not very good at

41
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:21,700
we have a lot of automated methods or
distributed message to attack these

42
00:02:21,700 --> 00:02:27,319
basically if you engage in a bunch for
those behaviors before we have automated

43
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:28,050
systems

44
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,610
that compare your actions to the actions
of

45
00:02:31,610 --> 00:02:35,950
normal users the distribution of all the
regular people who are using the site

46
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:36,730
and what they do

47
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:40,129
and as you've move further and further
away from that

48
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:44,540
said normal activity you'll start seeing
automated countermeasures

49
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,800
was really a meeting so for instance a
person a lot of messages

50
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:51,930
a lot more than that a normal user would
will start limiting the number messages

51
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:54,459
you can send by putting in interstitial
page saying

52
00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:57,870
percentage many messages slow down if
you continue sending lots of messages

53
00:02:57,870 --> 00:02:58,830
because

54
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:02,300
you're not a human reading that pager
script um

55
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,970
that will start taking other methods
like 3m captures

56
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:10,260
or keeping your messages from sending
for a much longer period

57
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:13,530
which destroys economics a script
because it takes longer for the spam

58
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:14,500
messages to get out

59
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:20,510
a who up to eventually just disabling my
account so I can send any more messages

60
00:03:20,510 --> 00:03:25,459
all this happens in an automated fashion
in real time and also

61
00:03:25,459 --> 00:03:29,390
if up a buncha brew are a bunch of
individuals become disabled for sending

62
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:30,470
similar messages

63
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:34,640
will start targeting that message as
potential spam and will block it

64
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:39,540
automatically as for removing it from
the network we do that via a budget for

65
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:40,650
classifiers like

66
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:46,370
is a street blocking if it's the same
stream a look at it if the accounts

67
00:03:46,370 --> 00:03:49,830
a are movie missus rounder deleting
things

68
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:53,150
messages from us saying stop doing this
will look at that

69
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:58,530
and we actually have working more and
more on automated detection of traffic

70
00:03:58,530 --> 00:03:59,780
flows as opposed to

71
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:03,819
content flows to do so. so

72
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:08,890
good this is all leading up to pick a
study by the way so

73
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:12,890
that so that's what we're doing here um
because we're in the US in California we

74
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:15,319
actually have a really good legal
arsenal that we can use

75
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:18,449
a worldwide and here's some here's some
things we r

76
00:04:18,449 --> 00:04:22,340
sorry to have any European equivalents
but I'm a

77
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:26,460
if you're in the US some other stuff for
work for you the first one is the the

78
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,449
can-spam Act which is an anti-spam

79
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:32,220
a statute in the US federal statute a

80
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:36,380
that really yours you could bring our

81
00:04:36,380 --> 00:04:41,030
are cases to to the FBI or or other law
enforcement agencies to make a

82
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:42,050
prosecutor under this

83
00:04:42,050 --> 00:04:45,870
but the AU essays are really keen on on
prosecuting the slow they haven't had

84
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:46,639
good luck with it

85
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,970
um fortunately there's a a civil damage
so we can actually once we're

86
00:04:50,970 --> 00:04:55,060
find that the people involved even
before even the people involved

87
00:04:55,060 --> 00:05:00,169
we can sue them for for sending this
paper material

88
00:05:00,169 --> 00:05:04,530
and there's a statutory damages as high
as a as a hundred dollars per message

89
00:05:04,530 --> 00:05:08,600
sent interestingly a statute it's
permissive cents not

90
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,990
message received which means that for
instance if our automated systems which

91
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:13,800
they do

92
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,210
identify the messages families for two
leading them before the users ever see

93
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:17,850
them

94
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:20,930
it's still under the statute a hundred
dollars per message

95
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:24,970
so so when we make a large family
Thacker systems make jack shit

96
00:05:24,970 --> 00:05:28,600
removed from the system for any user
actually even she's a message is

97
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:32,000
but we still have statutory damages
based on based on the numbers a message

98
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,789
is sent

99
00:05:33,789 --> 00:05:37,000
and some others stature are pretty I'll
talk about that during the

100
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,380
through the case study we also got the
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act

101
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,759
both at the federal level and at the
state level that provides for

102
00:05:44,759 --> 00:05:48,720
for civil damages from unauthorized
access the statutes don't define what an

103
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,110
authorized access is

104
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:55,699
I'm which is probably a good piece of
legislation because that'll change

105
00:05:55,699 --> 00:05:58,979
quicker than the legislation would but
are

106
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:02,650
statement rights responsibilities our
Terms of Service does define what

107
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:04,020
unauthorized accesses

108
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,169
sand that's a a lot of different things

109
00:06:07,169 --> 00:06:10,699
the fridge to go look at what point to
go through the mall to it

110
00:06:10,699 --> 00:06:13,789
okay so fear is

111
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:17,150
the chain of a typical spam attack on
Facebook and over

112
00:06:17,150 --> 00:06:20,330
talked through the trade you guys
probably have seen

113
00:06:20,330 --> 00:06:24,350
so we're all these these links before
and then we discuss different ways that

114
00:06:24,350 --> 00:06:26,210
we interject each section of the chain

115
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:31,060
and what the result abouts difficulty
was

116
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:34,830
so first off someone's got to identify
an attack

117
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:40,050
be it it may or may not reach re rely on
a threat or or ability in our

118
00:06:40,050 --> 00:06:43,470
in our application at work it may just
be using this site the way it's supposed

119
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:44,340
to be

120
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:48,490
sending messages to the people but
sometimes it does rely on an application

121
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:50,160
layer

122
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,340
threat have fish level ability something

123
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,910
someone at some point tries to figure
that out and

124
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:01,440
I'm that's a good that's a early warning
system that something's going to happen

125
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,380
if you start seeing that type of
behavior

126
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:07,919
and will explain how we do that little
generally go collect a lot of accounts

127
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:09,699
and neither do this by buying

128
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:12,780
big fish lists and just trying to get
just to see how many

129
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,310
work or the whole farm friends

130
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:20,110
or so we'll records but this guy before
on the site

131
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:24,360
because up the social network major a
Facebook you can just send messages to

132
00:07:24,360 --> 00:07:25,690
millions of people automatically

133
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:29,479
you have to have some relationship with
them so you need to get into compromised

134
00:07:29,479 --> 00:07:30,620
accounts the couple

135
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,970
friends that you can send messages to or
you need to

136
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:37,690
create accounts that people will friend
and make your connection to

137
00:07:37,690 --> 00:07:41,530
and then use those two to send messages

138
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:46,550
so and many have to rate or buy software

139
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,250
the script that because you're you're
clearly not gonna send a hundred million

140
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,169
messages

141
00:07:50,169 --> 00:07:53,349
by by hand so

142
00:07:53,349 --> 00:07:57,020
you know there are people out there who
will identify some way to do this right

143
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,280
software that

144
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:02,099
will sell those people who writer on
softer

145
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:06,139
many do the attack this is where we get
to know about you

146
00:08:06,139 --> 00:08:09,370
you can go through all those previous
steps without necessarily

147
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:12,419
coming to our attention but definitely
want to perform the attack

148
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:16,169
start sending letters fam our systems
will catch you at all or just you I will

149
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:17,259
start figuring out

150
00:08:17,259 --> 00:08:21,310
who you are and what you're doing one of
the first things will track is

151
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:24,879
where you sending people the

152
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,090
because general you're not gonna make
money by selling things on on Facebook

153
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:32,550
you to send people to some other site to
install malware to get them to buy

154
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:33,469
something

155
00:08:33,469 --> 00:08:36,760
what have you so where you see people
and how are you getting there

156
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:41,659
will start investigating that
immediately

157
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:45,260
and then there's profit at the end most
spammers are not collecting information

158
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,950
they're not trying to gather

159
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:51,170
personal information they're trying to
get money and

160
00:08:51,170 --> 00:08:55,779
but cities want to go so over to the
stuff

161
00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:59,410
to disrupt the identification of attack

162
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:03,580
so what's going to be sitting there from
trying things trying to figure out how

163
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:04,100
to do it

164
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:09,399
and the early so we actually caught a
lot of people because

165
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:13,779
them they were really thinking that our
users had any money so they were trying

166
00:09:13,779 --> 00:09:15,240
to send them off site

167
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,670
but they're really trying to collect a
gradual so a lot of people were putting

168
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:19,310
and

169
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:23,470
CSS attacks in JavaScript rewriting the
page to try and collect

170
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:28,000
user names and passwords so they could
sell elsewhere where the ways that we

171
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,750
the Wii found out about that is we just
decided to

172
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:35,769
at the database level start monitoring
every piece which text that someone

173
00:09:35,769 --> 00:09:36,670
entered into the

174
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:41,470
into the the site stripping out
obviously JavaScript and

175
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:45,330
and sequel things like that but then
also since we knew who they were

176
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:48,850
because they were logged in for they had
been logged in or

177
00:09:48,850 --> 00:09:52,760
we have some mechanism to tie them to
some Facebook profile

178
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:56,459
we also say that information and it was
for the following up with

179
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:59,959
who are the top 10 people who are trying
this all the time or who are the top
