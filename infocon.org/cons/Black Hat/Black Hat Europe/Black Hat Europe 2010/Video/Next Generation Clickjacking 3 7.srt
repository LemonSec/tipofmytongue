1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,290
they get converted into the quicken you
are out so

2
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:07,710
thanks can sometimes contain sense
information that might contain

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,500
user ID them are contained a see perhaps
for example

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:16,289
I'm in this case here this is a got you
to keep document

5
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:21,590
I'm if we could somehow get that Sandra
have a page that's pretty get

6
00:00:21,590 --> 00:00:24,680
but links ok all that interesting what
we really want

7
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:29,510
if the content of a page so text
elections

8
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:33,329
a draggable when I mean by that is if
you selected text in the page in a web

9
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:33,890
browser

10
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:36,960
you can track that's after the after the
browser

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,110
I'm on to another page so we

12
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:44,120
somehow we need to be able to get the
city first selection text: the page

13
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,370
and then drag it out and

14
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:50,700
I'm not with work but it sounds pretty
tricky

15
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,579
I'm but it is possible for his work how
we do it

16
00:00:55,579 --> 00:01:00,100
this is a a document which I'm letting
want to know the URL a bit

17
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:03,910
we don't know the contents said he is
authenticating has access to documents

18
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:07,470
we want was just to try and still
content but this

19
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:12,260
from the user so I can we use the hidden
life in concept

20
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:15,860
and festival we place

21
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,220
in no /iframe weeks we talk at the top

22
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,530
of the page an easy start to track so

23
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:26,270
again i'm for example at the beginning I
shaded sliding block puzzle

24
00:01:26,270 --> 00:01:29,549
for the first time we sought to try to
piece and

25
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:32,950
that's top secret selection notes Lee

26
00:01:32,950 --> 00:01:37,939
this page is quite long and we don't use
it abstract all the way to the bus moved

27
00:01:37,939 --> 00:01:41,869
at the document but what we can do is
the soonest use it starts to you

28
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:46,470
the same issues as how down the mouse
button we can position no /iframe

29
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,950
pic but talking inside your crime said
possibly the document

30
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:53,220
is is targeted what that means is the
issue

31
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:56,350
as soon as the user has moved the mouse
even by small amounts

32
00:01:56,350 --> 00:01:59,810
did not help down introduction has been
selected

33
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:04,799
so than due to finish that track and
then we need to get these to track again

34
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,830
and so in this case we

35
00:02:08,830 --> 00:02:12,180
would target position say at this point
with texan the pagers be

36
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:15,390
selected and then we get easy to track

37
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:18,680
again it should be that an example
beginning to be

38
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:22,410
weaving a puzzle piece for the second
time and wood rack the content

39
00:02:22,410 --> 00:02:27,420
from the iframe and property taxes page
now I'm gonna show you an example of

40
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:27,670
this

41
00:02:27,670 --> 00:02:30,780
yet to see exactly how it works I'm

42
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:35,120
when I see the to check until now

43
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:38,500
the truck in shop API in web browsers
lets you transfer

44
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:41,709
plain text from one place to another now

45
00:02:41,709 --> 00:02:45,879
in the case have document and a text
content its

46
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:49,640
is valuable information but if we think
about absent

47
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,120
to web pages think about the isolation
of school so that

48
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,349
picking up to be certain for the
interesting

49
00:02:56,349 --> 00:02:59,370
and sensitive data in that separate some
who

50
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:03,540
1804 escrow so crisp or treat a concise
so on

51
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,739
a page as course I quest for your
protection lb

52
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:09,950
a form house normally hidden

53
00:03:09,950 --> 00:03:13,470
had failed still have this random taking
him

54
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:17,930
now if we can still that taken then

55
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:21,810
the site suddenly becomes front cross at
Crestwood re

56
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:25,180
each request we send it in we can
include is taken

57
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:28,840
and perform an automated attack

58
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,110
now

59
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:35,159
the way sites in from across request
forgery barry

60
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:39,849
sometimes he's taken salad Annie wants
but sometimes taken sides

61
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:44,069
and a different I session on a criminal
limited amount of time say

62
00:03:44,069 --> 00:03:48,540
10 minutes so

63
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,940
to get the source page we can use a
method I showed you before

64
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:55,720
but said he's in a drag-and-drop API to
browse is we can use

65
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:59,260
and editable a shift L area a when he
drops

66
00:03:59,260 --> 00:04:03,700
the tax on to that point to that so
every web browser

67
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:07,650
has a rich Texas ago ten and it's the
kind of thing that you use when you're

68
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:11,140
I'm in where militants only to make text
bold

69
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:15,659
metallic and the US editing it you know
know happens is

70
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:19,220
when you at flexing text and web page
drop it on to their

71
00:04:19,220 --> 00:04:23,530
it will actually copy nice shemale

72
00:04:23,530 --> 00:04:27,680
and we created insights inside the area

73
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,810
so again contract from one page went to
maine

74
00:04:30,810 --> 00:04:33,870
to you and that's play area on another
two main

75
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:37,940
and all the source that will be copied
across and

76
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:41,729
this cause I made or contact sport
that's at that's how it works

77
00:04:41,729 --> 00:04:45,070
so content extraction

78
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:48,729
this is the second technique so

79
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:52,520
again a bit more user in traction
required to make this work sensitive

80
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:53,490
just one track

81
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:57,030
everything's inject X into into form
with it

82
00:04:57,030 --> 00:05:00,979
two tracks so the fact that attacked the
second track after the page

83
00:05:00,979 --> 00:05:05,509
where the hands and the size the page
doesn't matter

84
00:05:05,509 --> 00:05:08,840
so we can flex in toy section a page
even with this is

85
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,930
very small mouse movement up one
interesting

86
00:05:12,930 --> 00:05:15,979
way this could be used is internet
reconnaissance

87
00:05:15,979 --> 00:05:19,210
so for example we may know the URL of
the page made a high

88
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:22,410
maybe and a akroyd internet

89
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:26,650
we don't come to contended of it napping
guess some positions on the page

90
00:05:26,650 --> 00:05:30,250
we can guess a the top of the page and

91
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:34,310
roughly when it was in the pages and we
can and Tenshi

92
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:37,560
guess that they set by trekking out

93
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:41,160
to get this this and this question all
the latest browsers and

94
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:44,600
in WebKit based browser is when we
copying the HML

95
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,009
out a page the in for children's quit
texting

96
00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:51,289
cold across that's been a limitation
this technique

97
00:05:51,289 --> 00:05:54,780
I'm so we can't use in this case is
still

98
00:05:54,780 --> 00:06:00,780
closer Chris were taken to this audience
for in crime

99
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:05,509
again show you at the ends I'm a
Democrat how that works

100
00:06:05,509 --> 00:06:09,259
so onto technique number three

101
00:06:09,259 --> 00:06:13,130
now if you think back to the Texans
action that required to drag and drop to

102
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:13,880
work

103
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,880
now that's okay that the question is

104
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:21,100
can make it easy to do that and also

105
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:25,270
if we want uniform with many felt
example address and a dress code

106
00:06:25,270 --> 00:06:29,810
on and online shopping site when you get
these to attract each day's

107
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:34,590
and thats not likely to happen

108
00:06:34,590 --> 00:06:38,780
however I've been looking at the Java
track and you're happy I

109
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:42,449
huh now Java has its own

110
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:46,870
drag-and-drop API separate from the one
in web browsers

111
00:06:46,870 --> 00:06:50,870
the a choice bit more towards

112
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:54,849
and in web browsers ands

113
00:06:54,849 --> 00:06:58,120
they're very interesting things that you
can do with that

114
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:01,259
so for example I'm day

115
00:07:01,259 --> 00:07:05,599
is a close call mouse drag gesture
recognizer

116
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:08,900
known in job growth plate we can
actually over right that to change

117
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,560
behaviour

118
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:14,810
how a drag-and-drop operation works

119
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,910
so what we can do is instead of saying

120
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:21,550
okay drag-and-drop consistent these are
holding down the mouse button

121
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,919
moving the mouse that number pixels and
then removing a mouse

122
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:28,780
she say okay when these hotel UMass
Boston then we're going to start a drag

123
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,759
and drop them

124
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,919
and because we can do that we can track
text from a job right place

125
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,729
you can just a click and set up a track
so we're back to the same

126
00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:44,759
using traction as with traditional kick
checking was using a single click

127
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:47,860
2d something interesting in this case
injecting text into

128
00:07:47,860 --> 00:07:51,139
pay kilt with educating

129
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:54,229
further with it Java I'm

130
00:07:54,229 --> 00:07:57,550
drag-and-drop API and we can say okay

131
00:07:57,550 --> 00:08:01,009
incentive requiring these its do
anything to talk about that

132
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:04,910
actually just thought drag and drop
event right now

133
00:08:04,910 --> 00:08:09,319
so JavaScript on a missus web page use a
hidden job wrapped up

134
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:14,180
to you foresees it to you and text to
form kills

135
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:18,039
and the way this works is that web page
to say okay

136
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:22,610
such a drag and drop with this text and
web these and ask us raise

137
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:27,340
the text we drop since the area so it's
a great excuse all on

138
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:30,860
a on top inside an iframe inside an
iframe

139
00:08:30,860 --> 00:08:34,120
than a text to be and into that

140
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,120
some ska show you how it works this is

141
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:43,600
pretty fun

142
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:46,650
okay so in this case we have visible I
friend

143
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:50,090
the so you can see what's going on in a
real could jacking attack

144
00:08:50,090 --> 00:08:54,220
what it is to be hidden and possibly
putting his mask asset they see this

145
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,140
little grey suede

146
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:58,230
this is actually John trapped at and

147
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:02,200
when I click on it it will start a
drag-and-drop operation

148
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:06,750
wait on hold down the mouse button site

149
00:09:06,750 --> 00:09:10,290
hold on to the mouse button and it went
out to the way

150
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:13,650
and let them ask us hasn't changed

151
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:17,450
and normally it will change to have a
little plus I'm so that I can drop was

152
00:09:17,450 --> 00:09:18,000
going on

153
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,890
clash over right that in again with John
right right can stay

154
