1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,240
that we can fenced require one click to

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,770
a pic status now

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,230
sites of I'm my sights implement cossack
for

4
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:17,020
quote cross-site Request for detection
but quite a lot of them to anyway

5
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:21,680
that's makes checking pretty easy so
this is a screenshot from big sale at

6
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,430
which is then issue tracking software

7
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,449
at the missile use I'm for Firefox side

8
00:00:28,449 --> 00:00:31,900
work it uses well this is what happens

9
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:36,380
if it detects across across watery
attack but actually what happens

10
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:39,879
is we can click this button bottom to
say yes go ahead

11
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:43,050
do these changes so well that prevents
cossack respiratory

12
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,550
I'm all that was needed be needed for a
successful keep checking attack is dis

13
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:48,420
click on a button

14
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,640
say

15
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,640
and when the problems we is back
attacking

16
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:58,640
whether things that makes it very tricky
to carry out

17
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,250
is that we need to know the exact
position on the page the target so you

18
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:03,050
remember the

19
00:01:03,050 --> 00:01:07,000
I'm Twitter example but at

20
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,920
noticed talk at this button and to the
positioning me tonight exact number

21
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:12,750
picture was from the Latin from the top

22
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:16,299
North targeted what happens if the

23
00:01:16,299 --> 00:01:19,439
pace changes and talk it moves with this
is

24
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,000
attack that summers past to pay changes
when you can and

25
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,380
she does it then OK control part of the
page so

26
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:32,409
how can we get round this what methods
which I've

27
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:35,920
I'm to come up with is to use

28
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:41,340
fragment positioning not go through this
and people are familiar with HTML

29
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,200
probably a this will be familiar to them

30
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,290
so in the source for page we can have
this attack

31
00:01:48,290 --> 00:01:52,259
and give it a name if we can visit page
and have thats

32
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,340
this name a at the end of the are out
the papers

33
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:00,829
the browser scroll down to make that
section visible so we can use the same

34
00:02:00,829 --> 00:02:01,469
methods

35
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:05,509
to position target in I'm not trying to
keep checking attack

36
00:02:05,509 --> 00:02:10,360
without knowing exactly where it is in
the page now with a

37
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:13,620
and lots web pages don't use this a name
tag

38
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,840
myspace web pages have admitted by the
attributes

39
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,120
and can also use ID attributes to you

40
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,420
and to scroll down to particular element

41
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,599
so this is an example from Google

42
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:32,239
accounts page now each those two boxes
see

43
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:35,410
element has no ID so we can't use

44
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:39,810
up this message to you talk to any these
elements

45
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:43,110
without necessarily knowing that they
are on the page

46
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:47,790
say

47
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:52,459
I'm although it is used to seeing

48
00:02:52,459 --> 00:02:55,879
I'm across Robert Gates make tick and
invisible

49
00:02:55,879 --> 00:02:59,159
if we do this in a very small a friend
and brother was go by horizontally and

50
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:00,760
vertically to make talking visible

51
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:06,959
as quickly show you how that works say

52
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,260
this is the Patriots around the new
investments ans

53
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:14,060
using no positioning methods we wouldn't
know where

54
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:18,870
to you at ex-presidents pics opposition
to the and is adamant

55
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:21,870
thats three loads I'm

56
00:03:21,870 --> 00:03:25,470
effing to the ID

57
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:28,560
BT sentiment in the euro and my friend
scroll

58
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:35,560
to the cracked wall except okay

59
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,050
so extortionist I follow is pretty much
what people know about attacking a

60
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:42,650
moment's

61
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,989
now well as the problems

62
00:03:45,989 --> 00:03:50,690
as I've said before is that's we're
going cross-eyed Chris poetry to get

63
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:51,370
day-to-day

64
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:54,680
into a former and then user clicks
mister but what if

65
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:58,410
the with you can use that method I'm

66
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:02,360
to get they tried to pull how else can
we

67
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:05,550
get that ties into the form displays and
keep checking method

68
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:10,930
one-way is to try and drop night the
grounds that everyone grass courts drag

69
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:11,890
and drop by PI

70
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:15,739
trying to a person's copy and paste let
you transfer transfer data from one

71
00:04:15,739 --> 00:04:16,570
place to another

72
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:19,959
which I can drop using the mouse to do
that see how can a must but move the

73
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,229
mouse and released somewhere

74
00:04:21,229 --> 00:04:26,000
detectors dropped into particular
element nothing with drag-and-drop

75
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,690
it doesn't have the same sandwich in
policy

76
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:33,540
that prevents JavaScript accessing

77
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,780
from a princess jumped from one site
from accessing

78
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:42,650
content on the site say these occur
should write a tip one site to another

79
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:45,690
I'm because use in traction is quite a
quiet

80
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:49,000
president prevent this so his and

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,400
just in case that shows how data

82
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,860
we can you drag drop a few eyebrows a so
what it says is

83
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:00,130
west to drag the sentiments a socialist
state with some text

84
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:03,479
hands which drops that text will be

85
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:10,479
I'm entered into a text or onto the site
so I say that quickly

86
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:18,110
so the sediment

87
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:23,580
uses the second row happy I me so much
like it was a testing text

88
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:26,910
with the element this green

89
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:31,960
area as a page from another two main and
as you can see each my track

90
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,470
its I'm putting different data into him
for this be

91
00:05:35,470 --> 00:05:38,830
will be really useful if we can combine
to keep checking

92
00:05:38,830 --> 00:05:44,940
and get easy to input data into a form
so how can we do this

93
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,780
festival

94
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:53,540
we use the same hidden by frame
technique shortly before

95
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:59,210
we have the little my friend putting the
mouse cursor secondly we need

96
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:03,360
did get easy to track something now
there's many ways you can do this it

97
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,010
could be

98
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:07,940
I'm checking the Scirocco it could be
I'm some sort of game

99
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:13,190
like the sliding puzzle game check you
out here no need to start to track

100
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:17,500
the tix adamant resets and some days
with sorry this is a test to detect

101
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,530
what's to inject

102
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:22,820
into the other site noise is starting to
drive

103
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:26,490
the by people followed the mouse cursor
and the menu to release the mouse button

104
00:06:26,490 --> 00:06:27,580
the text /b and

105
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:32,180
into that field inside iframe then
released it

106
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:35,530
we needs another click to submit the
form and

107
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:38,770
the task complete sam says she is still
ahead

108
00:06:38,770 --> 00:06:42,080
sir how it works I'm

109
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,150
say this is a a game

110
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,740
which people what's that might be time
to try out

111
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:52,120
so what would a as we thought to drag
this program head

112
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,580
now you can see that will square it
appears that's actually

113
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:58,950
I'm and I that so I crime and

114
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:02,270
action is going to show you hoops their

115
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:05,700
a set up a tent of his head

116
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:09,479
and this is a a.m. generic social
networking

117
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:12,890
fake site I'm up

118
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:16,190
so we can send status updates like this
so on

119
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:19,590
so we want to try to get you the chance
to text in here kick the update and

120
00:07:19,590 --> 00:07:20,790
upset with friends

121
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:24,950
so tracking now the

122
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:28,630
buy from us got the the text on a page
under the cursor

123
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:32,789
so when we release the mouse button the

124
00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:36,210
by his opposition says over the Update
button say when we kick the on button

125
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:42,800
flat ands here is what happens

126
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:48,060
that it has been injected that

127
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:51,830
so in this case the do I can with this
bull that I am

128
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:55,919
every attack at we can t in baseball
these would have no idea what's going on

129
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:02,919
okay

130
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:06,500
so that steps for injection obviously
and

131
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,419
downside to it compared to complete
checking is it actually needs to use it

132
00:08:09,419 --> 00:08:10,020
to you

133
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,530
track something and it's a bit hard and
getting stickam stuff

134
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:17,710
clicking is I'm what most people do on
the web most the time

135
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:21,120
know to get to track something around
2010 gates you to it

136
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,960
a bit more so there'll be some more
socially engineer look like that to

137
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,190
carry out excess blood

138
00:08:25,190 --> 00:08:29,669
successful attack but on the other hand
it does continue by POSCO cyclist watery

139
00:08:29,669 --> 00:08:32,680
we're not relying on partial Secrest 42

140
00:08:32,680 --> 00:08:36,640
get a Twitter for Manning at least kick
the possum we doing everything despite

141
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,130
using

142
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:42,050
a iframes and these in traction said as
many things

143
00:08:42,050 --> 00:08:46,050
this could be I'm could be useful

144
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:49,650
example with wet now you could target
the

145
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:53,320
to field the up body failed

146
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:57,260
and then you could sense fake emails
from eases counts

147
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:01,140
you close a edit documents in some sort
of authenticated

148
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:05,700
have talking testing system and put
placed a train that without you YouTube

149
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:06,420
realizing it

150
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:09,670
this technique works in new know the
browser's

151
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:13,560
ask me to cross browser okay

152
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,910
that was content injection and that both
parties cross-site

153
00:09:16,910 --> 00:09:22,060
request forgery we can actually do even
better than that and we can get data

154
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:26,089
out tonight frank so how's that work
welp

155
00:09:26,089 --> 00:09:29,420
we as reverse the drag and drop
technique that I say to you as a

156
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,540
