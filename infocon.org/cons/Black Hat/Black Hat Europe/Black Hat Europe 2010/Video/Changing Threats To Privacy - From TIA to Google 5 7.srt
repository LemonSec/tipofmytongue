1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,090
and the second thing is I don't worry a
little bit less about information for

2
00:00:03,090 --> 00:00:03,439
them

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:06,710
because I don't think about the future
to be done medic even the places that

4
00:00:06,710 --> 00:00:07,720
have done that

5
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,230
are beginning to purchase sometimes have
chipping away from that

6
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:14,990
and than a good thing is that I worry a
lot more about port security

7
00:00:14,990 --> 00:00:18,800
that and I think this is going to come
or more important as a

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,130
for Anna in 2004 a

9
00:00:22,130 --> 00:00:26,150
Nikita Borisov golfer character room a
paper

10
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,380
called off-the-record communication or
wanna

11
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:32,890
to use PD and their

12
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:36,829
observation was pretty straightforward
what they

13
00:00:36,829 --> 00:00:40,070
noticed was there on if you look at

14
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:44,989
okeedokee works probably you know almost
seems like I was never use pgp but must

15
00:00:44,989 --> 00:00:45,340
feel

16
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:49,950
no how it works right which is and let's
say that I sent an email to Bob

17
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,300
I get off public key and I'm tripped my
email about public key

18
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,460
and I senator bob found it on another
note about

19
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:00,489
I use Bob same public key

20
00:01:00,489 --> 00:01:04,470
and get that an upset about on and on
and on and

21
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,580
the problem is that if and any point
bob's public key is compromised

22
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:12,090
then every email that you never sent

23
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,119
is in that he is now also compromised
that

24
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,159
if I send an email to Bob today it is a
cure

25
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,150
but if even 20 years in the future
someone mentions a compromise

26
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:26,159
ability that ella is now past so

27
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:33,159
becomes that one key compromise fast all
previous four spots is that a promise

28
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:37,560
that you're in this weird situation

29
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,780
where the secrecy of what i right is
dependent on

30
00:01:40,780 --> 00:01:44,020
door security practices just have the
opposite a while

31
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:47,930
you know I'm sorry can I am like what I
think our stringent security practices

32
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:48,430
but I

33
00:01:48,430 --> 00:01:52,040
don't really know if that's true for the
people that was funny I would like for

34
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:55,659
my security practices to protect the
secrecy of the things that I might

35
00:01:55,659 --> 00:01:59,590
and but the problem is that you have a
fantasy

36
00:01:59,590 --> 00:02:03,500
with her calls like he he you don't have
to nine billion and so what that means

37
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:04,110
is there

38
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:07,930
if I write this message hey Bob I was
thinking that you know the realtor

39
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:11,489
he had any point that messages a
compromised

40
00:02:11,489 --> 00:02:14,610
there's no way for me tonight and

41
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,870
I absolutely ruthless a

42
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:22,810
its and would that that's partially nice
read it does bother see this message and

43
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,129
he knows that it came from me

44
00:02:24,129 --> 00:02:27,270
but I would like for about another came
from me but also to the other

45
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:31,040
some point say that wasn't really me a

46
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:35,090
the promise that is undeniable at it as
it is and so

47
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:38,810
I'll these I photographers were
proposing that paper

48
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:42,930
a something called off-the-record
messaging and the way this works

49
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:46,239
is there everyone continues to have a
public/private key pair as

50
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,940
you know we're familiar with but the
difference is that those the those he

51
00:02:49,940 --> 00:02:51,920
cares I never used to encrypt actual
data

52
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:56,080
instead their only used to sign an
ephemeral key exchange

53
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,790
that you do a between buffers so

54
00:02:59,790 --> 00:03:03,220
else about change ephemeral Hughes which
they sign

55
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:06,709
using their key pair so that you know
that you have a fantasy

56
00:03:06,709 --> 00:03:10,470
really talking to the right person then
you use that Amaral

57
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:15,040
he care to actually exchange messages
and

58
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,220
what you do is there every time you
change a message

59
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:22,470
you also include past other key exchange
one hard to keep the change

60
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,580
so appended pippen did learn that in
your message is also a key change

61
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:30,220
which means that every time you exchange
messages and

62
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:33,330
you get a new

63
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:37,459
key exchange which means that the key to
your using to exchange messages can

64
00:03:37,459 --> 00:03:39,159
continue rolling forward

65
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:43,049
and so not only are using a penalty is
but also

66
00:03:43,049 --> 00:03:46,540
every time you change a method you have
in your Jeep but ultimately falling

67
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,049
so there's not any one key they can
never be compromised to affect

68
00:03:50,049 --> 00:03:53,459
on your previous messages because that
he is constantly changing and animus

69
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:54,739
toward anywhere from 11

70
00:03:54,739 --> 00:03:59,110
furthermore CMS's I think that with this
session

71
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:02,540
and instead of using digital signatures
to authenticate that message

72
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:06,730
years message authentication code and
Mel message authentication code is

73
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:09,920
he'd ahold the session its a derivative

74
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,129
the session so this decade signatures
are undeniable

75
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:17,549
because they only have one possible all
but

76
00:04:17,549 --> 00:04:20,729
max have to pass a law that's right
because

77
00:04:20,729 --> 00:04:24,250
to most people no the key that is used

78
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:29,030
to construct the matter but Alice and
Bob soap opera see the message

79
00:04:29,030 --> 00:04:32,870
he knows that you know he wrote it for
Alice read it and since he knows that he

80
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:33,479
didn't write it

81
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:37,479
you know that without but if at any
point you present this message and says

82
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:40,610
house wrote this isn't up to the

83
00:04:40,610 --> 00:04:45,060
Allison say no that was %uh and there's
no way for anyone to differentiate

84
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,030
whether as one of the other

85
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:49,169
what's more since this other

86
00:04:49,169 --> 00:04:53,030
message authentication he is
attributable to seventy

87
00:04:53,030 --> 00:04:56,330
and the session he is constantly rolling
forward it means that

88
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:01,259
the Mackies a constantly growing forward
as well and 10 forward to a new mackey

89
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:04,440
and it is no longer censored the old one

90
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,750
a is candy given away it doesn't matter

91
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:11,139
if you keep it secret wanna and so they
explicitly

92
00:05:11,139 --> 00:05:14,750
publish it a openly in the clear

93
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:18,030
in the spare parts every time and that
he becomes obsolete the publisher

94
00:05:18,030 --> 00:05:23,449
white which means that now anyone could
potentially have been watching this then

95
00:05:23,449 --> 00:05:27,660
and unusable mackey to my or four
channel message

96
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:31,970
which means that a this cannot be used
to inject

97
00:05:31,970 --> 00:05:35,039
new messages which would be received by
Bob up indicated a secure

98
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,789
because they moved on to a new mackey
but if someone presents a message

99
00:05:38,789 --> 00:05:42,710
chaos but this is a fucked up you can
say not only well it might involve

100
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:46,020
but also Canada any potentially shopper

101
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,259
but it was better this message so now we
have authenticity

102
00:05:49,259 --> 00:05:52,300
and we have a really strong national
tonight building

103
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:56,150
so the nice thing about otro is that one
key Hamas does not affect

104
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:59,900
all previous messages but also that you
get authenticity

105
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:04,280
entitled so I think that particles like
this are going to be

106
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:07,940
very important in the future that as in
the forward anytime at: secure protocols

107
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:10,190
the first things that theirs is the
sport secure

108
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:14,460
because we're moving into this world
where key disclosure is becoming more

109
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:14,819
more

110
00:06:14,819 --> 00:06:19,449
more and more mission so another project
that I started

111
00:06:19,449 --> 00:06:22,949
with a people from the Institute for
Development Studies

112
00:06:22,949 --> 00:06:26,069
is this project public assistance and
we're trying to do

113
00:06:26,069 --> 00:06:29,639
is combine and fourth secure protocol

114
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,229
into mobile phones which are Anderson

115
00:06:33,229 --> 00:06:36,940
is to trans that I'm interest in working
on the future

116
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:41,400
this place where were asked to make this
choice that i think is a good choice

117
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:46,060
and also a where fort secure protocols
are gonna become more and more important

118
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:49,729
I'm so a to think that we're working on
right now

119
00:06:49,729 --> 00:06:53,539
are first a a scripted Voice application

120
00:06:53,539 --> 00:06:57,660
that uses for it secure protocols and
readiness for

121
00:06:57,660 --> 00:07:01,190
enjoy just the easy thing to do first

122
00:07:01,190 --> 00:07:04,710
and look you know there are other for
device applications and have been on the

123
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:05,560
market for a while

124
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,770
but what we want to do is this should be
something for free that is

125
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:13,090
extremely extremely easy to use we want
this to be as easy to use

126
00:07:13,090 --> 00:07:17,389
as making in Omaha that it should be
integrated into existing tile on your

127
00:07:17,389 --> 00:07:18,449
smartphone

128
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:22,389
the Asian of depression should be based
on existing phone numbers

129
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:26,380
and it should be as easy for you here to
make your call

130
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,880
than just to make an Omaha the way this
works

131
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:33,139
a is playing using that the data channel

132
00:07:33,139 --> 00:07:37,479
you know WiFi or 3G actually transmit
the voice communication

133
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:40,910
and so is this question doesn't know
what's up

134
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:45,069
and the answer is usually yes but and

135
00:07:45,069 --> 00:07:48,550
the reason that I am think if that's
usually comes down to signaling

136
00:07:48,550 --> 00:07:52,129
so normally in some weird situation you
have two parties to try and communicate

137
00:07:52,129 --> 00:07:54,360
and you also have to at some point sir

138
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:58,389
like nafta sheen the sand on the ceiling
and this means we have to

139
00:07:58,389 --> 00:08:02,680
Mangini connection like a TCP connection
already connection

140
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,740
to the report server at all times

141
00:08:05,740 --> 00:08:08,930
and in the context a mobile environment
this is really

142
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:13,660
can be sure that and because now I have
to maintain a constant love and passion

143
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:14,360
to

144
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:17,120
some server somewhere on the internet
which means your phone can't ever go to

145
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,020
sleep

146
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:21,190
and also means that as yours for the
moving around

147
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:25,569
you like going out network connectivity
the connections to break one party might

148
00:08:25,569 --> 00:08:28,099
not notice that action is broken and I
had this for

149
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:31,789
have been situation and things start to

150
00:08:31,789 --> 00:08:34,930
work poorly so but we've decided

151
00:08:34,930 --> 00:08:37,890
is there a lot of in the mobile
environment a lot of signaling can

152
00:08:37,890 --> 00:08:40,250
actually be pushed onto the existing

153
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:43,279
signaling infrastructure that is used
for telecommunications

154
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,540
that this is really nice ceiling
mechanism

155
00:08:46,540 --> 00:08:50,260
its fall the phone company but you know
that

156
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:54,070
a you know they know how to address
devices on the network

157
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:57,700
and their pretty good at and so what
we're trying to do

158
00:08:57,700 --> 00:09:00,870
is leverage that existing bank to a

159
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,279
use the signaling in our opposition and
so

160
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:08,450
a initially and what we're doing is
using the signaling using SMS

161
00:09:08,450 --> 00:09:12,589
so whenever you want to go another far
he just send an SMS message

162
00:09:12,589 --> 00:09:15,720
and the a pull your information at that

163
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,970
and connect their a over the TV channel
to your phone directly

164
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:22,480
see you have this point to point on mold
the

165
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,940
little with connection and you don't
need any

166
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:29,000
long-running actions to some ashford
server somewhere with some

167
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:32,120
user name configured probably won't

168
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:35,890
and so the upside other your phone
doesn't mean

169
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:39,029
a constant never fashion winter from go
to sleep

170
00:09:39,029 --> 00:09:42,540
you don't need if they want to Skype ID
you're offering an idea anything's

171
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,769
the phone numbers are funner you know
that's how you're dressed

172
00:09:45,769 --> 00:09:49,399
if you know someone's phone number you
know how to phone securely and that you

173
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:50,640
don't miss Mina blitzer

174
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,750
you don't need some server are some
Harbor anywhere and just installing a

175
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,970
and I'm ready to go readiness circles

176
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:00,029
and and that
