1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,009
mean to you file format and the old one
but

2
00:00:04,009 --> 00:00:07,620
it's only the compression algorithms
that they've changed so

3
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:10,740
a when the onto a result that was
getting this they were

4
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,420
at risk tolerance all the congressional
all week and they don't support and just

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:15,719
people were whole art

6
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:18,869
now we came to me

7
00:00:18,869 --> 00:00:23,080
rock hard for it and this is an
interesting one

8
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:26,230
because at for small block inside the

9
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:30,000
rar file file format that defines call
archive it says if it's

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,100
a multi-volume long or stuff like that
but it has

11
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:38,700
a pretty neat feature that you can use
to declare blockers temporary one so

12
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:42,180
next time you add an archive to that
particular

13
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,410
I identify with that particular archive
that first law school district

14
00:00:46,410 --> 00:00:49,600
and since it is tripp the archive is
broken

15
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,460
so we can use this as a prevention of
modifying data

16
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:57,489
will show this in the station later

17
00:00:57,489 --> 00:01:02,379
but what the problem was a is that
differs a bite to use to identify the

18
00:01:02,379 --> 00:01:07,010
archive itself but the next block itself
is pretty much standard

19
00:01:07,010 --> 00:01:11,979
so I'm our best guess is that some that
data was used to identify to file format

20
00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:12,930
and that's why

21
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:17,860
at discounting didn't work properly of
course

22
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:21,250
dozens if we tried the password
protecting the single file in

23
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:24,950
it also worked now

24
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:28,479
every file inside the zipper inside the
rar

25
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,460
archive also has a a Persian
requirements for the software to extract

26
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,100
it

27
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:37,540
and by setting the was a requirement to
25

28
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:42,399
which is the FF impacts p we were
successfully able to

29
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,229
a prevents some sup reminders from

30
00:01:46,229 --> 00:01:49,490
confessing such archives of course the
first file cannot be you can miss

31
00:01:49,490 --> 00:01:50,869
biennial this author

32
00:01:50,869 --> 00:01:54,110
that processes prior archive but

33
00:01:54,110 --> 00:01:57,259
I duress to the files in the archive for
it despite

34
00:01:57,259 --> 00:02:01,060
now capital for might

35
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:04,930
what we wanted to do is see if we could
in peace

36
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:08,050
need a compressed file size: so we set
that size to

37
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:11,069
four gigabytes which is the maximum file
size a

38
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:15,830
allowed by the couple format and this
doesn't do anything for dinner kept

39
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,980
processes because

40
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,200
they don't rely on this information when
they're creating founded as the

41
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,230
compressing data

42
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:26,150
and once the come to the for me to bite
me know this but the el Papa size and

43
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:27,209
they just write that

44
00:02:27,209 --> 00:02:31,470
but if somebody was to try to allocate
all this data of course there are

45
00:02:31,470 --> 00:02:36,099
processor with break or just people to
file thinking it's still are skipping

46
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:37,280
any kind while there

47
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,530
and just couldn't scan it now 4G

48
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:46,480
GZ file format we just added the
document that the extra field and

49
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:47,410
recommendation

50
00:02:47,410 --> 00:02:50,950
and it's really not commonly used and
that's why

51
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:54,730
essential for runners had the problem
the fighting started the compressed data

52
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:57,730
which was shifted by a few bites and

53
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:01,550
that's why did the compression and work
now for some that

54
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:05,780
in I'll it has also dressed like a

55
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,690
rar archive it has several blocks which
describe the

56
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:12,769
following content by setting the CRC

57
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:16,430
up to Heather to an incorrect value you
would still

58
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:19,819
have a valid archive which can be
decompressed by seven Zip but

59
00:03:19,819 --> 00:03:23,190
some some security when there's were

60
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:27,330
taking the CRC and telling all this
follows broke in and we're not gonna

61
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,000
scant

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:32,379
now this it

63
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:35,540
can be implemented a like this so

64
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:41,299
p first her Heather which has these four
fields can be Sep 20

65
00:03:41,299 --> 00:03:45,750
and this only works if have to pick up a
single file in an archive because then

66
00:03:45,750 --> 00:03:50,060
some zippel generically try to locate
that particular compressed file

67
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:53,580
and it'll succeed at that and the other
archive for

68
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:57,049
processes fung in securities author
wouldn't

69
00:03:57,049 --> 00:04:00,610
not whether to conclusions are testing

70
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:05,950
files can be more performant its to
carry couldn't play load and

71
00:04:05,950 --> 00:04:11,260
that simply locate the affect department
do we we process archives and

72
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:16,840
and case of security the we won't be
able to use canned whole archive

73
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:21,549
now hidden multnomah personal security
might it be fixed

74
00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:24,979
or by adding a generic the compression

75
00:04:24,979 --> 00:04:28,949
a generic a decompression routines to
dr. co-processor such as

76
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:33,220
mean our house for ZIP file format they
can still be decompressed even though

77
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:37,169
they don't look ballasted from to the
conditions that point

78
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:41,570
now of course us can be more permits to
carry additional

79
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:45,560
you know that the content and this
second got

80
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:49,000
content has a self-destruct button so if
you're not careful enough

81
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,800
in the process all repairing an archive
or modifying anything

82
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:57,020
you would end up with losing the
important data now

83
00:04:57,020 --> 00:05:00,639
good at death brings us to our first
demonstration

84
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,210
we can do some exiting lena hai existing
files in signs it

85
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:08,650
is the part I began to insert some
hidden messages

86
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:12,090
we gonna in Mentor on file format and in
a show of

87
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:15,130
added to we used to do tackle this and

88
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:19,270
is gone and inject some stable data
inside

89
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:26,270
an existing zip archive so as that

90
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:36,670
ok it didn't look so the first thing is
to women to show

91
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:39,710
is this particular archive which is the
first

92
00:05:39,710 --> 00:05:42,800
BSA security adviser we posted

93
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,170
so it only has one particular find fill
filing it and its

94
00:05:47,170 --> 00:05:50,860
I'm over it but then it's a compressed

95
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,980
her Conficker sample I believe

96
00:05:54,980 --> 00:06:00,000
so its heather is damaged see that but
just been looking and

97
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,930
X output as he first devices

98
00:06:05,930 --> 00:06:11,220
zeros in their supposed to be day for
months format signature which is for C

99
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:14,270
BK we damage that intentionally

100
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:17,450
and at dnt we

101
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:20,980
added another file which is hidden menu
don't really see it's called

102
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:26,980
difference either see that spring right
here insist that file

103
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:32,090
since that file its head in and such
only in the ER coprocessors

104
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,900
that actually confused security software
and

105
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:39,020
thought that without I was broken and
didn't scan it in full

106
00:06:39,020 --> 00:06:42,700
now some other fields were modified here
not gonna

107
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,880
going to that this was documented in or
like paper

108
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:51,640
now a tool used to create such an
archive this cold seeped inside you

109
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:56,300
we made such an ARCA such a program to
test

110
00:06:56,300 --> 00:07:01,260
if we are correcting looking for the
special content and if we are processing

111
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:01,980
these

112
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:08,630
archives correctly you know I'm gonna
demonstrate how it works

113
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:11,920
the archive and in question this one
real

114
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:15,180
already has any content inside it

115
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:20,790
soldiers by calling

116
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:25,660
as insider weekend i list all files

117
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:29,600
that the hidden inside that particular
outfit

118
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:33,150
of course I

119
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:36,560
removed hiding so high

120
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:43,560
riddle okay

121
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,060
now we see that we have found one file
it was hidden

122
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:53,110
is called file does have an extension
its size is 12 bytes

123
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:56,650
has a certain CRC of course now

124
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:02,710
be thats particular file is a hidden in
the archive because

125
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:07,210
prosperous and if you want to show that
particular out how we would modify dr.

126
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,020
Katz L

127
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:12,610
no to show them show that particular
file

128
00:08:12,610 --> 00:08:18,300
in any program so now

129
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:22,360
we have modified the archive and you can
see that file

130
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,570
and that file is pretty good text file
which has

131
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:31,250
the answer to hit the middle israel
itself you have to look closer to find

132
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:32,849
the answer to this isn't the answer

133
00:08:32,849 --> 00:08:37,120
the question why this file is so special
and i actually send this to

134
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,789
couple my guys and they were able to
find this file but the rest to the

135
00:08:40,789 --> 00:08:41,719
puzzle was

136
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:45,590
be on them till

137
00:08:45,590 --> 00:08:49,090
beaten this was a an example of hiding
existing

138
00:08:49,090 --> 00:08:53,840
content inside an archive but we have
also injected additional content inside

139
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,950
the archive itself

140
00:08:54,950 --> 00:09:01,180
so use extract to you

141
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:07,500
get that you content with this file has
been successfully

142
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:11,810
expected this Candice that injected
content on this

143
00:09:11,810 --> 00:09:15,430
as we see it follows possible protective
it's another text file

144
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:21,240
and passport for it is a force riddle
and

145
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:24,600
this is the act this is the answer to
the question why this

146
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,030
files specialist because we made it
pretty tool called

147
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:31,830
deep inside her so as you can see the
deck and

148
00:09:31,830 --> 00:09:35,680
successfully be hidden inside an archive
we can do alls

149
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,890
assorted stuff for with are tools to
extract them back

150
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:43,510
now a provided this particular tool

151
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:47,130
both Heights and reveals content so it's
only aware

152
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:50,150
of its own mechanisms for fighting

153
00:09:50,150 --> 00:09:53,770
additionally to 0 we gonna talk about

154
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:59,000
how we can generically detect any kind
of hidden content a bit later

155
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,860
but
