1
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,830
I think I'll the

2
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:06,779
calling silly hackers a business model
is actually accurate because we never

3
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:07,569
get the money

4
00:00:07,569 --> 00:00:10,920
um it's it's a it's a

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,080
deterrent um I occurred in here the
first for the question so

6
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:18,420
a though introducing more bugs a

7
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:21,779
well for chair develop a process is very
good at introducing bugs

8
00:00:21,779 --> 00:00:25,929
a it's a it's a

9
00:00:25,929 --> 00:00:29,119
not widely touted fact and when that
that shocks a lot of people

10
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,340
is that we don't actually have a
dedicated to you and the Company

11
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:35,500
I am we develop and test internally

12
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:39,890
and and the security team makes risk
assessments based on

13
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:43,700
on what we find but there's there's
still plenty about sir

14
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:50,700
yes

15
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,739
um II

16
00:00:56,739 --> 00:00:59,870
can't really address the revenue number
%uh the quick let me repeat the question

17
00:00:59,870 --> 00:01:00,200
yes

18
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,660
the question was how we people do we
have dedicated to security and how much

19
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:05,890
of our total revenues related to
security

20
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:09,460
clearly address the revenue number a

21
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:14,140
the number of people is a is actually
pretty broad and between how you define

22
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:14,729
security

23
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:17,780
the the core security team the good

24
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:21,490
the team that i described the art right
there is now about

25
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:26,090
a I think twenty-some-odd people under
1200

26
00:01:26,090 --> 00:01:29,910
um but we also have other organizations
that have security responsibility that

27
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:30,450
work with us

28
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:33,990
so we have a site integrity team that
sits inside

29
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,520
engineering and builds and maintains
those automated systems I was discussing

30
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:42,009
and thats another I think ten or fifteen
people right now

31
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:45,509
and then we also have or use our
operations team woohoo

32
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:49,360
part of their role is to respond to user
requests

33
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,470
um for not just span but

34
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:56,009
any other type love a.m.

35
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:59,860
legal or illegal activity that may be
reported in to move that into the

36
00:01:59,860 --> 00:02:00,520
security

37
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,959
chain and that's about two hundred some
other people so if you take all those

38
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:06,050
responsibilities together you're talking

39
00:02:06,050 --> 00:02:09,899
somewhere say twenty percent of the
company is

40
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:13,750
is working on a security-related
directly working on some sort or

41
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:14,959
security-related function

42
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:17,220
we have strong security awareness
throughout our whole development

43
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,640
organization as well which is about half
the company

44
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:23,890
but

45
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:30,890
yep both in person and you're next yes

46
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:44,170
the question was a lot of our user data
sits on a CD and

47
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:47,470
the content distribution networks and

48
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:51,500
do we get backlogs from those as part of
our intelligence-gathering correlate

49
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,410
that with our

50
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,990
logs and the answer is we have of

51
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:59,570
so where we're where we're investigating
things

52
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:02,810
and we want to see to

53
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:06,209
if content is moving out through the CD
in the we're not seeing directly

54
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:10,130
we absolutely will go to them until I
said we've actually that was part of our

55
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:13,489
original agreement with them we first
started user

56
00:03:13,489 --> 00:03:20,489
so we have the capability s

57
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,360
the the question was how the
relationship between

58
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,989
our group and the Facebook management
and CEO

59
00:03:33,989 --> 00:03:37,300
the the company still very small

60
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,970
and it was very very small and I started
as well so

61
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:44,220
there there's been an awareness love

62
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:47,410
up security early on it at the highest
levels above management

63
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:51,900
the the relationship in direction is

64
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:55,280
I mean I would say it's it's good

65
00:03:55,280 --> 00:04:00,680
a we definitely in for regularly to the
management team about different attacks

66
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,569
different threats I'm indifferent
especially large

67
00:04:04,569 --> 00:04:08,930
actionable in investigations are
underway that happens on a regular basis

68
00:04:08,930 --> 00:04:13,640
the it yeah i think thats

69
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:20,640
but subscribers is they're engaged they
know what we're doing TS

70
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:36,340
yet the question is 0 are we doing
anything about advertising especially

71
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,470
advertising

72
00:04:37,470 --> 00:04:40,850
through platforms or third-party
networks um

73
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:44,650
and the answer is yes we're doing for
its but a

74
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:47,660
our advertising strategy is is appalling
very quickly right now

75
00:04:47,660 --> 00:04:51,070
a especially in terms of platform in
figuring out a

76
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:55,460
what we're doing their help um in it
back next week is our Developers

77
00:04:55,460 --> 00:04:57,250
Conference in San Francisco where

78
00:04:57,250 --> 00:05:00,560
we'll be talking more about about
advertising in and

79
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,919
how to integrate those inside
applications we've them

80
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,760
we have a %uh something this some
measures in place to

81
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,880
especially for third-party ad networks
to identify the ad

82
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,669
and and try and find malicious once ok

83
00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:17,889
of which there have been some um but
also

84
00:05:17,889 --> 00:05:21,789
the had no our own ads and they have
networks that we work with

85
00:05:21,789 --> 00:05:26,199
are very responsive in terms of reacting
to quickly and helping us identify the

86
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,090
people behind it

87
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:31,090
wheels

88
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:36,740
will nothing really well

89
00:05:36,740 --> 00:05:43,740
but little was there when oh hell

90
00:05:57,020 --> 00:06:00,580
well the question is since we're using
US law um

91
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:04,570
to go after tax if someone's in love a
foreign country

92
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:08,440
um or the free to attack Facebook

93
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:13,920
and the answer is the answer is actually

94
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:19,760
no the it the the law and the way it's
written specifically

95
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:22,690
a takes into account specially the
california law which is but which is

96
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:23,470
very well written

97
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:27,540
takes into account the idea that the
actors may not be under the jurisdiction

98
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:30,810
love love California for instance or the
US

99
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:35,090
but I'll that doesn't preclude us

100
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:38,990
using a mechanism to make judgments
against in the

101
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:42,500
the Canadian cases actually is actually
good example Canadian

102
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:45,690
living in Canada COO

103
00:06:45,690 --> 00:06:48,970
who we soon got this judgment against um

104
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:53,960
and we actually have mechanisms to what
we have a judgment in the US to go to

105
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,830
other countries

106
00:06:54,830 --> 00:06:58,390
and have a country recognize a judgment
some some countries have trees right

107
00:06:58,390 --> 00:06:59,400
where they do that

108
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:02,870
but also in other cases where there we
don't have a treaty where

109
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:06,360
you know your example prezzo or

110
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:11,010
train is probably applicable um they're
not the entire

111
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:14,840
economic the person that we that we end
up doing is not the entire economic

112
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,230
change they need to get their money from
somewhere the need to move their money

113
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:19,050
somewhere

114
00:07:19,050 --> 00:07:22,970
and you know I don't see a lot of
families that are interested in getting

115
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:23,630
paid in

116
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:29,340
in rio's and 30 still getting paid in
dollars or Euros and there's

117
00:07:29,340 --> 00:07:33,690
there's plenty of opportunity for
judgment that's under the Zacks 2

118
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:40,690
to go after that those assets yes

119
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:45,800
the question was a.m. I also involved in
the privacy disc

120
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:49,610
me personally or trip over to you um

121
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:53,400
look at the privacy discussions going or
where a facebook and the answer is

122
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,250
absolutely yes

123
00:07:54,250 --> 00:07:58,590
ok because a.m. security and privacy on
Facebook are very strongly or twine

124
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:03,720
we can't we can't offer people privacy
around the personal information and

125
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,360
control over

126
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:07,750
less we have the security measures in
place but allow them to do that

127
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:12,090
so weeee we definitely engage

128
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:15,490
our Privacy discussions with an element
love security

129
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,720
and our security discussions are also
informed by our

130
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,760
respect to our users privacy that's
because

131
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,820
kinda it will is a more I mean

132
00:08:25,820 --> 00:08:32,820
alt

133
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:42,880
p

134
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:51,280
did

135
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:55,330
I think the the poll the phone but we
can we can actually talk

136
00:08:55,330 --> 00:08:58,580
more about others the following: point
was a that

137
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:02,360
sharing data as witches part above
potentially part of a business model

138
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:02,920
over

139
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,240
social networking site is not something
that a security

140
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,120
professional should support and I think
that

141
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,140
you know the rules for depression
professionals to think about how to do

142
00:09:14,140 --> 00:09:16,040
things in a manner that is

143
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:20,279
I'm save and respectful up the users and
I think

144
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:24,470
we have a lot of stuff to do with them
i'd my god not for to talk about that

145
00:09:24,470 --> 00:09:26,610
appear right now but we can be over but
the later

146
00:09:26,610 --> 00:09:33,610
and yes the biggest secured

147
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,580
the a I love this question the biggest
security risks

148
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:40,810
that for Facebook faces or will face and
what keeps me up at night

149
00:09:40,810 --> 00:09:44,310
um I think

150
00:09:44,310 --> 00:09:48,279
to by a large our biggest

151
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:51,950
I'm your biggest most disastrous event
will be

152
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:55,560
a a wholesale law so user data a breach
their

153
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:59,230
that doesn't actually keep me up at
night because I think we're

154
00:09:59,230 --> 00:09:59,839
we're very
