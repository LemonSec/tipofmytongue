1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,909
friendly a

2
00:00:03,909 --> 00:00:07,629
subtly you know call it something else
I'll put Total Information Awareness

3
00:00:07,629 --> 00:00:12,790
a lot like the kitten surveillance
society don't really what you want is

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:13,830
something that's sort of like

5
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:18,140
friendly and colorful something so
playful that seems harmless

6
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,960
you know something play a

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,019
because these people that are right

8
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:29,869
if you go and you look about you know
what he was the Total Information

9
00:00:29,869 --> 00:00:30,660
Awareness

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:33,420
saying that they want to do all the
things that they want a flat and dump

11
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:34,320
into one big pile

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,239
for Trinity who has done it all in fact
they had exceeded

13
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,870
what tool Information Awareness want to
do and

14
00:00:41,870 --> 00:00:44,940
if we know you know it

15
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:48,390
if there's one thing that Google is good
at its developing

16
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,000
the technology to make sense outta a
whole bunch of information

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,940
to take a whole month information
develop the profiles

18
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:59,140
and it is just it's on individual
targets and

19
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:02,850
so clearly with intent is different
right there

20
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,049
they want to do something different than
john poindexter they want to make money

21
00:01:06,049 --> 00:01:06,830
by selling

22
00:01:06,830 --> 00:01:10,000
and right but make no mistake about it
there

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,010
any the surveillance business that is
what they did

24
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:17,619
they make money by surveilling people
and so the effect is the same

25
00:01:17,619 --> 00:01:21,000
friend at the end of the day what

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,060
it was a TIA was trying to do and one
who was going to do looked

27
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:27,479
almost identical on you know that this
question me

28
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:31,049
who knows more about the citizens in
their own country hinge on your own

29
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:35,829
the dictator of North Korea or Google I
think it's probably Google

30
00:01:35,829 --> 00:01:39,549
and so why is it that people were so
scared

31
00:01:39,549 --> 00:01:43,280
a tool Information Awareness and first
so scared people like Kim Jong Il

32
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:47,100
weapons you know draconian surveillance
systems but not to go

33
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:50,700
people freaked out until Information
Awareness was announced that p people

34
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,159
don't really freaked out about the

35
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,200
more or less I would say that again it
comes under choice

36
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:59,680
that there's disorder allusion

37
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,450
a choice that you can because they don't
observe it but once again I would say

38
00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,500
that this choice

39
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,410
is it and a the choice her whether or
not he is the whole

40
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:11,870
as increase from just whether or not you
wanna miss much for me email

41
00:02:11,870 --> 00:02:15,020
to something larger and larger to the
point where it's going to

42
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:18,020
be a choice %uh whether or not the state
and society

43
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:22,500
so I was at a friends have changed that

44
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,780
what we're looking at now is technology
but also society

45
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:30,540
the to change the actual social fabric
the site and as a result

46
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:33,580
information accumulates in distant
places

47
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:36,640
and that the eavesdroppers just moved to
those

48
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,330
points the places with information is
articulating than in the past there was

49
00:02:41,330 --> 00:02:45,000
unit is really direct attacks at a
acquire information

50
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,489
things like you know the clipper chip
bread weather actually

51
00:02:48,489 --> 00:02:51,750
trying to introduce surveillance
equipment into every piece of consumer

52
00:02:51,750 --> 00:02:53,290
communications electronics

53
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:57,140
the present as much more subtle right
instead of doing that

54
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:00,670
they just moved to the few points where
this telecommunications vision

55
00:03:00,670 --> 00:03:04,269
telecommunications information actually
accumulated and the United States that's

56
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:05,230
not many places

57
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:08,700
the Rams like 64 route 611 n which is

58
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:12,890
the where the NSA has been operating a
fiber optic splitter

59
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,890
in the AT&T will constantly it's been
ruled

60
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:20,209
illegal three times that I'm still doing
the past was arrested at this little

61
00:03:20,209 --> 00:03:22,099
information awareness for the same we

62
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:25,519
are going to take all the data and put
it into one big file

63
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:29,269
and then we all mind that we want to in
the present as more saw

64
00:03:29,269 --> 00:03:34,629
that things like information tends to
accumulate

65
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:38,400
in places like cool Twitter Facebook and
that

66
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,599
the shoppers just moved to those places
that

67
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,659
it starts now with demanding but
soliciting your involvement

68
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:48,260
so when I'm thinking about the future

69
00:03:48,260 --> 00:03:52,120
the first thing but I think I would like
to would recognize and deal with

70
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:56,250
is the choices that are the choices does
not identify

71
00:03:56,250 --> 00:03:59,580
these false choices that were presented
with up whether or not you can use a

72
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:01,540
mobile phone whether or not we're going
to spin

73
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,890
Google because these things are becoming
impossible right

74
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:08,060
like what happened he decided I'm not
going to know anyone the gmail account

75
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:08,659
anymore

76
00:04:08,659 --> 00:04:12,180
red you would be cut out of the social
their would be cut out

77
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,130
society and it's nice so that we have to
acknowledge

78
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:19,500
that these choices are expanding and I
and many ways the coming

79
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,919
demands so some projects

80
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:26,970
that I've been sort of thinking about
working on and a slight our first

81
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:30,710
I've started thinking about Google Press
so what's up with what is the problem

82
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:31,610
are trying to solve

83
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:35,580
was that they were trying to flee reject
this fall choice and we say it's

84
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:36,960
actually impossible to just

85
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,530
refused to engage football what is it
that we want well

86
00:04:41,530 --> 00:04:44,729
so that the main problem is that the
house a lot of deal

87
00:04:44,729 --> 00:04:48,060
the report everything and

88
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:52,240
forever you know they have your IP
address the could be the issue

89
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:56,020
all your search requests the continent
every email you never said Morrissey

90
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:59,770
the new Zune the places you go the ATT
CP headers

91
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:04,479
on now they're collecting like real time
GPS

92
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,900
location information and also they're
now trying to get every bit as DNS

93
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:08,800
lookups did

94
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,669
so they know who your friends are thing
and where you live in a world where

95
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:17,000
you know I spend your free time and they
know how to help your love life

96
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,199
your political leanings in many ways the
information that they have

97
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:23,440
probably has a more complete picture
view that even

98
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,600
your best friend and and

99
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,729
some scary things they not no just a lot
about what you're doing but they also

100
00:05:29,729 --> 00:05:33,050
have an insight into what you're
thinking

101
00:05:33,050 --> 00:05:36,419
on and they've done really I mean course

102
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:40,130
Google PR department is you know type of
the brilliant

103
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:44,880
sorta unmatched in the world right now
and they've done a really good job hun

104
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,789
as they've received some criticism and
sort of controlling the to be

105
00:05:48,789 --> 00:05:52,430
by defining the terms right so now
they're saying

106
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:55,770
been analyzing data after nine months
what does that mean

107
00:05:55,770 --> 00:06:00,630
any the truck the last up to your IP
address after nine months

108
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:04,229
so you know what they've done is their
able to control the times right

109
00:06:04,229 --> 00:06:08,250
they define a Nana any and any

110
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:11,840
one last october your kid´s and so now
they can say oh

111
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,509
were providing honest access and

112
00:06:15,509 --> 00:06:19,080
they also have done is really clever
thing up a introducing the

113
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,069
privacy manager panel whatever and

114
00:06:23,069 --> 00:06:26,970
because they're disorder same okay now
we're giving users control

115
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:30,620
over what it is that we collect about
him but the the thing that's interesting

116
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:33,970
is that the only show you some of the
information that they should most

117
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:34,970
obviously

118
00:06:34,970 --> 00:06:38,720
have done they don't see any information
that they could very easily

119
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:43,410
poorly to you and if they you don't put
any effort into it at all

120
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:47,930
on and and almost serve most
diabolically

121
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:51,039
the required to have an account to
participate and he

122
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,620
practice at threat so suddenly if you're
interested in privacy

123
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:57,819
means you have to have a login and you
have to maintain a consistent but the

124
00:06:57,819 --> 00:06:59,280
with Google

125
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,289
which is pretty smart on their and you
know

126
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:05,780
clearly and the slipped up a little bit
you know

127
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:08,590
Eric Schmidt said that there is
something you don't want anyone to know

128
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:11,000
maybe shouldn't be doing it in the first
place

129
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,720
which was with a big mistake and so you
know these things that are happening

130
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,650
that

131
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:19,530
a have and revealed in with us a little
bit better

132
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:23,620
and if there's one thing that we learned
from the or attacks on bill

133
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:27,750
it was the they were about to set a
where they were likely and I said

134
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:31,650
there from the information we have it
seems likely that we now know

135
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:36,400
that law enforcement is running
intercept systems on people's networks

136
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:40,729
and not only that but that there are
other he suffers without legal backing

137
00:07:40,729 --> 00:07:45,259
who wanted access to the same intercept
systems and like the city

138
00:07:45,259 --> 00:07:48,569
and that as more and more information
begins to accumulate

139
00:07:48,569 --> 00:07:52,449
in his place is because the technology
that you'd rather than move there

140
00:07:52,449 --> 00:07:55,620
and even if their youth office without a
legal backing and

141
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:59,319
we know that they always went right it's
just a matter of how much

142
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:04,160
time money or effort it takes and as
more more information to these places

143
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,840
and become one more valuable which means
that it's more likely that someone is

144
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,569
going to get access to

145
00:08:09,569 --> 00:08:12,940
so the part is that I came up with two
respond to this

146
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:16,280
was a on Google share and

147
00:08:16,280 --> 00:08:19,330
the premise is that this still up the

148
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:22,629
Google choices become very large and the
so

149
00:08:22,629 --> 00:08:25,819
we need innovation that allows us to
reject this fall choice

150
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:29,629
and and also maintain anonymity while
using Google

151
00:08:29,629 --> 00:08:33,830
and which means resort to me something
anonymous access to Google services

152
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:37,289
which is both fast and reliable you can
use all time day-to-day

153
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:40,430
and to the way the people showing works
is that it's two parts it's a

154
00:08:40,430 --> 00:08:43,479
Firefox add-on and also proxy server

155
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:47,029
a that custom processor and

156
00:08:47,029 --> 00:08:50,790
that on runs in your web browser and it
watches all appear

157
00:08:50,790 --> 00:08:53,790
normal requests and

158
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:57,490
for everything that isn't Google downed

159
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:00,890
just goes straight to the Internet
that's totally unlisted

160
00:09:00,890 --> 00:09:05,360
is no performance implications you get
your fall Internet connectivity

161
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,990
if it is something that's a for a Google
service which doesn't require a long

162
00:09:08,990 --> 00:09:09,399
time

163
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:12,850
is the things like Google search Google
News Google Images

164
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:16,490
Google products a but not things like

165
00:09:16,490 --> 00:09:21,029
Google Mail or Google Checkout then it's
like in that traffic of

166
00:09:21,029 --> 00:09:24,399
strip the your the hooky from the
request

167
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:29,010
and poured it onto the bankruptcy the
sharing cock see it maintains

168
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:32,310
a pool identities where each identity

169
00:09:32,310 --> 00:09:35,330
is a cookie its then issued

170
00:09:35,330 --> 00:09:38,870
by Google as well as some unique
user-agent: Hester

171
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,200
not a situation but HTTP headers and do
the things they're sort like

172
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:45,740
fingerprinted a web browser right
user-agent header what time to make

173
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:47,810
things a lot better said second

174
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:50,880
each identity has for the unique
fingerprint

175
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:53,920
and when the request comes into the same
boxing

176
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,980
and the HTTP headers from the

177
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:00,050
plan to stripped of and headers from the
identity put up
