1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,020
that in the check it that's a be so the
same are Kyle or another archiving your

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:07,669
you are able to recover data now

3
00:00:07,669 --> 00:00:10,710
why this isn't as simple as just adding

4
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:14,519
numbers on the back files and see death
matches the archive

5
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:17,580
because that's it doesn't include
heather's

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:21,150
if you with two at the value of the fact
file

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,220
inside an archive and just at them all
together and see that matches the

8
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:28,340
process he would be still missing quite
a few fights that are attributed to the

9
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:29,390
Father itself

10
00:00:29,390 --> 00:00:34,700
so by submitting all the data and seeing
what's in between that we are able to

11
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:35,309
detect

12
00:00:35,309 --> 00:00:38,340
generically any kind of the danger
action inside

13
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:43,930
the archive itself p

14
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:47,020
and of course I fail to mention is that
a

15
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:51,550
I'm backsies and compressed size don't
really matter for some archivist who

16
00:00:51,550 --> 00:00:52,379
could have that

17
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:56,129
as a that's not a given information

18
00:00:56,129 --> 00:00:59,859
so you can't believe rely on that you
have to check the data itself

19
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:03,530
of course if we have found a corrupted
the

20
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:08,900
content we are able to salvage most the
no

21
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:13,100
be one of the most a useful features on
this engine

22
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:16,450
the besides finding hidden data is

23
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:20,250
preprocessing archives which protects
you from and

24
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:24,950
all sorts of exploits so if you come in
as the cable at saving rar

25
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:29,369
and use extension from the vet you're
sure I'm not to be exploited by

26
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:31,350
something that's not patched by the
lender

27
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:34,720
because we check you know the final in
Langton contents

28
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,390
because that was most commonly used the
trigger exploits

29
00:01:38,390 --> 00:01:41,540
in the in the

30
00:01:41,540 --> 00:01:46,070
microprocessors because if you have a
string that's longer than next battle in

31
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:46,710
those

32
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:51,790
I'm you would probably all rights and
buffer and have some sort of an exploit

33
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,200
recently that has been fixed in every
every

34
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,210
archive processor except with zip which
had

35
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:04,200
such an exploit few days ago now we look
for suspicious compression radio reach

36
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:04,570
you

37
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:08,509
so in order to check writer bombs

38
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:13,300
which are nasty we checked if the
confession Redhill matches

39
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:17,540
the actual data so if you have something
gets compressed let's say one bite

40
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,860
and it says that when it's the
compressed its four gigabytes

41
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,770
space hats forcible with information so
we

42
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:28,270
checked with this kind of attacks
because we found its

43
00:02:28,270 --> 00:02:32,480
some a group processes who try to
allocate all these great day to

44
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:36,720
and since they were were unable to they
would I just slow down a machine

45
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,739
or just breaking darling know which

46
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:45,670
forty extract a week quietness now this
doesn't need

47
00:02:45,670 --> 00:02:48,750
at these updates from plus side it's

48
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:52,030
just something 18 that generically
detective

49
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:55,230
if a piece of information is valid or
not so it's if

50
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,310
for example for WinRAR said diversion 25
is needed to

51
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,330
extra this particular file which in
North Baghdad

52
00:03:02,330 --> 00:03:05,659
visible with information so we don't
really need out there that and say

53
00:03:05,659 --> 00:03:09,390
latest versions that everything beyond
that it is a bogus

54
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:12,500
info we

55
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:17,129
be found that some Texan tempering is
possible which prevents some software

56
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:20,760
when there's decompressing the archive
if we talk about this zip

57
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:24,129
its has a central your to record in the
local one

58
00:03:24,129 --> 00:03:27,560
and if that the doesn't match the
something is all

59
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:32,000
and that the way this works is that some
vendors use the central directory

60
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,890
information to the compressed data and
some local so you can have

61
00:03:36,890 --> 00:03:40,760
an archive which is which was able to
which is able to do

62
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,459
which is acceptable by some programs but

63
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:48,099
not by others because they're using
different points of reference

64
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:51,440
of course being here some

65
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,200
stuff you can do to let's say the
archive

66
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,220
splits you let's see 21 units when it
doesn't

67
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:03,110
we also check for that which act for

68
00:04:03,110 --> 00:04:06,730
and this interesting file in triplicate
Asian because nowhere in the specs it

69
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:11,129
says you can't have two files with the
same name and extension in the archive

70
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:14,370
yes arco programs that will not serve

71
00:04:14,370 --> 00:04:17,959
enable you to do that but nothing stops
you from creating such an archive

72
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:21,859
so if you have a tool that is basically
come on line in use send it to you

73
00:04:21,859 --> 00:04:24,910
I will overwrite the file I found sold
for

74
00:04:24,910 --> 00:04:29,240
first file will be all written by the
second one which is deprecated

75
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,639
and we do all sorts of the

76
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:36,880
have their checks just to make sure that
everything you see is according to his

77
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,800
back but not only according to spec

78
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,880
what we have seen that works in the wild
as well

79
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,009
you can now for every exploiting

80
00:04:46,009 --> 00:04:49,800
or gonna bleep you find we provide
detailed description

81
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,520
we the to late to our advisory which you
can read and see how

82
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,330
to exploit bricks now we come to the
demo of our engine

83
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,780
we feel s the next engine

84
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:05,850
own some larvae essays and

85
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:09,590
we deal test this wrong mistaken
implementation

86
00:05:09,590 --> 00:05:13,870
and we will show how to recover lead-up
so if you cannot see this but you have a

87
00:05:13,870 --> 00:05:16,900
lot of it from the you can go to you
tube dot com slash

88
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,990
reversing lives in cádiz video

89
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:26,990
weather

90
00:05:35,050 --> 00:05:38,660
so first thing we want to do is we gonna
use

91
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,680
couple files to create the zip archive

92
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:46,900
so missus

93
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:50,220
did like this you know professor my good
friends here

94
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:54,160
US the park I it doesn't matter which
processes

95
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,990
process who use say this

96
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:02,910
should work fine and there we have as
the park I that only campaigns

97
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:07,770
that particular image now if we use take
another fee

98
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:11,070
tools for you we talked about earlier so
one of them

99
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:14,660
which seems to work best is

100
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:18,530
in exhibits technology agreement on

101
00:06:18,530 --> 00:06:21,919
so if you were to open such file which
just

102
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:28,919
me that

103
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:44,190
your bpm we open it and it only has one

104
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:47,330
far let's my good friend and we will a

105
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:50,340
at couple more for also let at

106
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:54,470
next segment Asian and let's just at it
as a hidden file

107
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:58,770
17 under File which is let's say the
smaller

108
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:02,240
which is Conficker simple p

109
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:09,240
and by saving changes

110
00:07:10,350 --> 00:07:13,680
we have successfully created an archive
which contains hidden content

111
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,250
we can moan about and I believe this
just by hoping I can see

112
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:21,110
tell me what from there and then we can
open the same

113
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:24,330
archive with the program again to see if
it's

114
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:30,720
able to reverse process so we just
opened

115
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,950
snuggle and as you see

116
00:07:35,950 --> 00:07:40,870
there's a visible file called pgp unit
Jeff Beck

117
00:07:40,870 --> 00:07:44,940
and to other hidden files inside the
archive I'm gonna show you how that

118
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:45,590
looks like

119
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:51,230
and hex editor so the bank itself

120
00:07:51,230 --> 00:07:58,230
is visible but everything else isn't so

121
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:02,220
become to look at the end it only has

122
00:08:02,220 --> 00:08:05,500
one particular entries keep but if the
goal

123
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:09,530
a in reverse and see this all the time

124
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:12,700
just search from beginning 4pk signature

125
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,730
x1 stake

126
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:22,730
mistake

127
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,910
okay I think we funded yet and as we've
seen

128
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:31,030
and there's another local Heather

129
00:08:31,030 --> 00:08:37,380
which hole contains more overdone been
and that particular data is stored

130
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:40,520
just behind the first compressed file
which is gonna be and

131
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:43,979
at the central drip directory so it's
only jected

132
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:48,120
and let's see how this single file

133
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,160
is process we

134
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:58,160
are an extension

135
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:11,670
to his couple parameters first one
scammed archive itself

136
00:09:11,670 --> 00:09:15,300
see what's in it and as you see there's
a lot to be a

137
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:19,550
so what we found as we hope only have
one report profile

138
00:09:19,550 --> 00:09:22,760
so total number files is one that still
kills it

139
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:26,730
but we detected someone abilities that's
we detected the possible attack that the

140
00:09:26,730 --> 00:09:28,690
presence of non-standard Heather data

141
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:34,170
that's an Dixfield modification the
possible inability to different eating

142
00:09:34,170 --> 00:09:36,290
local and central directory entries

143
00:09:36,290 --> 00:09:40,070
and by doing a detailed inspection for
steganography content

144
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:45,110
we found the following we found re
detected file on reported by the archive

145
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:45,570
Heather

146
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:48,820
it starts at that particular of sites we
can go there in

147
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:50,800
the Exeter and see how it looks like
