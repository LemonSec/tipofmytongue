1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,470
up people were succeeding at this where
where

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:07,029
there may be something we're we're
before Phil Turner correctly and

3
00:00:07,029 --> 00:00:10,840
weekend a lot of information that way as
an example love a

4
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,839
early detection that you can have on
them on individuals

5
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:18,260
summers individuals that we found we've
never approach we just identified them

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:19,470
internally and they have

7
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:23,100
figured out oh these are some other
people who are writing and selling

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,480
scripts against us

9
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,420
and and ultimately you know if we need
to which we can take action against

10
00:00:28,420 --> 00:00:33,510
so the collection accounts

11
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:37,160
mean the everyone knows really get the
fits all its official I'm

12
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,649
be so we've gotten into you are told his
group has gotten into

13
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:45,719
the fish economy has done things like
seated bad list so

14
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:49,010
will just hand out lists abusers to to
people

15
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:52,140
a and know that anyone that goes to any
of these accounts

16
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:55,520
is getting it off the list because
you're not really counts and that was

17
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,670
for getting information about what
they're trying to do

18
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:01,640
and and who's using those accounts we've
also

19
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:05,250
just bought lists and wholesale on

20
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:09,360
deactivated all the users on list
telling them they need to change their

21
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:10,110
passwords

22
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,119
so that we can validate the value of the
list

23
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:19,360
the

24
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,470
and

25
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:25,850
we put some systems that to pay a lot of
attention to

26
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:30,579
the URL formation or people's
interactions with the site

27
00:01:30,579 --> 00:01:34,900
and this is actually the benefits of us
being such a fast moving company is that

28
00:01:34,900 --> 00:01:38,270
stuff changes all the time the interface
points change the data changes the

29
00:01:38,270 --> 00:01:39,270
cookies change

30
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:43,329
everything changes lot so someone writes
a PC software

31
00:01:43,329 --> 00:01:47,060
30 they're gonna have to invest a ton of
time keeping up with all the changes

32
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:50,020
we're making a site in the interface is
in order to

33
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:53,409
a make it continue to look as a real
user

34
00:01:53,409 --> 00:01:57,020
or they're not going to which is your
typical what happens

35
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:01,790
and then we can start identifying a
information about oh this particular

36
00:02:01,790 --> 00:02:03,100
euros being called

37
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:07,100
is based on the way we used to call it
three weeks ago so this is clearly a

38
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:07,750
script

39
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:12,230
and it happens to be similar coming from
all these different places so it's

40
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:13,500
probably the same script

41
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:16,620
let's start attributing that and
figuring out who

42
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:21,220
who wrote this and and why um its

43
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:25,030
the it's definitely a benefit to the
fact we will surpass religious I think

44
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:25,620
if you had a

45
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:30,900
more less dynamic developing a farmer
you may not be able to get quite as much

46
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:32,780
information as we do but we're actually

47
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:36,379
free free able to replicate those people
and

48
00:02:36,379 --> 00:02:40,090
obviously when they're performing the
attack I'm

49
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:43,510
the

50
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:47,519
automated systems I talked about earlier
kick into play and start

51
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,000
automatically identifying attacks and
actors and potential

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,660
individuals were doing it for us a

53
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:58,840
in the user's give us a lot of
information about the spam with

54
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:02,819
if a bunch of users report particular
messages as spam again the automated

55
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:04,040
system just right for you know

56
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:08,700
rushing yards some I'm aware of time and
i want to make sure we have a Q+A

57
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:09,569
session so

58
00:03:09,569 --> 00:03:15,500
apologize for that been

59
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:20,050
so some at this point after the tackles
are seeing

60
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:23,950
messages coming down will would if we go
after what the target is if they're

61
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:25,830
going after malware will go get them out
where

62
00:03:25,830 --> 00:03:29,819
reverse engineer will submit it pretty
quickly to anti-virus people that we

63
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:30,489
work with

64
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:33,530
will look at what is trying to do to see
if it's something that

65
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:36,830
that ultimately targets us again or for
goes after another organization

66
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:40,670
if it does we'll talk to the other
organization and and pass it on to them

67
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:44,200
I'm benefits affiliate marketing where
they're going to

68
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:48,470
redirection cites her other sites will
get this taken down within

69
00:03:48,470 --> 00:03:51,879
within a couple hours so the time window
for for

70
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:56,409
having people see the messages and then
react on them is actually

71
00:03:56,409 --> 00:03:59,250
very very small because we're already
were moving messages by the time we're

72
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:01,409
removing the domain semesters point2

73
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:06,110
and then finally there's some

74
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:11,230
the money the and risley the can-spam
act was was

75
00:04:11,230 --> 00:04:14,590
modified so that if people are are

76
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:17,590
being affiliate marketers and are
directing people back to their marketing

77
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,120
sites

78
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,870
that the ultimate marketing site is
responsible for the actions the

79
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:22,550
affiliate

80
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:26,699
and that's been very helpful for us
because if we know ultimately they're

81
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:27,389
selling

82
00:04:27,389 --> 00:04:31,000
something we go to the company that
selling it and say

83
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,130
we have evidence that the that there's
statutory spamming your marketing

84
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:38,030
if you don't give us information about
your getting this money to for these

85
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:39,240
particular towns

86
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,500
we can hold you liable they generally
are willing to turn over those people

87
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,440
pretty quickly

88
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,180
the which means even after all that the
investment up the

89
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,520
counts software the attack the

90
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,930
a hiding their tracks and everything
ultimately they're not to get their

91
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:56,490
track

92
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:00,750
which is pretty destructive to the
economic 6 p.m.

93
00:05:00,750 --> 00:05:04,000
and when we find them they're still
gonna be liable under with the can-spam

94
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:04,570
Act

95
00:05:04,570 --> 00:05:08,910
so know the kid can actually reduce your
summer

96
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:11,990
information about different different
suits that we pursued

97
00:05:11,990 --> 00:05:16,389
we've actually got dozens up these types
of shoots lined up

98
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:19,460
and word is pursuing them thing about
our leisure

99
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:22,960
up this was what was our first speaker

100
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,080
spam lawsuit I think this is still
remains the largest can-spam judgment

101
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,330
ever

102
00:05:27,330 --> 00:05:31,120
the statutory damages on this we're
about 1.3 billion

103
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,500
and the judge thought that was excessive
so

104
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,490
the prudential much more reasonable
number 870 million

105
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:44,600
a if it this is against a an individual
who was in

106
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,440
is in Canada and you may think well if
you have a US judge wanna get someone in

107
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,150
Canada that's really not that useful for
you

108
00:05:52,150 --> 00:05:56,870
up but in fact it is because it means
that any asset to go through the United

109
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:57,610
States we have

110
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:02,370
we have a claim to it so even if we can
actually go after this person's money in

111
00:06:02,370 --> 00:06:05,319
Canada which there are there are
mechanisms which we could but

112
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:08,979
if we can get the money in Canada means
that no one in the US

113
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:12,319
no affiliate marketer no a

114
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:15,850
business that he can pay can move from
money through the US without us

115
00:06:15,850 --> 00:06:20,690
be able to to attach to it so it makes
the cost of doing business in the US

116
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:25,919
much more prohibitive for and able to
just spamming since I'm

117
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,680
the reason we gotta Sanford Wallace
judgment

118
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,699
which was smaller I think it was only
about seven hundred and something

119
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:33,650
million

120
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:36,650
I'll we have statutory damages in that
case

121
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,880
up seven billion dollars which in church

122
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:43,949
also felt was a bit excessive and

123
00:06:43,949 --> 00:06:47,620
he he produced as much as he could and
where we have multiple counts he only

124
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,669
counted one

125
00:06:48,669 --> 00:06:51,280
any store ended up with a much more
reasonable number of seven hundred

126
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,210
million dollars

127
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:56,880
in that case also though which is which
is interesting is

128
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,970
because the can-spam Act has both civil
and criminal penalties

129
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:05,349
a.m. the judge ordered withdrawals not
interact with Facebook during the trial

130
00:07:05,349 --> 00:07:08,789
and two she's any any spare me activity

131
00:07:08,789 --> 00:07:12,740
as defined by the can-spam Act which he
didn't do

132
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:17,990
so there's there's a pending criminal
case against him now because about

133
00:07:17,990 --> 00:07:21,530
which would be interesting and i cant

134
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:24,699
the okay

135
00:07:24,699 --> 00:07:28,240
so kill your time not not well

136
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:34,870
was terrific um so what types of things
that I just say

137
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,220
got the pyramid a gettable abilities and
threats attacks

138
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,970
an actor's your highest leverage

139
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:45,690
actions in this point is to go after the
actors in our belief

140
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:49,190
the you know vulnerabilities and threats
all abilities are endless

141
00:07:49,190 --> 00:07:52,699
threats to keep an eye on because report
but don't don't admire them

142
00:07:52,699 --> 00:07:55,990
and really famous to your attention to
the attacks because that we can gather

143
00:07:55,990 --> 00:07:57,620
intelligence about

144
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:01,949
a getting to get your foot in the door
is to just a whole chain of you attack

145
00:08:01,949 --> 00:08:02,419
you

146
00:08:02,419 --> 00:08:06,889
and then eventually identify the actors
and hounded them

147
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:12,910
keep after them and and destroyer
economics

148
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:16,160
but really I think this live says
dollars to

149
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,849
that's what I think we do and things
that may help you is gather lots lots of

150
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:22,150
intelligence

151
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:26,099
disrupt people when they're attacking
you

152
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:29,680
use your loss wherever you can and be

153
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,880
innovative about using them and don't
rely necessarily on law enforcement to

154
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,099
take a release rates for you

155
00:08:36,099 --> 00:08:39,250
the stay out of the complaints mindset
because

156
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:43,459
policies and compliance while helpful
are not going to help you

157
00:08:43,459 --> 00:08:46,480
really defend against the bad guys

158
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:51,410
who you identify and go after hound them
as much as you can

159
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:54,360
because that's the highest leverage
action that you can change against

160
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:55,600
attacks

161
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,390
that ultimately remember that your
interest in the user's interests should

162
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,459
be allowed

163
00:09:00,459 --> 00:09:03,620
and they are aligned in terms your

164
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:08,620
security apparatus protecting them

165
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:13,130
the finally after all these axioms
here's one that's really important

166
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:16,320
sometimes just do what you have to do
and forget the rules forget the

167
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:17,709
compliance

168
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:20,649
because the other side doesn't have to
comply with anything they can do

169
00:09:20,649 --> 00:09:22,540
whatever they want

170
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:28,300
and sometimes are going to have to to

171
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:31,600
okay and butt sluts

172
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,970
the questions now very questions bases

173
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:41,970
one way in the back

174
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:56,270
well

175
00:09:56,270 --> 00:09:58,210
with if it
