1
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:13,850
my name is so nice and it's like I'm
from Greece

2
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:17,750
so sensitive not been secured the group
a doctor's permission technology

3
00:00:17,750 --> 00:00:21,350
and I'm also doing my beats the apps UPS
University

4
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:25,070
you know go them at the day's topic

5
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:28,920
would be able discussion describing and
a thoughtful that's capable of

6
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:31,030
compromising the security bro fight

7
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:35,350
well for wireless sensor network its
basic functionalities

8
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,410
EP would awesome on opening of the
section on doctor

9
00:00:38,410 --> 00:00:43,690
actually slifer and most importantly the
ability to launch bodies kinds of bucks

10
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:47,790
against this network's what's one more
important characteristics that you can

11
00:00:47,790 --> 00:00:49,100
be applied to

12
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:52,620
differences were fun with us from swatch
into reportable

13
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,559
but before we describe the school we are
going to talk with about the field in

14
00:00:57,559 --> 00:00:58,409
back on the door

15
00:00:58,409 --> 00:01:02,260
so we're going to talk about some other
good services networks but can be

16
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:03,650
exploited by and i cant

17
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:08,290
and we will describe all the doctor but
don't want to pick up some way up to

18
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:11,670
and actually used in order to extract
important

19
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,729
met with information about its
functionality

20
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:17,760
know the addition such stop and the

21
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,770
also since hopefully the

22
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:24,570
drive tool to do a last name of the dude
okay we'll see

23
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:28,210
I have a toy network with you so we'll
see what the

24
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:33,140
is this a top of the store network
official first before starting with a

25
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:35,439
brief overview of 12 social networks

26
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:39,079
the whole many of you know about this
kind of networks

27
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:42,640
he saw clearly Wireless is from old

28
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,350
is in an embedded system it with the
microcontroller development and the bus

29
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,450
today the United

30
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:52,310
yes you can see the figure because all
of the components will fit the pic on

31
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:53,280
embedded system

32
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,189
the different stuff over here on the
sensors and actuators

33
00:01:57,189 --> 00:02:01,380
which are actually Conklin form ongoing
and not the good of interest in a

34
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:02,390
specific area and

35
00:02:02,390 --> 00:02:08,670
the corresponding colors for funding the
fence coming from the central what he

36
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,649
sees the energy

37
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:13,400
is not one of the strong gospic
substantial knowledge agreement with the

38
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:14,660
case went out to go

39
00:02:14,660 --> 00:02:18,640
underlying protocols our daily lives
when conventional memory Invenergy

40
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:22,810
you sold the most of the times these are
all time low carb devices

41
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:26,370
okay you can see some some food

42
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,390
public blossoms word using the third one

43
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:33,490
school team on skype we chose this
article critique some

44
00:02:33,490 --> 00:02:37,400
actually because this is the talk with a
marxist my universe that they will be

45
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:37,920
here

46
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,990
now work with a concept

47
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:44,970
of successful no two will deploy them
not serious of interest income but one

48
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,830
decision at work which is able to SoCal
figures if

49
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:51,290
and adopt to different kind of changing

50
00:02:51,290 --> 00:02:54,580
this is really important because usually
would deploy system os

51
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:58,170
the Sun deployed to follow since and do
something that is above not easily

52
00:02:58,170 --> 00:02:58,950
accessed

53
00:02:58,950 --> 00:03:02,070
my few months so we need them

54
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:05,620
once deployed to be able to configure
the same stop to it working

55
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:08,790
and actually adopting vitamins and
teases motifs

56
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:12,460
and pissed off intentional communication
with health

57
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:16,410
mood hope I'm into one communication
between the nodes

58
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:21,240
in touch with a local SBA more than one
of for communication between the North's

59
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:24,610
and the destination which actually the
base this before so we promise

60
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:25,320
networking

61
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:29,010
example application Sharda smart grid

62
00:03:29,010 --> 00:03:32,080
sense from a crush on the really used in
the military

63
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:37,960
special another base wiki and didn't
think a wildlife for structural health

64
00:03:37,960 --> 00:03:41,720
building one drink and old age that
strengthen social networks

65
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:45,580
days the using them in combination with
ought to fight these

66
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:48,870
in order to build the so-called smart
environment

67
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:54,430
smart homes much fifty's the last think

68
00:03:54,430 --> 00:03:59,940
use a why social networks are good for
us okay first performed I think the most

69
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,740
important is because with a relatively
small amount of money

70
00:04:02,740 --> 00:04:05,910
she's most commercial notes are to be

71
00:04:05,910 --> 00:04:09,250
we can go over lots head of
international interest

72
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:12,510
and more including a number of a of a
huge through vents

73
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:16,180
physical she did to be a really robust
against North link fails

74
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:20,090
because once we said recover mesh
networking so even if an old

75
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:24,350
phase know what was being out there not
just of from another note to the base

76
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:24,880
station

77
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,539
can finally as user

78
00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:31,730
can have access to the data inside the
network from wherever she wants

79
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:36,060
it's not necessary to be close to the
network would be so special that will

80
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:38,280
support the credential did for depicting
plus

81
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,850
like a duck and complications become
provides Florida

82
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:46,370
then special striking in order to
identify and Mon began moving object

83
00:04:46,370 --> 00:04:50,270
and also even in the case of an orange
but you should not amount of data

84
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:54,670
that out look of our group but on inside
the nose but provides information

85
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,180
integration and other one

86
00:04:56,180 --> 00:04:59,730
station peaceful this was

87
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:03,460
the the overview the center networks so
let's move on

88
00:05:03,460 --> 00:05:06,940
to the theory behind the food official
actually first

89
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:10,250
with the sky the security challenges of
this network

90
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:13,300
if they're not a good summer they ought
to be the most important with unexploded

91
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,360
buy that bike if

92
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:18,550
O'Keefe s the votes in Seoul and

93
00:05:18,550 --> 00:05:22,820
or transmission something wirelessly you
got exposed for bucks likes

94
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,700
eavesdropping interception alteration or
deeply about the

95
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,830
and injections of money just like its
called injection

96
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:33,190
week essential molds are the most

97
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:37,530
usually operate in another department so
again that exposed fiscal up actually

98
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:39,370
can be seen compromised by now if I
could

99
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:44,139
with all them to see the actual known
about it now when we deploy since when a

100
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:44,740
group

101
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:48,180
again most of the times we don't have
any problem on its

102
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,139
of that the portage so it's totally
random again this can be used by a

103
00:05:52,139 --> 00:05:53,100
specially

104
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:57,200
because it contains the positional the
nose and factually leave

105
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:01,889
and many of the network empty so there
will be a possible communication between

106
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:03,180
something which

107
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,000
besides he said to finally talk to
protect them

108
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,240
against the inside a box gay because
once deployed and I'd like to go there

109
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,290
to a compromise in order used to just
like they won't be able to deduct

110
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:19,820
for gaining access into the needs memory
key

111
00:06:19,820 --> 00:06:23,430
V Scarlets to post modification of

112
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:27,180
memo recalled wanna believe this weekly
which in turn can lead to attacks like

113
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:31,300
board's action

114
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:35,190
so Harvick all these things in mind the
research community what the dude is the

115
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,630
proposed several defense mechanism

116
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:43,360
okay but try to prevent and protect this
networks however to get specific a touch

117
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,639
do but the smoking of every day is a new
day for that I cancel there are always

118
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,139
new kinds fucks

119
00:06:49,139 --> 00:06:52,889
the existing affectionate everyday
shopping with a different and better way

120
00:06:52,889 --> 00:06:57,730
so secure the course always exist so
that's why they moved one step further

121
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:01,600
movie started to implement intrusion
detection protocols

122
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:06,050
which actually don't prevent that talks
from taking place

123
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:09,060
the village them popping $1 billion type
montel

124
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:13,190
abnormalities you the network
functionality shoeless I could find

125
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:14,720
something is wrong

126
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,980
King however both police megan is

127
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,550
you move more movies megan's by 75
degrees

128
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:24,560
post to the next level for this Yazdi by

129
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:28,860
they are not be too for the doc inside
the metal p

130
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:33,210
show what we've done first before you
that we can be made to sniff n

131
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:36,410
for capturing and holding all these data
not available

132
00:07:36,410 --> 00:07:40,639
in a sensor network show we overhear the
network traffic

133
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,090
key we've got really wanted it we'll all
get and

134
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:47,470
we then who tried to process all over
the transmitted by kids in order to

135
00:07:47,470 --> 00:07:48,210
extract

136
00:07:48,210 --> 00:07:52,300
important information about the network
no chain uses

137
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:57,050
looking Sohag on the sniffer can be used
in order to compromise the security of a

138
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,370
social network

139
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:02,590
official phone the and i cant use

140
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:07,060
the Cardiff frequency in order to Lowes
aside time to talk

141
00:08:07,060 --> 00:08:11,380
and try to identify the network
underlying social hard work

142
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:15,260
showing up talkin can use either
spectrum analyzer

143
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:19,639
or different special hardware attached
to the love to run the ball

144
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:22,720
like in this case you like without
substantial note

145
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,389
do so and then she can find the
communication frequency used to the

146
00:08:26,389 --> 00:08:27,600
network

147
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:32,130
once a disk or words of key scenes
commercial notes you specifically which

148
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:32,579
is

149
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:36,760
to communicate she commanded then what
is that the manpower

150
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:40,279
and then she can use all the political
abilities but I used

151
00:08:40,279 --> 00:08:43,380
with this specific on work

152
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:47,069
second think is love by observing the
mission's rate inside

153
00:08:47,069 --> 00:08:50,249
up in size inside this social network

154
00:08:50,249 --> 00:08:52,889
you saw this going to be an important
information about the network

155
00:08:52,889 --> 00:08:54,180
publication

156
