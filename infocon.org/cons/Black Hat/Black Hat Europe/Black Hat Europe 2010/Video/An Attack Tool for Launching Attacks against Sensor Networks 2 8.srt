1
00:00:01,160 --> 00:00:03,370
so once we got through such markets

2
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:07,210
people come home marxist to the rock
bottom but is using the network

3
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:11,010
okay so this enables the seafront to
construct the

4
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:14,740
apology of all over good mods will see
that in the pool

5
00:00:14,740 --> 00:00:18,470
and the finally he can use the solving
problem

6
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:22,199
in order to trace esteem mess at the
spot for the sort

7
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:25,310
because whenever an essential network we
use

8
00:00:25,310 --> 00:00:29,470
multiple problem for the court all of
the messages of sent through this bottle

9
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:33,250
so love the messages key on cots
available for more genetic

10
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:36,399
you to call mister that's fun by that of
the protocol

11
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,629
be so we can trace this three movements
spoke to the event

12
00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:46,879
okie soul

13
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,110
to by gulfstream

14
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:54,320
beta index of information like the with
visited the previous life

15
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,480
week on launch again revised

16
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:01,840
kinda bus number for talks so that's a
good to fine for wireless network

17
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,269
walking distance from it which is
exactly the same also wired network

18
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:08,909
so we possible for this you'll get
fucked you not them to intercept private

19
00:01:08,909 --> 00:01:09,850
information

20
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:13,960
sent over the wireless medium K
eavesdropping but the place in it for

21
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:14,500
warding

22
00:01:14,500 --> 00:01:17,600
week of integrity of talks sent

23
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,729
for stock a range like program which the
nation

24
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:25,189
but the injection and malicious code
detection he met with addiction

25
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:28,210
and finally will help over lobby get
fucked

26
00:01:28,210 --> 00:01:33,110
try to impede the body of why this
message is to be flexible about

27
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:36,840
which is really important and kind of
like the park now all of the sudden

28
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,610
talks are supported by the kind of
vision of the

29
00:01:39,610 --> 00:01:42,649
to and the will be explained and
demonstrated

30
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:48,670
hopefully later on now a few words about
the

31
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:52,220
the global network back up over here
gave

32
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,820
to listen to just to try to show you

33
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,920
how the fuck can watch against its
networks

34
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,119
great so the special blushing what we
used

35
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:05,570
us we said that's that the mortgage guy
you this is a picture

36
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:10,009
and I don't know maybe what will you
don't see the with your book to

37
00:02:10,009 --> 00:02:13,270
key so these are the kind of to destroy
this possible

38
00:02:13,270 --> 00:02:18,050
it was created by a company named gospel
we talk cheerleading always close to be

39
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:19,879
named for sho thorson dealer

40
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:24,239
them all the most important thing that
you have to keep in mind for a date on

41
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,650
when we talk about the

42
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:29,190
recorded six in a box is out the the
mold

43
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:34,140
uses Themis before 30 microcontroller
which is based on the phone I'm optics

44
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:38,569
d morning on a pictures good

45
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:43,629
memory and doctor and memory program
memory said the same other space

46
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:47,830
key so you can actually move the program
go out and execute

47
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:51,590
colds but the story was not a member
which is important

48
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:55,800
now the program

49
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,610
and the store applications the
certification with bike up on this

50
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:02,909
social knowledge gig you know who's who

51
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:07,099
but they are widely used the universe is
forty-six but the

52
00:03:07,099 --> 00:03:11,170
very simply the first one is called
Delta and it's actually a mood cooked up

53
00:03:11,170 --> 00:03:12,510
a collection of occasions

54
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:15,810
case devices some for their internal
temperature sensor

55
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:20,360
and said fuck leading to the base
station key through remote hope the

56
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,970
I'll compile week of the skills
competition which actually

57
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,220
similar to the Delta but the difference
is that the chances

58
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,720
all of the sensor on the tumult sky key
know it will cover

59
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:34,849
as you can see seven times form on going
to me to do

60
00:03:34,849 --> 00:03:38,209
was to what thats and all the stuff and
then the

61
00:03:38,209 --> 00:03:42,010
connects then it's on the readings in
the game brought him to the

62
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:45,629
base station and finally we have some

63
00:03:45,629 --> 00:03:49,099
and exploits for demonstrating malware
detection

64
00:03:49,099 --> 00:03:53,939
K again the such implementations we'd
seen visually cover

65
00:03:53,939 --> 00:03:57,200
vulnerability in order to be able to do
an overflow

66
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:04,040
to show the recorded section occasional
know the

67
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:08,250
this was a theory was the boring stuff
let's move to the interesting part with

68
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,170
some that talks

69
00:04:09,170 --> 00:04:13,799
became that special fall

70
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:18,530
the what motivated us used to be such a
good

71
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:22,350
by compromising the social network
security the

72
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:25,250
our goal was to reveal all the while
it's not working on and I've been at

73
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:26,470
this for this kind of mental

74
00:04:26,470 --> 00:04:32,160
because nowadays when the the only try
to find the killer application for this

75
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:34,320
networks in order to be able to

76
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:38,220
to send them but looking for little blue

77
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,680
work with the security stuff for this
kind of network so emotionally wish to

78
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:43,660
describe a

79
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:47,680
even better waste to perform existing
the talks for the

80
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,440
like another language protocols and also
study the effects

81
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,060
okay and demonstrate the impact this all
their operating

82
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:58,240
and those with us a good way for a an A

83
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,020
I can look dumb stuff with more than a
touch to try and fix their effectiveness

84
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:05,960
be against the area mess which should
generally

85
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:09,039
the by publishing such a good

86
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,840
we we schools to apply to the weaknesses
of all the protocols

87
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:15,850
but the widely used in the research
community okay

88
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:19,750
actual we think that by highlighting the
need to come up with more efficient

89
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:22,250
security protocols we will actually
motivates

90
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:26,789
be very sensitive to start actually
implemented K and the

91
00:05:26,789 --> 00:05:30,759
one more thing because it's fun and you
can do it

92
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:34,410
and especially when you go to conference
in places where you see you

93
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:37,759
people with sensor networks trying to
demonstrate their

94
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,990
old purification continue if you ask
them but they did secure

95
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:46,660
the OC did then you do that by accident

96
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:50,199
everything falls apart

97
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:53,340
so here you can see that picture layout

98
00:05:53,340 --> 00:06:00,340
of that fact alone

99
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,760
going and sold

100
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,790
uses an intelligent component-based
system K

101
00:06:06,790 --> 00:06:10,070
the cost component as you can see is the
network sniffer

102
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:13,820
key for possum ongoing looking before
read your bike its

103
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:17,060
so traffic analysis or and if I could be
called the

104
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,240
recording can be done either you
real-time where did you overhear the

105
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:20,940
Methodist

106
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:25,000
or offline through the demanded by good
description database

107
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,330
but with helping the network sniffer
week of the network key component

108
00:06:29,330 --> 00:06:32,610
which is the main component of the plan
provides a number of auctions

109
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:36,090
for compromising this instrument which
triggered the profile

110
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:39,620
and finally we have the network
visualization component which actually

111
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:40,790
the good football

112
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:44,040
before displaying to the overhead
network topology

113
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:48,280
all of the messages without a cup by the
sniffer in all states

114
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,210
and stop the suffering up talks about
the pic missions are in progress for a

115
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:52,930
minute biker

116
00:06:52,930 --> 00:06:58,100
no let's start with the network sniffer

117
00:06:58,100 --> 00:07:02,120
working you do realize from transmission
love comes

118
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:06,360
within the range of them then all the
central part with some thoughts

119
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:10,090
to the tune occasional conceptually

120
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:13,550
the it consists of the local I couldn't
be more true

121
00:07:13,550 --> 00:07:16,860
which is responsible for governing
followed other

122
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:20,930
before Ward over the over the sea import
to the bike store on wood

123
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:24,600
Madrid for logging of the messages
without us

124
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:28,190
forced diesel vs let us for the

125
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:31,440
off-line analysis of all the pockets

126
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,540
lot of cops out by the pool no

127
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:39,100
let's talk about with what they will do
data so all the data

128
00:07:39,100 --> 00:07:43,510
on again naturally all the transmissions
but come from all the notebook computer

129
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,180
here

130
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:47,680
by the internal call that we use without
called be

131
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:51,560
solve this can be collected by mission
promiscuously board member at Nordstroms

132
00:07:51,560 --> 00:07:52,100
missions

133
00:07:52,100 --> 00:07:56,790
what permissions mean is that the once
in old EC now reigns

134
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:59,930
key week of June she's the

135
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:03,940
transmission independent of the
destination ID for the mistype

136
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:07,580
what they fifty cents for he received
we've got something we looked

137
00:08:07,580 --> 00:08:11,250
whole ones if I could

138
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:15,030
his cup by the sniffer also went to the
timestamp

139
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:18,150
good in order to be able to to give the

140
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:22,290
the the possibility that I get to do
something based on issues

141
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:25,290
offered up and now when Nancy for

142
00:08:25,290 --> 00:08:29,620
cause a pocket what we need is a is a
smart way

143
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:33,330
let's try to decode be spiked I that if
they're interested

144
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:37,670
or not that's why what we've done we
have created the parking description:

145
00:08:37,670 --> 00:08:38,540
database

146
00:08:38,540 --> 00:08:41,860
which contains unabated miss
instructions key

147
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:46,070
for the most widely used publication
messages and other like because

148
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:49,880
officially not case the park in the
colder

149
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:54,010
continues all of this message structure
in order to the court to go to the

150
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,550
over-fifty like a failed

151
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:59,190
issue and it gives boxer so that I can
production siege

152
00:08:59,190 --> 00:09:03,380
of the over the bike its but even in the
case

153
00:09:03,380 --> 00:09:08,620
but will you receive a message that we
don't know the structural problem the

154
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:12,400
you spawn not like a description
database again week of troops we'll all

155
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:12,930
get

156
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:16,630
but we don't see as we don't know the
structural dimensions would just give

157
00:09:16,630 --> 00:09:18,310
much so that I could be the payload

158
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:22,390
us add to the budget revision of the
payload but again it's like a connection

159
00:09:22,390 --> 00:09:24,280
to change the paintings the bites

160
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:29,320
in the kenneth was needed so what they
were going to messages sent when it was

161
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,050
through a network

162
00:09:30,050 --> 00:09:33,230
we can come true so this is important
because

163
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:36,650
the okay there are some really

164
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:39,880
do when no network application so we
northern missus and

165
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,830
the other night broken shoulder and
pulled inside the bike a description of

166
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:43,360
the base

167
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,650
but we don't know everything sure
whenever we go to admit we we spoke of

168
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:48,700
boxes to the other

169
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:53,640
trust we feed so the configuration of
the spark a discussion with a base with

170
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,930
its really simplistic

171
00:09:54,930 --> 00:09:58,420
it takes in the loop so when you gone
but the takes

172
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,900
that dude big the source code
