1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:03,989
and his last month but and fellow

2
00:00:03,989 --> 00:00:07,420
Institute prospective studies and on top

3
00:00:07,420 --> 00:00:11,510
with about 20 today thanks for

4
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,580
coming in sticking around as the last of
the in the to

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:19,019
on this so China last much and

6
00:00:19,019 --> 00:00:22,619
but i wanna talk some generally about
privacy

7
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:25,619
and those trends as well as

8
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:28,720
and maybe talk a little bit more
specifically a few

9
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,020
project I'm working on that i've seen
people work ends well

10
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:35,670
and so I guess what I like to be a star

11
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,579
looking into the past talking about the

12
00:00:39,579 --> 00:00:42,929
threats that he saw previously the

13
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:46,429
customers how important we want me to
get this dress

14
00:00:46,429 --> 00:00:49,809
and i wanna talk a little about how I
see this fast-changing

15
00:00:49,809 --> 00:00:52,940
and some speculation into the future

16
00:00:52,940 --> 00:00:56,739
what i think is going to be important
moving forward and things I'm still

17
00:00:56,739 --> 00:00:57,440
working on

18
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,039
to address the situation is looking to
the past

19
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,400
a lot of me sorta technology narrative

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,920
in the 1990s was dominated by this thing

21
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,420
the web browser when estate person to be
tested navigator

22
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,170
it was almost evolution and immediately

23
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:21,150
a many people need to capitalize on that
knowledge one of the major players

24
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,180
that quickly moves wells Microsoft

25
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:28,660
and they want to protect their interests
by introducing Internet Explorer

26
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:32,000
and so when they did this

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:36,070
the technology near the up from the late
90's was transformed from not

28
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:40,010
just a web browser but more this war
between

29
00:01:40,010 --> 00:01:43,050
my brothers the browser wars and

30
00:01:43,050 --> 00:01:46,430
we all know how that at the same time

31
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,620
there was another what was happening and
it was

32
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:54,120
somewhat more so but perhaps even more
important and it was a war

33
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:57,930
over this thing a little what kinda

34
00:01:57,930 --> 00:02:01,330
in your browser and more importantly the
idea behind it

35
00:02:01,330 --> 00:02:05,020
I love this warm were the sacrifice

36
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:08,550
in the people who want to see this
information

37
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:12,950
spread while they want to 78 this
information the software

38
00:02:12,950 --> 00:02:16,250
as effectively as they could and on the
other side of the war

39
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:20,700
were the structures these were people
who want to prevent

40
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,290
as for this information they want to a
limits

41
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:28,430
the usual protect photography put it in
as few hands as possible

42
00:02:28,430 --> 00:02:32,330
and so the lines were drawn and one side
at a slower

43
00:02:32,330 --> 00:02:36,370
the second side had to collect Matt
plays the lives in a min

44
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:39,520
eagleberger isham to

45
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:42,960
any the heroes my teenage years

46
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:46,170
any shoppers that these people were
dangerous

47
00:02:46,170 --> 00:02:49,880
in fact the ideas scared the fop

48
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:53,980
and they were talking about

49
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:57,670
the move from the world with each other
samples may control

50
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:01,490
and access to all communication and
information to a world where they would

51
00:03:01,490 --> 00:03:02,450
have no control

52
00:03:02,450 --> 00:03:06,730
and no access to any indication more
information in fact they thought this

53
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,800
was so dangerous

54
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,730
that the classified as ideas as weapons
their

55
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:15,240
listing United States if you really love
the pic to other

56
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:18,410
Anderson at your friend in Canada
tantamount to

57
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:21,450
a shipping stinger missiles and

58
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:25,560
you try to hospital such at the same
time

59
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,000
the governor realize that a these ideas
were perhaps

60
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,970
potentially interesting to some people
and that they would want them and so

61
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:36,000
they realize that they had to come up
with their own solutions and for that

62
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:36,640
has

63
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,290
key escrow which was that about by the
clipper chip

64
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:44,550
and the idea was this is a totally OK
teacher

65
00:03:44,550 --> 00:03:48,069
a that no one knows the internals

66
00:03:48,069 --> 00:03:51,660
up known as about the details internal
and

67
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:54,480
that the government would invent this
into every piece of consumer

68
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,250
communications

69
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,459
equipment at the telephone effect
session

70
00:03:58,459 --> 00:04:01,840
every personal computer and then

71
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,510
you could use this inside on these
devices to establish secure

72
00:04:05,510 --> 00:04:07,310
communication channels with other people

73
00:04:07,310 --> 00:04:10,380
on it was essentially like a lucrative

74
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,739
us a the electric is there course

75
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:17,309
the government would have sort of like a
master key which they could then use to

76
00:04:17,309 --> 00:04:21,180
decrypts whatever communication they
were interested in and

77
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:24,710
so the main problem but the shoppers
during this time is that

78
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:29,469
photography in is not a banana let's
just say that information

79
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:32,499
is not an object and if you have a
banana

80
00:04:32,499 --> 00:04:36,809
and you share with a friend and there is
still only one person in the world with

81
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:37,490
a banana

82
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:41,189
if that trend and given in to someone
else they're still

83
00:04:41,189 --> 00:04:44,550
only one person in the world manana but
information

84
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,699
every time share you make a copy and so
you increase the chance for

85
00:04:48,699 --> 00:04:49,509
exponentially

86
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:54,419
explosion that information this
situation was made worse by wannabe

87
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:57,819
me like a punk montross cyberpunk sprite
cold

88
00:04:57,819 --> 00:05:02,069
a lot of great work to be done nettuno a

89
00:05:02,069 --> 00:05:05,770
developing photography outside of
government control

90
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:08,839
and but it was mostly red it was mostly

91
00:05:08,839 --> 00:05:12,210
and way keepers Anza

92
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:16,449
you talk about conferences there's very
little actual saw at once I don't wanna

93
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,050
software that people could use

94
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:22,330
12 right software sturdivant means that
anyone who want to use

95
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:25,839
photography could use it and so the
kinda nice

96
00:05:25,839 --> 00:05:29,680
and some people move to and we learn
Jersey

97
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,610
carribean island that has very favorable
long sometimes a

98
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:37,240
photography in export restriction and
the

99
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:40,800
move their hands rapidly started reading
better than exporting it

100
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,110
on world and people trying to open
another

101
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:47,249
hosting strategies a in nineteen and
five

102
00:05:47,249 --> 00:05:52,180
filament published a book called pgp
source but an internal

103
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:57,199
posters at MIT Press the book was not
think that the PDP source code

104
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,119
printed any machine-readable haha as a
very small print run

105
00:06:02,119 --> 00:06:06,339
and the ideas that if you have a digital
representation photography

106
00:06:06,339 --> 00:06:10,439
and you sanity friend in Canada thats
exporting munitions

107
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:13,789
and if you have a book and you think
you're going to Canada

108
00:06:13,789 --> 00:06:16,800
that is protected speech and so

109
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,490
what they did was Prince the source code
PDP in this book with machine with a fun

110
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:25,169
a small print run mail it to every place
in the world that they would like to see

111
00:06:25,169 --> 00:06:26,099
photography

112
00:06:26,099 --> 00:06:30,729
and people there simply stand back and
and now the head happy pgp that had been

113
00:06:30,729 --> 00:06:33,939
a distributed to leave the link so

114
00:06:33,939 --> 00:06:37,129
and stretches like this continues and
people were

115
00:06:37,129 --> 00:06:40,129
very rapidly pursuing the dissemination

116
00:06:40,129 --> 00:06:43,479
photography and the they were morning on
affective

117
00:06:43,479 --> 00:06:46,680
until he in 2000 the

118
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,020
Clinton administration suddenly change
the kitchen and

119
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:53,740
they repealed all the significant loss
restricting the use

120
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:57,139
and spoke with the time and it sort of
seems

121
00:06:57,139 --> 00:07:04,139
like the wall was long

122
00:07:08,570 --> 00:07:12,220
that and as I haven't done it and got to
talk to me

123
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:17,350
a on a and if you go back and look at
the psychic predictions

124
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:21,630
their most precious prediction was that
spread information on

125
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:25,480
coming up the premise a their
inheritance was that

126
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:28,560
cryptography will become ubiquitous

127
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:31,870
and that was the thing that they were
most read about this is

128
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:35,410
sort one of the first times that we saw
how information really does want to be

129
00:07:35,410 --> 00:07:35,780
free

130
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:39,000
however the other predictions about what
happened

131
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:43,130
once photography was everywhere were
somewhat less pressure and

132
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,990
these are things like a anonymous
digital cash in a flash

133
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:51,620
intellectual property will disappear
surveillance will become impossible

134
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:55,060
government will be unable to continue
collecting taxes

135
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:58,060
and eventually governments will call

136
00:07:58,060 --> 00:08:01,660
neither predictions that they made on
things like

137
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,790
he seconds mailing list and

138
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:10,800
for 2&a for doing it this manifesto and
the seven months back but if he flashed

139
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,550
for ten years after the soda

140
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:16,530
victory the spread of attacking
catastrophes that they had that allows

141
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:18,600
it to securely transmit your credit card
number

142
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:22,320
to Amazon dot on so that you can buy a
copy of Sarah Palin's book

143
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,470
ongoing road share

144
00:08:26,470 --> 00:08:29,640
%uh everyone's mother has a legal copy
even mp3 somewhere

145
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:33,979
photography is somewhat ubiquitous and
there are actual documents that have

146
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:35,070
been developed which

147
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:39,490
should make the reservation information
in possible but surveillance

148
00:08:39,490 --> 00:08:42,740
as Anna is at an all-time high and
privacy is probably

149
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:46,590
at an all time low so what happened

150
00:08:46,590 --> 00:08:50,270
we had to sort them out work seem like
you're victorious

151
00:08:50,270 --> 00:08:55,180
an hour in this unfortunate situation
like us manager is this

152
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:59,270
is that and as icons were in a way to
Karen

153
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:03,970
for future and future that they thaw

154
00:09:03,970 --> 00:09:08,030
they were going to get was fascist but
we got

155
00:09:08,030 --> 00:09:12,920
was social democracy and that's not for
the better

156
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:16,400
it's just different on let me

157
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,300
give you an example of what I mean how
many people here would be

158
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:24,280
excited about a law the required
everyone to carry

159
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:31,029
a government-mandated tracking device
with them at all times

160
00:09:31,029 --> 00:09:34,500
probably very few people right no one's
really excited about that

161
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:37,589
ok as long as the different question

how many people here have a cell right
probably everybody in this room has a

165
00:09:51,649 --> 00:09:55,010
mobile phone and so what was the
difference really

166
00:09:55,010 --> 00:09:58,220
a mobile phone is a tracking device that
supports

167
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,660
its position over an insecure
