1
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,930
at my name is poor state I make security
consultant I work for

2
00:00:07,930 --> 00:00:13,030
context information security and the UK
and I'm gonna be talking to you

3
00:00:13,030 --> 00:00:16,790
this afternoon about two decades

4
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:19,260
site this is a a quick summary of what's
coming up

5
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:23,050
first who I'm gonna give I construction

6
00:00:23,050 --> 00:00:26,119
to keep checking as it stands today

7
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:29,220
just people I'm you maybe don't know
much much about it

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,470
then I'm gonna show you foreign you

9
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:36,879
a cross-browser attack techniques take
keep checking

10
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:39,879
ands building at doing it to you

11
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:43,910
aspects like anything's then I'm gonna
show you

12
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:48,860
a tool that I've written that allows you
to you experiment

13
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:53,500
I will these techniques and try them out
see how they work and at the end if I

14
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:54,170
have time

15
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:58,430
I'm gonna show you some browse a
specific exploits that i founds

16
00:00:58,430 --> 00:01:01,920
during the course of this research but
for without

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:08,920
I'm gonna show you this okay so this is
a

18
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:13,830
a puzzle game its disintegrate because I
write that

19
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:17,080
and is basically sliding block puzzle
game

20
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:21,830
a drug that blocks around ideas to try
and get to bed square

21
00:01:21,830 --> 00:01:24,850
out of this and onto the

22
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:28,530
once the grace where I'm at the National
its completeness

23
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:32,140
and apparently it takes i'm in a mood
minimum

24
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:35,720
both 81 minutes to complete and that if
you had to

25
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,850
say I'm probably not gonna finish that
now I'm

26
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:41,909
but anyway say this is a web game
perhaps he was playing online

27
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:45,960
to spend in a sense but let's take a
look at what's going on in the

28
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:46,590
background

29
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:49,890
all this information has been sent

30
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,930
from my web browser to you a remote
attacker

31
00:01:52,930 --> 00:01:56,009
I'm each these I

32
00:01:56,009 --> 00:01:59,549
frames here has some any sensitive
information

33
00:01:59,549 --> 00:02:03,170
and this is a a document with you to
documents

34
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:06,659
this is the page starting from this is
that

35
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,739
gmail inbox this is main question it
email this is there

36
00:02:09,739 --> 00:02:13,860
and gadget basement you know and as you
can see the pages that have been

37
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:17,110
starting on the information is that said
as far as other things that as well

38
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,920
said how did that happen

39
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:23,940
let's

40
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:28,440
get back to this and that's correct
beginning

41
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,760
hands talk about the basic circuit
checking naked checking

42
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,940
relies on bike frames by frames allow

43
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:39,730
a allow you to take one sites

44
00:02:39,730 --> 00:02:43,310
and frame in another site today on the
same page now there's a few

45
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:44,430
misconceptions about

46
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,480
I'm for friends work so it's going to
now

47
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,780
festival any so I can frame any other
sites

48
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:55,180
even if they're not in the same tonight
secondly

49
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,670
even if the so it's been brain is HTTPS
that still works even if the outside

50
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,330
is mated yes thirdly if you looked into
a site

51
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:07,550
then Oreo cookies will be sent among the
question do it right

52
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:11,260
say that would be locked into that site
inside the arc right

53
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:14,840
say that's a thats

54
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,379
I'm what you talkin uses I'm

55
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:21,989
you might think that because patti
page's

56
00:03:21,989 --> 00:03:25,560
I'm to give insights on the same page
that's as I can connect

57
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,879
read what a nap right that's not the
case this is what the

58
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,560
after page sees in reality and the
reason for that is because

59
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,370
the bro the same origin policy prevents
any JavaScript access

60
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:40,330
inside iframe it's moved to Maine so
these a result Pepe

61
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:44,450
and happen if you try to activate
JavaScript to keep checking the way to

62
00:03:44,450 --> 00:03:44,860
you

63
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:48,190
get around this and still do some bad
stuff with what's inside the frame

64
00:03:48,190 --> 00:03:51,920
say I'm gonna pretty one through how to
checking take

65
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,250
is set up festival we have a target site

66
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,019
and Twitter up she was only targeted and
keep checking attack

67
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:02,140
a while back I'm services how they did
it

68
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,480
first we take at the site we want to you

69
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,849
I'm the cycle

70
00:04:08,849 --> 00:04:12,200
that was getting its due to the battle
on the site basically so

71
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:15,650
I'm in this case we want to get these it
kick the Tweet button

72
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:19,250
and send this message to all that

73
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:22,610
friends on Twitter without realizing
what's happening the festival

74
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:25,950
we friend sites and high school entice
you know

75
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:30,510
then we decide what's area the page
won't miss click in this case is three

76
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:31,120
percent

77
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:35,160
secondly we use second step is to CSS to
move the iframe

78
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:38,680
up and to the left say that the target
want to click

79
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:42,440
is on the top left hand side package the
last ep

80
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:46,139
is to take that page and continue on the
right train

81
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:49,530
and its lets us crop the the page

82
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:53,210
any particular target that we want you
to click on his physical

83
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:56,310
say in this case treatment

84
00:04:56,310 --> 00:05:00,400
and the three different ways a this can
be done first this to you

85
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,669
I'm show the target pretty visible ands

86
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:07,930
disease School's UEE dressing the

87
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:11,540
I'm where this could be used is for
example using that but in another

88
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,380
context

89
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:15,919
six weeks waiting at the user to you to
click on it

90
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,509
compasses and submit button let me think
I was missing another phone

91
00:05:19,509 --> 00:05:23,270
rather than I'm that the site that's
being

92
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:27,160
back tax secondly thing we can do is
catch make the iframe

93
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,060
invisible and Claire over other content
on the page

94
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:34,840
so in this case we haven't button that
says something else family can lead the

95
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:37,850
person to put out and get these to click
that

96
00:05:37,850 --> 00:05:41,090
what actually happened is to click on
the button and friends page said it

97
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:42,400
wasn't me that

98
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,310
but I think into issues job script to
make the iframe

99
00:05:46,310 --> 00:05:50,259
invisible very small make follow the
mouse cursor

100
00:05:50,259 --> 00:05:53,539
so that whether you to move the mouse
they will be

101
00:05:53,539 --> 00:05:57,330
when they click over clicking on the
target I'm

102
00:05:57,330 --> 00:06:00,500
know much what happens okay say

103
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,740
to fully understand why keep checking is
important

104
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:08,190
I went to compare it to you other
brother attacks

105
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:11,509
so some other attacks take place in
browser across expecting

106
00:06:11,509 --> 00:06:15,090
across across watery this a fun night
sights to people based

107
00:06:15,090 --> 00:06:18,720
and see him there was also got reach as
you can see Kate cost-cutting is

108
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,800
for by far the most popular and tend to
be results

109
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:26,479
and the other two I'm happy results with
kids looking at the least

110
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,259
if we have to look at how many how long
the attacks have been around

111
00:06:30,259 --> 00:06:33,710
these rough estimates we can see that
cassette scripting

112
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:37,750
across watery of any post-tax taking
effect on you

113
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:41,310
now what we can do is take the number
results but but number keys

114
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:45,259
I may end up with a complete meanings
number weak economic growth

115
00:06:45,259 --> 00:06:49,330
and pretty much do anything that shows
is that the kids can even run a couple

116
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:50,060
years

117
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,500
there's a love interest in it I love us
on

118
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,220
possibly because as much scary sounding
name than the other two

119
00:06:57,220 --> 00:07:01,150
something quickly pick up get it to you
a these attacks

120
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:04,789
this will cost cutting it to inject
JavaScript into web application

121
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:09,530
and if we can do this you can

122
00:07:09,530 --> 00:07:12,889
run any just great on the site is pretty
powerful even there

123
00:07:12,889 --> 00:07:15,940
I is fairly Commonwealth attack

124
00:07:15,940 --> 00:07:20,069
I'm because that's something we can be
the stator we can't keep mounting web

125
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:20,910
sites

126
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:25,440
I'm we can inject fresh and so on that
require machines in traction

127
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,280
course request forgery is less power and
cross-site scripting

128
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,930
we can send questions whether into a
publication perhaps by following the

129
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:33,400
link

130
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:37,060
from website and we can trick tip
haitian into

131
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:40,460
I'm warning that quest to do something
about

132
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:44,660
now cause I request forgery with this is
happy Kenny

133
00:07:44,660 --> 00:07:49,069
information into an application because
the back in the results

134
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:53,190
so in this case and this my bank site
perhaps we could

135
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:56,560
transfer some money from one account to
another weakened read-back

136
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:01,590
the page to see if it worked a lot
police or directly

137
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:05,060
cross Rs 43 is can be beaten I'm

138
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:08,690
stopped by having a run then taken with
that request so in this case you can sit

139
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:09,500
bottom

140
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,530
I'm we haven't been taken that website
nice but

141
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:17,650
I miss you stack wouldn't I and
therefore each request me check to make

142
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:18,669
sure they originated

143
00:08:18,669 --> 00:08:21,729
from the site and up from somewhere else

144
00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:26,099
keep checking and basic to the Sacketts
getting

145
00:08:26,099 --> 00:08:30,150
some and click on a bison something
inside my crime to do that stuff

146
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:33,660
the other thing a project was first
announced with the

147
00:08:33,660 --> 00:08:37,750
the flash but ability that allows you to
use access his webcam or

148
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:41,459
friend that's been fixed now and but

149
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:45,630
my site is still going to keep checking
to keep checking with you by POSCO side

150
00:08:45,630 --> 00:08:47,130
quest for the protection

151
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:51,380
because the tufted doesn't know your and
the caucus will be taken

152
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:56,130
we say well and get round up what's
getting you to interact directly with

153
00:08:56,130 --> 00:08:58,130
the form

154
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:01,529
probably talking it can you put weekend

155
00:09:01,529 --> 00:09:05,260
Inc clicks internet cation not to think
about it is anything much you candy

156
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:09,339
despite kicking on things on the web
site perhaps you could

157
00:09:09,339 --> 00:09:12,470
contrary to what some like that but
kicking alone

158
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:17,330
there's no all that much candy

159
00:09:17,330 --> 00:09:20,410
so to make to check a more powerful

160
00:09:20,410 --> 00:09:25,649
I'm current tax happened he's kept
checking with Prosecco Chris cool DRI

161
00:09:25,649 --> 00:09:29,500
to this request to see on that on the
page is what happens when you

162
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:33,209
submits when you updates just ate some
Twitter

163
00:09:33,209 --> 00:09:36,390
so in this line at the bottom half

164
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:40,390
we have been taken I'm at the status if
I run into isn't that then

165
00:09:40,390 --> 00:09:45,519
the update what happened say

166
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:49,800
actually checking attack to successful
we need to get some data into a

167
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,800
particular form

168
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,670
now Twitter makes that easy because we
can have a link

169
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:58,830
includes status so example hello

170
00:09:58,830 --> 00:09:59,880
prick if we have to panic
