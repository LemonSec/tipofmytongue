1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,940
excuse me for that so let's talk about
about some other values

2
00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:08,230
um I love you see the movie Zombieland
but

3
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:11,800
a the main character has these rules
that he has running through the whole

4
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:14,420
thing you follow the rules and
everything will be okay

5
00:00:14,420 --> 00:00:18,369
up so I have a few those in here but I
thought they were axiom is way cooler

6
00:00:18,369 --> 00:00:21,520
than rules because it has an X in it so
I decided to use that instead

7
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,580
but here's the first one a

8
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:29,640
that feature that you have you can be
used in a way that you didn't think up

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:33,010
trying to go out what it is and this
came from

10
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:36,260
one of the first attacks what happened
the first large attacks it happen to

11
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:36,969
Facebook

12
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:41,100
that wasn't a kinda low hanging fruit it
was

13
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,420
it was something that was really
innovative will and we're

14
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,620
many came at a time when we were very
focused on

15
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:50,649
growth and we didn't have a lot
resources we have a lot of money within

16
00:00:50,649 --> 00:00:51,750
a lot of people

17
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:56,260
and it really inform to the way that we
decided to think about attacking

18
00:00:56,260 --> 00:00:57,110
security from

19
00:00:57,110 --> 00:01:00,910
from then on and this was in early 2006
when the school to start it

20
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:03,940
so we have a feature at the time

21
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:07,170
I'm called friend finder where a

22
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:10,290
you could upload we tell you how to
export your email list you can upload it

23
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:11,030
to us

24
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:16,360
and we would tell you here's a above the
people are on your list here so many of

25
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,360
them have facebook

26
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,470
account so if you joining will
automatically send a friend request for

27
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:21,869
you to them and then come

28
00:01:21,869 --> 00:01:26,740
from going all your friends at that time
we're also very focused on performance

29
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:28,710
because we have a lot of money to buy
servers

30
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:32,439
and we want to make sure that every
feature we put in we knew how many

31
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:35,890
CPU cycles it took with monitor them and

32
00:01:35,890 --> 00:01:39,090
that where there were inefficiencies we
going to the coating try and pick some

33
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,759
so suddenly found at this page

34
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:43,950
I'll was very very happy

35
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,450
what's a CPU you're serving a lot and we
thought there was a there was a problem

36
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:49,770
with its we went in with code
everything's fine

37
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:53,869
from ended up partitioning of a couple
things in

38
00:01:53,869 --> 00:01:58,430
I'm a couple servers in production and
looking at what people were uploading

39
00:01:58,430 --> 00:01:59,790
and looking at what they were doing

40
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:05,479
and we found was a a variety of IP
addresses from around the world were

41
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:08,500
uploading a slightly miss format it file

42
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:12,590
that contained a hundred alphabetical

43
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,690
email addresses and they were doing it a
lot

44
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:18,849
so what they were doing ultimately was
taking

45
00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:22,349
I a spam list that they've gotten the
email addresses and scrubbing it via

46
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:23,050
Facebook

47
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:27,720
so every time we told them pay on your
list fifty those guys have Facebook

48
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,370
accounts they knew those are good

49
00:02:29,370 --> 00:02:32,709
was a good addresses and they coulda
spam that with impunity

50
00:02:32,709 --> 00:02:37,400
and so internally we thought about what
do we do about this

51
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:42,349
do we you we had probably four choices
one was to ignore it

52
00:02:42,349 --> 00:02:46,610
I'll which was a good because we're
paying for the CPU usage that was

53
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:49,810
a not showing real pages to our users

54
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:54,349
another one was to train coat around it
or to to keep them from doing it

55
00:02:54,349 --> 00:02:57,849
but realistically that's not where we
want to put our

56
00:02:57,849 --> 00:03:01,750
re-engineering time without point and we
probably wouldn't succeed because we

57
00:03:01,750 --> 00:03:03,459
make changes that make changes

58
00:03:03,459 --> 00:03:08,780
the arms race would go on we could just
buy more servers entrance supported

59
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:12,040
which was obvious at least favorite
option

60
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:15,360
and that really left us with one a.m.

61
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,860
one choice and that was to go on the
offensive

62
00:03:18,860 --> 00:03:22,909
and find out who was go after them do
whatever we could to get him to stop

63
00:03:22,909 --> 00:03:26,069
and I was a big proponent of that about
solution

64
00:03:26,069 --> 00:03:29,299
so we did we ended up using

65
00:03:29,299 --> 00:03:33,840
some legal methods I'll talk million
presentation filed lawsuits

66
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,180
from word against John does because you
know they were

67
00:03:38,180 --> 00:03:41,200
when after a bunch the IP addresses with
a.m.

68
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,290
with her discovery letters subpoenas and
battle looms stopped

69
00:03:45,290 --> 00:03:49,879
the activity um but we wanted to find
out who was a graphical

70
00:03:49,879 --> 00:03:53,730
ultimately after a I'm money trail that
went from

71
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:56,849
from Washington to Cypress

72
00:03:56,849 --> 00:04:00,330
to Canada all over the place where the
defining the individuals involved

73
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:05,180
um during them sewing them in US Court
even though they were Canadians and

74
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:09,459
and they settled for a few hundred
thousand dollars the

75
00:04:09,459 --> 00:04:12,930
afshar this was in retrospect that

76
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:16,150
probably cost us fifty thousand dollars

77
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:20,970
to do suit I'll and at this was at a
time where there was a lot of money for

78
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:21,540
us

79
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:25,120
we provide a service for that with the
support more usage um

80
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,380
but the fifty thousand dollars we spend
their not only stop the attack

81
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:32,449
thereby gaining probably twenty thirty
thousand dollars worth of server

82
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:34,220
capacity that we didn't have to rebuy

83
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:38,340
but ultimately because the penalties we
ended up having more revenue

84
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:41,990
to actually support a real business and
we wanted to do so

85
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:45,550
better informed one of our key security
values

86
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:49,750
which is we diligently go after
attackers have any type

87
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:53,449
anyone attacks Facebook will go after
them we may not do anything

88
00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:56,759
we made a just identify them sat on it
for a while

89
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:59,960
you know we have seven years so the
statue limitations runs out

90
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:03,389
but we want to know who people who
attack US ally but the other thing we

91
00:05:03,389 --> 00:05:05,000
might do is not to sue them we actually

92
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,770
will probably it's a really good at it
will offer them a job as some other

93
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:10,560
people on my team that's how we found
them

94
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,320
did yes sir we still do that it's not a
cliche

95
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,479
um did and we use

96
00:05:17,479 --> 00:05:20,979
pretty much all legal means to identify
attackers and their motives

97
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:24,509
so we're big on attribution Jeff

98
00:05:24,509 --> 00:05:27,720
and that means a not only

99
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,889
IP address a and their interactions with
Facebook but once we

100
00:05:31,889 --> 00:05:35,830
identify in the whole chain of the
attackers will talk about later

101
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:40,940
will go after people in there too and AM
and ask them who these people are who

102
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:45,270
are the people are because ultimately we
want to get down to individual

103
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:49,210
um they want to find those if people are
charged you attack us we go after them

104
00:05:49,210 --> 00:05:52,250
with full civil and criminal penalties
and we'll talk about some other

105
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:56,509
to move things were able to do based in
the US I

106
00:05:56,509 --> 00:06:00,660
I was trying to get some information on
equal European laws in other ways that

107
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,919
the people in Europe could do this and I
was able to but

108
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:06,850
I'm still working on that this obviously
we're going to need that in the future

109
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:09,919
as well

110
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,710
then is Facebook has the set up
corporate values that are

111
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:16,729
they're pretty strange I was gonna go
through all them and I thought that's

112
00:06:16,729 --> 00:06:17,729
not really

113
00:06:17,729 --> 00:06:21,220
a appropriate here but there's three in
particular they were actually really

114
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:23,910
relevant to the security organization

115
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:28,000
I we respect the trust that users
patients and and that's

116
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,580
pretty much first and foremost I think a

117
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,979
from the day that I started a Facebook
n/an/a value try to install the whole

118
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:36,229
group is

119
00:06:36,229 --> 00:06:39,580
we're essentially a private security
force for

120
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:42,870
before two million people did that use
the Site

121
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:46,539
to anything can act that way that we're
protecting

122
00:06:46,539 --> 00:06:52,639
your self-interest and in a sense your
interests are interest because

123
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:55,919
you know we want you to use the Site and
one should be safe I'm using it so we

124
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,539
work hard at that

125
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:01,699
secondly the company moves very fast and
by very fast

126
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:04,610
pretty much every company every person I
talked to has been in what they think is

127
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,319
a fast evolving organization

128
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,509
I told him what we do and how we do it a
and

129
00:07:09,509 --> 00:07:12,979
they realize that the there so much so
by comparison

130
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:17,190
we in the early days we're pushing code
once or twice a day

131
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:20,430
from booth we did up early for

132
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:24,990
through late 2006 a and then we we slow
down to

133
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:30,080
once a day and now we're now averaging
about once a week

134
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,400
a but this is a major changes major
develops a

135
00:07:33,400 --> 00:07:38,310
its work on Salieri factory which means
there's a lot of other

136
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:43,380
pools are you have to follow our tools
we have to keep updated things like them

137
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:47,560
um but also attackers were fast so we
have to move fast enough to

138
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,150
to keep up with them and not let them
laugh us

139
00:07:52,150 --> 00:07:56,280
it was very important Facebook is since
our resources are so small

140
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:00,160
we're still only about 1200 person
company and

141
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,590
a everyone has to work very hard but
it's very important that we are working

142
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:04,379
hard

143
00:08:04,379 --> 00:08:07,889
bigger leveraging that work on
high-order problems and I'll talk about

144
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:11,180
what are the ways that we think and
security where the high-order problems

145
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:14,849
are and how to go after them

146
00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:18,340
but there and then it's very important
to us to to work in the community and

147
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:20,410
talk to

148
00:08:20,410 --> 00:08:23,449
everyone about what we're doing and how
and I'm

149
00:08:23,449 --> 00:08:27,050
we want to assist the community as much
as they assist us so there's there's a

150
00:08:27,050 --> 00:08:28,690
buncha ways we do that

151
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:32,349
when one of them is room the responsible
disclosure policy that we have

152
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:37,320

facebook dot com slash security

word about water no

164
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:14,420
fifty times in the next half hour up
intelligences kid

165
00:09:14,420 --> 00:09:18,080
you own the playing field your
application

166
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:22,570
your website your network

167
00:09:22,570 --> 00:09:25,560
do everything you can to get every
single piece of information out there

168
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,410
not just the obvious pieces of
information

169
00:09:28,410 --> 00:09:31,940
just get as much data as you can and
figure out different ways to analyze it

170
00:09:31,940 --> 00:09:33,970
to make attributions

171
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:37,120
um

172
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,220

173
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:44,019
attribute attacks

174
00:09:44,019 --> 00:09:47,880
to at least unknown actors but but
identify the individuals

175
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:51,040
if you look at the data properly so this
one would actually

176
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,700
the awful because I think it's really
really important

177
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:59,880
okay it is a little bit about how the
