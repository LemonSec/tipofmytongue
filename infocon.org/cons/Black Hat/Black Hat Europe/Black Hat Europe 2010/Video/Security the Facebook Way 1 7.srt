1
00:00:07,569 --> 00:00:09,670
I wanna just talk briefly on

2
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:11,900
I'm some top

3
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:14,220
bution has been on

4
00:00:14,220 --> 00:00:15,740
for those have you know

5
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:19,280
I've been donating to more by time to a
homeland security

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:22,460
a in the US and so I spend time I've

7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:25,460
just recently spent a week wandered
around easy listening to what everybody

8
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:26,500
has to say

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:30,180
and what's interesting and the funny
thing is the topic that comes up

10
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:34,210
over and over is this concept with
attribution which is not a concept we

11
00:00:34,210 --> 00:00:35,170
have a whole lot

12
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:38,940
in my hacker world I mean yes you want
to avoid attribution

13
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,590
not be cut I'm but it's not something
that

14
00:00:42,590 --> 00:00:46,180
a lot of people worry about I think it's
you defend your networks you try not to

15
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:46,930
get broken on

16
00:00:46,930 --> 00:00:50,040
into and then you move on with making
money or your job

17
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,000
but two governments they're really
concerned about this concept about

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,140
tribution because you can't have two
turns

19
00:00:56,140 --> 00:01:01,050
without attribution and our whole sort
of defensive postures based on this

20
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:02,420
concept of deterrence

21
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:06,850
I'm so you have all these people
invented all these kinda Bob two systems

22
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:07,690
to try to

23
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,759
automatically identified attributes
attacks right

24
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:14,420
well we saw the packet come in from here
in the packet came in from there and

25
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:14,850
then they

26
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,200
you know the browser strain was in this
you know foreign language and then

27
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,700
they're probably from that country sec
okay I'll probably they are but

28
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:26,000
you know you're not gonna launch
missiles based on that information

29
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,700
this concept above 18 identification is
super old the hacker games I mean how

30
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,849
many people he remember

31
00:01:31,849 --> 00:01:35,630
chaining together so many systems until
like your telnet sessions like

32
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:40,890
chunk chunk that four seconds you know
it's like 300 to 1000 milliseconds lag

33
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,000
between each character on your SSH
sessions I go by chain myself

34
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,580
31 too many countries are better back
out tonight a little too slow

35
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:51,660
when your cell shell session is that
slow but thanks to this

36
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:55,050
high-speed internet nowadays you can
change three evermore systems right you

37
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:58,330
can bounce 256 machines and probably not
notice a whole lot

38
00:01:58,330 --> 00:02:01,739
and you can do between countries that
hate each other

39
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:04,840
and will never pick up the phone and
talk to each other and that gives you a

40
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:05,440
lot of

41
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:10,869
um ability to hide and so the limiting
factor is almost a technology on its

42
00:02:10,869 --> 00:02:15,040
network latency um and because this is
I'm

43
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,010
technical attribution at least in my
perspective is essentially impossible

44
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:23,270
because clever adversaries know that
it's now of course you can catch the

45
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,930
low-hanging fruit and the dummies

46
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:28,349
but clever attribution I'm

47
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:32,069
it's going to be very hard on a purely
technical level

48
00:02:32,069 --> 00:02:37,379
I believe to attribute attack and so
just like in a spy versus spy world of

49
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:38,810
the cold war right you have

50
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:42,310
false flags in misdirection I'm

51
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:46,819
your people to plant evidence in
implicate innocent people

52
00:02:46,819 --> 00:02:50,890
you're gonna have the same problems with
purely technical attribution it so I'm

53
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:54,599
my i'm saying that we have to learn to
live in that world

54
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:57,980
you're gonna have to live in a world for
you can't hit a button and say aha

55
00:02:57,980 --> 00:03:01,180
I'm gonna straight back to this IP
address cuz it's clearly that country

56
00:03:01,180 --> 00:03:01,989
its attacking

57
00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:05,480
and the state department can't clearly
look at the statistics and say aha

58
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:10,329
estonia for after us techno it's
probably not going to be that clear

59
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:14,010
so we need to develop systems to deal
with that reality and they're not going

60
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:17,129
to be easy systems are going to be
things like better treaties

61
00:03:17,129 --> 00:03:20,980
you know better working relationships
with other a

62
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:24,159
network security teams in different
countries I'm

63
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,409
it's going to be a whole lot traditional
gumshoe detective work

64
00:03:28,409 --> 00:03:32,599
right cycle we think are being attacked
from this country let's get some agents

65
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:33,140
in there

66
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:36,489
and spy on them okay we think it's
coming from the University

67
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:39,549
okay well we should look at the
university and watch what building it is

68
00:03:39,549 --> 00:03:40,260
coming from

69
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,329
who's coming in and out of that building
the attacks stop in the lights go off

70
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:48,200
the attack start when the lights come on
then there probably in that building

71
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:51,689
we're gonna have to get better
connecting all the dots because a purely

72
00:03:51,689 --> 00:03:54,530
technical solution I don't think is the
way that you can set

73
00:03:54,530 --> 00:03:58,549
create policy in the future on

74
00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:02,150
but this also gives a certain level
deniability right we're not 100 percent

75
00:04:02,150 --> 00:04:03,159
sure who they are

76
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:07,659
well they can't be 100 percent sure of
who we are and that works both ways

77
00:04:07,659 --> 00:04:11,049
in law enforcement and intelligence
community because that allows a certain

78
00:04:11,049 --> 00:04:12,139
amount of latitude

79
00:04:12,139 --> 00:04:16,440
to monkey around and try to get them
it's not a one-way street right we can

80
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,760
use this to our advantage

81
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,200
right now so I don't give up don't
despair

82
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:24,789
it's not all one-sided but you have to
be aware of it and and

83
00:04:24,790 --> 00:04:28,330
at take advantage okay so that's

84
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:31,240
kinda but all I want to say right now
Nash bution because we're actually gonna

85
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,099
hear something far cooler from Max Kelly

86
00:04:34,099 --> 00:04:38,599
I'm so max was in the FBI and he was
working in the IMAX

87
00:04:38,599 --> 00:04:41,630
a as a Macintosh and Unix forensics labs

88
00:04:41,630 --> 00:04:45,090
it headquarters and FBI in Washington DC

89
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,849
but in 2005 he got struck

90
00:04:48,849 --> 00:04:53,440
with the the bug and wanted to leave and
do something more entrepreneurial and

91
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,729
something more commercial

92
00:04:54,729 --> 00:04:58,560
any ended up a being rude away and
started the security team at Facebook in

93
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,930
2005

94
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:03,880
and he's built and run it ever since and
it's a really interesting challenge

95
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,610
because

96
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:07,610
you're constantly having to respond
every single changing threat that you

97
00:05:07,610 --> 00:05:10,509
can find on the internet and during that
time Facebook has grown

98
00:05:10,509 --> 00:05:13,710
I don't know how many thousands of
percent

99
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,940
and the people coming after you are like
application scammers

100
00:05:16,940 --> 00:05:20,199
spammers trying to get your customer
base in all kinds miscreants

101
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:24,720
who stay up all night long trying to
figure out ways to misuse the Facebook

102
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:26,879
platform for whatever their hands are

103
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:30,629
and so he's gotta figure out how to do
defense against these kinds of attacks

104
00:05:30,629 --> 00:05:33,860
essentially in real time without machine
learning

105
00:05:33,860 --> 00:05:36,919
and other interesting things that led to
this philosophy

106
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:40,940
on the sort of the Facebook development
philosophy is how do you do this

107
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:44,139
and a higher after a high-growth reno
rapid development

108
00:05:44,139 --> 00:05:47,650
a environment when the attacks are
consciously escalating

109
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:50,830
enduring the fastest development a
environment are one of them I in the

110
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:51,539
world

111
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:55,330
so concepts certain concepts that you've
grown to

112
00:05:55,330 --> 00:05:59,379
to love you can't do in that environment
MN so that's led to the sordid

113
00:05:59,379 --> 00:06:03,699
unique philosophy max's is developed and
will share with you

114
00:06:03,699 --> 00:06:07,389
which six people but before you get up

115
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:10,970
I'm one of the cool things about knowing
back so is he Forza Facebook

116
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:14,470
and you get to ask questions about
Facebook and

117
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:17,259
and I recently started trying to use
Facebook more than Michael who are all

118
00:06:17,259 --> 00:06:18,819
these people friend in me

119
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:22,259
how do you select to your friends like
is there a threshold the you guys have

120
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:22,990
like

121
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:26,509
some weird metric that you use they have
to note any of your buddies or whatever

122
00:06:26,509 --> 00:06:28,360
and I'm like how does this work

123
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:32,830
so I asked max I so how do you everybody
in the world must wanna be your friend

124
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:36,210
I mean maybe you know you're not as

125
00:06:36,210 --> 00:06:39,810
you know you're not is cute as maybe I
don't know the others are covered

126
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:43,669
she has like thousands of friends but
you have lots of friends

127
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:46,970
and Mac says his philosophy which is I
won't friend anybody

128
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,840
unless I physically met them twice could
you meet a lot of people one time in

129
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:53,419
your life but you don't miss a meal of
people twice

130
00:06:53,419 --> 00:06:57,069
especially conferences and you have to
actually remember them

131
00:06:57,069 --> 00:07:00,080
and that's seems like a pretty relevant
threshold right

132
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,800
I'm not looking for my next best friend
I'm just looking for people are

133
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,740
interested in the same things I am

134
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:07,840
I'm that are humans are not robots

135
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,860
so anyway with that on a pass it off to
max

136
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:14,490
who's gonna give you really cool insight
into life Facebook and

137
00:07:14,490 --> 00:07:17,699
I think a glimpse into the future how
you gonna have to developing defend

138
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:22,449
these high-volume a social sites so cool

139
00:07:22,449 --> 00:07:29,449
expect

140
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:36,340
give this one back thanks room for
coming out

141
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:39,370
good morning and I guess we'll converse
with her not from here

142
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:42,580
if you are thanks for coming a

143
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:45,960
interestingly I think want to the you
can

144
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,170
you'll be able to tell drew my
presentation that jeff and I didn't

145
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,410
coordinate

146
00:07:49,410 --> 00:07:52,580
notes with his comments on what I'm
about to say because

147
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,810
in a nutshell I'm gonna talk about how
important it is to build attribution

148
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:56,340
here

149
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,830
in your site and they're security plus P
a

150
00:07:59,830 --> 00:08:03,180
so keep that in mind as we go forward
the

151
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,430
the to when

152
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:09,860
when they asked me to come Speaker I was
thinking a lot about what the right

153
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:11,380
things to speak about were

154
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:14,880
at Black Cat because it's very much
focused on

155
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:18,940
technical issues how to getting into the
turds seen the the techniques

156
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:23,530
and and working on them and I thought
I'm a lot of the ones that we use a

157
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:24,360
facebook

158
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,660
are either very very specific to
Facebook

159
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:31,790
and in our environment or the things
that I don't necessarily want to tell

160
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:33,000
people about because

161
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:37,490
their really important to how we how we
keep things safe so I thought a

162
00:08:37,490 --> 00:08:40,750
what I can do is actually go up to the
next step and say

163
00:08:40,750 --> 00:08:43,669
for all these tools and techniques that
that a hint about during this

164
00:08:43,669 --> 00:08:45,080
presentation there is it

165
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:48,850
a unifying philosophy and way that we
thought about approaching

166
00:08:48,850 --> 00:08:52,740
up security as we're building this
company up at rapid velocity

167
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:55,970
that that will into it to you

168
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:59,230
if you fill in the gaps the types of
things that we're doing I have some case

169
00:08:59,230 --> 00:08:59,850
studies

170
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:03,120
a some other cases we work on the talk
about that I'm not sure how much

171
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,760
a detail we actually were so in public
before so he probably learned something

172
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:07,260
that

173
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:14,240
I'll the so that when we talk about a
little bit is just directly tunneled

174
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,970
from the Facebook stay employed where
our values change from what form them

175
00:09:18,970 --> 00:09:19,580
early

176
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:22,590
early on in the in early life for the
company and what they are

177
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:27,170
no kinda argue over the world and how we
view

178
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:30,640
a attacks against us and how we deal
with that

179
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,210
little bit about spam from a

180
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:38,280
and how we had some big anti-spam cases
in the US will talk about how we created

181
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:38,870
those in

182
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:42,070
and what they actually were a then all

183
00:09:42,070 --> 00:09:45,350
a revisit what I said is always
important to think twice sometimes 35

184
00:09:45,350 --> 00:09:49,820
three times and I was like to have a
small Q&A session

185
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:54,950
at the end because it people always want
to ask me questions and and and I love

186
00:09:54,950 --> 00:09:56,120
dance them actually can ask

187
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:58,839
anything you want Facebook or not
