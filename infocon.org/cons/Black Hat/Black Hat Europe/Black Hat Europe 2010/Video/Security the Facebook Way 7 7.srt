1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,919
well prepared and we have good good
mechanisms in place to keep that from

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:04,540
happening

3
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:09,330
the the types of attacks whatever
threats that I think are

4
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:13,599
do keep me up at night or threats that

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,220
are intrinsic to the social network up
the site

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,740
and I actually debated whether to talk
about

7
00:00:20,740 --> 00:00:25,300
the for nineteen types of scams today
and decided not to because a

8
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:29,650
the numerous ongoing investigations that
we have but I think that that's

9
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:34,300
that's a threat where the implicit trust
the people put in the network is then

10
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:35,809
turned around and used against them

11
00:00:35,809 --> 00:00:39,940
and figuring out how to manage that
trust

12
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:43,850
appropriately so that people still trust
but at the same time kinda

13
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:48,230
don't trust what we're telling them is a
is is going to be a challenge for us

14
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:51,890
but so far it seems to be working pretty
well

15
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:57,449
based on anecdotal evidence so we have
okay

16
00:00:57,449 --> 00:01:01,109
the thank you very much I hope

17
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:04,019
peaceful see it
