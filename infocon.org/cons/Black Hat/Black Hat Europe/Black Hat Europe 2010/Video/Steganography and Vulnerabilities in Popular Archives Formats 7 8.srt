1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:03,550
and there is that and therefore are
buckingham

2
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,859
and he says size of the file phones

3
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:10,030
and the next one starts at

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:13,790
wish on them we need to go there and we

5
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:18,420
pienso questionnaires once we know it's
there what do we do it

6
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,560
not what we do is with you an
interactive scan on the archive itself

7
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:26,970
cell interconnects can

8
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,580
stable and he says okay a fun first I'll
be watching the coverage

9
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:33,989
CES what do you want to recover it to

10
00:00:33,989 --> 00:00:40,989
say recover wonders if by other father
were recovered at

11
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:46,039
yes cover to knows it

12
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:49,160
and the program has finished

13
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:52,960
so let's see that because Russell first
fun recovered

14
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,030
we are unable

15
00:00:56,030 --> 00:00:59,320
at the moment to recovered following so
we use a generic one

16
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:02,440
in case the file name is office gated or
something like that

17
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,450
but the day itself is valid him if you
open that we see that this

18
00:01:06,450 --> 00:01:09,960
particular file as a doc file we can
open it it's a valid zip file

19
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:14,210
so this thing can be sweeney to

20
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:18,310
zip archive pickers that this what it is
zip insiders at

21
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:22,060
can extract that they don't see it later
forced

22
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:25,860
and for the second one and

23
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:30,060
if we just view it PCV MZ singer which
is

24
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,000
before for applications and this is
accomplished simple so we're not going

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,000
to extract this

26
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,090
gorgeous but as we can see we can a
couple data

27
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:44,680
bpm

28
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:48,090
so we can try this engine on

29
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,500
any of the advisories we gave and he's
gonna report

30
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,899
all the information about 31 abilities
be just as close

31
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:59,210
so let's try this 11 so just scan the
file

32
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:02,479
levin

33
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,210
and it says possible steganography
detective is a clear data

34
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,690
clear text data and it's that gives you
an offset in size

35
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:16,709
they detected so all its kinda fuzzy
area where stable lands and where when

36
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:18,180
they do it begins because

37
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:22,430
if it's just to go and it's affecting
some software security vendors

38
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:26,459
it suppose you're you can't really clear
it is in with your ability if it's

39
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:29,670
in accordance to do documentation

40
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,950
so we would kinda struggling with some
just do

41
00:02:32,950 --> 00:02:36,560
I'm file them as right thing

42
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,129
but we are able to detect both abilities
take another p

43
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:44,019
and corruptions with our tool and

44
00:02:44,019 --> 00:02:48,230
so what's important is that we have in
bed it's not only these

45
00:02:48,230 --> 00:02:51,970
315 would this be found we have been to
the 30 more

46
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:55,890
we found in the process of calling this
tool however there is no description for

47
00:02:55,890 --> 00:02:56,970
that because we haven't

48
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:00,080
really disclose them yet it just means
people that content and

49
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,900
play like the archive is valid I once we
disclose this and it's going to be

50
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:09,140
this with the phone lines at them
details when I get updated in with you

51
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:13,000
my what they want abilities were it's a
process it's a

52
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:16,519
30 31 abilities and

53
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:20,200
since that last a 15 were patched

54
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:24,140
and some other vendors and still rolling
out Patch's we want to make sure

55
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:28,780
that we have to renew and not something
that was a rescue from the old ones

56
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:33,739
so if it was packed States no-good at
what we found is that we were doing

57
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:34,909
testing the

58
00:03:34,909 --> 00:03:38,970
miss nation with the highest total so we
were using their scanners to do that

59
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:41,989
and what we found that this wasn't
really a good idea

60
00:03:41,989 --> 00:03:45,769
because some with the security vendors
have come online tools there

61
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:50,930
that haven't had their engines updated
in awhile so what we did not always

62
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:54,909
have are results from Myers total and
just manually verify thats

63
00:03:54,909 --> 00:03:58,480
if that's not affect your desktop
solution so their data

64
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,950
name in the phone book advises we get
now it's

65
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:05,540
much more accurate and

66
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:09,310
thats for an extension that's it for a
presentation at

67
00:04:09,310 --> 00:04:16,310
become to the question part so many
questions

68
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:25,600
guys there's got to be one question yeah

69
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,389
we didn't add that part yet it was short
quoting

70
00:04:31,389 --> 00:04:35,680
periods and we only wanted to make the
archive all its you can recover the data

71
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,550
file name: you can get that from the

72
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:41,540
from the archive itself want to but we
will add that feature

73
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:48,540
pay you know couple weeks between us

74
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:55,610
any mostly if I was too I

75
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:59,090
a the profile image I will definitely
changed breast sizes

76
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:03,000
file before that and so with a laptop
and that you would have

77
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,220
absolutely no idea that there's some
hidden content

78
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:10,430
for cavity is ill

79
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:14,349
even with feather because kathy is
single-stream to compress old the

80
00:05:14,349 --> 00:05:18,789
and if you just change the numbers I'll
be a compressed size it really has no

81
00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:19,539
effect at all

82
00:05:19,539 --> 00:05:25,570
chaos

83
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:28,610
cool

84
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,220
more

85
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:35,560
of good

86
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:39,570
pop

87
00:05:39,570 --> 00:05:43,570
admits engine opens a file you provided
to

88
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:47,310
so if you provide the zip archive it
identifies that as a zip archive

89
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:51,810
if it is really is it doesn't matter
which expands and as we do thx to

90
00:05:51,810 --> 00:05:58,810
make sure and then just inspect that
content role binary searches for his

91
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,460
signature and

92
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,460
we in that fight at insiders it brought
Jeezy

93
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,650
or cap which is supported at the moment
it

94
00:06:09,650 --> 00:06:16,650
and heels

95
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:21,660
yes yes you get our response which says

96
00:06:21,660 --> 00:06:24,880
this particular file is protected by
password you can see them

97
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,940
and the council and that that
information we provide with the

98
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,820
data about the file because this is an
indication and that this anyway

99
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:36,650
that was basically a but it doesn't the
crib files or anything

100
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:40,420
in the process of recovery you really
don't need to do that use another tool

101
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,380
to break your password

102
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:44,720
up

103
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:50,840
first to do the recovery part

104
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:54,980
and then decreased but when you are with
the valley Heather it still stores

105
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:59,320
the information about the Passport so
you are able to use a brute force it to

106
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,090
recover the password itself on the

107
00:07:01,090 --> 00:07:06,290
newly-created but Mallorca which

108
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:09,450
get it depends on how the steak who is
implemented

109
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:13,250
because this particular program we show
them

110
00:07:13,250 --> 00:07:17,830
it and meds new data but still a zip
file inside its all

111
00:07:17,830 --> 00:07:20,940
when we covered out that's another zip
file doesn't matter

112
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:26,270
but there's some tools do injected the
if they don't profess to be just the

113
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,500
trip that will run the best

114
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,690
and you will get to the texan from
cartoons and say

115
00:07:30,690 --> 00:07:34,430
okay there's some data from here to here
we have no idea what it is

116
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:38,000
go check yourself and when you do you
can either see

117
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,120
if thats change and eat up plain text or
something that looks like that and then

118
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,780
you can apply or photography

119
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:47,460
tools at work with FM stuff but them me

120
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:50,630
issue we had is just finding the data

121
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:56,020
because this is all level and had we
have absolutely no idea I whole problem

122
00:07:56,020 --> 00:07:57,030
this is in the wild

123
00:07:57,030 --> 00:08:04,030
because nobody will eject yes

124
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:11,000
okay

125
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:18,000
hidden content no matter what

126
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:25,979
I seven books generically so doesn't
matter which kind of the total used to

127
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:26,840
hide files

128
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:29,910
still be able to detect hidden data its

129
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:33,080
won't be able to tell you how it was
hidden by people tell you

130
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:37,180
from here to here just given data and
you use a software engineer to check for

131
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,570
that they don't see what it is

132
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:42,289
and I guess your question was the

133
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:45,880
you know what the security tools do with
its right a and the mean

134
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:48,880
they would in did they have been
affected by the very smaller villages

135
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,420
because they're reading the file is a
file format

136
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:56,060
trying to figure out the versions and
the you know made effective for me not

137
00:08:56,060 --> 00:08:59,240
depending on how you do the malformation
are stable

138
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,940
your vision modeling for example these
from the store abilities

139
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:08,270
then for the offer Rs 2k products we
basically made sure that we don't fall

140
00:09:08,270 --> 00:09:11,779
to live as we open up feature the
archives we look at him like

141
00:09:11,779 --> 00:09:15,570
we don't sort of fall prey to some other
type thing so we'll explore and %um we

142
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:19,350
don't say oh this is got this going on
it just sorta breaks in the file

143
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:22,560
without sorta be like oh there's a
header that's messed up here other

144
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:23,740
something appended

145
00:09:23,740 --> 00:09:28,650
let's ignore it just rated you know
instead of the detection mechanisms more

146
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:35,650
just get into the day

147
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:41,800
discover any kind of data so we are not
worried about

148
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,870
any kind of technology implication
because we can't unite the pic anything

149
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:47,890
so that that's what we try to do and
from the

150
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:51,820
such a security standpoint it's really
doesn't matter what kind of data is

151
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,590
hidden because

152
00:09:52,590 --> 00:09:55,650
if the user doesn't know about it he
cannot be infected

153
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,160
force just
