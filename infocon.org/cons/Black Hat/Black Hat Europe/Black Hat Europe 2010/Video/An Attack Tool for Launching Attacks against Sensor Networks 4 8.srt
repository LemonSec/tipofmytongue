1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:03,030
look attractive to the surrounding
knowles K

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:07,390
with respect to the other line cosmetic
you can see an example here

3
00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:11,320
on the left you can see the topology the
network before that type

4
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:14,750
here so you see that pulled the nose
have chosen the department's

5
00:00:14,750 --> 00:00:17,830
and that of course not to the pasta was
the base station

6
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:21,270
key now one step back is starting to
doze me think

7
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:24,630
over here you can see specially crafted
messages but I'll give the other line

8
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:25,680
call the public on

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,800
eventually what you see here look almost
forward the messages

10
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:33,950
to that like an old K so again that i
cant cuz

11
00:00:33,950 --> 00:00:38,090
boxes to the ball a methodist but the
bookcase

12
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,350
since you are very legitimate parliament
key go out and know that they're

13
00:00:41,350 --> 00:00:42,940
supposed to forward the messages

14
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:46,399
even the occasional but we are using
encryption the connection because the

15
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,160
congressman's

16
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,460
they send you think it messages but
after a while

17
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:53,789
what the user's social networks like
cost seen and contains

18
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:57,690
they will send you to keep you because
you aren't you the bottom two

19
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:01,660
at some point you have school before the
messages and you have to do that the one

20
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:07,180
visions will be sent to the key key
novice

21
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:11,220
a doctors who was one of the officials
wouldn't want your successful network

22
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,159
key but in order to better understand
how this war

23
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:18,400
we first public talk a little about the
routing layer model

24
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,330
crucial their routing protocols that are
used in sensor networks

25
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:26,619
at the same the asking all other
wireless networks will give their dues

26
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:30,070
for constructing communication of from
all over the North's

27
00:01:30,070 --> 00:01:33,710
so what's the base station no session at
worst there appears to be

28
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:37,710
to be a great day vested you this
routing protocols would be but most of

29
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,829
the existing ones

30
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:43,000
infection I don't think that the this
will change in the near future

31
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,549
usually quite the calculations of the
rocky coast method

32
00:01:46,549 --> 00:01:49,810
so what they do is the Noles

33
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,909
jus us the bottom the immediate bottom
24 with the admissions

34
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:57,520
but wants to reach the destination to
the node was the best

35
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,880
link while K if you got way they believe
there are two people what's the base

36
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,439
station

37
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:07,780
now hereof put the two examples the
summit the most widely used

38
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:12,460
welcome for the call sheets instrumental
from these days even in the

39
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:16,200
invasive unification Zwicky this marked
the homes for some cities

40
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:19,720
this summer the put together they are
using soul

41
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:22,990
whip up to meet all and the mood quite
right

42
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:27,300
the fest wonderment alt use this link
want the estimates

43
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,580
again us there knocking Coast metric so
what does

44
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:33,950
if these calculations the are based

45
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:37,280
on the bike it at a rate key shown the
Norge

46
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,420
30 or the commitments made specific
methods

47
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:44,350
called welcome date key and all of their
neighbors

48
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:48,510
the over here this transmission that out
the dates would be the

49
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:51,890
estimate then in quality based on the
packet loss

50
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:55,990
well this motivates key so that %uh
published top secret number

51
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:59,160
you should buy something that ought to
go to call you hover

52
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:02,400
I could see was number one two three if
you lose five six seven

53
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,420
them to cover the have created their
functions to become embedded inside the

54
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:06,900
nodes

55
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,900
games you can find finish the mission of
the quality over the issue understand

56
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:16,010
key this is not a very I could
estimation cue because

57
00:03:16,010 --> 00:03:19,520
the musician it was a special message
from it which

58
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:23,380
which are in the they don't PubMed
strong and a nice

59
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:27,750
to go home for good luck wild pitch no
one saw

60
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:32,330
it's one of the notes maintains a
neighborhood BBQ inside its memory

61
00:03:32,330 --> 00:03:35,380
Mukundan show love the idea of its
neighboring nodes along with the

62
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,780
corresponding week while Kris

63
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:40,250
so every time since use but something
changes

64
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:43,980
inside the statehood but us to be
something like a really big chains

65
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,980
like the pot and died so I talked to
delete it from there

66
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,130
neighborhood they've been alright see
but mike got in

67
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:55,320
bottom link what these really bob's so I
felt better in quotes a minute with a

68
00:03:55,320 --> 00:03:55,730
blue

69
00:03:55,730 --> 00:03:59,470
movies to be just the pun intended
mechanism not to talk to choose

70
00:03:59,470 --> 00:04:03,400
your pipe know the mood to open tryout

71
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,650
protocol again operates in a similar way
but it goes to the dogs cause

72
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:11,980
a better indicator it for the talking
about the cosmetic

73
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:15,720
what is the difference is that the link
want the estimation

74
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:18,750
calculation actually is based on their
own pocket when

75
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:22,820
but the Cubs the sense from the old key
so up to this

76
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:27,370
the the most guys 'cause this kind of
hard work so what they do again the

77
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,470
North's periodic

78
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:33,640
but will be going to just meet the
methods called Bacan show only exception

79
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,479
all of the other neighboring nodes boss
this message to his hard work

80
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:41,180
okay again the public function in the
extract the link quality

81
00:04:41,180 --> 00:04:44,780
novel equality response to another
function

82
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:48,020
not from these the country meet the cost
of the past

83
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:53,320
obviously wiki the the relation between
the cost

84
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:56,729
and the Equality case you missed the
proportion key

85
00:04:56,729 --> 00:05:00,080
if the new quality is better than the
butt of course will be small

86
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,260
the minimum possible so you can find
such political Lisa the number fifty

87
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:07,590
the important think about that often
called the coaches up there

88
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:11,800
all of them they are all designed public
stop using mine meaning that once

89
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:15,720
the Cubs created that out in three so
what's the base station

90
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,310
key they want to stick to it they don't
want to have many diseases

91
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:23,479
inside the sale completed why this is
done first before because

92
00:05:23,479 --> 00:05:26,930
whenever a group are you think you're
fine tunes in mechanism B school

93
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:27,539
standards

94
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:31,310
invent it is very important instrument
which and also

95
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:34,760
if you make a lot of changes previous
may lead

96
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:38,919
blogging sites because when you choose
your part in talks when you don't know

97
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:43,020
if the skies above the base station okay
so this may be per cycle

98
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:46,780
so the hospital because we all good news
for help with the search

99
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:51,020
not avoiding they didn't happen but for
the leading the cyclist but this is

100
00:05:51,020 --> 00:05:51,840
really costly

101
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:57,110
so they don't want to hardware such
rocks items much wine or the food chain

102
00:05:57,110 --> 00:05:58,150
25 attained

103
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:02,970
he sighs the smoking three we might come
up with two reasons first before his up

104
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:06,850
got important type for some reason
doesn't have any energy at the white

105
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:10,650
died so you have to change your of
school which was another part

106
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,669
the authorities on is that if you find

107
00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:16,840
in your neighborhood David another
neighborhood mold

108
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:20,229
key but the cheating quality seventy
percent better

109
00:06:20,229 --> 00:06:24,070
done they want to comment on posts key
so I should understand

110
00:06:24,070 --> 00:06:27,350
it must be really better than the
current one

111
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:31,940
in order to change your departing this
release it does this week look like

112
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:38,940
the more difficult for them thank you
okay so now let's describe the

113
00:06:41,490 --> 00:06:46,050
the most the known waste but the night I
can come notes that she called

114
00:06:46,050 --> 00:06:49,090
in a social network know the first

115
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:52,550
Sarkozy is really simple and actually
it's a pretty

116
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,880
your text or but woke up was admitted to
doing there fucked on

117
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,220
because it's really easy to will be
detected if the social network

118
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:03,260
house any guidebook for defense mickens
or security protocol even the simple

119
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:04,400
lost mission this one

120
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,610
so what the like a gun blues actually
it's going to start with ties a very

121
00:07:08,610 --> 00:07:09,100
highly

122
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:13,220
1/4 cent is solely index intense fake
messages

123
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:16,310
fake updates wilkey advertising

124
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:19,790
the high slick one-two between itself
and all of its me buttons

125
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:22,830
if I sleep while the is 255

126
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:26,750
but as we said this may be no this may
not be enough

127
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:30,230
to trigger the pontoons in Macon is ball
of the other

128
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:35,440
to enable notes because even if that I
can transmit some estimates

129
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,870
advertising content while feels 255

130
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:43,280
if their neighbor knows schmitz et cover
pardons with Nick 121 same it'd be this

131
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,690
is I don't think this is a bad person so
that we looked

132
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:49,340
to give the pontotoc megan's sure what
the possible

133
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:53,090
to the tough to make the other notes the
got in parliament the

134
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:57,090
all of the content parlance good to make
them look but

135
00:07:57,090 --> 00:08:01,660
good pubs for you wanted what's why baby
special Mideast notes

136
00:08:01,660 --> 00:08:04,870
key she's they concede that will see the
sparkle the network

137
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:08,360
key obviously also love the other
neighboring nodes basie

138
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:12,020
that up a bit of all of the neighborhood
so the knoll

139
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,410
what to order the bottoms of which one
other note and what are the mean one

140
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:19,110
sure you she cheered up like a
confession made each one

141
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:23,010
over the bonds inside the neighborhood
key and Oxford nice

142
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:26,520
early but I think was different said and
with six children

143
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:32,340
the us about this obvious can be used
only four other protocols

144
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:36,680
the problems that often cost me think
link while the estimates

145
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,460
key not calculation like that the more
the public artwork but this time it's

146
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:41,140
about the

147
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:45,050
us we said with a mean throws the
because folks why

148
00:08:45,050 --> 00:08:48,530
this is what that's like you used here
to pick up on the sofa because it's an

149
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:49,590
estimation

150
00:08:49,590 --> 00:08:53,160
and actually you can convince the other
know that this my estimation

151
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:56,870
key that's why the passionate and the
