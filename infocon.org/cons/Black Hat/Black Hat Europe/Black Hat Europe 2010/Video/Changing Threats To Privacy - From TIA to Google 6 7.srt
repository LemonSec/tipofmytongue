1
00:00:00,459 --> 00:00:03,320
and then to handle he likes a cure for
this

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:07,540
and the RTP streams actually as the
artistry in and

3
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:11,519
your cheekies pretty nice for the call
is tonight designed by floods in a min

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,769
and it was done with for security in
life the way it works

5
00:00:15,769 --> 00:00:18,990
is that you too negotiate a

6
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:22,189
general session fee between the two
phones and then

7
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:26,480
from the summer FML session he he drive
what's known as a sort of an efficient

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,359
rail and

9
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:31,670
that certifications training is then
displayed when

10
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:35,890
the call ahead so there's this you know
problem a key distribution

11
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:39,640
authenticity right you know that
whenever you want to send someone a

12
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:42,840
appease you came here to email you have
to find a public key

13
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,079
and then once you have it you don't have
to really there's definitely check the

14
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,010
signatures are calling on the phone if
you like what you think your friends and

15
00:00:49,010 --> 00:00:49,780
other stuff

16
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:52,770
the way this works is that they're no
longer and he is there's nothing for

17
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:53,930
anyone to come and see you

18
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:57,899
or demand from him an ass that when you
set up the call

19
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:01,270
the first things that you do is look at
the bottom of your car you say

20
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,290
I see flat busted up or whatever the
sort of thing kitchen string

21
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,400
needy the personalized just yet but it's
gonna

22
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,369
and this training is derived from the
shares material so that he posted the

23
00:01:12,369 --> 00:01:13,080
same strain

24
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:16,420
you know you but at the same P which
means that there was no minimal attack

25
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:19,509
and it solves the entire authenticity
from

26
00:01:19,509 --> 00:01:22,970
without all of this rigmarole checking
fingerprints

27
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:27,710
and things like that the other thing
working on

28
00:01:27,710 --> 00:01:30,960
is at Whittier Drive SMS application
also friend read

29
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,320
a again we want to look identical

30
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,229
to the a normal SMS via and

31
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:41,700
infatuated it clone feature for feature

32
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:45,049
the Thursday as mathematician on 105

33
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:49,280
and the way this works is it allows SMS
is normal

34
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:52,530
you can sms people that are running iOS
applications are just have no homes

35
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:53,000
whatever

36
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,079
but whenever you have to be in contact
with someone that is running

37
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,750
misapplication it automatically
negotiation secure session

38
00:01:59,750 --> 00:02:03,409
and once again video shopping a indebted

39
00:02:03,409 --> 00:02:06,509
one had a key exchange into every
message that is sent

40
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:10,090
so everything is change messages the key
Roll Hall

41
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:13,530
which means but again is not one thing
and one thing Thomas for

42
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:16,930
and get all hockey disperse funds
because is constantly changing

43
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:19,950
sup and these are

44
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:23,590
these products are my small holes for

45
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,690
reducing this bill the choice that here

46
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:31,300
is to me every day and this sort of
increasingly surveilled

47
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:34,780
and a decreasing the private world

48
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,180
a you can find on his part of my website

49
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:45,180
the kind that are and its thank you for

50
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,100
and answer any questions

51
00:02:55,100 --> 00:03:02,100
like that

52
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,700
the chance to rest this is the a good
question though

53
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,730
the question is a okay this bullish
about the stuff might be interesting but

54
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:19,299
are off the chain cox's an exact same
position the Google is now at

55
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:22,510
and the answer is yes and no the

56
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:25,909
I guess I first I think the way things
are now

57
00:03:25,909 --> 00:03:29,470
on it more not transfer taxes

58
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:33,010
individual search terms have any value
like if you have a really high housing

59
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:36,469
starts that you're gonna be performed
once people and honest used for

60
00:03:36,469 --> 00:03:39,579
good chance for your day to day

61
00:03:39,579 --> 00:03:43,430
search their rate which means that when
you're trying to protect his your search

62
00:03:43,430 --> 00:03:44,230
I V

63
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:48,079
are researches or you know the things
that you're using that only valuable an

64
00:03:48,079 --> 00:03:48,700
accident

65
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,590
the paint like a really big picture for
you on as a person I would say is that I

66
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,069
anyone was running to the strength of
the server

67
00:03:55,069 --> 00:03:59,489
are any much worse position to
capitalize on that information

68
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:03,040
and some unlikable that you know I don't
have the resources to do something like

69
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:03,530
that

70
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:07,419
the second thing is that the Guwahati

71
00:04:07,419 --> 00:04:11,040
server is a available at an SOS to

72
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,129
and anyone can run and you can configure

73
00:04:14,129 --> 00:04:17,539
yeah don't use whatever bank officer in
the lapd so

74
00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:20,930
you don't trust me hopefully someone you
can find you trust

75
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:25,130
thing we're doing is in the future a
move into more distributed about

76
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:28,949
where you can define a whole list a
Google champ at the surface and multiple

77
00:04:28,949 --> 00:04:29,690
people are running

78
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:33,510
and will distribute your class across
I'll so that

79
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:36,960
there should be no 10 that has any big
picture

80
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,190
a all of your search activity and should
be much higher for any individual

81
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:44,580
without elaborating into construct a
picture for you

82
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:51,169
and what did I and taking was from

83
00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:55,930
here

84
00:04:55,930 --> 00:04:59,870
but it shouldn't be that hard

85
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:03,259
right now its it's very specific threat
because

86
00:05:03,259 --> 00:05:07,229
over trentadue's intentionally Duff
there at his critics and also

87
00:05:07,229 --> 00:05:10,810
you everything a all information about

88
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:15,389
local services are a require a login in
which dole

89
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:18,389
acid amino which request to siphon off
stuff like that

90
00:05:18,389 --> 00:05:22,050
but it should be you know fully possible

91
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:26,000
T to extend this to other such things a

92
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:30,099
as people like the needle is

93
00:05:30,099 --> 00:05:33,740
by far the largest threat so and a
stressor

94
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:37,919
here

95
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:41,270
I

96
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:46,219
here here

97
00:05:46,219 --> 00:05:49,849
call weird

98
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:54,940
called friend

99
00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:01,940
yeah flood as Fulham rent

100
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:05,410
yes like that as we've been developing
this

101
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:09,440
a you know even if you like you know
thousands a test call stuff like forgot

102
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,400
about stuff like that

103
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,510
and you get is really amazing short
authentication strength

104
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:17,870
that I just collectively a almost like a
cool or something in their life profound

105
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:18,380
nature

106
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:22,010
yeah he likely that night and I'm really
trying to think that works and you will

107
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:24,830
get a funny thing is a strange that man
that's just

108
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:29,480
genius and you gotta keep this fall

109
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:35,670
hard

110
00:06:35,670 --> 00:06:39,960
right

111
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,040
right now I think a chair for fat as the

112
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:47,500
only place that I've seen this and when
I would like to see is and it seems like

113
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,300
that it definitely

114
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,850
where the developers a gr8 focused on
their energy

115
00:06:51,850 --> 00:06:54,620
and you know they don't have a limited
time I'm doing a really good job this

116
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,380
environment

117
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,380
and I just like to see people now
extending this with your concept and

118
00:06:58,380 --> 00:06:59,100
other spaces

119
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,510
into email a hint SMS and to all of our

120
00:07:02,510 --> 00:07:06,460
communication forty

121
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:10,810
sure that

122
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:13,740
if you to start I passed and this is
maybe one of the reasons that people

123
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:15,080
have immediately comes with it

124
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:18,620
you know just because people keep him
around for a long time it ends today

125
00:07:18,620 --> 00:07:21,720
and that what you have to do is

126
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,880
350 with a local hear something like
that if you intend to

127
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:28,910
him a but the nice thing about dr.

128
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:32,740
is that he gives you the option to
delete something hand

129
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:36,250
that the PDP even if you're deleting
email as it comes and

130
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:39,870
refused to be shitty model for SMS in if
you're deleting that it came and

131
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:44,340
its really not very unrealistic to
assume at this point if someone is just

132
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:48,310
capturing all traffic everywhere
infinite any point the back and

133
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:52,320
reconstruct what happened on the wire a
after they have tough stay

134
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:55,630
subsidy we know that some people aged
like the NSA

135
00:07:55,630 --> 00:08:02,630
at the eighteen people come soon G

136
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:09,750
well

137
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:13,770
friend red had

138
00:08:13,770 --> 00:08:17,080
is to have a right I seventy tricked-out

139
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:20,970
comic the a no temple had fun would like
to us

140
00:08:20,970 --> 00:08:25,320
hardware switch on the microphone so the
barber switch it off stuff like that

141
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:29,050
yeah you do that it's just so maybe it's
because they take the battery out

142
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:29,550
whatever

143
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:32,729
so this way and I want to turn it on
without but on

144
00:08:32,729 --> 00:08:35,280
no I think there's tons of other
problems that need to be addressed in

145
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:35,780
the

146
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:39,320
the hospice you know real time tracking
and stuff like that

147
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,669
is definitely dateline and I hope that

148
00:08:42,669 --> 00:08:46,940
we continue to recognize or this we
start to recognize that

149
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:50,510
you know this thing they were so Calif
just because the choices and

150
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:54,670
are really a the

151
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,920
the those free choices and a

152
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:00,870
no we should response to things like
mobile phones in the way to leave a

153
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:01,910
response to

154
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:05,300
government-mandated check devices and
that we should treat them as almost

155
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:12,300
does they really are him

156
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:18,500
I'm here's

157
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:23,980
red a the question is the question is

158
