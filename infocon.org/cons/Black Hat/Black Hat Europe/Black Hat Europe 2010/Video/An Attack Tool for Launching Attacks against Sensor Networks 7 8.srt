1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:03,340
published action sporting the government
morning you can execute them

2
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:07,089
you can played with the program content
and then would go to the government

3
00:00:07,089 --> 00:00:10,370
you've got a fun heart of the picture
devices

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:14,580
okay program and don't remember spaces
office can you separate

5
00:00:14,580 --> 00:00:18,260
okay so in Parliament artificial devices
to come not

6
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:22,830
public comments sent messages conveying
the destruction of the payload

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,310
and factually execute them sold

8
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:29,330
would be what she did him on a solution
one missions

9
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,780
okay containing two or three sections

10
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:36,770
could depending on the mission size but
they're usually the message size insist

11
00:00:36,770 --> 00:00:37,760
on it with a small

12
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,500
marching the default like it which is
used most of the pic is from spent four

13
00:00:42,500 --> 00:00:43,050
bytes

14
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:47,649
you so you can actually send 45 months
and execute the commands

15
00:00:47,649 --> 00:00:51,370
but which sent throughout this message
the

16
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:54,430
then Vista guys that come from France

17
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,730
okay I will not try to save their names
been demonstrated

18
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,550
because detection devices with the
following a few picture but the

19
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:04,830
because of the nature of this kind of
pics with us

20
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,270
limitations would be fished before this
we said you cannot execute

21
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:12,270
you call destructions but can be sent
three messages

22
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:15,500
so what they demonstrated this actually
call to execute

23
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:19,299
the sequence of instructions but already
stored

24
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:22,810
inside the program emotive the note give
a call the city got its

25
00:01:22,810 --> 00:01:26,790
key chauffeur's what they do is do find
the memory model for the note in the

26
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,189
fine selection sequins

27
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:32,130
not the kind used like sending gets all
the credit from God's its

28
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:36,150
and that they showed that if you can use
it anal began executing

29
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:40,180
this god's its you can actually inject a
fake stock

30
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:45,020
decide the note okie bye bye bytes and
then actually texting you for coming

31
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:45,420
months

32
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:48,549
but that is the the the big think use a

33
00:01:48,549 --> 00:01:53,490
seems you inject a fake stock which is
really big it's like good 256 bytes

34
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:56,890
bite bite bite you can imagine how much
time stakes

35
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:00,610
so obviously something that I can be
detected by the Administrative

36
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,060
okay and the it's not the

37
00:02:04,060 --> 00:02:08,340
okay you cops to find okay specific
instruction sequences

38
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,970
inside the remember him up if you cannot
find this action she pushes you want

39
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:18,080
so we've there is a guy that knows what
these functions are used in a forensic

40
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,709
spate good

41
00:02:19,709 --> 00:02:23,860
stocks so you won't be able to do such
chemical detection a doc

42
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:29,400
info about that for a device okay so
that's why we target the

43
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:33,970
also have only one pictures okay but why
you use the most guys in for devices

44
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:37,280
us remember the cob them as people for
the microcontroller

45
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,750
key which is it's based on them when
women are

46
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:44,819
picture so what we did is we took one
step further that work well for tribes

47
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:45,500
which beat

48
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:49,980
and factually -2 injecting execute a bit
tonight in Long Colt

49
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,680
not call this auction will come to send
only 31 message okie

50
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:57,110
and then we do still in development this
of each one essential knowledge

51
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,640
and actually create a self-replicating
warm okie

52
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,220
that propagates the Cottonwood
throughout the whole network

53
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:07,840
so what we achieved by infecting only
one node

54
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,090
good which takes effect seconds p

55
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:15,349
eventual you compromise of 3rd two or
three minutes because we help them some

56
00:03:15,349 --> 00:03:22,260
this Google compromise environmental on
its ok with more about this

57
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,739
so as we said we'd target devices
following the only one that the pictures

58
00:03:25,739 --> 00:03:29,139
be the selection who got us talking the
same members face

59
00:03:29,139 --> 00:03:34,859
get here you can see the memory mop of
them is before 30 Michael controlled

60
00:03:34,859 --> 00:03:39,440
who used to date back in order to find
these things now the heat

61
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,780
behind being able to to inject arbitrary
long called

62
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:46,079
inside the network is not sensor nodes

63
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:49,540
do not support dynamic memory allocation
okay

64
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,989
show all memory but is needed for duck
boat

65
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:56,900
my love this function key his phone and
allocated

66
00:03:56,900 --> 00:04:00,870
during a violation you but on the other
cons

67
00:04:00,870 --> 00:04:05,599
she's this is a typical embedded system
would be the company's if memory space

68
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,099
for the heap key piece for the dynamic
memory allocation

69
00:04:09,099 --> 00:04:12,250
so he purrs over here both and goes
upwards

70
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:16,120
okie sold peacekeeper members pay such
release

71
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:19,549
remain unused in this initial netbooks
throughout the call

72
00:04:19,549 --> 00:04:23,560
lifetime of the network okay and not
only thoughts

73
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:26,780
the other thing is that even if you take
the note you can take the cold

74
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:30,570
and you publish a copy to the say MMO
space between you two said the nodes

75
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:33,710
the cold over there will not be a racist
K

76
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:36,830
the tough specifically say to the Nord
slush

77
00:04:36,830 --> 00:04:41,260
organ memory otherwise the vindiction
called will always be there

78
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:45,120
so what we did we found the memory but
the heap starts

79
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,010
gates 25 74 it was gross supports

80
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:52,380
and then we used this member space

81
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,610
in or did to go pee or malicious called

82
00:04:55,610 --> 00:04:59,330
K so you can do something we're going to
go pee a really big

83
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:02,440
shove called bus always keep in mind

84
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:06,620
but you don't have to you must not
override the stock

85
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,690
okie which glows long words consult from
this others

86
00:05:10,690 --> 00:05:14,640
because otherwise the sensor most good

87
00:05:14,640 --> 00:05:18,919
will the will not do anything we got
bounced a they remain there

88
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:22,599
for that if it's like because it will be
better okay

89
00:05:22,599 --> 00:05:26,539
so the other important thing he's up
I'll come up in income

90
00:05:26,539 --> 00:05:29,770
muppet me about pockets so watcha Lee

91
00:05:29,770 --> 00:05:33,669
agencies we don't have the number and
location essential knowledge

92
00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:37,659
all memory other sis but I reject for
specific functions

93
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:42,830
the other the same shocks from the many
others which is used by this mission old

94
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:47,240
for storing it achieved by Kent remains
the same for specific programming much

95
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,180
day independent of where you are
compliant get the memo the others

96
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:54,880
you too remains the same so by again by
using its a duck

97
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,710
you can find these the this other ish of
where

98
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:02,349
the the doctor inside the pain of a bike
at are stored

99
00:06:02,349 --> 00:06:06,050
in again to come play with it you can
actually be a buffer overflow

100
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:10,469
overnight and other social survival
function pointing to but the address

101
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:13,479
okay and then actually execute your
money she's called

102
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:17,520
the most important thing here is this
restoration of a little

103
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:21,849
okie so what this means is actually if
you want to inject

104
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:25,950
a big piece of code York from POF
synthesis of malicious bike YouTube

105
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,159
according to Google

106
00:06:27,159 --> 00:06:30,889
show when you sent one missile defense
missiles

107
00:06:30,889 --> 00:06:34,330
you overnight there have been other
stuff the run up a function you point to

108
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,930
the official where the duck up

109
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,849
over the missile distort show you
execute them on issues call decide the

110
00:06:38,849 --> 00:06:39,380
mission's

111
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:42,810
Austin these you have to be careful to
restore

112
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:46,240
the control flow to stop it special no
box its normal state

113
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,240
because otherwise you're gonna send any
other missions mortgage to lock cyli

114
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,190
windshield inside every message you we
must cover but once a month

115
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:58,220
key for making the point that the
program convert the point buck

116
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:02,759
to the with instructions no

117
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:05,880
this does not look good in the required
steps his first full

118
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:10,259
to ponder something we dwell over this
is what device but we're going to target

119
00:07:10,259 --> 00:07:13,849
key will be some little things that we
said you must find

120
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:17,889
Esplanade others of the many which
largely the others not the cheap stocks

121
00:07:17,889 --> 00:07:21,539
and you have to find the memory I'm
gonna solve the reception at a fund

122
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:26,460
with the venue of it does mission of the
offices of my pockets containing the

123
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,370
cold but this

124
00:07:27,370 --> 00:07:30,520
to be coping into the heap good so what
you actually do

125
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,520
is a mid-stage buffer overflow so which
one of the pockets before lunch buffet

126
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,389
with your talk

127
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:39,740
and then send the specially crafted by
kids okay for changing the program

128
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:40,620
counter

129
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:43,740
to the obvious it over a cold YouTube

130
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:47,720
he partially no this is how it works

131
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:51,620
guy wheeler go through it fast because
I'm running out of time

132
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:55,000
socially the fact that with so much you

133
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,330
okay so the first to visit when you
achieve the no decision methods

134
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:02,759
the bottom function he will publish
their coping case called

135
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:07,379
okie so what this does is take the
available to mention its advice to cope

136
00:08:07,379 --> 00:08:07,750
with

137
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:11,430
inside the buffet soul with 12 a buffer
overflow

138
00:08:11,430 --> 00:08:16,030
but the security whenever this reception
funders call

139
00:08:16,030 --> 00:08:19,050
is called so the second step is over
here

140
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:23,409
uses Republic buffer overflow that it
did not show this to cope with function

141
00:08:23,409 --> 00:08:26,449
is over even by obvious you wanted

142
00:08:26,449 --> 00:08:29,810
okay so you put the others also the

143
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:34,140
I see you you can see the work you put
the other ish of where demolishes called

144
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,209
inside the pocket

145
00:08:35,209 --> 00:08:38,250
distort keys and you know this %uh this
so

146
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:41,770
this is the third step you execute you
execute all the cold

147
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:45,510
but no keep in mind that seems to want
to go pure gold

148
00:08:45,510 --> 00:08:49,750
decide to keep wiki the payload before
this message will contain

149
00:08:49,750 --> 00:08:53,180
move months cute because you want to
move your gold

150
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:56,290
into the keep so this is an example

151
00:08:56,290 --> 00:08:59,440
such a payload with of the box

152
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,860
the first box contains without us of the

153
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:06,310
