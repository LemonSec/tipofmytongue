1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,850
woohoo is you cough your space station
with your show ever

2
00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:07,270
which uses one of the nodes interjection
to the network

3
00:00:07,270 --> 00:00:10,610
key new program launches be called boy

4
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,009
when you called for coming months and
then we're going to topical months

5
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:17,220
but the bell to the knowledge to
reprogram the same

6
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:21,070
themselves to another pro-government d
and you can harm them

7
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:24,410
laying contain to go out to a new book
coming months and then

8
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:28,180
the old one still believes it's always
there for you come from the people buck

9
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:33,090
okay so what we can do in North Boone

10
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:37,000
the social issues or if i cant is
considered to be part of the netbook

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,149
because access to this political show
all of the messages that are injected

12
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:44,520
working of this program in months we
also come

13
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,780
also close to what we can do is modified

14
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:50,789
or replace the real cool be months for
something else

15
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:54,809
and then injected a good book for the
netbook or nothing

16
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:58,989
actually inject according to call the
Picatinny good so we are going to see a

17
00:00:58,989 --> 00:01:00,899
thoughtful such an injection per month

18
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:04,710
and eventually what we can of this week
on

19
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:07,930
reprogram the netbook to run our own
application

20
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:12,490
okay the obviously this will be

21
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:15,600
seen by the administrator but what you
can do is you can

22
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:19,360
and when it wants to put all your you
send the new programming months

23
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:22,869
you can actually local with over this
protocol okay

24
00:01:22,869 --> 00:01:26,860
so you can save even know that this is a
final coming months

25
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:30,909
chanukah I can guarantee that you will
not receive any minute section for

26
00:01:30,909 --> 00:01:32,290
months or even if the

27
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:36,360
means that the ones to reset them to get
the bug they will not be able to do it

28
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,740
also finally what we can do is going to
win his other function on this provided

29
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:41,409
by the beach

30
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:44,840
over them problem for the cause like the
pink ink wiki

31
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:48,259
the biggest make something clear on the
individual when you send the pink

32
00:01:48,259 --> 00:01:53,000
missiles to an old 1c to deceive sheet
will give you information

33
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,329
about sixty tidy its others and going to
the modest but because tort

34
00:01:58,329 --> 00:02:02,700
and about the conflict agree to demands
okie so wats when you can

35
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,560
this is our this is actually used the
game if you don't know what kind of

36
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,750
application is running

37
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:11,209
you the network wiki you can find no
indeed

38
00:02:11,209 --> 00:02:15,349
and she will give you bugging
application K and factually

39
00:02:15,349 --> 00:02:19,280
you can and change the protocols in
order to send got to you from the

40
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,410
structural the mission's

41
00:02:20,410 --> 00:02:24,790
but this was me to do this complication
article months

42
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:28,470
but there are provided also by the Boone
is that it would you go through said

43
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:33,080
you can erase it from coming months okie
and the most important you can exact one

44
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,180
now hold the injection works is not the

45
00:02:37,180 --> 00:02:40,370
when you write an application called key
and to compile it

46
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:44,560
that is an excellent addition of this
program and once that is created

47
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,920
all usually this is big K especially if
the goal to

48
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:53,230
big this is really big so what we do is
we break this cold

49
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:58,170
into pages it joins the pages making
she's from one of more than one pockets

50
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,849
K and we start just meet dick each one
of the pages

51
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:07,000
so this is done in the foot by khuman so
fast we just meet

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,450
the fish page all of the first hope
Norge

53
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:13,659
receive this one will give that is
another basic which him

54
00:03:13,659 --> 00:03:17,450
showed up defies I felt page 1 of vision
to this complication

55
00:03:17,450 --> 00:03:20,680
the other nodes check they don't vote
for government is

56
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,769
they see that they need so they would
send a request

57
00:03:23,769 --> 00:03:27,269
send me these things seoul-based of SS
uniform by khuman

58
00:03:27,269 --> 00:03:31,129
but the see cities

59
00:03:31,129 --> 00:03:34,970
the program which is really big usually
enough it's a

60
00:03:34,970 --> 00:03:39,230
application consists of 35 programming
ones' each one will feed because she

61
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:40,379
still spent by kids

62
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:44,690
usual this is really scary not sway
initially

63
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:49,140
program injections are supposed to
happen only a few times during network

64
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:50,000
lifetime

65
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:54,069
not you can see that there for example
with this kind of knowledge

66
00:03:54,069 --> 00:03:57,159
be which are really simple Commission
notes and use a

67
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:00,900
botanist if you do formal begin's
actions

68
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:04,299
key eventually they will lead to another
friends

69
00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:07,780
they will not even be able to set
themselves because they don't have

70
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,670
enough energy

71
00:04:08,670 --> 00:04:12,739
so again you're going to use this thing
culturally to create complications with

72
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:13,209
you

73
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:18,570
the during the network's energy know you
this is a snapshot

74
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:23,199
of the tycoon to involve the
objectionable comment further provided

75
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,600
until the right here this is the result
of a pink a month

76
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,740
K what the would cede

77
00:04:30,740 --> 00:04:34,240
in real-time no use your old

78
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,460
HUS six places for storing program you
insist

79
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:41,100
okay so you can change and manipulate
each one of them

80
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,470
except the the programs you don't which
is called the Golden you once

81
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:49,800
introduced by essence remote when it is
lifting an all-state

82
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:53,780
ok and it doesn't know what to do for
example like after the buffer overflow

83
00:04:53,780 --> 00:04:57,210
you show with a status symbol too much
going to this was the most

84
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:03,479
so you can change this area is think
before we go to vote

85
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:08,039
rookie

86
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:15,039
with taking not is usually when you
deploy social network

87
00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:19,250
shoes you want all to become one has a
lease and finance

88
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:22,979
you what they do you say once they do
when they deploy them

89
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:26,169
if they put them their names to the
limit okay

90
00:05:26,169 --> 00:05:30,130
was refused to be stations

91
00:05:30,130 --> 00:05:36,479
good book now you can see

92
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:41,240
key so this is because of the

93
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:44,800
months of the the projected

94
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:51,800
care but first let's do the pending

95
00:06:21,710 --> 00:06:24,810
good thing you can see because have two
teams

96
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:28,090
this wasn't supposed to be like this

97
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:31,770
giving me that because consoles because
of an ounce for the projector

98
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:35,440
looking

99
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:40,310
but you can see it here you not that you
can think

100
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:44,380
in front of me but most okay so weeping
no number nine

101
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:48,320
and as we should trumka don't obligation

102
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:51,419
okay I haven't put anything just the
golden once

103
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:56,360
source told months-long is a delta so
the muslims this was good publication

104
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:59,919
key and do the last three months useful
for $10.5

105
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:03,150
on this exploit applications you

106
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:06,590
well as you can use in order to do some
called addiction know what you're going

107
00:07:06,590 --> 00:07:07,750
to want to hear

108
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:14,750
okay let's say for example to do that he
would think

109
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,130
thank you it impossible to do it no you

110
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:28,500
because in the home watching the feed
but

111
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:31,720
like can show the unit and we fight
scenes that when it says they are nice

112
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,700
to see my laptop

113
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:37,430
key but

114
00:07:37,430 --> 00:07:44,430
no let's go back to this crucial

115
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,949
you might all this on the function not
provided by this over the upcoming

116
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:50,889
political

117
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:54,529
so you can exit camara a program you
must

118
00:07:54,529 --> 00:07:58,889
K I wanted to do this the and that when
you check to

119
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:02,269
show you miss montgomery months
consisted of 17

120
00:08:02,269 --> 00:08:05,329
like it's like upgrade to do you see
Publication

121
00:08:05,329 --> 00:08:10,169
with Sony said seventeen-page it's one
of the basic physical 505 likens

122
00:08:10,169 --> 00:08:13,979
which are not supposed to be not months
and

123
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:17,969
you will see that this was taken on 10
minutes you know to predict

124
00:08:17,969 --> 00:08:21,449
V's we're going to much to this kind of
network key

125
00:08:21,449 --> 00:08:25,079
which is actually one of two hope
mugging if your government work

126
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:28,239
not host in 15-20 coach rookie

127
00:08:28,239 --> 00:08:32,129
you called the very sick a month ago
month actually

128
00:08:32,129 --> 00:08:36,740
is 47 notes to the same for coming
months you called the Richemont

129
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:43,740
and that would come on now let's go to
the

130
00:08:44,589 --> 00:08:48,060
i think is the most destructive but fuck
that can be launched by this

131
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,939
tunes minus is called addiction be what
do we do

132
00:08:51,939 --> 00:08:55,449
miles to do is to take abundance of
memory little ability

133
00:08:55,449 --> 00:08:59,379
inside the goal that on called overtly
you faced

134
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:03,350
of fine such a lot built in order to be
able to perform sucks and fuck

135
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:06,449
like of course talk overflow and

136
00:09:06,449 --> 00:09:09,990
what we do the same kind of bike its and
execute malicious called

137
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:13,480
on the target system great keep in mind
that the

138
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:16,930
in a bad system likes this remote man
was there

139
00:09:16,930 --> 00:09:20,910
so no one looks for you if you think
that these coming popping but actually

140
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:21,509
it's gone

141
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:24,819
and vision is simply me when is

142
00:09:24,819 --> 00:09:29,519
possible depicted wiki but what we want
to do is actually -2

143
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,100
trust for the supermen were inbox
Melissa thank you to all

144
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:36,779
you that propagates the socks for men
were while the whole network

145
00:09:36,779 --> 00:09:39,970
now clubs which beat

146
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:43,389
was the first one to call for such a
wise decision it would exploit

147
00:09:43,389 --> 00:09:46,519
to present to the the your struggle

148
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:50,629
the block again so keep bugging devices
following the only one

149
00:09:50,629 --> 00:09:54,319
architecture guess we should before the
1i much different devices

150
00:09:54,319 --> 00:09:58,730
they say a the program and other members
space dishwasher you published action

151
00:09:58,730 --> 00:09:59,980
sporting the government morning
