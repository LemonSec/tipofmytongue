1
00:00:00,049 --> 00:00:03,189
be put on and in their quest to support
it on to Google

2
00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:07,049
responses back to the party's over and
the processor returns the smile

3
00:00:07,049 --> 00:00:10,410
the response to the fire and and then

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:13,590
we tryin to love like to set it up a
notch by

5
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:16,859
in 15 this link from the claim to the
same boxing

6
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:19,900
so you get as a self protection on your
local area network

7
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:23,220
for a Google services that

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:26,400
for nearly don't even provide GPFS so
you can

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,660
all your Google search things are now
sent overseas to this was kinda

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:34,579
interesting thing for me because you
know as the the plainness

11
00:00:34,579 --> 00:00:38,670
well I have to get an SSL certificate
and

12
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,820
you know I've been publishing attacks I
saw for the loaner

13
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:45,750
and been awhile since I've just Donna
certificate like a legitimate

14
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,539
activated does I had just beaten gonna

15
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:52,719
as I went straight to the bar on you
know

16
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,050
six dollars certificates or something
you know someplace fact that it doesn't

17
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:56,649
matter

18
00:00:56,649 --> 00:01:00,480
and a I you know gotta stay

19
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,129
you have to create an account before you
can get the certificate and so you know

20
00:01:04,129 --> 00:01:05,780
I fill out the information whether

21
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:09,640
and click the button create account and
it loves me into someone else's account

22
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,850
in like turkey or something I can see
all the certificates Alistair

23
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:17,430
my really like I'm not even looking for
skating on a bill is I just

24
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:21,020
dust on the certificate you know it is
just annoying rather

25
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:24,500
yeah lockout you know I'll try here

26
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,860
save my information greathouse was mean
to someone else

27
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,530
aka different master and wing okay well
I could just keep doing this until I

28
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:33,810
find interesting and how

29
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,009
a actually I don't really care because
really I just wanted to let you know

30
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:41,200
so I i cant go no one step up to the No

31
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:45,770
ten dollars certificate is an ETA and so
I go to this other place that

32
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,680
no that the two-step process for
perceived fill in your contact

33
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,350
information

34
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:53,210
and then the next step is to submit your
Certificate Signing Request so I have

35
00:01:53,210 --> 00:01:54,729
done my contact information you know

36
00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:58,130
maximum spankings to construct a that
nest

37
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:03,350
and says request in a I have any given
you my

38
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:06,380
Certificate Signing Request yet like how
can you deny my request if you haven't

39
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,310
seen it yet

40
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:11,450
and so on matched by a lot of support
say anything I just need a city it is

41
00:02:11,450 --> 00:02:12,069
very

42
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:15,730
and I got another place the exact same
thing happens I

43
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:19,020
finally and I escalate support stuff up
the infrastructure and talking to

44
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,180
somebody on the fun

45
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,300
and the like all yeah your your band

46
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:28,120
from marcia weird here does not allow to
issue certificates

47
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:31,250
which is bullshit a

48
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:34,680
so eventually addictive behaviors and
found that as well

49
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,060
and the nice thing about this is that
right as their

50
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:41,660
there are other like analyzing networks
things like toward

51
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:45,000
and they have very high anonymity gains

52
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,250
I you know there's three proxy is and
you know these

53
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:52,110
that which is a a great system for sort
of high-risk traffic

54
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:55,400
but its infeasible to think that you
would proxy

55
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:58,769
every Google search requests throughout
the day overt or right

56
00:02:58,769 --> 00:03:02,200
it's painfully slow that this word

57
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,560
and really inhibited what's more

58
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,110
is analyzing systems like to or that are
targeted drafted for Google

59
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:12,790
work by stripping off the identifying
information from an HTTP headers

60
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:17,030
and when you do that Google can be
conveniently had viewed as a spammer

61
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,040
which means that day give you a capture
the house of whatever you in a research

62
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:21,620
request

63
00:03:21,620 --> 00:03:25,360
and you don't have access to things like
maps news other people

64
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,590
services and so then I think about who
the james won

65
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:31,890
its extremely and lightweight
high-performance the only thing to this

66
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,510
party server is proxying

67
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:37,019
is Google search requests and responses
so

68
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:40,049
its very fast and

69
00:03:40,049 --> 00:03:43,379
the you don't even notice that is
running when you're a using web browser

70
00:03:43,379 --> 00:03:46,590
and the other thing is that Google can't
distinguish

71
00:03:46,590 --> 00:03:50,299
to do the same thoughts the server from
a large corporate net because they look

72
00:03:50,299 --> 00:03:51,000
kinda

73
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:54,390
no for some number of clients with
actual use and

74
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:58,000
you know validation be heather's coming
from this IP address

75
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,470
and so you don't have to end up solving
captures anything because you don't get

76
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:02,120
targeted

77
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,379
as and how does it look

78
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:08,650
well it looks identical to just using
Google you know

79
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:12,720
there's no special a place to visit and
no changes to your workload of

80
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,919
you can use Google Maps and it los super
fast the only difference is in the

81
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:17,570
bottom right

82
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,970
this is the status that says the changes
nipple any

83
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:26,220
and Google service works totally
transparent so this product is available

84
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,630
at was hearing that and so

85
00:04:29,630 --> 00:04:33,690
something like anonymous thing here
interactions with Google

86
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:37,550
is um is pretty straightforward right
because

87
00:04:37,550 --> 00:04:41,229
your intent on using Google is not
actually to share information with them

88
00:04:41,229 --> 00:04:45,130
what when you're using Google you're not
actually try to give them

89
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:48,729
your personal information you're just
trying to make use of services and

90
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:52,210
things like Facebook or whatever our
different because

91
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:56,330
your intent is actually to provide
information but you're not

92
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:01,270
release mentioning Commission Facebook
you're trying to share with sunset

93
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:01,910
finance

94
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:05,400
and so a project that I like along these
lines is called

95
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,970
fiscal which is further proof of concept
it's not any

96
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:12,320
production anything but it was developed
by this guy

97
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:15,820
professor is tender and what it does

98
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:20,979
is running as a Firefox add-on and it
transparently encrypted the information

99
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:21,500
that You

100
00:05:21,500 --> 00:05:24,940
send to Facebook if you prevent that
information into that samples

101
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:28,539
and then wall

102
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:32,090
if you really easy mechanisms you share
your views with people that are in your

103
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:32,940
friends group

104
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:36,620
such that they're also friendly the
add-on then it will just happen to fix

105
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:37,000
them

106
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,050
so everybody trying this out on uses
Facebook

107
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:43,759
it looks exactly the same a nothing
different happens

108
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:46,930
and the only difference is that Facebook
now doesn't have all her information

109
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:48,330
which they can either go back

110
00:05:48,330 --> 00:05:52,030
and I'm stern I think the same thing
could be said

111
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:55,120
for projects like Twitter which a

112
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,500
you know are 1/2 broadcast and 1/2
conversation

113
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,199
the conversation that's there's no
reason for Twitter to have all the

114
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,530
information other people that don't
tweet

115
00:06:04,530 --> 00:06:07,840
i right alright yeah so you people are
my heroes

116
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,819
rightly I am have a Twitter account and
something dies inside me

117
00:06:11,819 --> 00:06:15,169
every time Asia but the same time

118
00:06:15,169 --> 00:06:18,680
I don't think that his and I think that

119
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:22,919
if I try and resist things like Twitter
and ideas and I still have a Facebook

120
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:23,449
account

121
00:06:23,449 --> 00:06:26,530
but I think eventually I will become a
dancer and

122
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:30,250
that like dinosaurs I will become
extinct that I will be removed from this

123
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:33,530
social negative from a civil
conversation a

124
00:06:33,530 --> 00:06:37,039
and in circular and

125
00:06:37,039 --> 00:06:40,069
my second visit here is that a

126
00:06:40,069 --> 00:06:43,240
the trip to war was largely and update a
freedom

127
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:47,130
that while all this was happening it was

128
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:50,370
very you know limit been in the game was
trying to

129
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:54,419
get this restricted information at to me
restricted information available

130
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:58,860
and from that is very true extrapolate
the future updated control

131
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:03,370
that and is very easy to look at that
situation and assume that in the future

132
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:07,110
well we're going to be dealing with was
continued attempt to

133
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:11,419
control data and so a lot of are press
the products were born

134
00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:14,930
that reality we have things like
darkness state ahead

135
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:18,699
shouldn't services they were all born
out of this and

136
00:07:18,699 --> 00:07:21,930
this a future nightmare and doesn't hear

137
00:07:21,930 --> 00:07:25,020
use starkness

138
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:29,650
wanted even well

139
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:33,500
but

140
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,990
a good I suppose

141
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:40,800
again wall right most people don't use
these things and I think it's because

142
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,050
that's not a feature that we got

143
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:46,069
to we got something else write this

144
00:07:46,069 --> 00:07:49,430
social life is something this thing
looks different annis

145
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:52,900
a lately it seems like a lot of my gf
it's really love other

146
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:56,550
they're all about Iranian dissidents are
chinese dissidents

147
00:07:56,550 --> 00:08:00,340
and not because these are people and
places that have anything in common

148
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:03,580
with them and I think if you look
carefully a leadoff

149
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:07,419
that the you know come project to the
Iranian dissident and someone is working

150
00:08:07,419 --> 00:08:08,289
on

151
00:08:08,289 --> 00:08:11,550
sometimes the subject are probably
pretty dissimilar

152
00:08:11,550 --> 00:08:15,069
but I think that the people who work on
his buttocks are

153
00:08:15,069 --> 00:08:19,000
fascinated by people in these places
because they lived in a world

154
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:22,360
this still speaking a language that they
understand

155
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,449
that these places are still speaking the
language it didn't roll

156
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:29,020
which makes sense in the context to the
project that they've been working on

157
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:32,050
but I would say that even these places
are

158
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:35,610
starting to change if you look at around
recently announced the

159
00:08:35,610 --> 00:08:39,570
their launching a national email service

160
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:42,959
you know even they realize that the most
effective thing

161
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,519
is to just feel you know what they're
saying is not we're going to try and

162
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:47,380
restrict everything

163
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:50,480
but that we want you to sign up to our
e-mail service

164
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:53,540
will provide unlimited storage on this
thing right that

165
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:56,860
even they are shifting to this world
starts by soliciting rather than

166
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,540
demanding

167
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,000
their involvement the other thing I
would say is that the loss

168
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:04,940
the the war was less about the
eavesdroppers giving up

169
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:09,250
and more about them changing strings and

170
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:13,200
a large ship to be seen most recently is
from is key as growth strategy

171
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,750
to strategy he disclosure maybe see
things like everybody

172
00:09:16,750 --> 00:09:20,470
in the UK and other parts of your and
where

173
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:24,640
the stoppers Irvine sheler affectively
requiring

174
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:28,019
their attitude is we're not gonna try
control photography right that is a hard

175
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:28,730
problem

176
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:32,140
and we have been able to do in the past
anybody can use whatever

177
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:36,769
to talk if they would like but if at any
point we want to be your communication

178
00:09:36,769 --> 00:09:39,880
we come to you in the ass for your key
and if you don't give it to us

179
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:43,640
people injured and so this is he does
pose a problem

180
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:47,089
which is also lame a problem on our
hands full with security

181
00:09:47,089 --> 00:09:50,300
any are conditions particles

182
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,519
a so if I'm thinking about future the
first thing I want to do

183
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,920
his deal with his choices that are
choices these you know

184
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:59,950
is sort of all sources that ready to do
it and
