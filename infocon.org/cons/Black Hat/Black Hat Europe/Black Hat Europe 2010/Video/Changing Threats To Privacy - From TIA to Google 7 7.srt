1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,449
but that just should be an integrated
into the existing died in his arms

2
00:00:03,449 --> 00:00:07,649
such that it is as easy or easier to use
and the existing

3
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:13,759
a stop sign she

4
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:20,759
bus things reverse layup

5
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,010
group people chair

6
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:36,260
yeah the question is are you through

7
00:00:36,260 --> 00:00:39,899
because a you know everyone's iPhones

8
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:43,290
and there's no way that Apple will ever
let you do something like this and

9
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,750
I maybe dancers finest I'm I mean
definitely started on Android not

10
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,180
because it the most popular thing

11
00:00:49,180 --> 00:00:52,690
obviously because it the easiest just to
get this in there and done right

12
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,750
it is the right thing like this there's
you know

13
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:59,680
you can run the process in the
background and stuff like that and

14
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,410
and I guess my hope is that in the
future we can extend this and iPhone

15
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:07,200
first into the jailbroken model are
market right and articulate jailbroken

16
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,760
iPhones and there's like the alternative
markets and stuff like that

17
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:13,390
and then it becomes popular you can
eventually it into

18
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:16,439
a the normal distribution channels Apple
has made

19
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,090
some a noises about possibly allowing
sky

20
00:01:20,090 --> 00:01:23,140
and stuff like this these other probably
thats

21
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,979
so it's possible that you know you visit
the back of that

22
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:31,500
but I don't know this is why you know
the things that Apple is doing

23
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:38,500
tentative hanoi him

24
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,820
then up

25
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:46,960
heard wretched start of the game and
then one day

26
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,340
the update something else a

27
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,510
secure up again

28
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:55,790
version 2.0 him

29
00:01:55,790 --> 00:02:00,150
all and really citizen the mic in a
permanent

30
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,760
yeah okay

31
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,270
