1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,460
she was built out from I just wanted to
to come show the scale that kinda

2
00:00:04,460 --> 00:00:05,380
challenges that we had

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:09,320
um would have built up the team

4
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:13,610
I had two tracks one was armed security
that's a response team

5
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:17,510
and the other was the law enforcement
response to you and that those are

6
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:18,330
people who

7
00:00:18,330 --> 00:00:22,510
a law enforcement comes to with
subpoenas warrants and ask for data we

8
00:00:22,510 --> 00:00:22,960
go to the

9
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,060
and missus I'm I'm found any other
company that's really done it this way

10
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,660
yet but the reason we did it this way

11
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:31,849
because usually law enforcement era
group legal under Lawyers

12
00:00:31,849 --> 00:00:36,120
third they're treated as compliance not
really as a as security

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,360
reason we did it this way as I thought
the security answer response teams going

14
00:00:40,360 --> 00:00:44,190
to proactively look on our site and five
what people are doing try and figure out

15
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,800
what the underground economy is around
us disrupted

16
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,500
that way but we can also gain a lot of
information about what criminals are

17
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:54,320
doing on the site because the police are
gonna come and tell us every time they

18
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,800
give us a warrant or subpoena

19
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,949
and bring those two pieces of
information

20
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:03,180
those two information collection
mechanisms together has actually

21
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,510
produced wonderful results and the tools
that we build

22
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:10,689
we can simultaneously built for both
teams so the same tools that they might

23
00:01:10,689 --> 00:01:12,080
use to respond to

24
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,140
or request or subpoena request we can
use internally

25
00:01:15,140 --> 00:01:20,360
to investigate attacks in incidents and

26
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,979
it'd be a less than $50 million number
is that was about the number of users

27
00:01:23,979 --> 00:01:25,990
before we started building up the stream

28
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:30,390
until that point you to these boxes
represent one person sorry about three

29
00:01:30,390 --> 00:01:31,460
people doing this job

30
00:01:31,460 --> 00:01:34,880
as you got greater than 50 we built out
and

31
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,009
did we split the security that's a
response team into three separate silos

32
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:43,100
I'm malware does pretty much what you
expect it does is we

33
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:46,479
we go and get about where the targets us
we

34
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,799
reverse engineer we analyze it random
boxes above

35
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:53,299
if the box we try and give command
control network to to see what they're

36
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:53,780
doing

37
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:57,530
all that kind of stuff investigation

38
00:01:57,530 --> 00:02:01,570
is pretty much what you expect it's
developing cases against people

39
00:02:01,570 --> 00:02:04,729
I am looking attacks analyzing what
they're doing

40
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:08,239
and trying to to figure out how to how
to circumvent them

41
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,069
and intelligence is in the middle
because it is a little bit in the middle

42
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:13,190
it's not only

43
00:02:13,190 --> 00:02:16,959
analyzing the attacks are people doing
against us but looking at the whole

44
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:17,840
value chain

45
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,599
how do how someone able to pull out this
attack what is our ultimate goal

46
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:27,500
how to do has a community feel about us
are they afraid to love us with a not

47
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:31,580
are people planning attacks is someone
shopping around for particular script

48
00:02:31,580 --> 00:02:36,720
that's what we doing intelligence have
some great stories are what are you up

49
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,110
to

50
00:02:37,110 --> 00:02:41,739
if the hit me up later this evening gets
diplomatically did

51
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:47,209
so this is a big one that values also
from the very beginning

52
00:02:47,209 --> 00:02:51,690
is compliance is in security and

53
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:55,200
but I'm gonna call old PC as once back
but the everyone knows is

54
00:02:55,200 --> 00:03:00,099
there's a lot more specs and a lot of
organizations I think we'll

55
00:03:00,099 --> 00:03:04,379
have security organization that comes in
and really views the world from an

56
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:07,260
information security perspective so
they're gonna have a suspect

57
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:10,620
they want policies around its they're
going to implement

58
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:14,430
password controls in eighty access
controls and things of that nature

59
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:19,879
really from the outside world the real
threats that we faced

60
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:23,780
maybe your organization's buffets those
who really do anything

61
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:27,209
you can be fully PCI compliance still
get actors

62
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:30,450
as has been proven many many times so

63
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:34,599
home when your small you're moving
faster you have a lot of very dynamic

64
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:35,489
attacks against you

65
00:03:35,489 --> 00:03:40,209
in my opinion the time you spend on
compliance above and beyond what you

66
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:41,370
absolutely have to

67
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:48,159
is time wasted okay

68
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,959
a.m. here's a little bit of a model how
we think about the world

69
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:55,159
and CEO

70
00:03:55,159 --> 00:03:58,230
will still works call this diagram the
triangle for obvious reasons

71
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:02,830
it's gonna be a triangle a so the bases

72
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:06,090
vulnerabilities in the way that we
define vulnerabilities is

73
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:09,180
every piece of software every

74
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:12,830
device every building every everything
really

75
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,220
has some mechanism to get in we all know
this

76
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:19,769
we just maybe don't know what it is yet
but there's away and/or around

77
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:22,840
everything if I could make the base of
the triangle

78
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,370
infinite I would because that's the way
that I think about it

79
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:31,630
and if you spend time going after every
single ability or trying to find a

80
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:34,310
reasonable ability in your network in
your application

81
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:37,479
in your physical plants the

82
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:40,889
anywhere you're spending a lot of time
going after and

83
00:04:40,889 --> 00:04:45,070
trying to categorize an infinite set
maybe not the most useful time

84
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:48,110
threats are

85
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:51,199
I am the way we define threats are

86
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,840
their vulnerabilities that are actually
would be harmful

87
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:58,350
if they were exploitative years in your
room

88
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:02,370
in your environment so understanding
which are the water abilities are

89
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,370
important

90
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:06,460
are you threats versus those better just
their

91
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:09,830
in prioritizing accordingly is really
important this is hopefully not

92
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,610
something that is new to everyone here

93
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:14,729
I'm because I think that's that's the
way we all we've all thought about

94
00:05:14,729 --> 00:05:16,830
security for a long time

95
00:05:16,830 --> 00:05:20,789
but I think most up the security
organization especially compliance

96
00:05:20,789 --> 00:05:24,360
a.m. a specifications

97
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,680
really said in these two layers of the
at the triangle

98
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,520
and they don't go further than that but
the

99
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,270
because without a tax threats and
vulnerabilities are phony

100
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:39,620
if you take a XP machine that some
patched and sit in a room that no one

101
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,960
can get into

102
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,180
I'm and don't worry about the output
have only one person come use it and you

103
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:47,530
never connect to the internet or do
anything

104
00:05:47,530 --> 00:05:50,979
if you're printing paper offer there's
probably okay it's not a huge

105
00:05:50,979 --> 00:05:54,740
a huge issue I'm but as soon as you put
that in

106
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:57,930
to the Internet you have a tax and

107
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:01,039
a especially when you're thinking about
things to do

108
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,160
XP box to be put it on the internet it's
almost as if you think about it as a

109
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:05,430
force of nature

110
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:08,020
that you click the box and it
automatically attacks are going to come

111
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,000
in eventually the box you don't

112
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,780
and that's kinda just the way it is so

113
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:17,660
the way to approach that is be very be
very strong at the

114
00:06:17,660 --> 00:06:21,080
level between threats and attacks hardly
that so that

115
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:24,090
you can be attacked without the box
kitty getting owned

116
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:27,169
you could fight of such attacks

117
00:06:27,169 --> 00:06:30,470
I think that that's some that's valuable
and obviously the

118
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,930
you want to do that a lot of players but
if you have

119
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:37,400
the most leverage way to attack attacks

120
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,650
is that there are people behind them
they're not forces of nature

121
00:06:41,650 --> 00:06:44,800
every one of those attacks comes from
someone who has an agenda

122
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,580
a motive something that they want to do
and

123
00:06:48,580 --> 00:06:52,710
if you go after them if you love them
home

124
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:56,500
you reduce the people that are
specifically targeting you

125
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:03,500
I'm and that's what we decided to do

126
00:07:03,690 --> 00:07:07,470
or skip ahead actually it was a perfect
fit talk about things that we flip you

127
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:08,780
decide to do it

128
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:10,849
I think a lot of people folks
unprincipled abilities especially

129
00:07:10,849 --> 00:07:12,509
complaints

130
00:07:12,509 --> 00:07:17,110
attacks are a great place to understand
how she's reportedly go of reactors

131
00:07:17,110 --> 00:07:20,710
wonderful site okay so from

132
00:07:20,710 --> 00:07:24,319
the way that we really dealt with this
is

133
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,380
and this is this is pretty much our
policy still is

134
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:31,180
we don't pay attention to the
vulnerabilities I'm you we keep track of

135
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,699
them in terms of love

136
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:35,590
knowing what's out there and knowing
what's relevant so that we can assess

137
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:37,199
what's a threat or not

138
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,639
but if we see that there's something on
and

139
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:45,569
any of the millions list so we hear from
any of our our vendors that this is

140
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:46,970
relevant to us

141
00:07:46,970 --> 00:07:49,750
we're not automatically gonna go Pasha
think we're gonna we're going to a

142
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,930
threat assessment first

143
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:56,190
and the threat assessments are really
based on

144
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:59,569
overall in the company what's important
and what's important to us is

145
00:07:59,569 --> 00:08:03,500
protecting user data keeping the site
running at making people feel secure

146
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,370
with freemen data

147
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:08,129
so if there's a thread that's going to
say address

148
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:12,300
I'm something that's not necessarily
related to

149
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:16,120
for the production website its internal
I'm

150
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:19,440
and we don't think there's any way it's
gonna if it was compromised so what

151
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:20,150
access

152
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:24,500
user data we're probably not going to
get to that one right away

153
00:08:24,500 --> 00:08:29,030
no man

154
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:32,510
the some really important thing to us so
was watching attacks

155
00:08:32,510 --> 00:08:37,630
and identifying attacks because if you
see

156
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:41,700
if someone's attacking you that's really
the best mechanism you have for

157
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:42,959
identifying

158
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,990
who they are going after them you can
ultimately expand at a soap opera

159
00:08:46,990 --> 00:08:47,589
medical

160
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:51,860
in later slide to other mechanisms to
identify them

161
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:55,480
but at the point when they're attacking
you you have

162
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,510
a bunch of data that you can if you
build the site directly but your data

163
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,490
that you can get

164
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:02,860
that will help you identify an attribute
that first even if you don't necessarily

165
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:04,459
know they are the real world

166
00:09:04,459 --> 00:09:09,370
you can collated accident later
attributable to someone

167
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:15,380
and go after the actor so the way that
we decided to do this is will

168
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:19,420
everyone has a motive figure out what
the motives are and frustrate them

169
00:09:19,420 --> 00:09:23,060
so a we talk about spam a second

170
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:26,700
obviously the spammers their motive is
making money and if you destroy the

171
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,850
economics of spammy for them

172
00:09:28,850 --> 00:09:31,970
a.m. them the legal

173
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:35,950
it

174
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,500
them by the way if your judgment free
for seventy million dollars can someone

175
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:42,970
you're destroying economics is family
for them

176
00:09:42,970 --> 00:09:46,750
did so some

177
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,899
one thing that we really be on a
facebook also is distributed help

178
00:09:49,899 --> 00:09:54,209
from in this is probably actually
affected a buncha much people through

179
00:09:54,209 --> 00:09:57,959
it's not security related but its
philosophical thing

180
00:09:57,959 --> 00:09:59,790
we decided to translate the site into
