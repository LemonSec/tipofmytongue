[Music]

2
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,559
good morning everyone

3
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:13,840
uh thank you for uh coming to my first

4
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,560
talk at black hat and uh so happy to be

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,080
here with you so we're going to talk

6
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,439
today about uh vulnerabilities um

7
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:23,119
old and uh

8
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,800
tasks that we all do and it looks like

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,000
we are

10
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,320
keeping keeping up with the endless

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,760
we're not keeping up with the endless

12
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:32,960
war between the patch and

13
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:35,040
vulnerabilities so

14
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,040
my

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,960
co-presenter nabeel is not finished well

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,640
so he's not coming today to present with

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:42,960
me so

18
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,399
like i said we're going to discuss a

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,120
little bit today about what we found out

20
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,920
in term of analyzing all vulnerabilities

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,039
um

22
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:53,920
based on our work at vfd which is a

23
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:56,480
startup which is dedicated to maintain a

24
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,960
vulnerability database since 10 years

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,000
now

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,399
well nothing more startup but a little

27
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:04,799
bit more than startup now

28
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,159
and we're going to

29
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,439
discuss how we are moving from

30
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,680
management of vulnerabilities to

31
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,280
intelligence

32
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,640
vulnerabilities like it's now we're not

33
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,560
talking about any more about managing

34
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,360
vulnerabilities but more like a big data

35
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,280
of vulnerabilities that we need to work

36
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,960
on

37
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,560
so before i start

38
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,840
a little bit about myself

39
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:27,360
used to be the ceo of netpes it's a

40
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,240
cloud vulnerability management

41
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:32,880
solution in in the cloud

42
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,079
i'm now an advisory board at the

43
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,079
wayfit.io which is a startup which is

44
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,640
doing via vulnerability database

45
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,000
um

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:43,520
and i'm now office of a seasoned service

47
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,479
now

48
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:45,360
and

49
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,600
that's who i am

50
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,759
in terms of security the last 15 years

51
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,759
with what i've been working on

52
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,200
one more thing i forgot to put in the

53
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,360
slide actually i'm also in the arsenal

54
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,840
review board so um please make sure you

55
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,840
come i see some people

56
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,600
from arsenal here as well thank you for

57
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,240
coming please also come to arsenal to

58
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,038
review the open source security tools so

59
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,038
so what we find out from different

60
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,280
analysis and here is from ponemon but

61
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,239
all of them said the same thing is

62
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,319
the majority of companies are not

63
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,400
improving their vulnerability

64
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,160
management right we are not able to

65
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,800
detect quickly and fix quickly the

66
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,480
vulnerabilities right

67
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,200
why is that why we are not able to uh

68
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,680
quickly detect quickly remediate any

69
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,519
vulnerabilities right so why is it why

70
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:35,120
we are still

71
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,800
in this endless

72
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,599
race so what happened so uh that's the

73
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,440
question we're trying to answer today or

74
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,959
not answer basically but give you um

75
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,200
our experience on that on that on that

76
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,800
wall on

77
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,400
that task of

78
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:51,920
keeping up with

79
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,720
vulnerabilities

80
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,680
yes just to gain some data just to put

81
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,280
in perspective

82
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,519
critical vulnerability mec

83
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,000
can take up up to 12 days before being

84
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:06,959
fixed

85
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,200
it's more or less some study put more

86
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,080
less

87
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,000
i don't know your experience here maybe

88
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,200
it's going to be interesting if you have

89
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,040
some data someone have any data to share

90
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,599
we'll be happy to have it as well

91
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:18,560
again

92
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,560
why is still why is it why is it that

93
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:22,720
why why don't we have to take so much

94
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,360
time to to fix a critical vulnerability

95
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,440
we may impact your confidentiality

96
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,000
integrity availability resilience of

97
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,440
your organization why is that so

98
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:35,599
but first let me try to define what is

99
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,519
the critical vulnerabilities why how do

100
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:40,560
we define something to be critical i

101
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,319
and that's what we found out to be

102
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:44,560
difficult because with all the number of

103
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:46,560
vulnerabilities between you can get into

104
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,640
your uh

105
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,599
uh

106
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,159
infrastructure or information system

107
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,840
what how do you define a critical

108
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:56,560
vulnerabilities so uh some standard are

109
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,239
trying to to to do that by um as you

110
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,000
know the nvd has been able to have it

111
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,920
has been has been published in the cbss

112
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:05,200
core but

113
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,120
what else what more can you how how do

114
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,040
you define critical vulnerability into

115
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:11,040
your own organization right so that's

116
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,280
what we're also trying to help with our

117
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,280
database at the feed is to provide much

118
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,000
more information to help you prioritize

119
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,160
vulnerabilities right based on we will

120
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,560
see later all the different factors all

121
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,720
the different data and information you

122
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:28,240
can use to actually um

123
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,000
define what is critical for you to work

124
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,320
on right away okay

125
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,280
and yes as i said yes cbs says is what's

126
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,199
one thing that's been used

127
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:38,320
i don't i don't know i don't think

128
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,040
people is using this a lot best to to to

129
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,919
to prioritize your work but um

130
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:45,199
uh

131
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,280
and this definitively uh when you are

132
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,120
not able to pry it as correctly you walk

133
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,320
this will lead to delays uh and

134
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,120
uh issues for your organization to to to

135
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,800
patch and welcome you on your on your

136
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,520
vulnerabilities

137
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,039
okay

138
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,840
yes definitely you find out that

139
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,039
security teams spend more times um

140
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,880
navigating manual processes you know

141
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,199
between this can be when you raise the

142
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,639
team while using the scanners the team

143
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:18,479
who are patching they are always

144
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,560
different teams not uh

145
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,479
and it takes a lot of time to kind of

146
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:24,560
coordinate this team right

147
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:26,720
so that's one of the major issues we

148
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,720
also find into vulnerability management

149
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,199
so to analyze this task here are some

150
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:35,840
numbers to kind of

151
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,400
how do you keep up with monitoring

152
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,639
systems for your vulnerabilities so here

153
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:42,560
are some numbers

154
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,759
it can be more or less deepen up

155
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,600
organization but yeah if you just

156
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:47,840
monitor in threats and vulnerabilities

157
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,039
on your organization which is what will

158
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:50,320
cost you

159
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,400
more or less right so it's still a high

160
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,720
number just to keep up with monitoring

161
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,280
with threats

162
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:01,199
and when you look there are some

163
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,720
organizations who are trying to try to

164
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,720
actually

165
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,319
standardize this well you know all of

166
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,120
these logos here and uh are we helping

167
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,960
are we not helping

168
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:12,960
but what we found out is actually they

169
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,880
can be a very helpful if you are able to

170
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,039
connect them together right if you are

171
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,720
able to tune the cve to a mito attack

172
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,600
of course to a cpe to cwe to a capex

173
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,080
this can help we found out that

174
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,639
by it by themselves one by one

175
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,080
and i'm not sure they are very helpful

176
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:31,919
but if you are able to connect them

177
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,240
together that's where we found out that

178
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,759
they will help you much more to

179
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,240
prioritize drink management and the

180
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,120
remediation of your vulnerabilities

181
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:51,680
so we have also

182
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:52,639
a

183
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,479
list down here that we found on the last

184
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,400
year's the top 10 exploited

185
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,039
vulnerabilities and as you know

186
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,880
the majority of the bridge comes from

187
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,880
exploitation of vulnerability so here

188
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:06,080
are the top 10 what we found out here um

189
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,840
based on yeah

190
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,919
that's what we have that's what it helps

191
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,240
to prioritize vulnerabilities right

192
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,840
any any exploit links to that

193
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,639
vulnerabilities or

194
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:18,960
any automation exploitation exist in

195
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,280
your vulnerabilities so

196
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,800
yeah the ease of exploitability of that

197
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,560
vulnerability

198
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:25,599
the

199
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:27,440
the use the use of this vulnerability in

200
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,840
the wild how much people are actually

201
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,359
exploiting this reliability in the wild

202
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,919
and is there any campaign going on using

203
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,919
that vulnerability so based on all this

204
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,680
factor we've been able to actually

205
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,039
classify the top 10 cve's

206
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:45,520
vulnerabilities that we found right

207
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,560
there out there

208
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,560
any comments we can give in that list

209
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,039
of course microsoft's still on top of

210
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,800
the majority of cves

211
00:07:57,800 --> 00:07:59,199
[Music]

212
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,680
yeah so anyway you probably organize all

213
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,319
of these but that's the way we we that

214
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,400
is important here is how we are able to

215
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,840
actually uh uh prioritize this top 10

216
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,360
how we come up with top 10 is based on

217
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,120
the number of factors to help us

218
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:16,400
prioritize our work in terms of

219
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:29,759
top 10 inaudib used miter attack attack

220
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,879
techniques

221
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,360
uh that we've been able to also to to to

222
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,360
this down here's the top five here and

223
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,519
the next slide is the number five

224
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:38,479
um

225
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:40,240
yeah what is interesting here to find to

226
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,039
see is uh

227
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,399
uh

228
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:45,279
yeah

229
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,120
techniques to send melissa's files you

230
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,880
know every day there is thousand of my

231
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,480
of malware being created and sent

232
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:52,000
everywhere it's still on the top

233
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,080
techniques techniques to attack

234
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,000
organization

235
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,080
token manipulation is also you have two

236
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:58,959
of them

237
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,519
in that list so it's still also top in

238
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,760
the list of

239
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,399
attack right there so based on all our

240
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,160
database of vulnerability we that's

241
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,600
really that's where release comes from

242
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,680
right so um

243
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:14,399
you'll be so that's a

244
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:16,800
yeah the monitor attack top 10 from the

245
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,800
analysis

246
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:27,600
yeah same thing if you look at the uh

247
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,680
some of the reports on the iot or authen

248
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:32,640
abilities again these are they also list

249
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,000
you will see i will not believe them

250
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,360
here but they also list down 25 cves

251
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:39,600
that are commonly used to attack

252
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,959
this kind of network um and

253
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:44,480
and again these are coming from the

254
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,320
standard which can help you to which can

255
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:49,440
help out also to mitigate your

256
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,480
environment

257
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,440
and

258
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,200
of course we have much more sensitive in

259
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:54,880
terms of

260
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,880
availability and the resilience of this

261
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,519
environment so just mentioned the iot

262
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,160
and ot space

263
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:05,040
so a little bit more analysis into these

264
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,440
vulnerabilities we found out that

265
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:10,560
70 of his cves um

266
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,959
have a connection to this top 10 attack

267
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,320
uh uh micro attack list okay

268
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,040
yes this is interesting um as well again

269
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,440
this can help also uh when you do this

270
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:23,519
connection you are able to

271
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,120
rapidly prioritize your work right

272
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,120
so that's an analysis we've done as well

273
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,839
is be able to list down

274
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,800
uh

275
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,200
from the top 10 cves which are the top

276
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,519
10 micro attack at least connected to

277
00:10:37,519 --> 00:10:40,160
both cvs

278
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,480
okay

279
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,839
so let me try to uh

280
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:49,920
move on to the different factors for

281
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:52,800
prioritization that we find out

282
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,120
yes so again

283
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,800
yes how do you prioritize your your

284
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:57,839
vulnerability management or

285
00:10:57,839 --> 00:10:59,440
vulnerability intelligent intelligence

286
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:01,440
task we find we have also in our

287
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,279
analysis find out

288
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,920
here are four factors that can be useful

289
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,680
first one is the exportability again

290
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,040
version exploit how easy it is to to

291
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,800
to execute it

292
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,760
that's one factor the other factor is

293
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:17,120
what we call

294
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:18,880
scannability

295
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,800
what you call scalability is do you have

296
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,800
a

297
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,920
let's say

298
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,399
a script or a signature that you can

299
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:28,240
easily run on your infrastructure to

300
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,160
once you find the cve or vulnerability

301
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,600
to quickly detect

302
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,760
that uh vulnerabilities in your network

303
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,600
uh because you're not gonna scan you

304
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,120
know you have thousands or hundred

305
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,200
thousands or millions of ips so it's

306
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,560
gonna be difficult to scan them all it's

307
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,920
gonna take time so

308
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:44,160
how how do you have the capabilities to

309
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,360
quickly have a signature to about

310
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,839
specific vulnerability to actually scan

311
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:49,200
your overall

312
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:51,440
infrastructure and find which asset is

313
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:54,399
actually vulnerable to what specific

314
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:56,880
cves or yeah so

315
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,399
that's another factor to take an account

316
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,880
in your calculation

317
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:02,959
popularity yes that's another factor

318
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,880
which is interesting to to prioritize

319
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,959
your your work is actually

320
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:11,680
how much is it used in the wild how much

321
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,760
people are actually using that cve to

322
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,760
exploit uh

323
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:16,639
uh

324
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,240
to exploit the infrastructure

325
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,680
yeah often it is used how much people

326
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,399
are using it on github twitter

327
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,160
any other dark web any other thing so

328
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,760
how do you are you able to get this

329
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:27,600
information

330
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,920
to kind of help you prioritize that cv

331
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,000
okay that's another important

332
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,519
uh

333
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:35,600
factors we think is uh

334
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,880
helpful to prioritize your work

335
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:40,959
and is there any mitigation in place i

336
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:43,040
mean is there any ips idea signatures

337
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,320
that you can use

338
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,920
of course any patch

339
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:48,160
where is it is it accessible

340
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,839
so again here are what we find

341
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:54,480
very helpful four factors to prioritize

342
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,279
your

343
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,480
vulnerability management which are

344
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,519
useful and important so again it's yeah

345
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,120
it's more than just

346
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:04,480
having a list of vulnerabilities and

347
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,079
work of them based on cbss and

348
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:08,800
criticality

349
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:11,440
if you are able to use this

350
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:13,279
big data information based on these

351
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:14,399
factors

352
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:17,279
that's how you can prioritize your work

353
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,279
we found out that yeah

354
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,000
our data that we gather is used by there

355
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,360
are many companies which is the only

356
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,880
business is actually just to do that

357
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,240
just to do the prioritization based on

358
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:27,680
all these factors so

359
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,560
again

360
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:29,440
um

361
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,279
yeah so

362
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,720
sometimes you can do it your own

363
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,560
yourself i mean some people use all

364
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:36,880
service factors to create their own

365
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,000
prioritization okay

366
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,519
okay

367
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,800
i think i've been

368
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:53,279
criticized myself without nabil with me

369
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,480
so in the conclusion

370
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,399
yes automation is key with the world of

371
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,639
big data

372
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,079
it's specifically to navigate the world

373
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:04,480
of of big binary vulnerability data

374
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:06,800
which is how i call it now so um

375
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,440
standards are helpful but they really

376
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,480
need

377
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,160
to make interconnection between them to

378
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:13,199
really make

379
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:15,279
use of them as much as you can

380
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,199
okay

381
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,560
yeah so it's my conclusion the

382
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:21,519
conclusion of a talk today

383
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,519
and if you have any questions we have

384
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:26,000
plenty of time now to answer them so

385
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,440
please let me know thank you

386
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:38,130
