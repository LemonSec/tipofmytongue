1
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,280
okay uh i'm super and the other two

2
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:16,239
speakers uh shinro

3
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:19,680
they came from battle circle lab

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,279
today our topic is a new ways of ipv6

5
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:24,400
scanning

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,720
okay

7
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,279
first we will introduce the basic

8
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:34,160
knowledge of ipsec address and the

9
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,280
process of obtaining address then to

10
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:40,800
introduce several ipv6 related risks we

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,520
found and the method of quickly scanning

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,480
an address we will introduce how to

13
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,000
implode and

14
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,800
attack vulnerabilities after obtaining

15
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,840
large number or ipv6 addresses slow

16
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,120
several in the examples

17
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,879
that's some

18
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,520
safety suggestion and the summary will

19
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,000
be given

20
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,159
ipv6 uh uses

21
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:11,439
128 bits as the address money to solve

22
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,600
the problem problem or

23
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:14,479
is

24
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,280
in surface and network address

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,119
it uses stainless address auto auto

26
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,840
configurations which is more convenient

27
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:25,520
for networking

28
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,400
using smaller and faster

29
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,000
routine tables

30
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,479
because there are enough addresses

31
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,960
it is no longer needed and the partner

32
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,560
partner communication is more

33
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:39,119
inconvenient

34
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,000
since it uses a random address there

35
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,200
will be no address scanning problem so

36
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,479
it seems more cyclical but is that real

37
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,720
true

38
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,399
we know that most of one bts are imp

39
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,920
implemented through part recess such as

40
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,719
the

41
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,960
interview blue vulnerabilities we can

42
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,920
get the control of windows system by

43
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,920
just sending a packet to power 135 and

44
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,560
445

45
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,280
servers on the internet also listen to

46
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,400
posts but because they often update

47
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,520
security patches and set of favors the

48
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,360
risk seems to be

49
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,319
getting lower and lower and now scanning

50
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,520
ipv6 addresses is becoming easier and

51
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,400
faster you can scan our ip address in

52
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,280
feminist so now there are fewer and

53
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:35,200
fewer one which

54
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:39,200
this can be a pro it's followed it is on

55
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,040
the internet

56
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,560
but the mobile phones pieces out devices

57
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,599
most of

58
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,640
them under the local network are under

59
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,319
40

60
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,080
and the home broadband band

61
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,680
they may have a large number of

62
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,480
different vulnerabilities but we can not

63
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,720
exercise them from the tonight

64
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:03,360
however ipv6 allows

65
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,560
the part

66
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,720
to be assessed directly and remotely so

67
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,640
if

68
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:12,640
also

69
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,200
if you are a security researcher this is

70
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,599
a very effective

71
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,119
remote attack vessel

72
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,920
however the ipv6 address is long enough

73
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:29,040
to scan

74
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:32,000
if you could scan a 1 million address

75
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,200
every second it would take about half a

76
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:38,959
million years to scan just over 34 bits

77
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,440
and it's also a security feature of ipv6

78
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,319
let's analyze the scanning method that

79
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,920
security research

80
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,760
researchers have found for example

81
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,720
the ipv6 addresses obtained

82
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,239
by traversing low beetle dresses there

83
00:03:58,239 --> 00:03:59,439
are

84
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,159
thermal servers and gateway devices

85
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:04,239
which are configured

86
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:06,080
based on the convenience of

87
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,640
administrator manu management

88
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,239
generate ipv6 assess accounting for the

89
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,000
manufacturer's information

90
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,759
characteristics of mac address

91
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,160
but the effect is very poor

92
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,919
normal mobile phones and smart devices

93
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,160
addressed with the world meetings can be

94
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,199
scanned

95
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,320
so the new and effective ipo draft

96
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,800
scanner

97
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:37,120
the new and effective ipo address

98
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,199
scanning method are

99
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,919
urgently needed

100
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,240
before starting the new scanning methods

101
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,520
let's look at how the devices obtain the

102
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,280
ipv6 address

103
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,280
this feature shows

104
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,400
the pros

105
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:57,199
process of mobile phone assessing

106
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,080
international 4g we captured on the

107
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,880
pixel 4. first broadcaster scmp as and

108
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,320
only messages each other to obtain the

109
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:10,880
other party's link address it's like

110
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:13,199
getting the mac address

111
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,720
through erp

112
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,800
for one to one communication

113
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,160
the operator

114
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:19,840
returns the first

115
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,600
64-bit prefix address and the dns

116
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:24,639
address

117
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,759
and that

118
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,199
the device

119
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,240
generates a complete address according

120
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,840
to the prefix address and notifies

121
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,400
the router

122
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,039
uh in february 4j uh network now the

123
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,440
operator will assign a radar 64 uh

124
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,919
profits to the mobile phone the mobile

125
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,720
phone uses data loss configuration to

126
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,160
generate a complete server

127
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:57,520
128 bit access address and notify the

128
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:58,880
operator

129
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,280
the broadband is similar to the mobile

130
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,479
phone the gpu one device may obtain a

131
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:08,319
64-bit prefix from operator or obtain a

132
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,080
60-bit uh prefix which is convenient for

133
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,960
the low lower layer router uh to

134
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,120
continue to allocate

135
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,479
64-bit prefix

136
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,680
in some special cases a small number of

137
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,360
operators

138
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:29,919
are not understand the only prefix in

139
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,639
the world due to the limited address

140
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:33,680
segments

141
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,639
and this is very convenient for address

142
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,120
management and the routine management in

143
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,759
different regions of operators

144
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:42,479
so

145
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:45,759
expect for some special cases motor

146
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:48,560
operators will assign a global unicast

147
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,280
address i'll call the goa

148
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,560
our research found that if con subtract

149
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,880
some special smp packet and the first

150
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,639
city 64-bit prefix is correct

151
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,319
the device will return for ipv6 address

152
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:09,800
this may change the ipv6 scanning from

153
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,639
128 meter browser to 64-bit bus

154
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:17,520
if we can guess the correct prefix tool

155
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,319
uh the ipv6 address scanning will be

156
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,840
possible because we did

157
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:26,000
now

158
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,440
now let's assume

159
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,639
uh to

160
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,599
a as produces the risks we have found

161
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,759
next let my colleague introduce a risk

162
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,840
we have found

163
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:42,479
okay next i will share the risk and the

164
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,840
new scanning methods

165
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,800
after analyzing and joined iphone

166
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,919
windows and other systems we found that

167
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:53,520
if the prefix

168
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,520
fixed device is not and the last 16 for

169
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,319
beta stratum advice is online therefore

170
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,120
advice can be obtained by citing some

171
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,479
special semp packets this problem

172
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,319
affects multiple operating systems

173
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,479
let's learn more about it through the

174
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:15,479
video

175
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:36,600
yes

176
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,040
okay as we can see from the video and

177
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,920
that

178
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,600
at that table

179
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,639
multiple operating systems are affected

180
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:54,160
including almost all operating systems

181
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:57,440
at the same time enjoying the system and

182
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:00,560
embody the linux system seem to have the

183
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,320
greatest impact

184
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:06,160
for example risk one affects all android

185
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,360
devices and there is no need to turn on

186
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,480
how to sports and other conditions

187
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,360
risk

188
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,240
5

189
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:17,040
needs to turn on forwarding but many

190
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,120
routine devices turn on forwarding

191
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,600
themselves

192
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,760
now we take risk one as i example to

193
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:28,959
introduce the principle of vulnerability

194
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:31,839
triggering and how to scan large numbers

195
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,880
of other devices after the sim card is

196
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,240
in inserted into the mobile phone the

197
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,600
mobile 4 establishes a link through the

198
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,240
pointer to pointer protocol and then

199
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,920
sends the neighbor

200
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:50,000
discovery package at the obtained prefix

201
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:53,040
per package now it can connect to the

202
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,720
internet normally

203
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,839
macbook pin with the collective prefix

204
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:01,920
and the bladder lasts 16 for it operator

205
00:14:01,920 --> 00:14:03,839
checks the routing table according to

206
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:04,959
the unique

207
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:08,959
prefix and sends it to per parts uh

208
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:12,160
perks form then the mobile phone

209
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,800
receives the package and looks at the

210
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,240
routing table there is no for a advice

211
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,639
generally speaking

212
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,120
each operating system will not respond

213
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,079
to this package but the android system

214
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:29,839
will intelligently return a samp on the

215
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:31,440
auditor

216
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,720
the destination advice is the advice to

217
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:36,720
stand there peeing at that source

218
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,120
otherwise is that every basics at the

219
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,760
size of a point two point protocol

220
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:43,040
interface

221
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:46,560
we now seem to have a way to obtain the

222
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:50,000
last 16 for bit advice through our

223
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:53,480
sample request but what about the first

224
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:58,079
164-bit how can we gather this we found

225
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,040
that the first setting for the devices

226
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:02,480
are regularly

227
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,440
regular and the operators usually divide

228
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:08,639
to the devices according to which is

229
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,279
such as different operators have

230
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,240
different privacies the different cities

231
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:17,440
different districts and the countries

232
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,199
we can see from that

233
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:21,760
figure that different tables represent

234
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:25,279
different operators network networks tab

235
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:29,120
privacy is at the cities so the first 16

236
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,440
four bits of ipv6 are very focused

237
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:36,320
therefore we don't need a wide scan

238
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,600
second on non-existent advice without

239
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,920
existing talk don't

240
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,000
return

241
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:47,120
icmplan at the doctor and do not display

242
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,079
we can use t-shark at the tcp dumper to

243
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,959
monitor which is why this problem has

244
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:54,800
not been formed

245
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:57,440
and how to scan quickly

246
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,959
we must use faster slightly scanning set

247
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:04,079
samp package faster enough

248
00:16:04,079 --> 00:16:07,680
i recommend using fi6 as a scanning

249
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,959
course it can easily say which bits need

250
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:15,120
to be scanned we use a ygb network card

251
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,440
server to join

252
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,199
fi6 as a program which can achieve that

253
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:26,399
speed of 1.5 milli pickets per second

254
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:29,040
the destination of a targeted network

255
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:32,320
segment is a very important problem

256
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,079
because ipv6 allocates too many network

257
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,720
segments some of which are very large at

258
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,120
the fuel ieu's

259
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:43,440
here are some methods to collect

260
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:47,040
effective iv basics network segments

261
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:49,680
this video shows the scanning results of

262
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:52,399
some network segments such as china

263
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,279
russia television at the cm4

264
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:59,639
now we can see the video

265
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,559
next let's let my

266
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:28,960
colleague introduce the other disco

267
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:33,280
cases now shoe pong is your attempt

268
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:36,720
the risk tool is only effects on android

269
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:39,280
when hotel parts enabled our android's

270
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,720
devices

271
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,080
device the local dns service will start

272
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:45,039
and

273
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,919
it will cause the address or

274
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:51,520
host pulse interface became shorter only

275
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,799
eight bits of its latter setting four

276
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,640
bits are valid so if uh risk one is

277
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:02,240
fixed and the network prefix is not

278
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:05,120
the shortened ipv6 address can still be

279
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:06,400
obtained so

280
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:10,960
profiles cracking in a few seconds

281
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:14,320
the risk 2 is the only effect on the

282
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:17,840
request 3 is only affecting android 2.

283
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:20,039
because android use the

284
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:25,200
ua604 uh to generate ipv6 address so uh

285
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,840
java devices connect to internet through

286
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,880
wifi we just need to broadcast

287
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,600
16 to 24 bits and then get the full

288
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,918
address

289
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,880
when the request profits prefix is

290
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:43,840
correct

291
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,520
the packet is routed to the

292
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:50,799
of 4j router and if we try to control

293
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:55,280
the ttl value of smp or ip became zero

294
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:58,640
the snmp time injected error will be

295
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:02,880
thrown and the full ipv6 ipv6 address

296
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,840
will be carried this vulnerabilities

297
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,880
affects all linear kernel devices such

298
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,320
as the ubuntu android os routers and

299
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:15,120
windows system

300
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,320
uh after successful telling uh your pvp

301
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,760
or ppoe

302
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,440
the will obtain a 64-bit network

303
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:27,440
address profits if the device has ipv6

304
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,760
forwarding enabled

305
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,400
a net item will be added for the routing

306
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,240
table i did a

307
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:38,720
address with all zeros in the last 40

308
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:41,360
letter section 4 bits

309
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,960
since the address is it the smp reply

310
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,440
packet will be returned

311
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,240
with the full activities address

312
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,919
let's say this risk also has a valid

313
00:21:53,919 --> 00:21:54,880
impact

314
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,360
for example mobile phones

315
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:01,039
that turn on how to spot and 4.5 j

316
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,840
routers and home broadband

317
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,320
routers

318
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:09,280
this finger shows that not only devices

319
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,480
based on linux kernel are affected but

320
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,640
also windows next

321
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,679
my colleague will introduce affected

322
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:21,440
situation and how to employ it

323
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,760
so what situations are fighted first the

324
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,480
device needs obtains the prefix

325
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:31,679
prefix by dialing generally there are

326
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:34,000
some mobile phones at the past with the

327
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:37,600
sim cards as well as gpons and routers

328
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:40,880
in broadband networks and the operator

329
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,000
has the calculator advice routing table

330
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,799
and sets the package to the destination

331
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,400
device at the last the charging device

332
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,440
must have no firewall involved if the

333
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:56,799
above points are met congratulations you

334
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:59,679
can conduct attack the test on such

335
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:01,520
devices

336
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,760
this table is an example of the

337
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:07,120
equipment affected and which type of

338
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:10,080
equipment is more affected

339
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:13,280
in terms of quality android devices and

340
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:15,360
network access

341
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,559
devices have the greatest impact

342
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,080
thus global over impact is very wide and

343
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,799
many operators are afraid

344
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:27,440
because we don't have enough valid epi

345
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:30,559
basics network segments we only tested

346
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,400
these countries

347
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:35,600
unfortunately they all have a problems

348
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,000
that fpv thinks that otherwise can be

349
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,280
scanned

350
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,480
better accepted for the united states

351
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,000
that's why we focus the data that

352
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,240
although we collected industrial

353
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:51,600
american personal activities advice

354
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,720
the butter there is no root to

355
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,960
to these advices

356
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,760
let's look at some interesting findings

357
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:03,039
during the research of ipv6 scanning

358
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:06,320
technology we found many management page

359
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:09,279
pages some are home routine some are

360
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,960
nice systems and some are portable wi-fi

361
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:13,760
with

362
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:18,000
sms studies and the receiving function

363
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,000
in short there is a majority of internet

364
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,320
overseas devices

365
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,200
this is a waiting matching with open adb

366
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,279
service since we don't need the

367
00:24:29,279 --> 00:24:31,039
authoritative

368
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,840
we can control it so that activation

369
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,960
connect

370
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:38,799
fpv seeks the connection that's green

371
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:41,600
of course this product this problem has

372
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:44,159
been notified to the other party for

373
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,159
repair

374
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:53,400
now this is a video

375
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:12,840
this is a list of a device with a high

376
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,480
risk hotel scan and the test added which

377
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,039
variety abilities to test

378
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,840
please remember don't attack jessica for

379
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:25,639
security research

380
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:32,080
the biggest risk is to scan all zero

381
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,360
advertises

382
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:36,640
after obtaining valid ipv6 network

383
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,279
segments because it affects the both

384
00:25:39,279 --> 00:25:42,960
mobile networks and broadband the

385
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:47,039
the largest number of devices

386
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,320
after analyzing is

387
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,480
is the clean clinton application we

388
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:59,440
found out the most arbitrary fair

389
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:02,480
leading minority ability

390
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,760
the we also recorded a video on how to

391
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:09,120
test the effectiveness of this mineral

392
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,840
ability now this

393
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:17,158
this venerable ability has been fixed

394
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,279
and also we can also test the annoying

395
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,279
vulnerable abilities

396
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,320
faire explorer is our fair manager

397
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:39,200
manager application on android it

398
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:45,000
creates ihtp service bond 2.5977

399
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,240
we can use this vulnerable ability to

400
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,320
trade fairs remotely

401
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,120
the risk theory has nothing to do with

402
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,760
advice scanning but it's also a new

403
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:58,640
method to obtain ipv6

404
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,279
otherwise and set the exploit card

405
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,559
remotely

406
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:05,679
here we introduce how to use this

407
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:08,159
attack method through a practical

408
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:09,440
example

409
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,840
our five days discs

410
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:16,240
are all made of i i say mp equal package

411
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,919
so what about other types of icmp

412
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,240
researchers can analyze

413
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:25,840
other kinds of icmp packets to say if

414
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,559
they can move

415
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:29,679
okay

416
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:32,240
there are some suggestions the most

417
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:35,039
important one is that the server is

418
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,320
enabled by default or only on the web

419
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:42,000
interface which can resist motor harmful

420
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,000
process

421
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:49,279
now let's summarize

422
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,480
the introduce several risks to obtain

423
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:55,440
complete fpv sex addresses

424
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:58,080
and then how to get a large number of

425
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:01,760
ipv6 addresses and use these addresses

426
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:05,279
to employ it we hope that our research

427
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,360
results can give the security

428
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,720
researchers

429
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:12,640
new tactile ideas and methods of course

430
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:16,480
at last i will delete our scan the date

431
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:17,930
okay

432
00:29:17,930 --> 00:29:27,539
