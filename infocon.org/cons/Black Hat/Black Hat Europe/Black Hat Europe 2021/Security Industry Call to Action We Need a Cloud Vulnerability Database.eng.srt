00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,440
hello everyone and thank you for joining

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,160
us

4
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:14,960
my name is shir shilta mari and i lead

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:17,039
the security research team at with the

6
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,720
cloud security company

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,800
with me on stage is a launch hindo

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,960
alone leads our data and threat research

9
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,560
team

10
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:28,240
so i would like to welcome you all to

11
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,560
our talk about cloud vulnerabilities

12
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,079
today we would like to share with you

13
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:34,480
our idea on a unique identifier for

14
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,000
cloud vulnerabilities

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:37,920
we will talk about why we believe such

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,399
an identifier is so important

17
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:43,120
why it's critical at this point in time

18
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,559
and why an open database for cloud

19
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,839
vulnerabilities is necessary

20
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,199
so the outline for today will start with

21
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:52,559
discussing vulnerabilities in the

22
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:54,879
pre-cloud area how vulnerabilities that

23
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,120
are not related like to cloud handled

24
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,559
and i believe that it will sound

25
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,120
familiar to most of you then we'll move

26
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,480
to introduce you to a new type of

27
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,040
vulnerabilities cloud vulnerabilities

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,080
will

29
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,040
explain um what is different about them

30
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,600
and why they need a new system to handle

31
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,840
them we'll use three different examples

32
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,759
of vulnerabilities each one will

33
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,759
demonstrate different aspects of the

34
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:20,400
issues that cloud vulnerabilities raise

35
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,640
then it will move to a solution proposal

36
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,640
and this is actually something that we

37
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,479
walked with the community we have a

38
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,880
community of people who care about these

39
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,640
cloud security issues and we'll

40
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,479
introduce you our way to solve this

41
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:33,600
problem

42
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:34,880
lastly

43
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,960
we'll talk about what can we as a

44
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,560
community do in order to um to help and

45
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,159
solve the cloud vulnerability issues

46
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,680
so just a word about us so we are from

47
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:50,159
wiz with us a cloud security company and

48
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,079
our mission uh we say usually say that

49
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,920
it's to make the cloud less cloudy we're

50
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,560
trying to solve problems in the cloud

51
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,840
as part of that we do cloud

52
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,520
vulnerability research and in the past

53
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,200
year we had some very interesting

54
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,119
findings and you might have heard about

55
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:03,920
them

56
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,159
we had a session yesterday about chaos

57
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,800
db one of our findings and the important

58
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,639
thing is that when we

59
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:12,400
investigated these issues and found the

60
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,560
vulnerabilities we understood that the

61
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,959
csps the cloud security the

62
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,080
the cloud providers they have um i mean

63
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:21,599
there is some gap in the way that they

64
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,280
handle these vulnerabilities and this is

65
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,400
what we are going to talk about today

66
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,560
so let's start let's let's say just

67
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,640
imagine for a second that i'm a cso i'm

68
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,840
on my first day in a new job and my

69
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,519
responsibility is to make sure that my

70
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:37,360
organization is secured

71
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,080
so

72
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,519
if i go for

73
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,120
software vulnerabilities you know

74
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,000
there's i mean we have some solution so

75
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,920
you know that i have a patch management

76
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,000
product and usually

77
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,560
it goes it checks the softwares of a

78
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,319
software that is installed in my

79
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:54,560
environment and it compares it with a

80
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,760
database the cve database uh that i'm

81
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,560
sure you you're familiar with and if i

82
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,519
if this the version of the software that

83
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:04,640
i have

84
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,440
is listed as vulnerable i have to patch

85
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,239
this software and this is how i

86
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,319
mitigate the security issue this is how

87
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:13,599
i'm safe

88
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,519
but what about cloud vulnerabilities

89
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:17,360
there are some vulnerabilities in cloud

90
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,560
services

91
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,400
and the cve system doesn't cover them

92
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:23,840
so if i

93
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:26,319
what do i have to do so i read about

94
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:28,640
blogs so do i have to bookmark every

95
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,239
blog that

96
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,200
that

97
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,280
that is talking about these issues and

98
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,080
you can see some examples here to

99
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:38,480
mails or blogs that about the cloud

100
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,200
issues but none of them is is is uh

101
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,159
centralized in in one place and if i go

102
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,680
to my cloud security team dude did you

103
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,519
receive a mail like this an action

104
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:51,840
required from aws do you remember this

105
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:54,400
mail do when when you got this mail did

106
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,760
you did you remediate the issue

107
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,280
this is a

108
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,840
this is a problem that we see today and

109
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,760
now she will

110
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,920
start walking you through the issue

111
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,840
thank you

112
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,360
okay so before the cloud was introduced

113
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,360
companies and organizations were fully

114
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,120
responsible for all aspects of their

115
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,358
security from physically protecting the

116
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,358
data centers for maintaining security of

117
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,519
their network devices and also applying

118
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:22,880
security patch

119
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:26,000
to any type of software

120
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,600
but in the cloud

121
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,360
things have changed

122
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,600
companies no longer own physical data

123
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,880
centers they no longer own um servers or

124
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,840
network devices they share these those

125
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,320
services all those devices with others

126
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,960
in the cloud companies no longer

127
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,120
maintain their own storage or database

128
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:46,240
solutions

129
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,320
they use clouds managed services instead

130
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,440
so

131
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:53,600
in order to split the security

132
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,919
all the services the cloud provides us

133
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,120
as users

134
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:59,360
are no longer under our control and

135
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,280
therefore the cloud service provider

136
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,440
must be the one that's responsible for

137
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,800
protecting

138
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,800
those services

139
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,199
in order to split it in a convenient and

140
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:10,560
understandable way

141
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:12,560
the cloud service provider

142
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,400
made the shared responsibility model

143
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,320
now the show responsibility model is

144
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:19,759
pretty simple

145
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,280
everything that is owned and

146
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,520
in control of the cloud vendor

147
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,280
it's their responsibility

148
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,199
the cloud vendor is responsibility for

149
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,280
doing the physical security of the data

150
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,160
centers to maintain the network devices

151
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,680
to protect and maintain the managed

152
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,479
services and so on

153
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:40,160
on the other hand we have all the

154
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,960
responsibilities within the user side

155
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,039
everything in control of the user like

156
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:46,320
software

157
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,720
operating system configurations

158
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,199
identities access controls

159
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,960
all those are in the responsibility of

160
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,000
the user

161
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,319
and we as cloud users we need to be

162
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:59,280
responsible to maintain update apply

163
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:00,560
patches

164
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,880
on that side

165
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,280
so we've been using this model

166
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,360
for more than a decade

167
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:09,840
and it works pretty well

168
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:12,880
but we discovered that sometimes

169
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,319
it has cracks

170
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:17,039
and in these cases the outcome is messy

171
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,680
and dangerous

172
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,680
over the last several months we conduct

173
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,840
extensive cloud research and we found

174
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,280
critical vulnerabilities across

175
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:27,280
different cloud platforms

176
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,520
what we learn is some is that some of

177
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,840
those vulnerabilities

178
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,560
are not simply in the i mean

179
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,520
the responsibility of the cloud

180
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,720
providers

181
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,319
but fixing them mitigating them requires

182
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,639
the user intervention

183
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:43,440
now

184
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,160
this sometimes could be a bit confusing

185
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,319
how come a vulnerability

186
00:06:48,319 --> 00:06:49,840
that it was in the cloud provider it's a

187
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,000
cloud provider vulnerability how come

188
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,720
that the user need to fix it how does

189
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,800
that happen

190
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:58,639
so we learned that cloud vulnerabilities

191
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,160
are quite different

192
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:02,400
than software vulnerabilities

193
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:04,880
in some cases the vulnerable code is

194
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,039
running on the cloud provider side so

195
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:09,039
users cannot patch it

196
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,479
and sometimes a provider find it hard to

197
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:14,319
change the vulnerable behavior

198
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,120
in their own code because users are

199
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:19,280
relying on this behavior on the

200
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,120
vulnerable behavior and if the cloud

201
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,479
provider will change the behavior of the

202
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,639
service it could actually break the

203
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:27,360
user's environments

204
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:28,720
in other cases we see that cloud

205
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,039
vulnerabilities could also exist in

206
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:32,960
cloud configurations

207
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,720
and in default configurations provided

208
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,240
by the cloud provider

209
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,080
now this is a real change of perception

210
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,639
for users who mostly treat dangerous

211
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:41,919
configurations

212
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:42,840
as

213
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,800
misconfigurations and we came across um

214
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,360
cases where configurations that was

215
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:51,520
provided by the cloud providers by

216
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,199
default to users

217
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:55,680
and cons and used to be safe

218
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:58,560
turned to be vulnerable

219
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,000
so most of the times these

220
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,199
vulnerabilities has no cve or any other

221
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,639
identifier and no severity scoring

222
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,560
and we discover that most of the time

223
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:11,520
cloud users are unaware of those issues

224
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,840
there is no official source or database

225
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,240
that lists them and the outcome is many

226
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,039
affected cloud users

227
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:20,800
there is actually a new middle zone in

228
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,240
the middle of the show responsibility

229
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:25,520
model of new cloud issues that we didn't

230
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,520
know exist

231
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,360
it has many kind of vulnerabilities that

232
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,520
there's no standard process to handle

233
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,399
them

234
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:34,159
these vulnerabilities does not fit in

235
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:36,559
the classic show responsibility model

236
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,000
there is no identification or

237
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,399
enumeration for these issues no severity

238
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:43,200
scoring and users find it hard to track

239
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,880
in the tech instances of those

240
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,320
vulnerabilities in their own

241
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,399
environments

242
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,440
so we would like to follow with you on

243
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,000
three real life scenarios that is based

244
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
on our findings where we found cloud

245
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,680
vulnerabilities that was not handled

246
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,320
properly and users tell me still still

247
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,080
be exposed and vulnerable to this day

248
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:06,080
the first issue

249
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,839
is vulnerability we found in aws uh it's

250
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,480
a confu it's a vulnerability class it

251
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:14,560
was affecting four different aws

252
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,720
services and we introduced it in a

253
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,800
previous black hat in august like usa

254
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,640
so the source of the vulnerability in

255
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,279
that case was that amazon provided

256
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,399
customers

257
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,720
with a default

258
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,959
vulnerable configuration

259
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,560
aws mistakenly provided users with over

260
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,399
permissive resource policy

261
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,880
allowing other aws tenants to perform

262
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,640
read and write operations on vulnerable

263
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,560
users

264
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:44,480
now the vulnerability made many cloud

265
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:47,600
resources exposed to malicious actors

266
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,600
and allowed those actors the ability to

267
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,200
read and access

268
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,200
to actually access and manipulate

269
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,000
customers data

270
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,200
the vulnerabilities are pretty simple

271
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,440
here we can see a vulnerable policy

272
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,519
that was issued to the serverless

273
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,079
repository users in amazon

274
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:08,160
and as you can see on the screen we have

275
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:08,959
the

276
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,240
policies that is in response that is

277
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,760
responsible to integrate between the

278
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:16,000
serverless repository service and the s3

279
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,600
bucket of the user

280
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,160
and the problem with that policy that it

281
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,120
allows any serverless repository user to

282
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,200
access the bucket

283
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,680
now this was very surprising and we

284
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:29,519
reported this to amazon

285
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,760
and when we disclosed that they took it

286
00:10:31,760 --> 00:10:34,720
very very seriously

287
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,120
they conduct some service changes and

288
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,680
they add scoping conditions to the

289
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,160
serverless repository service and also

290
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:43,839
in the documentation

291
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:46,079
and they replace the old policy with a

292
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,000
patched one

293
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,160
and now when users come to use the

294
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,240
service and they get a documentation

295
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,399
it's guiding them to add the scoping

296
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:56,880
conditions and if they copy the default

297
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,560
policy it's already patched

298
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,240
additionally they also emailed

299
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:05,680
vulnerable customers about the issue

300
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,000
and this is the email i received in my

301
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,880
private aws account that tells me that

302
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,399
there is an action required and i need

303
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,120
to update the bucket policies for my aws

304
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,920
serverless application repository

305
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,120
so

306
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,800
amazon did a lot of things in order to

307
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,000
accumulate this

308
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,920
vulnerability

309
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:25,519
but

310
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,760
in research in research in a survey we

311
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,959
conducted

312
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,519
we found out that 90

313
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,440
of cloud users

314
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,040
are still vulnerable

315
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,240
even though we reported this

316
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,360
vulnerability almost a year ago

317
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,000
so how come so many customers are still

318
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,040
vulnerable to this vulnerability

319
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,920
so surprisingly aws cannot update and

320
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,120
mitigate

321
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:49,839
the

322
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:52,160
current policies of users aws cannot

323
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,200
edit and apply the scoping conditions

324
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:57,760
themselves on user's configuration

325
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,639
because

326
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,560
changing the user configuration could

327
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,480
break the environment it's actually

328
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,800
changing the behavior of the resource

329
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,480
and if the user is relying on this

330
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,240
functionality it will break their

331
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,440
environment

332
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:11,040
so users must apply the scoping

333
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,639
conditions themselves on their own

334
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,279
responsibility

335
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:17,519
so aws emailed vulnerable customers

336
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,440
right they send them emails they alerted

337
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,240
them please update your policies

338
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:24,959
could it be possible that users just

339
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,000
didn't treat that email or ignored it

340
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,160
wait you is anyone like is there anyone

341
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,240
like heard about this issue before or

342
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:35,600
like do you have an aws account that uh

343
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,320
okay no so i don't know if it means that

344
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,920
no one heard of it or no one received

345
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:40,580
the name

346
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:43,649
[Music]

347
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:44,639
so

348
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,720
let's see

349
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:48,800
let's start by asking yourself who is

350
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,800
receiving these emails

351
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,839
is it the it manager of the company or

352
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,320
is it someone in the r d division

353
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,639
we saw cases where it was developers who

354
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,880
were receiving those emails

355
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,800
what would they do with them i mean at

356
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,240
best they will send it to someone in

357
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,200
security but it was those emails will be

358
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,959
forgotten

359
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:11,120
another issue is tracking let's say the

360
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,639
email does find the right person in the

361
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,000
organization

362
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,440
how would they track the remediation

363
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,639
process

364
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,880
how would they prioritize it

365
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,120
security teams have so many alerts

366
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,680
vulnerabilities and incidents to handle

367
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,680
so how should they prioritize this kind

368
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,360
of email

369
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,959
is it critical

370
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:30,560
should we stop everything and mitigate

371
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,959
it now

372
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,720
maybe we can postpone it i mean there is

373
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,639
no severity scoring so you have no idea

374
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:40,800
and another issue is tracking i mean how

375
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,760
can we

376
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,360
track these issues

377
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,800
how can we know if it's already been

378
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,800
addressed in the organization how could

379
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:48,480
we know if someone already patched the

380
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,199
policies and scoped them with the proper

381
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,880
conditions

382
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,800
so the thing is that users simply lack

383
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:57,279
this information they don't know and

384
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,880
this is because the whole process of

385
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,199
mitigating cloud vulnerabilities

386
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,000
not really exist

387
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:07,440
so let's summarize this example

388
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:09,680
we learned that cloud vulnerabilities

389
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,199
uh could exist in cloud configurations

390
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,959
and remediating it requires user

391
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,399
intervention these type of

392
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,079
vulnerabilities cannot be mitigated by

393
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:19,279
the cloud provider itself and it

394
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:22,240
requires the user to take an action

395
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,720
users have no process or methodology to

396
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,639
identify prioritize and track these

397
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,720
vulnerabilities this is a new kind of

398
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:31,440
vulnerabilities usually we are like we

399
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,959
used to that we know about the

400
00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:35,040
vulnerability we know about the software

401
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,399
that is vulnerable for a specific

402
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,240
version and we know that it's our

403
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,959
responsibility to monitor that and go to

404
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:43,040
fix it but when it goes when it comes to

405
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,800
cloud vulnerabilities the process does

406
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,560
not exist and people just don't know

407
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,480
that the cloud could be

408
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,399
vulnerable

409
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,839
and the result is that most users are

410
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,920
still vulnerable

411
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:56,560
and okay let's continue with the next

412
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,399
example

413
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,560
thank you

414
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,000
okay so the first example was about the

415
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,160
configuration now the second example is

416
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,120
about cloud middleware so first what is

417
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,360
cloud middleware

418
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:13,279
cloudwood delmer is a collection of

419
00:15:13,279 --> 00:15:15,040
software that is used to integrate

420
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,600
between customer vms to cloud managed

421
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:18,800
services

422
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,839
and

423
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:20,800
like

424
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:23,040
what does it mean sometimes when you

425
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,160
deploy some of the cloud services in

426
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,240
order to manage your vms they need to

427
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:31,440
install some kind of an agent um

428
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,560
and and this agent in many cases is

429
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,160
installed silently you don't know about

430
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,880
it so one case is the

431
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,720
omi omi is a very a popular agent used

432
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,079
by um

433
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,800
by azure on linux vms when they want to

434
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,639
manage linux vm

435
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,600
and we we know that it's like

436
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:55,199
60 of uh azure customers have this uh

437
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,519
this agent um

438
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:58,240
so

439
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:01,440
we found um four vulnerabilities in omi

440
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,000
without them oh my god because

441
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,000
we thought it would be funny and

442
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,920
the worst of them enable a remote

443
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,839
attacker to execute code with the

444
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:13,120
highest privileges on on a vm uh root

445
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,440
privileges and

446
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:18,320
it put thousands of consumers at risks

447
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:20,320
at risk because this agent is really

448
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,639
really popular

449
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:25,199
now uh

450
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,199
microsoft let's see how they handle it

451
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,000
so uh they published it they issued four

452
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,160
different cves so it's something okay we

453
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,519
know cvs um on september 21 is part of

454
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:37,839
patch tuesday one of them was in rcs i

455
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:40,320
told you three lpas with even they had a

456
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,360
severity and they asked the customers to

457
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,839
update their omi agents

458
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:47,839
but as i told before customers didn't

459
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:50,160
even know that this agent exists in

460
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,519
their environment

461
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:52,720
and

462
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,800
i mean it's a

463
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,560
you know it's something really weird to

464
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,120
us i mean oh please update it but you

465
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:00,720
don't know that it's there and there is

466
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,199
this tweet by kevin it went viral and i

467
00:17:03,199 --> 00:17:05,439
think that he summarized it very well so

468
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:07,199
microsoft don't have an auto update

469
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,359
mechanism so now you need to manually

470
00:17:09,359 --> 00:17:11,199
upgrade the agents you didn't know

471
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:13,359
existed as you didn't know

472
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:17,879
as as you did install them

473
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,760
now this is not even the end so we

474
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:23,280
believe that the real turning point is

475
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,599
that eight different azure services were

476
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,319
impacted by by this vulnerability and

477
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,000
some of them are really popular like log

478
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,080
analytics azure automation sentinel and

479
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,160
more and usually when we work with cve

480
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,440
we correlate it with cpe the common

481
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,240
platform enumeration and this is how you

482
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,280
know using the cpe you know how which

483
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,160
products are affected by the cve now in

484
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,280
this case

485
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:51,760
the cpe must have been the vulnerable

486
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,480
azure services it is really i mean it is

487
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:57,360
really unprecedented to to add to a to a

488
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,960
cve the services that are affected by by

489
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,679
it but we we believe that it is must

490
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:06,160
have been done in this case now today

491
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,960
actually when you go to the cve page uh

492
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,000
on on the msrc's portal you can see the

493
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,160
names of the services but initially when

494
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,360
they published it it wasn't there so

495
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,039
if i summarize

496
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,760
the the the problem is that microsoft

497
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,360
had a cve

498
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,760
but customers didn't have any way to

499
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:28,400
know if they are vulnerable if it's like

500
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,320
if this issue is relevant to them and

501
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,400
which azure services are affected by

502
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,360
this

503
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:34,640
by

504
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:37,280
by this vulnerability and eventually as

505
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,799
i said microsoft responded it took them

506
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:41,039
like two two or three days after patch

507
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,520
tuesday and they had

508
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,160
sorry they had this um guidance that

509
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:48,880
they published and they decided to to

510
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,799
deploy auto update for these agents i

511
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:51,679
mean

512
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:53,360
we have to say like

513
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,160
they responded well but it took them

514
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:58,160
three days

515
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,039
but

516
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,559
this response came after this

517
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:03,440
vulnerability uh has been exploited in

518
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:06,240
the wild malicious actors so understood

519
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,400
the issue understood that most customers

520
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,880
are vulnerable and there's a an exploit

521
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:12,559
that they can use

522
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,640
and and they started

523
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:18,400
exploiting it and consumers were at risk

524
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,400
so let's summarize it

525
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,559
first so we learned from this example

526
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:24,480
that vulnerabilities can be found in

527
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,320
pre-installed middleware so you know

528
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,880
shear showed us before that we have the

529
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,440
csp side what is in the csp ownership

530
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:34,720
and we have the the user side but there

531
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,400
are some another you see something in

532
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,600
the middle that is um the software that

533
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:42,880
the csp installs on the user machine on

534
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:45,280
the on the machine that the user manages

535
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:48,000
so it's it's a quite like a new

536
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,720
situation and we need a system we need a

537
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,799
way to handle it so first we believe

538
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,720
that we need identification it's not

539
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,120
only a software vulnerabilities if azure

540
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,400
services are affected we need a way to

541
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:02,720
to identify it we need a way to have a

542
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:05,120
unique identification and we got we can

543
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,000
just treat it as like the issue with the

544
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,640
omi that affects some services it's it's

545
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:13,520
really difficult to discuss it this way

546
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:15,440
then we need better transparency we need

547
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,880
microsoft to tell us

548
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,880
when you have this vulnerability all

549
00:20:18,880 --> 00:20:21,440
these services are affected

550
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,039
and then there should be an easy

551
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,880
tracking system

552
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,039
in in if you went to your azure portal

553
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:29,200
it was really difficult for you to know

554
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,679
that you are affected that you have now

555
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,280
machines that are vulnerable and we

556
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,880
believe that it should be easier to

557
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:36,799
track and understand whether

558
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:38,720
you have this issue

559
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,799
lastly remediation so in this case um

560
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:46,320
the the i mean microsoft asked customers

561
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,640
to remediate it themselves and change

562
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,320
the way they uh

563
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,120
they

564
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,120
their guidance a few days later and we

565
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,440
believe that for the cloud we deliver we

566
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,240
should have a very um like a clear

567
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:00,080
process and it doesn't have to be a

568
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,080
process that we think about only after

569
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,919
the vulnerability was released it should

570
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,919
be a process that you know of because we

571
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:07,840
know that the cloud mill the cloud

572
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:10,720
middleware is there

573
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,679
for the third example let's talk a bit

574
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:16,640
about

575
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,200
chaos db ksdb was an unprecedented

576
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,400
vulnerability cross-account

577
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:23,120
vulnerability in azure cosmos db and

578
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:25,520
just yesterday niran sagi from our team

579
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:27,760
presented it here in black cat

580
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,280
um

581
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:32,000
so cosmos db is a very popular managed

582
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,880
service um that is used among a lot of

583
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,960
azure customers

584
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:38,400
and the case they be incident

585
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,640
vulnerability was that customers access

586
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:42,640
keys were accessible and made it

587
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,559
possible for malicious actors to perform

588
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:46,320
read and write operations on their

589
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,840
databases

590
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:49,360
so when we disclose this issue to

591
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,640
microsoft

592
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,960
they handle it very fast in a record

593
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,799
speed and they remove the vulnerable

594
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,640
feature within 48 hours

595
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,520
but

596
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,400
customers access tokens has been exposed

597
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:05,919
and had to be revoked and regenerated

598
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,120
so

599
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,200
the thing is that microsoft cannot

600
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,320
regenerated keys of their own customers

601
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,080
because if i'm a customer and i'm using

602
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,799
this key in my production environment

603
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,880
if microsoft if azure will revoke it it

604
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,720
will break my environment

605
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,720
so this is why users were required to

606
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,880
take an action and regenerate their own

607
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,919
keys so to inform the affected users

608
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,480
microsoft emailed them and urged them to

609
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,799
regenerate their keys

610
00:22:32,799 --> 00:22:34,559
the thing here is that people receive

611
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,280
this email that requires them it says

612
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,440
action required and

613
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:40,720
actually it's not the email this is the

614
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,600
psa so they received an email that says

615
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,840
um action required you must regenerate

616
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,960
your keys

617
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,280
but it didn't damon was lacking a lot of

618
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:51,200
information

619
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:52,720
microsoft at the beginning didn't want

620
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,880
to publish anything beside the email

621
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,600
like this blog post and they didn't

622
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,159
disclose the type the time frame well

623
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,000
customers were vulnerable and they

624
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,760
potentially exposed

625
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,440
so the remediation process was a bit

626
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,280
unclear people really didn't know if

627
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,520
they were compromised if the keys were

628
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,720
compromised

629
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,240
many users that did not receive the

630
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:14,480
email were very confused they tried to

631
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,559
figure out if they had the vulnerable

632
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:18,159
feature enabled in this case it was the

633
00:23:18,159 --> 00:23:19,840
jupiter notebook

634
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,760
it was very hard

635
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:24,080
even impossible to detect

636
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,480
so microsoft saw the gap and they

637
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:29,440
decided to do to publish a blog about it

638
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,720
but it was still lacking a lot of

639
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,400
information

640
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,880
and in addition as we mentioned in the

641
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,360
previous examples this issue just like

642
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,280
the others he didn't have any official

643
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,080
identifier or detection rules which make

644
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,000
it very hard for users to remediate and

645
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,880
track the process how do i know if the

646
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,279
keys in my organization has already been

647
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:51,039
regenerated

648
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:52,880
if i'm a new cso that chemistry

649
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,799
organization i don't know i don't have a

650
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,159
track of that when the keys was

651
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,480
regenerated

652
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,240
so all those questions could not and so

653
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,159
easily

654
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,320
so if we summarize this example we

655
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,720
learned that leaked access keys could be

656
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,480
handled could not be handled by the csp

657
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:11,039
alone and requires a user intervention

658
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,880
there is no detection rules or guidance

659
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,360
for customers which was making which is

660
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:18,000
making the very hard to treat and track

661
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,960
those issues is there is no standard of

662
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:23,440
how to handle this kind of issues

663
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:25,039
and again

664
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:27,120
users need much more information and

665
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,799
much more transparency for club

666
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,440
providers

667
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:32,640
so

668
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,640
to summarize the

669
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,880
the three examples

670
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,159
the first thing we

671
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,159
learned is that there is no standard

672
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,159
notification channel

673
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:44,400
cloud providers use emails and internal

674
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,120
dashboards to notify customers

675
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,960
but this is not it's barely enough

676
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,960
they use the same channels to notify a

677
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:55,840
lot of things not just security things

678
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:58,080
and it's very confusing because who is

679
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,200
receiving these emails in the

680
00:24:59,200 --> 00:25:01,760
organization if if they send

681
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:03,919
non-security stuff so i want my i.t to

682
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:06,159
receive it if it's security stuff i want

683
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,559
to receive it

684
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,559
moreover security people often find

685
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,080
themselves confused and like the ability

686
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:14,320
to track and remediate because they

687
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:15,919
don't have a process to handle those

688
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:17,360
emails

689
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:20,400
another basic a big issue is the less of

690
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,039
the lack of standard severity scoring

691
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:23,919
um

692
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,240
because those emails usually contain

693
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:26,960
like

694
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,520
critical or action required

695
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:31,039
it's not enough for us to prioritize

696
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:33,039
those emails and we don't know where and

697
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,520
when we should treat them

698
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:38,240
and again we come back to transparency

699
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:39,919
we believe that some of those

700
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,000
vulnerabilities we never heard of

701
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,240
because usually we get the emails the

702
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:47,520
action required emails only if the csp

703
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:49,120
suspects that our environment is

704
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:52,400
vulnerable right now but what happens if

705
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,600
my

706
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,080
environment will become vulnerable in

707
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,200
two months

708
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:59,520
if by accident i will apply a vulnerable

709
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,039
configuration

710
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:02,880
i will not receive this email again

711
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,679
there is no continuous process to to

712
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:07,279
track if those

713
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,000
vulnerabilities affecting me and the the

714
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:12,400
the the transparency issue is that we

715
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,559
don't have a database that lists all the

716
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:15,600
issues

717
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:18,000
with as cloud customers would like to

718
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:19,679
know about all the vulnerabilities not

719
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,760
just the ones that affect us today and

720
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,600
right now

721
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,440
and all the vulnerabilities we show you

722
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,279
it's we know all the all the details

723
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,440
about them because we are the one who

724
00:26:29,440 --> 00:26:30,880
found them and we disclosed them with

725
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,400
the vendo and we pressured the vendor

726
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:34,240
and we got a lot of details from them

727
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:35,919
but we believe that other researchers in

728
00:26:35,919 --> 00:26:36,880
the world also report card

729
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,720
vulnerabilities and we just don't know

730
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:41,520
anything about them

731
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:47,120
okay so um now we would like to uh to

732
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,720
move in these are the five points so

733
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,600
shiro explained them brilliantly now um

734
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,279
first what you need to remember this is

735
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,799
what we want you to take from this part

736
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,799
that first vulnerabilities are not only

737
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:58,799
in code and software vulnerabilities can

738
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,679
be in configuration um

739
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,720
related to keys and many other issues so

740
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,400
this is one thing we have to remember

741
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,080
and this is why the current system the

742
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,760
cve system doesn't cover other

743
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,279
vulnerabilities

744
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:14,080
then uh there are five five things that

745
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,919
we want you to remember what we think

746
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:18,240
that we lack today the identification

747
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:20,399
tracking system transparency

748
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,559
severity standardization and remediation

749
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,320
steps

750
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,120
now on top of that when this

751
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:28,960
previous like the last slide we've got

752
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,720
what we need for every vulnerability but

753
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,919
we also need

754
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,559
one place where all the vulnerabilities

755
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:35,840
will be

756
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:37,760
stored and all the information about

757
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,440
them will destroy the centralized

758
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,080
database and it must be public for

759
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,279
anyone to use

760
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,360
for cloud users who want to track their

761
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:48,080
own environment and for security vendors

762
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:49,520
want to integrate it with their

763
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,880
solutions

764
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,120
this database can only be fed

765
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,520
from the cloud providers themselves

766
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:57,600
and we believe that it is the shared

767
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:59,600
interest of the cloud providers and the

768
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:01,520
cloud users i mean this is the way if we

769
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,279
do if we have this collaboration and we

770
00:28:03,279 --> 00:28:05,919
have this all this information public

771
00:28:05,919 --> 00:28:08,080
we will be i mean we will all be more

772
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:09,919
secured

773
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,799
and to give you a taste of how it should

774
00:28:12,799 --> 00:28:15,760
look let's go over the third example the

775
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:18,399
cursed db example um

776
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:21,039
and let's see how let's imagine together

777
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:23,520
how it will look like so first of all we

778
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:26,799
have an id so we chose a just a

779
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,840
random identifier for it

780
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,440
and again it's it's difficult when

781
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,440
microsoft wrote about this issue so it

782
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:36,000
was regarding the issue on cosmos db but

783
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:37,120
you know what happens when there's

784
00:28:37,120 --> 00:28:38,640
another one if there's another eastern

785
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,559
cosmos db how do you know which one to

786
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:42,159
treat it's really difficult to reference

787
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:44,000
them this way so first we give it an

788
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,640
identifier

789
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:49,840
then as she also explained we need to to

790
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:50,640
have

791
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,760
a system to decide and determine what is

792
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:55,760
the severity of the issue because today

793
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,360
we get you know you get a mail with

794
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,320
action required a severe issue or just a

795
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,559
configuration issue we must have some

796
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,960
kind of a system and for the cve for

797
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:06,880
vulnerabilities we have the cvss system

798
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,240
which is kind of

799
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:10,559
an agreed way

800
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:13,120
to uh to rank different vulnerabilities

801
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,600
and now if we have one vulnerability in

802
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,559
cosmos db and one in aws i have to know

803
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,559
how to prioritize which one is more

804
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:22,799
important to handle and this system

805
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:27,120
should be universal for all csps

806
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,520
transparency so here for transparency we

807
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:32,240
have a few different uh

808
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:34,799
points so one we have to know which

809
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,440
product is affected for so for casdb

810
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,840
it's the azure cosmos db it's quite easy

811
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,399
but if you remember for omi the example

812
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:44,159
that i showed

813
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:46,240
it was more difficult and you i mean you

814
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,840
had different services and microsoft

815
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,679
didn't even publish it at the first

816
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:50,880
place

817
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:53,279
then since for cloud services there is

818
00:29:53,279 --> 00:29:55,360
no version when you use a cloud service

819
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:56,480
you don't know what is the version

820
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,480
because the code is running uh

821
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,480
on the csp side

822
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,960
so you have to let a customer know

823
00:30:02,960 --> 00:30:05,440
to give them the tools to know when

824
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,399
he was affected or if he was affected

825
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:09,520
and

826
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:11,760
for that we we suggest using the time

827
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:13,919
effect and i mean it's writing a time

828
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:16,720
when uh when if you use the service then

829
00:30:16,720 --> 00:30:19,440
it means that you are affected lastly

830
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,279
the risk what is the risk i mean you are

831
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,120
vulnerable what could have happened to

832
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:25,600
your data it has to be really clear and

833
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,320
really uh understood and for kills the b

834
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:30,240
for example at the first place microsoft

835
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,559
didn't even want to publish any any

836
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,520
anything about it and we believe that

837
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,440
the transparency and that customers will

838
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,520
be able to understand the risk and and

839
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,279
choose themselves i mean it's not only

840
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:43,120
up to the csp customers who have the

841
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:45,919
power to understand whether they i mean

842
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,840
whether the information

843
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:49,520
was compromised or whether they have to

844
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,919
to take some actions in order to

845
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:54,159
remediate it it's not only the csps that

846
00:30:54,159 --> 00:30:57,120
you decide about that

847
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,559
and remediation um we showed you each of

848
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,480
the examples we showed you required

849
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,640
different remediation actions and you

850
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:06,640
know with with software it was quite

851
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,799
easy you have a cve and you know if you

852
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,720
check if the vulnerable version is in

853
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:15,360
your organization if you have it you

854
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,519
patch it and then you are safe

855
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:21,200
unless it's exchanging then you are not

856
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,480
um

857
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,559
and and uh

858
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,000
yeah so

859
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:28,000
you must have really clear remediation

860
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:31,600
steps um to to help customers understand

861
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:32,799
how to remediate the issue because

862
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:36,480
there's no standard in that

863
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:39,440
and there's another item that that we

864
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,440
thought that could be if we trying to do

865
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,440
things better maybe we should have it as

866
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,159
well

867
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:46,399
a way to detect it so

868
00:31:46,399 --> 00:31:48,159
again for cloud

869
00:31:48,159 --> 00:31:50,720
cloud services it's quite difficult to

870
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,720
find i mean

871
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,320
how i mean if you are vulnerable or not

872
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:55,760
because it can be configuration it can

873
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,320
be if you regenerated keys so we propose

874
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,440
to add a reg rule rego is is a cspm

875
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,640
language i don't know if you know but

876
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,080
it's some kind of a script language you

877
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:05,840
can run it in your cloud it makes some

878
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,919
checks and can tell you if if your

879
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,120
configuration is is uh is okay or not

880
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,039
so we propose if we do we are trying to

881
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:16,159
do things right now let's also

882
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:18,720
ask for four rules i mean how can i

883
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:21,679
detect whether my environment is is

884
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:24,159
vulnerable or not

885
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:26,320
and here you see this is some kind of an

886
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,799
example for for the table uh this is how

887
00:32:28,799 --> 00:32:30,159
the database would look like we will

888
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,240
have different issues and this this one

889
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,799
is only a mock-up it's not it's not real

890
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,720
um but

891
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,399
but you'll have all these issues this

892
00:32:38,399 --> 00:32:40,720
information will be public and

893
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,559
everyone who starts who wants to

894
00:32:42,559 --> 00:32:45,039
evaluate their security posture will be

895
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:47,519
able to use it and also cloud

896
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,200
some other security vendors will be able

897
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,519
to integrate it with their products in

898
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,279
order to help customers secure

899
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:54,399
themselves

900
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,159
and there's actually a funny story about

901
00:32:56,159 --> 00:32:58,080
that so i don't know like how many of

902
00:32:58,080 --> 00:33:00,880
you here are um like uh really our

903
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,960
practitioners who have to keep

904
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,919
organizations safe but um we showed it

905
00:33:05,919 --> 00:33:08,799
to someone who that it is is a real job

906
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,200
and he asked me how can how can i get it

907
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:14,000
like where does this database is located

908
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,279
and we told them that we did it only

909
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:16,480
like to

910
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,880
demonstrate but but i think for us it

911
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,640
really showed that there is a need

912
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,000
for this database

913
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,559
so let's get back um

914
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,000
if you remember the beginning of the

915
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,080
talk i was a cesar in on his first day

916
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,279
of uh of the job and i told you that if

917
00:33:31,279 --> 00:33:33,279
for cloud vulnerabilities i don't have

918
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:34,399
any way

919
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,159
to check whether i'm vulnerable or not i

920
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:39,840
don't even have a way to find which

921
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,440
which what is the latest cloud

922
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,919
vulnerability how do you do it

923
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:46,960
um so if i have now this database and i

924
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,880
have all this information

925
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:51,840
um i believe that it will make a work

926
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,320
much much more easier and i'll be able

927
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:56,880
to ensure that my organization is

928
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,399
secured

929
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,120
more easily

930
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:04,480
okay so what's next so that was i mean

931
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:06,159
we tried to explain and convince you

932
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:08,000
that there is a problem we propose the

933
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:10,079
solution but how do we i mean we don't

934
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:11,839
want to just talk about the solution how

935
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:16,800
do we make csps make these changes

936
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,399
so first we would like to um

937
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,239
we would like to ask you to join to our

938
00:34:22,239 --> 00:34:24,639
community we have a slack community with

939
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,599
a group of people that really care about

940
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,359
this issue and would like to promote the

941
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:31,119
initiative of a cloud vulnerability

942
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,639
database open for all we have more than

943
00:34:33,639 --> 00:34:35,599
130 members

944
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:37,520
from all over the world and from all

945
00:34:37,520 --> 00:34:40,399
over the industry from finance companies

946
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,960
security data fortune 500

947
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:43,839
and

948
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:45,440
all of us are thinking together in the

949
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:48,159
slag group how to promote it how to push

950
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:49,679
it and put some pressure on cloud

951
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,918
providers and make it happen so that all

952
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:54,480
of us could enjoy this database so i

953
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:56,399
would like all of you to think about

954
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:57,599
joining us

955
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,560
and join us with the initiative

956
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,800
yeah and actually a lot of the ideas

957
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,720
that that we shared with you today and

958
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,480
the way we understood the problem in our

959
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:08,640
proposal is based on discussions and

960
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,960
meetings that we have in this group so

961
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:13,280
this is like there are people out there

962
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,960
who care about it and

963
00:35:14,960 --> 00:35:18,480
and believe that the problem uh

964
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,320
that it's a real problem and they are

965
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:22,880
ready to take action and speaking of

966
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:25,839
that we have other projects i i mean we

967
00:35:25,839 --> 00:35:27,920
we are not the only ones uh who work on

968
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,800
that and there's also the csnf project

969
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:32,400
and there's csa the cloud security

970
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,400
alliance they have photos for unified

971
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:37,760
cloud identifiers miter the the

972
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:40,000
organization that uh works on like the

973
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,160
the real the original cvs they are now

974
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,920
trying we're actually working with them

975
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,280
on on

976
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:49,119
on how cve can be applied to uh to the

977
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:50,000
cloud

978
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,079
but the bottom line here is that there

979
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:54,160
are many different projects and you know

980
00:35:54,160 --> 00:35:56,400
none of them has succeeded in in

981
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,119
changing reality and we believe i mean

982
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:00,640
it's okay we're trying to collaborate

983
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,640
we're actually working with with all of

984
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,880
them but it takes time and we believe

985
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,800
that it's not only up to some people who

986
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,400
think about it it's about how the

987
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:10,960
industry reacts and we really want you

988
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:13,280
that that the next time that

989
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,079
you receive an email from aws

990
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:19,359
uh about an issue or an email from azure

991
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:21,280
about a cloud issue

992
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:24,400
how about to reply and tell them okay

993
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:26,480
i don't say why there is no

994
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,640
identification to this issue how can i

995
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,720
track it how can i make sure that in six

996
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:31,599
months

997
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:34,240
this issue doesn't uh repeat in my

998
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,119
organization ask for more details and we

999
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:38,960
believe that all

1000
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,040
all these questions it can make them

1001
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:43,280
understand that we care about our

1002
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,200
security and we want to know this

1003
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,480
information

1004
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,920
and

1005
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,560
yeah so

1006
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:54,200
yeah okay

1007
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:57,839
so the the bottom line is that the power

1008
00:36:57,839 --> 00:37:00,160
is in your hand and we believe that the

1009
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,000
way the real way i mean we have this

1010
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:04,400
proposal we we are going to promote it

1011
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,599
and

1012
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,760
we really believe that we should have

1013
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,599
more power against the csps and we

1014
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:12,880
should be clear that we want uh we want

1015
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:14,720
more security and we deserve more

1016
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:16,400
security and

1017
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,880
we this is the way the path is to make

1018
00:37:18,880 --> 00:37:20,560
them when you sign the next deal when

1019
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:23,200
aws how about bringing up these issues

1020
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:25,119
and asking them and if we'll keep asking

1021
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:27,680
them these issues we believe that

1022
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,640
eventually the issue they'll start there

1023
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,880
reacting and we will be able to more

1024
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,079
secure

1025
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:36,400
yeah during our disclosure when this

1026
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,480
closed vulnerability to aws a lot of

1027
00:37:38,480 --> 00:37:40,720
time when we see that they don't publish

1028
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:43,359
enough details or when they don't um

1029
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:45,760
tell how to track it or give remediation

1030
00:37:45,760 --> 00:37:47,839
guidance we put pressure on them because

1031
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:49,440
we know how important it is for the

1032
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:52,400
community and also for our customers so

1033
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,800
we see that pressure actually works so

1034
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,520
we really want you to guys to put some

1035
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,760
pressure on the cloud providers and this

1036
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:03,720
is the only way to make it happen

1037
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:05,520
thank you very much

1038
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,839

00:38:42,480 --> 00:38:44,640
been a pleasure for us to to present

1057
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:47,640
here

1058
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:51,598
so now questions and comments

1059
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,040
yeah

1060
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,599
sure

1061
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:04,560
so uh thanks i like the initiative hence

1062
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,560
the comment um

1063
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,480
i would like to comment on the first

1064
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:11,839
issue that was the aws correct yes yeah

1065
00:39:11,839 --> 00:39:12,960
so um

1066
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,200
of course the cloud vendors need to take

1067
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,800
some responsibility

1068
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,920
uh i think that was a

1069
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:21,839
good example of a very irresponsible

1070
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:25,200
email because it did not mention i'm not

1071
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,320
if you can

1072
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:28,400
just show it

1073
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,440
did not mention the word vulnerability

1074
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:32,400
right

1075
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:35,920
uh it was worded to me like a marketing

1076
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,440
email

1077
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:43,000
hey dear user we have now added features

1078
00:39:43,359 --> 00:39:45,040
it does mention the action required but

1079
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,720
let's see yes yes it does mention

1080
00:39:46,720 --> 00:39:48,400
actually required yes but what action

1081
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:50,880
why would i take action should i act on

1082
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,400
a new feature that they now have

1083
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:54,320
released that i could potentially take

1084
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:57,920
into use and and and and have fun with

1085
00:39:57,920 --> 00:40:00,079
uh it does not tell me that there may be

1086
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:02,880
a potential business impact to date i'm

1087
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:05,040
using so this is worded in a way that

1088
00:40:05,040 --> 00:40:06,560
they clearly they're trying to wash

1089
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,000
their hands of this this issue so so i

1090
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,160
think the the

1091
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:16,000
your your 130 plus working group i will

1092
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:18,160
join that and comment more there but but

1093
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,160
um

1094
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,000
do any of the

1095
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:26,160
cloud vendors the providers uh

1096
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:29,040
participate in this because if they

1097
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:31,040
don't change their wordings in their

1098
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:32,319
emails

1099
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:34,160
i think it's an indicator of they are

1100
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,640
not interested in providing this

1101
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:38,560
information that would be crucial for us

1102
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:40,319
to actually understand if it's a nice

1103
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:42,560
feature that we could now act on or if

1104
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:44,960
it's a vulnerability with a business

1105
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:45,839
impact

1106
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:47,520
yes um

1107
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:48,960
all right thank you

1108
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:51,599
um i would say that the

1109
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:53,200
we do have some people from the cloud

1110
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,760
providers in our group but

1111
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,520
they're not representing the cloud

1112
00:40:57,520 --> 00:40:59,200
providers some of them are just

1113
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:02,560
personally um taking um the initiative

1114
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,960
um and regarding this email amazon did a

1115
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:06,640
lot of changes it's not just html they

1116
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:09,280
also had configurations but i agree that

1117
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,359
the wording here is very

1118
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:14,480
soft yeah and what's your name

1119
00:41:14,480 --> 00:41:17,040
no what's your name

1120
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,800
and it's closed okay okay so you can

1121
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,000
tell me

1122
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,839
later because what we expect to see you

1123
00:41:21,839 --> 00:41:24,640
in in the community but um

1124
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,319
yeah we were also walking like directly

1125
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,079
for example like we are meeting msrc

1126
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:29,839
today i mean we also have other passes

1127
00:41:29,839 --> 00:41:31,359
because you know that we know that it

1128
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:33,119
might be difficult for them to be part

1129
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:34,319
of this uh

1130
00:41:34,319 --> 00:41:36,079
community so we are also working like

1131
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,000
directly with them and we see that they

1132
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:39,440
respond and they also care it's

1133
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,720
something difficult for them but they

1134
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:43,200
also care

1135
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,359
so um i

1136
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:47,040
i think it's a great idea to have a

1137
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:48,720
place where you have the missing

1138
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,040
information that you have mentioned

1139
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,440
i i question though the idea of having

1140
00:41:53,440 --> 00:41:56,720
yet another new identifier as opposed to

1141
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,280
simply enrich cve because

1142
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:00,800
i mean it's quite funny for me it's kind

1143
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,640
of back to the future because 30 years

1144
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,160
ago i was involved in the discussion to

1145
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,000
create cve so

1146
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:07,680
cv is just

1147
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:11,040
just a key right it's just a number

1148
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:13,599
the goal was from the beginning so that

1149
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:15,920
it's the simplest it can be with zero

1150
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:18,160
information just an identifier so that

1151
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:20,560
as many others can actually use that as

1152
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,760
a foreign key as a unit united pointer

1153
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,800
yes and now if you try to come up with

1154
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,760
yet another identifier then it it gets

1155
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,280
things confused you you gave this

1156
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,760
example of mi which has

1157
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:35,359
a cve number

1158
00:42:35,359 --> 00:42:36,079
so

1159
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:37,280
then

1160
00:42:37,280 --> 00:42:39,680
what we would have one in your system

1161
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:41,359
and another one in the

1162
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:43,839
you see so i think it's um so yeah it's

1163
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:46,400
a bit confusing if you want to have uh

1164
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:47,760
your unique

1165
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:51,440
identifier so we don't claim that

1166
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,280
we don't really it's not that we need a

1167
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:55,680
new identifier the thing is that cv is

1168
00:42:55,680 --> 00:42:58,640
not just an identifier it's also a

1169
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,359
format a standard and it has certain

1170
00:43:01,359 --> 00:43:04,400
fields and certain integrations and not

1171
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,440
always it works um it's fits for cloud

1172
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,599
vulnerabilities but the thing is that we

1173
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:11,520
don't we don't um claim to have the

1174
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,400
solution

1175
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,839
yeah it's just like a community

1176
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:16,960
discussion and extending the cv is

1177
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:18,720
one of the one of the good ideas that we

1178
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,079
that people consider in the in the

1179
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:21,680
community yeah we're actually going to

1180
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:23,520
present it i'll just say so we don't i

1181
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:25,680
mean we suggested you know and identify

1182
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,599
which is not severe because we know that

1183
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:29,200
there are some people like in our

1184
00:43:29,200 --> 00:43:30,640
community that really don't believe that

1185
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:32,480
this is the path to the solution and i

1186
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,000
have to say that i mean eventually what

1187
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,760
we first need is an identifier and i

1188
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,599
really agree that it might be confusing

1189
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:39,200
i mean we don't say we must have a

1190
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,200
different identifier and we are also

1191
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,960
going to present this meeting to mitre

1192
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:45,119
like to the guys who work on cve as part

1193
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:48,560
of their uh um like extend in

1194
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:52,000
discussions of cv to the cloud so we but

1195
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,760
in we know it takes them time they are

1196
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:55,760
more like uh takes them more time to to

1197
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:57,440
react and change

1198
00:43:57,440 --> 00:43:58,960
and we believe that we need a faster

1199
00:43:58,960 --> 00:44:00,400
solution so

1200
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,160
we don't know exactly how how is it

1201
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:04,000
going to look like and i really agree

1202
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:05,520
that it will be confusing to have

1203
00:44:05,520 --> 00:44:07,599
another identifier

1204
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:10,079
but so we we're more like a

1205
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:11,680
generally speaking that there there is a

1206
00:44:11,680 --> 00:44:13,760
need for identifier we don't like

1207
00:44:13,760 --> 00:44:15,280
it doesn't necessarily have to be a new

1208
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:19,040
one yeah i mean i i'm not in favor of

1209
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:21,200
extending and extending i think cve is

1210
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:23,280
already it should have remained what it

1211
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,240
was supposed to be just an identifier

1212
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:29,040
with a clear description

1213
00:44:29,040 --> 00:44:31,520
and then have as many as other as many

1214
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:33,280
as we want other databases that that

1215
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:34,880
point to that and complement with the

1216
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:36,800
detection with the severity with

1217
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,240
whatever and i think what you do

1218
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,640
separately for cloud is great

1219
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,560
but um

1220
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,119
because if you if you keep enriching cve

1221
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:46,880
what's going to happen is you will have

1222
00:44:46,880 --> 00:44:48,400
the same thing that was happened with

1223
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:50,640
the idmf for intrusion detection at the

1224
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:53,200
ietf which is like this huge standard

1225
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:56,560
that took three years to just uh reach

1226
00:44:56,560 --> 00:44:58,319
some consensus

1227
00:44:58,319 --> 00:45:00,720
and that nobody uses at the end which is

1228
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,520
which is kind of stupid yeah

1229
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,119
thank you thank you and i hope you also

1230
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:06,319
join

1231
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:08,160
the community

1232
00:45:08,160 --> 00:45:09,760
um first of all thank you it was

1233
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,560
brilliant um i'll also um join your

1234
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,560
group going back to your proposal i was

1235
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,240
curious you mentioned five different

1236
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,960
items or categories what led you to

1237
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:22,400
select these five in particular

1238
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:24,240
you're referring to a notification and

1239
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,599
that's very yeah

1240
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:28,319
so i i think uh this is what we came up

1241
00:45:28,319 --> 00:45:30,079
from the discussions we had so in our

1242
00:45:30,079 --> 00:45:32,000
group we we took some examples and

1243
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:33,839
additional examples not that these only

1244
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:35,760
three and try to see

1245
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,040
what uh

1246
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:39,119
like which different categories do we

1247
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:41,280
need to have there and again we are not

1248
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:43,599
saying that these are the only five or

1249
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:45,680
it must be only these five or maybe

1250
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,520
there's one that i mean doesn't even to

1251
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,400
to even be there but uh

1252
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:51,599
um

1253
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:53,760
but i mean this is how we we saw that we

1254
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:55,280
can analyze the issues and provide the

1255
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,200
best information for them and of course

1256
00:45:57,200 --> 00:45:59,599
if you have you're thinking else and you

1257
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:01,119
have a different opinion we'd like to

1258
00:46:01,119 --> 00:46:03,440
hear that and and to change it and i

1259
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:06,480
assume that since cloud issues uh vary

1260
00:46:06,480 --> 00:46:08,560
and there are like very different issues

1261
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:10,480
so we will probably need i mean some

1262
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:12,160
some of them won't have time affected

1263
00:46:12,160 --> 00:46:13,920
and some of them will and maybe they

1264
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:16,000
will need more details for a specific

1265
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,599
new type of issue that we've never faced

1266
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,720
before so it it has to be like

1267
00:46:20,720 --> 00:46:22,640
like an agile walk and

1268
00:46:22,640 --> 00:46:24,560
that we'll learn from

1269
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:28,279
thanks thank you

1270
00:46:28,319 --> 00:46:31,800
