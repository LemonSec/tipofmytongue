called we wait because we know you

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,920
inside the ransom negotiation economics

5
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,560
my name is bobinhock and i'm a cyber

6
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:25,279
security analyst at fox iit i've been at

7
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:27,519
several departments now

8
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,000
and i have a background in criminology

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,238

10
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,640
i'll give be giving this presentation

11
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,719
together with zong you

12
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:39,760

woo and i'm the guy who really tear

15
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:46,480
ransomware apart

16
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,559
and i'm working at the threat intel

17
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,879
department as a threat analyst so my

18
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,360
daily job is reversing the malware

19
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:57,800
building automatic analysis platform

20
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,840
thanks

21
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,680
so

22
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:03,680
let's set the stage what were we talking

23
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:04,959
about

24
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:08,240
um i want you to imagine you're the ceo

25
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,040
of a company and it's 1 30 on a saturday

26
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,600
morning and you just received a phone

27
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,320
call from the head of your rt department

28
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,479
when you arrive at the office he tells

29
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,479
you that your company got hacked and

30
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,560
infected with ransomware

31
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,640
after assessing the damage and

32
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,880
assembling your crisis management team

33
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,920
you open the ransom notes the demand is

34
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,400
three and a half million dollars

35
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,520
you feel your gut sink in your stomach

36
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,600
because you spent years trying to

37
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,840
building your company from the

38
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,439
and you think about all the people who

39
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,280
work for you and all the families they

40
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,040
provide for

41
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,960
the ransom note contains a link which

42
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,520
sends you to a tour website where you

43
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,200
can chat with the people who hacked your

44
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,240
company

45
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,159
but after telling them that you need

46
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:56,240
more time to even start thinking about

47
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,600
making a payment

48
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,680
all they respond with this we wait

49
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,079
during uh this presentation we will

50
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,240
present you the answer to the research

51
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,959
questions we asked ourselves

52
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:11,120
but first let me explain why we did this

53
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,280
research in the first place

54
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,440
we all know that ransomware is a big

55
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,840
problem and we don't see it getting

56
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,760
better anytime soon

57
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:20,720
so

58
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,360
when a company gets it with ransomware

59
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,800
they find themselves in the middle of a

60
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,080
crisis and one thing that makes a crisis

61
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,640
more manageable is to have as much

62
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,560
information as possible

63
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,080
so we asked ourselves what information

64
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:40,080
can we provide to companies who get

65
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:42,319
hacked or the people who try to help

66
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,519
them

67
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:44,400
and

68
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,440
we strongly agree that not paying is

69
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,400
ultimately the best solution and we'll

70
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,360
give examples of why because we

71
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,000
investigated that

72
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,280
however

73
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,120
in the second half of the presentation

74
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,680
we're also going into

75
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,680
the situation when that's not possible

76
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,519
when paying is the only solution

77
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:11,760
so we did research into the question of

78
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,640
how adversaries set their price

79
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,640
and how information and symmetry

80
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:19,440
influences the negotiation

81
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,640
furthermore we asked what strategies

82
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,560
are there that can be used during the

83
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,519
negotiation to lessen the damages

84
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,200
well and just like with any other

85
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,200
research project we needed data to

86
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,720
answer these questions

87
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,120
and so you will now be telling you more

88
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,519
about where we got the data

89
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,920
all right uh well thanks for ben so

90
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,480
before we jump into details i'm giving a

91
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,519
short introduction of a ransomware

92
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,640
negotiation page and it's processed so

93
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,239
after a victim

94
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,239
copyright passed the url in the ransom

95
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:55,599
nodes into the tool browser it directs

96
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,480
the victim to a page which has the

97
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,760
initial price at the left hand side

98
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,400
and in this case is

99
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,080
300 000

100
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,000
and also there is a

101
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,480
dialogue session in the right hand side

102
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,200
which is for victim and ransomware

103
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,320
adversary to negotiate the final price

104
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,399
so in this research we focus on the

105
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:21,358
final price because in our opinion for a

106
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,680
financial motivated attack the final

107
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,560
price the final ransom cash in is

108
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,880
represent the profit baseline in each

109
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,199
attack

110
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,759
all right let's play again think

111
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:36,240
ourselves as an attacker the originally

112
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:39,120
ransomware we are going to make profit

113
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,520
as long as these factors can be taken

114
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,960
care carefully

115
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,040
these factors including

116
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,680
the final price should be high enough

117
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,160
and also there should be enough

118
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,639
percentage of victim pay in the end

119
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,120
also our cost cost for for hosting

120
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:57,759
malware for penetration testing and

121
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,919
developing tool sets should be

122
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,639
covered and last but not least the risk

123
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,720
factor shouldn't be ignored

124
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,960
so what makes this business

125
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,840
complicated to drive is these factor are

126
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,479
intertwined

127
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,400
now here comes a simple decision problem

128
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,759
we need to make

129
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,199
so given that the ransom price versus

130
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,360
the willingness to pay has a negative

131
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:24,639
correlation

132
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,800
it means if the price is

133
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,600
higher than less people would pay so

134
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,160
would you choose a business model that

135
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,800
only a small number of become paid but

136
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,960
each payment is significant

137
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,479
or on the other hand as a lot of number

138
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:46,160
of victim pay but each ransom is smaller

139
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,919
okay i hope you all have your best

140
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,400
strategy in your mind so the question we

141
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,360
are answering is how about the actual

142
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,759
ransom actors

143
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,680
how they play this game

144
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,560
in the real world

145
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,680
we try to answer this question by data

146
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,120
in this research we use major two

147
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:08,400
ransomware negotiation data set

148
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,759
collected by ourselves so within the um

149
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,360
left the first one we have

150
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,919
681

151
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,880
negotiations and 70 of them

152
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,199
decided to pay in the end

153
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,120
so um

154
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:24,639
apparently the

155
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:26,880
um

156
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:29,199
sorry

157
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,639
the ransom paid in the first data set

158
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,280
they are the data was collected back to

159
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:38,240
the um mid of 2019 and at that time

160
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,560
ransomware has just started so

161
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,960
this group is one of the initiator of

162
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,280
the ransomware epidemic

163
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:46,160
on the

164
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,479
right hand side on the other hand this

165
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,919
statehouse that was collected at late of

166
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:53,280
2020

167
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,840
and at that time the ransomware attack

168
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,560
has become more professional

169
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,599
and

170
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,479
we test our hypothesis in the first data

171
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:04,160
set and

172
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,400
figure out how the adversary set the

173
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,520
price and also we carefully study the

174
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,560
second

175
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:12,080
data set to

176
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,120
um

177
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,919
to think of our negotiation strategy

178
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,199
because

179
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,919
when the second data set is collect the

180
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,599
ransomware negotiation process has

181
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,800
become more professional

182
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:27,440
i'm introducing a metric useless

183
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,840
interest in this research coherence and

184
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:31,440
over revenue

185
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,240
this rental over revenue is how the

186
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,120
percentage of revenue was paid as ransom

187
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,400
in the year the victim got reached for

188
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,840
example in our

189
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:44,479
data set the victim company who paid

190
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:47,520
roughly 100 million at that year

191
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,800
uh they they earn roughly a million

192
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,280
um us dollar at that year and they pay

193
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:57,120
around 36 thousands so for every median

194
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,720
they earn

195
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,599
600 and

196
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:03,440
363 us dollar was paid during ransomware

197
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,240
again

198
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,560
so with all the data calculated it is

199
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,400
parted to the figure at the right hand

200
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,280
side surprisingly most of them are in a

201
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,840
certain range it gives a sense that

202
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,039
there is a baseline

203
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,599
to dive deeper into the result we

204
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,599
further divide victims into two

205
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:23,680
subgroups according to the victim's

206
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,319
annual revenue interestingly as we can

207
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:27,599
see

208
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:29,840
at the figure at the left-hand side the

209
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,840
data is quite compact especially when

210
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,799
the company earns more than 100 million

211
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,399
so what does this mean

212
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,679
well the data shows if companies

213
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,679
they earned similar revenue and they

214
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:44,240
both got infected by that actor

215
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,560
and they both decided to pay eventually

216
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,680
they are likely to pay the similar ratio

217
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,880
in ransom

218
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,399
besides we

219
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:54,399
found small and medium enterprise

220
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,040
company payloads in absolute values but

221
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:59,040
relatively higher in percentage of their

222
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,080
robbery

223
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,760
and we are still studying the reason

224
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,160
behind it

225
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,000
so the results suggest the baseline of

226
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,800
the final ransom price within actors

227
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,080
might exist

228
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,440
the revenue the size of the company

229
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,760
these two factors are important when

230
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,320
actor is labeling the price

231
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:26,560
of course the visibility of the data is

232
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,880
limited so we don't expect it all the

233
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,839
factors can be exhausted however make

234
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:33,440
this result

235
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:36,399
worrying as

236
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,560
attacker always know how much a victim

237
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,279
would pay beforehand it is because a

238
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:43,360
victim is likely to be forced to play

239
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,160
this game for the very first time

240
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:48,399
on the other hand the attacker has been

241
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,959
playing this all day long and they know

242
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,800
what's in your hands

243
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,760
well

244
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:56,000
even we got these results the second

245
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,399
half of this research is going to talk

246
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,600
about the ransomware negotiation stretch

247
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,360
so but why

248
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,680
i have just told you in this situation

249
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,519
victim can't win

250
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,920
so even though play paying ransom is the

251
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,399
best choice and uh

252
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:16,000
we also realize there are worse scenario

253
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,200
that only to pay is the choice

254
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,000
so

255
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,399
um in this situation people will be

256
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:24,800
talking about what we have learned from

257
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,519
the success and the value story of this

258
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,880
reason where negotiations

259
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,399
thanks you

260
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,440
um

261
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,560
so

262
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,120
what can we do we just learned that

263
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,519
adversaries have quite the advantage

264
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,440
during negotiation

265
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,560
however

266
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:44,959
luckily the adversaries are also just

267
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:49,519
humans and humans make mistakes or are

268
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,839
able to be influenced into making

269
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,680
certain decisions

270
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,040
unfortunately

271
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,800
today we don't have the time to explain

272
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,720
all our findings but

273
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:00,399
we have chosen to highlight our most

274
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,920
interesting ones

275
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,320
if you want to know more we will be

276
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:07,360
publishing our full research paper soon

277
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,720
so keep an eye out for that

278
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,680
the first strategy i want to discuss is

279
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,480
be respectful now to some of you this

280
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,959
might sound obvious to some of you this

281
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:23,680
might not sound obvious

282
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,160
because you could say well

283
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,079
why would i be respectful to someone who

284
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:30,800
hacked my company and that's right a

285
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,959
crisis can be an emotional roller

286
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,519
coaster there's a lot of stake and

287
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,160
owners of companies can rightfully get

288
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,760
very emotional

289
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,800
however we have seen multiple examples

290
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,600
of victims getting frustrated or angry

291
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,120
in conversations

292
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,240
resulting in chats getting closed and

293
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,639
good luck getting your files back then

294
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:55,360
so you need to take a step back and look

295
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,519
at the ransomware negotiation as a

296
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,240
business transaction hire outside help

297
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,639
if needed but stay professional

298
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:06,240
being kind will lead to a better outcome

299
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,360
this is a quote i want to share with you

300
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,639
from one of the

301
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:13,760
negotiations we looked at and

302
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:16,000
well this was uh

303
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,079
there was a woman doing the negotiation

304
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,320
and she said since i learned about your

305
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,560
very positive reputation in providing

306
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,560
decryption keys

307
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,079
looking forward to hearing your thoughts

308
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,440
respectfully and then her name

309
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,000
just as an example of how

310
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,120
to

311
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,160
keep it professional

312
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,320
the second strategy we wanted to discuss

313
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,600
is do not be afraid to ask for more time

314
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:43,920
adversaries will usually try to pressure

315
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,560
you into making quick decisions um this

316
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,720
is often done by threatening to leak

317
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,120
documents or by doubling the ransom

318
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,519
after a certain amount of time

319
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:56,079
and the more stress the adversary can

320
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,880
impose on you the worse your decision

321
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,560
making will be

322
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:01,839
however

323
00:13:01,839 --> 00:13:04,480
in almost all cases

324
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,480
from the second database the adversary

325
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,040
was we're willing to extend the timer

326
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:12,959
when negotiations were still going on

327
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,160
um

328
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,399
this is a quote from a negotiation that

329
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,680
was already two ways uh past the timer

330
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,160
and they asked for more time because

331
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:22,959
they

332
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,320
well they needed to pay 12 million

333
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,480
dollars and they didn't have it at that

334
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:29,120
moment so they asked for more time

335
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,399
and after this the adversary replied

336
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:33,920
saying that they needed to make a

337
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:36,560
payment within 24 hours of 1 million

338
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,519
dollars

339
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,440
and they would get another week for the

340
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:42,639
rest of the 12 million

341
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,440
and the victim replied that

342
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,680
they were saying well

343
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,600
they were really trying we've been

344
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:51,279
working all night together defense to

345
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:53,519
buy more time and we aren't there one

346
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,600
million dollar isn't isn't going to be

347
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,120
possible right now

348
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,600
uh team please give us some more time

349
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,680
well this went back and forth a couple

350
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,760
more times

351
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:06,000
but in the end they got the timer

352
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,079
extended uh for more than a week

353
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,480
and they ended up paying only one and a

354
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:14,800
half million dollars instead of the 12

355
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:17,279
million which was initially asked

356
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,199
so you can really see that

357
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,199
there's some

358
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:22,959
there's definitely some leeway with

359
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,680
these negotiations

360
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,199
so don't be afraid to ask for more time

361
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,680
the third strategy we

362
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:34,399
wanted to discuss is promise to pay a

363
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:36,320
small amount now or a larger amount

364
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,279
later

365
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:39,600
um this is quite conflicting with the

366
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,399
previous ones but

367
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:44,880
keep in mind that you can negotiate for

368
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,079
different reasons if you want to

369
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,399
uh stall for time use the previous

370
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,120
strategy if you want to pre pay now get

371
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,440
your stuff back together uh because you

372
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,160
know you don't have backups for example

373
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,959
and your business needs to go get going

374
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,480
this is a strategy

375
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,240
that will suit you

376
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,120
um

377
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:07,519
so why does this work well as i've said

378
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,480
earlier

379
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,040
hackers are also just people

380
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,480
and everyone who has seen the

381
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:14,720
marshmallow test if you haven't go look

382
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,639
it up on youtube it's great

383
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:17,760
um

384
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,680
if you have seen it you will know that

385
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,839
people are not that good at delaying

386
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,199
gratification

387
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:26,160
and furthermore um you're not just

388
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,160
dealing with a single person actually

389
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,120
company

390
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,519
most of the time

391
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,720
there's an entire network of people who

392
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,120
will have been dealing with you

393
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:39,519
and often the negotiator himself will

394
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:41,920
also have a boss who tells you who tells

395
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,440
them what to do

396
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,440
so these adversaries they have an

397
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,759
incentive to close the deal quickly

398
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:50,000
move on to the next target and earn more

399
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,360
money

400
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,279
this is an example

401
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,959
from a case

402
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:56,880
in which the initial demand was one

403
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:59,040
million dollars and the company ended up

404
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,199
paying 350k

405
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:03,519
and this is the not the victim who's

406
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:06,480
saying this but the adversary

407
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,160
and he said i spoke to my boss and

408
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,839
explained your situation to him he

409
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:12,880
approved the payment of 350k

410
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,399
uh dollars there will be no more

411
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:17,199
discounts raise your price price by 50k

412
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,600
and we'll close this deal now

413
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,199
so you can see there's there's an

414
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,160
incentive on their side uh and a boss

415
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:27,759
apparently who needs to talk to

416
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:30,720
so this is a tip that really works

417
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,519
if you want to get it over with quickly

418
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,160
but pay less

419
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,199
then the fourth strategy one of the most

420
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:41,759
effective strategies overall is to

421
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,600
convince the adversary you can simply

422
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:45,759
not pay that much money

423
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,920
in one of example

424
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:49,759
a company was asked to pay two million

425
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,320
dollars and they asked for a discount

426
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,199
but then the adversary gave them a 50k

427
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,480
discount and they ended up paying 1.95

428
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,160
million dollars

429
00:17:00,160 --> 00:17:02,959
so well they quite quickly got a

430
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,280
discount and well that seems like a good

431
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:06,400
deal

432
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,439
however

433
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,480
there are

434
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:11,599
also a lot of examples in which much

435
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:14,079
less has been paid after more drawn out

436
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:16,000
negotiation

437
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,559
for example the previous case which we

438
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:20,400
just discussed um

439
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,919
the initial demand was one million

440
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:25,359
dollars and it was stocked down to 350k

441
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,280
and there was also one

442
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:29,440
uh in which one million dollars was

443
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,080
talked down to 150k

444
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:34,640
and this is a quote from

445
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,720
a case we worked out completely in our

446
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,120
paper

447
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:42,240
and in this case a victim successfully

448
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,039
talks down a ransom demand from 30

449
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:49,120
million to only half a million

450
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:51,760
and one of the things you can see what

451
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,919
they did was

452
00:17:53,919 --> 00:17:56,480
well they kind of threatened to accept

453
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,200
what will happen

454
00:17:59,200 --> 00:18:01,200
if they didn't get the description key

455
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,240
at all

456
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,120
um

457
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,120
and this was rather at the end of the

458
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:07,120
conversation um

459
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:10,160
but that really drove the message home

460
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:11,600
that uh

461
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,120
well they couldn't pay and they were

462
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:16,240
accepting what would happen if they

463
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,840
well they didn't get the decryption key

464
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,039
at all

465
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:22,080
and now you might think but surely this

466
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,080
doesn't always work right

467
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,559
with song you just told me that they can

468
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:28,640
look at our financial statements and

469
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,039
decide we can pay more

470
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,760
and we thought the same however

471
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,559
adversaries very rarely made remarks

472
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:37,679
about

473
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,559
financial statements and we speculate

474
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,039
that this might be because the ability

475
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,640
to hack a company

476
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,720
and the ability to read and dissect

477
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,799
complex financial statements

478
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,440
might not have as much of an overlap

479
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,480
it was even one fortune 500

480
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,039
company case we analyzed um

481
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:59,039
where we saw that the initial ransom

482
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:02,240
demand was close to 30 million

483
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:05,039
dollars and even they managed to talk it

484
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,760
down to 14.4 million

485
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,360
so even if you're

486
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,000
a fortune 500 company there is still a

487
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,360
lot of room for improvements

488
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,720
the last strategy i wanted to discuss is

489
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,440
that with the risk the rise in cyber

490
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,840
risk we also

491
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,919
see a rise in cyber insurances being

492
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:28,960
bought

493
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:29,840
um

494
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:31,760
and while we don't want to go into the

495
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,160
debate whether that's a good thing or a

496
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,280
bad thing

497
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:38,400
um one important strategy we propose is

498
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:41,039
to keep it a secret that you have a

499
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:42,799
cyber insurance

500
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:46,240
because if the adversaries find out

501
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,039
the negotiations will become a lot more

502
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,520
difficult

503
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:54,480
so and this is one thing they did notice

504
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:57,679
uh and did talk about the adversaries

505
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,919
and i want to read this quote to you uh

506
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,840
yes we can prove you can pay three

507
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:04,400
million dollars contact your cyber your

508
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,720
insurance company you paid the money at

509
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,080
the beginning of the year and this is

510
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,840
their problem you have protection

511
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,799
against cyber extortion i know that you

512
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:15,440
are now in trouble with profit we would

513
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,440
never ask for such an amount if you

514
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:18,840
don't not have

515
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,960
insurance and i want to give you another

516
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,280
one look we know about your cyber

517
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,960
insurance let's save a lot of time

518
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:26,880
together you will now offer three

519
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,600
million and you we will agree i want to

520
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,679
understand i want you to understand we

521
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,280
will not give you a discount below the

522
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,039
amount of your insurance never if you

523
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,960
want to resolve this situation now this

524
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,679
is a real chance

525
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,919
so

526
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,880
as we said if possible do not tell

527
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,200
anyone you have cyber insurance keep

528
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,880
the files

529
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,640
off your servers

530
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:53,039
print them out i don't know but make

531
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:55,600
sure nobody finds out so keep that a

532
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:57,760
secured especially the amount you're

533
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:00,400
insured for

534
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:02,720
so

535
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,880
to conclude

536
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,440
what we have learned is that ransomware

537
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,200
negotiations are an unfair game

538
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,200
adversaries can learn from previous

539
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:15,280
experiences and they have more

540
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,200
information about the victim than they

541
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,039
know what to do with

542
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,080
however

543
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:22,159
they're still just humans and we can

544
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,559
take advantage of that and depending on

545
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,240
what your goal is during a negotiation

546
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,919
we've provided you with different

547
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:32,159
strategies to gain back some of the

548
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:33,679
advantage

549
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:35,760
so let's take a look back at the

550
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,559
hypothetical case we opened with

551
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,760
we wait that was their reply after you

552
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:43,600
told them that you need more time to

553
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,280
even start thinking about making a

554
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:46,400
payment

555
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,120
and now after the investigation is over

556
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,360
all the systems have been restored it

557
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,760
became clear to you that they were

558
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,679
indeed not in a hurry

559
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:58,320
they have been in the company systems

560
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,720
for three weeks prior to rolling out the

561
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:01,919
ransomware

562
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:03,840
they had access to all your internal

563
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,400
documents including your financial

564
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,880
statement statements

565
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,440
they knew everything about you and you

566
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,760
knew very little about them

567
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,320
they waited because they knew in the end

568
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:17,600
you would pay

569
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:20,720
but how much did you end up paying the

570
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,600
full 3.5 million dollars they asked or

571
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,039
did you pay less

572
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:27,520
or did you not end up paying at all

573
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,440
the end of the story

574
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,360
will not be told by us but by the

575
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,400
countless of cases that will continue to

576
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,000
happen in the future

577
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,240
and we just hope that by sharing this

578
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,640
research we can add some fuel to the

579
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,080
defending side

580
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:44,080
we have demonstrated how powerful the

581
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,240
adversaries can be

582
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,480
during the negotiation but we've also

583
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,320
tried to create a safety net for the

584
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,880
unlucky victims we've fallen

585
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:55,520
thank you very much for listening to our

586
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:57,570
presentation

587
00:22:57,570 --> 00:23:07,189
[Music]

588
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,280
you
