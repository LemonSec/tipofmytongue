00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,160
better c-certs using behavioral

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,599
psychology

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:18,160
my name is dr daniel shore and really

6

excited to be here

7
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:21,119
share about some of my research

8
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,800
alongside mark orlando

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,080
i have been studying cyber security

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,119
teamwork since 2012. i have a phd in

11
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,920
workplace psychology so i was looking at

12
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,559
the social and behavioral components and

13
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,079
i'll speak more about the research and

14
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,079
then we'll get into the application of

15
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:42,239
it i'm the co-founder and chief research

16
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,640
officer of let's which is leadership and

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:47,200
effective teamwork strategies and with

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,280
let's on the research that i've been a

19
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,120
part of i've had the opportunity to

20
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,600
train uh government teams and also

21
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,840
private sector teams in the u.s sweden

22
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,960

and i started my career in security as a

30
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,040
sock analyst and worked my way up

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,000
and i've worked in or led or built

32
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,320
security operations teams of all shape

33
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,240
sizes and sectors at the white house the

34
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,560
pentagon the department of energy and

35
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,159
several other teams i'm also a

36

at the sands institute i teach sec 450

38
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,720
which is the blue team fundamentals

39
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,439
course and i teach management 551 which

40
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,280
is security operations leadership so

41
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,960
welcome to the talk

42
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,759
and uh before we move from this slide uh

43
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:48,640
it is worth noting uh how mark and i met

44
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,200
mark you tell the story better than i do

45
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:53,520
yeah i'll take it so

46
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:55,040
so i'll take you on a journey back in

47
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,719
time a few years ago

48
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,880
i'm researching another talk that i'm

49
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,600
giving about building teams and kind of

50
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,600
looking into that and i come across this

51
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,840
fantastic research

52
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,080
all about the social maturity of instant

53
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,598
response teams

54
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:12,480
so i study the research i study the

55
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,879
paper that's been published online i

56
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:17,520
incorporate it into my teaching and my

57
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,440
training materials a lot of different

58
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:21,599
things that i'm doing fast forward a few

59
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,560
years later and i'm talking to a client

60
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,920
and i'm explaining some of these

61
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:27,520
concepts and the client says hey you

62
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,080
know what that sounds really interesting

63
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,400
i know a couple of people they're over

64
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,959
working with george mason university

65
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:36,879
they're doing instant response stuff you

66
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,640
know maybe there's a business connection

67
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,400
there you should talk to them

68
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,800
so i hop on a call with these these guys

69
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,560
i'm talking to them explaining what it

70
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,720
is we do at bionic and

71
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,720
talking about social maturity and i say

72
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:49,599
yeah

73
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,519
you know we're all about trying to build

74
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,680
collaborative intelligence uh make

75
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,599
communication and trust you know easier

76
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,720
to build

77
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,480
and these guys say you know that really

78
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,080
sounds like some research that we did in

79
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,640
this paper we wrote and

80
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,360
as i think often happens in academia i'm

81
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:08,000
sure daniel you'll confirm um you know i

82
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,360
have that rockstar moment when i say

83
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:11,120
wait a minute you wrote that research i

84
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,640
love that research that's my favorite

85
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:15,200
scientific paper that i've ever read um

86
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,200
and i use it all the time that happens

87
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:19,120
all the time mark that's all the time

88
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,440
right and so uh we connected that way

89
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,680
and uh we've been working together ever

90
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,760
since um you know studying some of the

91
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,280
things that we're going to share with

92
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,640
you today

93
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:31,599
yeah it was a a rare moment in academia

94
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:33,680
and uh and since having been at george

95
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,599
mason university and now doing the

96
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,239
consulting work i do i have a real

97
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:40,319
appreciation for how much time mark put

98
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,560
in to learning the research um and we're

99
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,480
excited to share it

100
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:47,680
and in that context with all of you

101
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,239
so i want you all to just think to

102
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:52,640
yourselves uh this is a question of the

103
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,480
rhetorical variety i want you to think

104
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,319
through your experience

105
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,920
in security if you've worked in

106
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,599
operations if you've worked in instant

107
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:00,640
response

108
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,319
and i want you to consider whether or

109
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,560
not you've encountered this scenario

110
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,920
before

111
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,319
you come into a brand new team

112
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:11,040
okay there's a lot of pressure resources

113
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,040
are limited okay they're finite you've

114
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:15,519
got to make some tough decisions very

115
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,839
early on we have a very demanding

116
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,478
customer a demanding constituency

117
00:04:20,478 --> 00:04:22,400
and they're in the midst of very big

118
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,520
changes

119
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,160
okay it's a chaotic environment you're

120
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,479
thrown into this environment you have to

121
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,280
build out or make better their security

122
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,120
their instant response capabilities and

123
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:35,440
you're seen as that expert

124
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,919
now the customer doesn't really know all

125
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:40,080
of the ins and outs of incident response

126
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,000
working together as a team to execute

127
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,759
that response you're there because

128
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,759
you're the expert they don't really care

129
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:47,759
how it gets done you just need to do

130
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:50,639
security make it happen right

131
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,520
the team comes together you have a few

132
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,680
key experts and so the team sort of

133
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,240
naturally falls in line behind those

134
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:00,400
experts rallies around them

135
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,759
uh under the leadership of you and those

136
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,919
technical experts you get some quick

137
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,880
wins identify some intrusions respond to

138
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,600
them effectively recover all the systems

139
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:14,000
we've got some great kind of short-term

140
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,840
wins

141
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,520
fast forward a little while down the

142
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,880
road

143
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,440
those experts are getting tired of doing

144
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,400
85 90 the technical work they're

145
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,639
frustrated they're getting burned out

146
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:29,120
they're tired of being the smes

147
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,320
and so they look around for other

148
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,880
opportunities and eventually they leave

149
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,160
when they leave

150
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,039
your capability craters a lot of your

151
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,199
institutional knowledge your expertise

152
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:41,199
walks out the door with them and a lot

153
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,919
of the gains that you realize early on

154
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,160
have essentially been lost and you're in

155
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,320
a really tough spot

156
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,840
okay and i want you to think about

157
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,759
whether or not you've encountered that

158
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:54,160
scenario or any part of that scenario

159
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,880
before okay i certainly have that's why

160
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,960
we're here giving this talk

161
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,039
so more specifically the problems that

162
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:03,120
we want to solve in talking about this

163
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,880
research and some of the tools and

164
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:07,280
frameworks that came out of the research

165
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:09,440
and how you can apply it operationally

166
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,199
we're trying to address

167
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:13,600
what i call the superhero problem

168
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,440
in security

169
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:19,039
most teams are over reliant on a few key

170
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,080
people to repeatedly save the day

171
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,000
okay despite the fact that we're pouring

172
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,039
resources into large teams and tools and

173
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,039
processes okay it often comes down to a

174
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,280
few of these superheroes

175
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,280
we also have what i call the teamwork

176
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,800
problem

177
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,240
a lot of the security operations

178
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,479
training that's out there today is very

179
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,639
very focused on technical capabilities

180
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,000
and technical processes only and ignores

181
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,520
many of the social and collaborative

182
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:47,120
aspects of security and incident

183
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,960
response

184
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:50,560
we're also trying to address the

185
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,319
firefighting problem

186
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,360
which is we constantly need to adapt

187
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,759
right in the middle of a crisis

188
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,800
without any kind of structure or tools

189
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,000
to facilitate and enable that adaptation

190
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,919
okay it's really hard to adjust when

191
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:07,919
you're right in the middle of fighting a

192
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,319
major fire responding to a crisis and

193
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:11,840
then finally we have what i like to call

194
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:14,479
the lone wolf problem and security we

195
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:16,880
are very talented analysts

196
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,400
who are motivated and in fact

197
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,319
incentivized

198
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,479
to do all the work on their own

199
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,400
okay to avoid reaching out to others and

200
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:26,560
involving others and collaborating with

201
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:29,280
others okay in many different scenarios

202
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:32,080
so those are the main four problems that

203
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,319
we want to address today

204
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,919
more specifically

205
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,960
we're here because of a few key factors

206
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,160
in cyber security that have converged

207
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,919
to prevent our security teams and our

208
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,680
instant response teams from being as

209
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,520
effective as they could be and as they

210
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,960
should be

211
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:50,720
the first factor is what we call

212
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,639
egocentrism

213
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:53,520
okay

214
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,000
i know it would shock and appall many of

215
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,759
you that there are people in cyber

216
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:00,160
security that are egocentric right not

217
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,319
egotistical that's that's a little bit

218
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,199
too far but certainly egocentric

219
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,199
the thought that i can do this on my own

220
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:09,039
i should do this on my own i don't need

221
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:11,280
anyone else i'm going to focus on myself

222
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:12,960
and my work only

223
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,120
the second factor is that cyber security

224
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,520
is inherently a complex problem

225
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:19,840
right it's not easy to solve

226
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,840
okay so we need to rely on the expertise

227
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,000
and the experience and the knowledge of

228
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,080
many different people of our entire team

229
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,319
and in fact of multiple different teams

230
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,039
which leads us to the third factor

231
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:32,880
which is we often look at instant

232
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,599
response specifically okay as a team

233
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:36,958
sport sure

234
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:39,120
but a team sport involving just that one

235
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,799
instant response team

236
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,958
when the reality is we're dealing with a

237
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,519
multi-team system that involves

238
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:49,040
constituents partners peer groups

239
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:51,120
right other parties that all have to

240
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,480
come together

241
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,399
even though we're very used to acting as

242
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,680
individuals

243
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,360
right so it's the convergence of these

244
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,040
factors that keeps us from being

245
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,000
effective

246
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,720
and that's we want to want to address uh

247
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,320
starting with some of the research that

248
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,160
daniel and his team did so i'm gonna

249
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,640
kick it back to him what i want to point

250
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,560
out you know from our perspective from

251
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,640
the the social behavioral perspective is

252
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,959
that these challenges

253
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:16,399
all arose

254
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,080
almost by default

255
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,839
uh the you know the nature of

256
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,080
egocentrism is because we have a lot of

257
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,080
individuals who are trained and are

258
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,560
learning at an individual level when you

259
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,320
you know grow up and you're coding and

260
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,720
investigating or testing whatever you're

261
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,839
doing

262
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:35,680
in infosec is often only requiring an

263
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:38,160
individual's skill set an individual you

264
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,839
know a single monitor maybe multiple

265
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,560
monitors but you know one person in one

266
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,360
room uh doing their work and so you know

267
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,399
coming into a larger ecosystem

268
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:50,560
it's not surprising that people hang on

269
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,959
to that egocentrism that they have the

270
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,680
complexity of the problems uh have risen

271
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:58,320
out of the you know the simplicity that

272
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,000
slowly scaffolded into you know more

273
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,480
complex and mature adversaries who are

274
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,120
creating these problems and more complex

275
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,519
systems that are being developed and

276
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,519
lastly the multi-team systems came out

277
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:13,760
of the complex problems the need that

278
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,600
you know we not only need a watch team

279
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,360
we also need a forensics team we also

280
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,279
need you know the engineering team and

281
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:21,680
then we need those teams to have teams

282
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:24,399
so all of these problems have arisen

283
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:26,720
without a lot of intentionality

284
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,640
and what we're going to talk about now

285
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,560
the research is all about how to bring

286
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,880
more intentionality into this space to

287
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:35,600
overcome these challenges

288
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,120
right like matt damon said we're going

289
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,920
to

290
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,839
science the stuff

291
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,760
out of it

292
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:44,480
good censorship um all right so

293
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,360
coming to you from the the research side

294
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:50,000
uh we put a lot of time and human

295
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,959
resources and time resources into

296
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:55,360
identifying uh what it was that we

297
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,360
wanted to pull out of

298
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,920
the the research we did it was five

299
00:10:59,920 --> 00:11:01,839
years it was funded by the department of

300
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,800
homeland security uh later on the dutch

301
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,279
and swedish governments uh added funding

302
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,600
into that and then the the team down at

303
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,040
the bomb in the middle george mason

304
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,959
university where i was working on my

305
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,560
doctorate uh dartmouth and then hp labs

306
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,240
hewlett-packard labs

307
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,640
were the triumvirate that led the

308
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,120
research and conducted the study um we

309
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:24,640
had over 20 researchers and

310
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:26,720
practitioners at any given time and we

311
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,880
had people you know coming in and out of

312
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,440
the the project over those five years in

313
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,640
total over 56 000 human hours of

314
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,240
research were put in

315
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,000
and then on the right hand side you can

316
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,640
see the size of the sample in all of its

317
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,920
varieties from focus groups to surveys

318
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,600
the number of multi-team systems and

319
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,519
organizations that we were able to

320
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,680
interact with and learn from uh

321
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:53,040
throughout the study and all of that uh

322
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,040
produced an incredible amount of

323
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,760
information uh that we have now pared

324
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,000
down and and part of you know what i've

325
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,800
done uh with let's is to make this

326
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,200
accessible uh because we have actually a

327
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:07,760
300 page handbook uh that an incredible

328
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:10,959
team put together and also there are

329
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:13,200
some barriers to accessing even what's

330
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,440
in there um despite our efforts to make

331
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,120
it you know uh

332
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:19,440
accessible and colloquial in the way we

333
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,000
spoke about it uh you know evolution

334
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,560
requires refinement

335
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:27,360
in a in a nutshell um you know we we

336
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,839
turned all that research into a social

337
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,680
maturity model uh which we'll show you

338
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:34,399
shortly uh that talks about the social

339
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,519
behaviors driving cert effectiveness

340
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:39,680
and what are the priorities one of the

341
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,519
the pieces i want to

342
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,760
address up front is that

343
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,079
what mark and i are talking about

344
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,440
is not stuff that you haven't

345
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:49,200
experienced it's not stuff you don't

346
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,360
already know it's thinking about it in a

347
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:54,079
different way and in an intentional way

348
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:55,839
that'll help you actually shift the

349
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,480
culture and the behaviors within your

350
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:00,560
c-cert ecosystems

351
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,959
or sock ecosystems whatever whatever

352
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,120
infosec area you're in

353
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,959
these behaviors apply because again it's

354
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,680
all derived out of that egocentrism

355
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,320
complex problems and multi-team systems

356
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,079
so anywhere that you're touching those

357
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,399
points is a place where this research

358
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:18,880
can be applied and helpful to you and we

359
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:21,040
really want to apply this in a way that

360
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,839
makes your job easier and makes your

361
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,880
teams

362
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,279
you know more highly functioning

363
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,440
um so we'll talk a little bit about the

364
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,200
the maturity model that came out of that

365
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,880
it parallels

366
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,320
don stickvort's work out of the

367
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,560
netherlands and his research team

368
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:38,240
coming up with this idea of a maturity

369
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:41,600
model that over time as you add layers

370
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,160
of intentionality to

371
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:46,399
the the work that you're doing that the

372
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,399
maturity increases

373
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,160
not only at the individual but also the

374
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,480
team and multi-team level uh we have a

375
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,639
skills framework again we'll uh we'll

376
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:57,680
get to that in just a couple slides and

377
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,440
what we really want to

378
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,279
share with you today is the the

379
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,320
collaboration toolkit uh mts multi-team

380
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:06,959
systems uh require

381
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,880
structure standardization shared

382
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:11,360
language shared mental models across

383
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,000
them and that's what the the toolkit

384
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:18,320
brings uh into into your work

385
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:21,839
so social maturity

386
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:23,040
takes time

387
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,040
we say training is an event development

388
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:27,120
is a process and social maturity

389
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,199
certainly happens as a developmental

390
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:30,399
process

391
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,639
you start with assessment and awareness

392
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,880
and really understanding what is it that

393
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:37,199
we do well where is it that we can grow

394
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,399
and how are we going to maintain

395
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:41,360
everything as we mature

396
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,639
next is the actual strategic development

397
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,560
and figuring out how are we going to do

398
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:48,079
that who are the people what are the

399
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:49,120
pieces

400
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,360
and we always say chess pieces have

401
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,120
personality so we have to take into

402
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,440
account um you know who we're working

403
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,920
with not just what we're working with

404
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,320
application of the micro skills

405
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,000
from the framework which is on the next

406
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:03,519
slide so you'll you'll get a sense of

407
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:04,880
where those are at

408
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,480
but where do you apply then mark's going

409
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,399
to share a couple anecdotes on a little

410
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,399
bit and we're going to break it down and

411
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,720
actually demonstrate the application of

412
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,120
the framework and and where that

413
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,839
maturity evolves and then lastly is this

414
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:20,480
idea of mastery and we think of mastery

415
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:22,560
from a social behavioral standpoint as

416
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:25,120
habituation how do you get people to

417
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,120
actually take on new behaviors which

418
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,759
require requires rather

419
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,199
practice and time and mark you you

420
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,279
alluded to this but uh it can't happen

421
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:37,279
during crises we have to take a

422
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,199
proactive approach an intentional

423
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,519
approach outside of the incidents we're

424
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,240
responding to

425
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,320
so here it is

426
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,720
um you know what came out of this

427
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,880
incredibly large study was an incredible

428
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,399
amount of information

429
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,560
and the best way to give information is

430
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,000
to give you a framework or a way to

431
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,279
digest what it was um across the top in

432
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:01,920
the darker colored boxes you can see

433
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,000
what we call macro skills these are

434
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,920
these are the things that we often speak

435
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,680
about um you know among leaders uh and

436
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,160
and analysts in these organizations are

437
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:15,279
we resilient are we making decisions

438
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,240
adaptive solving problems sharing

439
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,320
information all those things are are

440
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,720
great and they're really important

441
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,040
they're also not as granular as they

442
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,519
could be and when you add granularity

443
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,920
you add the ability to refine

444
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:33,360
and be more precise in your actions so

445
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,600
getting down into the lighter colors the

446
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,160
micro skills uh you can see if we talk

447
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,920
about trust we could talk about swift

448
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,480
trust and or deep trust

449
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,920
if we're talking about swift trust we're

450
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,160
talking about what is created you know

451
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:48,959
in the uh span of a few interactions

452
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,040
where we start to feel like yeah i can

453
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,560
work with this person i can talk with

454
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,720
this person but the deep trust that

455
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:57,680
happens only through intense experiences

456
00:16:57,680 --> 00:17:00,079
that are shared and that are successful

457
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,920
so you have to build the swift trust so

458
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,600
you can get to success and build the

459
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,400
deep trust another example on this slide

460
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,480
creative problem solving

461
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,000
you know solving problems certainly

462
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,760
involves getting people's input and

463
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,240
being able to put ideas together test

464
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:16,959
things we know hypothesis testing um you

465
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:18,880
know going going the a b route seeing

466
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,959
what works and learning from it

467
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:23,039
when you get into the micro skills you

468
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,640
start to again get more of that

469
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,400
precision so

470
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,319
what is the discussion that we're having

471
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,400
when we're solving the problem are we

472
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,880
just talking and sharing ideas and often

473
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,840
what happens in that situation as a is

474
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,440
that people share the information they

475
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,480
all know

476
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,160
and we don't get into those kind of

477
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,240
nitty-gritty conversations that might be

478
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,080
a little difficult at first

479
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,160
we call that counterfactual thinking

480
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,080
where you start putting out

481
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,760
opposite ideas or being a devil's

482
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,840
advocate and being able to share that

483
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:54,160
and then anticipatory hindsight so we're

484
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:56,400
solving problems are we just doing that

485
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,480
you know reactively and trying things

486
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,400
and only doing trial and error are we

487
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,440
also doing some cognitive projecting and

488
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,120
thinking ahead okay let's say we do this

489
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,840
and we get three steps into the process

490
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,320
if we look back from that point what are

491
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,039
we going to see all that can be done and

492
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,799
we did some some research within the

493
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:18,720
research around

494
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,720
this idea of anticipatory hindsight or

495
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,280
we call it pre-mortem thinking as

496
00:18:23,280 --> 00:18:25,679
opposed to post-mortem and what can you

497
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:28,559
accomplish uh we actually saw in a

498
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,240
preliminary study that we were able to

499
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,840
better calibrate

500
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:33,200
confidence

501
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,080
and accuracy in the response by cyber

502
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,000
security experts given these

503
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,679
hypothetical situations that when we

504
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:41,039
asked them to think ahead what could

505
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,799
have gone wrong and how would that have

506
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,880
impacted your process it really gave

507
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,160
them a more precise sense of where they

508
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,080
were heading before they even took their

509
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:52,559
first step

510
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:54,480
so we're going to come back to these

511
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,880
five c's and we we call them that

512
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,320
because we we use words like

513
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:01,200
collectivity conscientiousness the the

514
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:04,160
cyclical nature of adaptation um we're

515
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,679
gonna come back to these in the context

516
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:09,440
of mark's anecdotes and uh and when you

517
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,120
get to that point you'll start to be

518
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,799
able to apply it to your own work as

519
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,440
well i want to cover one more piece from

520
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,840
the the psychological side

521
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,919
and uh and talk about why

522
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,919
this research and the application of it

523
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,919
works

524
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:28,320
from an egocentric standpoint and i i

525
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,919
really i can't stress enough how

526
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:32,320
important is that we start there because

527
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,160
we have to know who we're working with

528
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,320
and who we're trying to motivate

529
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,520
and you can see this is um it's built on

530
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,200
you know the same golden circles as

531
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,160
simon sinek um the y is in the middle

532
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,160
then the how and then the what

533
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,600
ultimately we want to be able to

534
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,080
celebrate this motivation for teamwork

535
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,400
we want people to find joy in working

536
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:55,120
together to see the value

537
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,520
of collaboration

538
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:59,360
to get there

539
00:19:59,360 --> 00:20:01,840
how how do we get there we create a

540
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,919
sense of psychological safety a sense of

541
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:06,720
not only trust but the ability to speak

542
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,760
up and the ability to be heard and all

543
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:12,080
of the opportunities that allow for that

544
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:14,320
in order to do that again takes a lot of

545
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,919
intentionality if we just go with the

546
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,400
default if we take a passive approach

547
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,600
we're going to end up with a lot of

548
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,799
people who want to just work for

549
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:22,720
themselves and feel their own sense of

550
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,120
accomplishment at the end of the day

551
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,360
and that is not wrong

552
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:30,400
and that is also not the key to success

553
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,880
for these complex problems that require

554
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,799
a multi-team response

555
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:36,159
so

556
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:37,600
why

557
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,799
why do we

558
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,960
why do we want to you know make these

559
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:43,280
changes um that the the research

560
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:45,600
suggests and recommends because we want

561
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,159
to cultivate at the individual level a

562
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:50,720
sense of autonomy belonging and

563
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:52,880
competence think about those three words

564
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,280
think about when you create them within

565
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,640
your teams

566
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,240
and ask yourself

567
00:20:58,240 --> 00:20:59,840
you know are you

568
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,480
cultivating those three things and they

569
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,640
don't all have to be equal but each

570
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,520
piece

571
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,000
adds value to the puzzle

572
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,679
so you know working your way back from

573
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:12,080
the the core to the outside

574
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,600
that

575
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,280
we cultivate

576
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,520
autonomy belonging incompetence

577
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,280
so that we can create psychological

578
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,200
safety and ultimately develop a

579
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:24,559
motivation for teamwork and the the core

580
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,880
of this research gets at the core of

581
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,080
this why it works model it gets at how

582
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,360
we develop

583
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,840
those pieces of motivation

584
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:36,400
at the individual level and then allow

585
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,840
them to

586
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:40,320
expand at the team multi-team

587
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:43,360
organizational level

588
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:44,400
mark

589
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,840
it's your turn

590
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,760
bring us into the real world get out of

591
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,919
the application here and then i'll i'll

592
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,880
speak to to where we could have you know

593
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,039
teamed up at these times because this is

594
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,960
before we were working together

595
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,880
right absolutely if this was a sitcom

596
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,039
this would be like our flashback episode

597
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:01,919
right

598
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:04,720
revisit previous episodes um

599
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,960
you know thinking uh through some of the

600
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,559
points that you just made

601
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:10,799
i'm reminded of a favorite kind of

602
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,640
management quote of mine that's by peter

603
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,400
drucker and it's

604
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,480
managers focus on doing things right

605
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:19,200
leaders focus on doing the right things

606
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,640
so i think a lot of this talk and a lot

607
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,960
of these concepts kind of bridges both

608
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:25,120
but sort of veers more towards doing the

609
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,559
right things

610
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,000
we often focus on technical execution

611
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,000
right doing things right

612
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,240
even if that means you know leaning

613
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,559
heavily on people who maybe have you

614
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,960
know more forceful personalities maybe

615
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,400
have more experience

616
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,919
maybe are bringing more that technical

617
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,640
expertise into it um and sort of you

618
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,960
know maybe at the expense of people who

619
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,360
don't have the same level of confidence

620
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:51,440
uh you know aren't the loudest voices in

621
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:53,360
the room so i definitely think

622
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,559
you know this kind of makes me think of

623
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,720
the leadership element of

624
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:59,120
leading these teams managing these teams

625
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,360
in addition to managing the technical

626
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:03,679
execution so with all of that in mind

627
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,320
i'm reminded if we can just journey back

628
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:08,559
in time once again uh to some of the

629
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,320
teams that i've built and led in the

630
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,200
past

631
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,440
uh starting with a security operations

632
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,640
team

633
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,559
that i built out uh in the executive

634
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:20,480
branch it's a 24x7 sock a few years ago

635
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,240
and thinking about your research and

636
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,480
kind of looking at uh the challenges

637
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:26,400
that i encountered kind of through the

638
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,720
lens of your research

639
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,559
uh i wanted to just kind of share some

640
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,720
of the things that i ran into uh by way

641
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,559
of a case study

642
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,520
so in that sock um it was a brand new

643
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,679
team we were coming in you know speaking

644
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:43,440
of an organization influx it was right

645
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,440
at the same time as a presidential

646
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:48,080
transition so a lot of change already

647
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:51,120
happening so we had to balance strategic

648
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,880
and tactical goals

649
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,200
okay so we had to execute this project

650
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,120
which was building out a sock team and

651
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,520
an instant response capability

652
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,440
and do all that project work but at the

653
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,679
same time oh by the way we also actually

654
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:05,919
had to identify intrusions and do the

655
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,240
incident response so kind of those dual

656
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,559
uh focuses

657
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:13,039
also we were in an environment where

658
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,200
uh to be honest a lot of the people that

659
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,840
were there had kind of been pulled from

660
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,840
you know the top of their field in any

661
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:22,080
given discipline so a lot of really

662
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:24,320
really smart capable

663
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:27,600
uh motivated people in that organization

664
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,520
and so coming into it

665
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,039
from the cyber security side of things

666
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:33,360
we essentially had to be an expert

667
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:36,080
in an expert organization so you know

668
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,520
definitely not the smartest people in

669
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,120
the room but we had to bring something

670
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:41,279
to the table in terms of our our ability

671
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,520
to execute that that cert task and that

672
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:44,880
sock tasks

673
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,799
another challenge was how do we know

674
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,240
we're successful how do we know we're

675
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,600
getting the job done which i think is a

676
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:51,600
challenge for most sock and instant

677
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,919
response teams so all of these things

678
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:57,120
you know kind of made me think about um

679
00:24:57,120 --> 00:24:59,039
your research into

680
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:01,840
goal setting right and i i wish that i

681
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,240
had had some of those tools to think

682
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,960
about you know how you could maybe set

683
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,480
goals more effectively and more

684
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,320
transparently so i i was hoping you

685
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:11,440
could kind of talk a little bit more

686
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,400
about that yeah i i would love to and

687
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:18,000
and i'll uh i'll expand the the horizon

688
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,000
here it's not just about goal setting

689
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,320
but really about goal engagement how do

690
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:25,360
you get people to buy into the goals and

691
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:27,279
uh we'll come back to

692
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,279
this idea of egocentrism and i'll pair

693
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,799
it with a tool from the research which

694
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:33,200
is called a goal hierarchy and in a goal

695
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,039
hierarchy you're

696
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,159
developing three things uh for the the

697
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:40,159
analysts and and other stakeholders

698
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:41,760
involved you're

699
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:44,080
identifying opportunities for input

700
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,919
opportunities for understanding and

701
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:48,000
opportunities for accomplishment or

702
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,120
achievement

703
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,440
and what i mean by that is that if we

704
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:52,400
start

705
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:55,679
by just thinking about the individual

706
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,240
analyst and we say all right

707
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:00,559
in the goal hierarchy we want them to

708
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,880
connect and have some input at the

709
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:05,520
individual team and organizational level

710
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,440
and then we want them to make sure they

711
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,960
understand

712
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,679
the

713
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:10,960
their goals

714
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,960
their team members and and other teams

715
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,720
goals and the organization's goals and

716
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:16,080
now you can start to see where we're

717
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:18,640
cultivating that sense of autonomy

718
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,720
belonging and competence um so that we

719
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,960
can get them you know through that chain

720
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,400
of motivation

721
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:25,279
and

722
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,840
lastly uh the sense of accomplishment

723
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,760
that even when

724
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:31,360
you have a

725
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:33,360
an achievement that happens at a team or

726
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,440
organizational level that the individual

727
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,200
gets to celebrate too that's that's what

728
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,200
people want people want to feel valued

729
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:40,000
they want to feel like they're

730
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,600
accomplishing something like they're

731
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,120
they're contributing

732
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:44,400
and

733
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,200
to be able to create that as a leader

734
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,320
in cyber security or for your peers

735
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:52,799
is a really powerful tool and you know

736
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,960
you spoke about this idea of you know we

737
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,400
have these tactical goals and these

738
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,640
strategic goals where we're trying to

739
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,640
you know be the expert but also put out

740
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:03,279
fires um all of that plays in here

741
00:27:03,279 --> 00:27:06,960
because when people connect early with

742
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:08,880
what those goals are and other people's

743
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,720
goals and get out of their own

744
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,559
uh you know just their own perspective

745
00:27:12,559 --> 00:27:15,360
and into a wider perspective and a

746
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,679
collective perspective

747
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,120
you start to see that people are

748
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:20,559
motivated they want to help you talk

749
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,039
about you know relying on the a team

750
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:24,799
you know those kind of challenges can be

751
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:26,960
overcome by using something like a goal

752
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:29,440
hierarchy which gets it into

753
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,640
acknowledging and understanding where

754
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:35,200
everyone fits within the larger puzzle

755
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,840
uh and i i'll move us on to the the next

756
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,360
one and we'll we'll keep uh doing this

757
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,559
to share the application the research

758
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:46,159
great um

759
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,159
so another set of challenges right in

760
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:50,399
the same case study the same experience

761
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:53,200
building out this new 24x7 stock uh in a

762
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,440
high pressure environment uh being a

763
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,880
very new team

764
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,880
having team members that had not been in

765
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:00,559
this environment before obviously we had

766
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:02,640
to learn the environment we had to learn

767
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,159
kind of the threat landscape as it

768
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:07,279
related to the systems we were defending

769
00:28:07,279 --> 00:28:09,679
so there were a lot of situations where

770
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,880
i needed my team to know when to engage

771
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,039
other teams to know when to collaborate

772
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,279
to know when to communicate

773
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,679
and also you know flip side of that coin

774
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,200
to know when

775
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,679
uh you know that was appropriate when it

776
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,279
was not appropriate when we just needed

777
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,520
to execute so you know that was

778
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:28,640
something that

779
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,039
you talked about intentionality earlier

780
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:32,559
uh it was very difficult for me as a

781
00:28:32,559 --> 00:28:34,080
leader and manager

782
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:37,679
to inject that intentionality in uh into

783
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:39,360
the collaborative process when do we

784
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,200
engage other teams when do we have to

785
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,320
work together with your organizations um

786
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:47,120
so i was hoping you could uh you know

787
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:48,880
share that with past mark if we could go

788
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,080
back in time

789
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,720
yeah yeah well past mark uh it's future

790
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,320
daniel uh

791
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,240
speaking to you from an informed

792
00:28:56,240 --> 00:28:59,919
standpoint which is that you know

793
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:02,480
the i said this earlier that we're not

794
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,320
talking about things you don't already

795
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:06,240
know and even some things that you don't

796
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:07,919
already attend to

797
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:09,679
but the way that you attend to them and

798
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,159
so you know from the research uh we talk

799
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:13,760
about a couple things here we talk about

800
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:17,520
banter boundary spanning uh protocols so

801
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:20,080
how do you how do you make sure that

802
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,640
before you're in a crisis uh that people

803
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,720
know who's gonna contact who either

804
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,880
within a team or between teams

805
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,880
what information are they going to share

806
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:31,279
what's the situation or the task

807
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,039
that's going to trigger that and what

808
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:34,240
are they going to share about where

809
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,679
they're going to pull that information

810
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:37,840
from you know we can talk another time

811
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:39,440
about how to organize your ticketing

812
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,679
system um so that it facilitates some of

813
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:42,480
this

814
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,559
and also it goes back to you know what's

815
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,159
the trust that exists between these

816
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,480
people who are assigned to to span the

817
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,600
boundaries

818
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,720
um and then another piece here is

819
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,480
zooming out at the organizational and

820
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:57,120
multi-team level and putting together an

821
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,520
interaction diagram and not only an

822
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,240
interaction diagram of again this this

823
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:03,840
kind of default oh yeah the

824
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,240
communication team talks with the legal

825
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:08,480
team who talks with the forensic team

826
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,240
you know where you know who does the

827
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:13,039
monitoring team speak to um or the watch

828
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,559
team

829
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:17,200
we we could generalize or we could get a

830
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:18,640
little more granular and get more

831
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:19,919
precise which will give us more

832
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:21,279
effectiveness on the way that we

833
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,679
approach this um so in the research we

834
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:26,240
we pulled out this idea of mts

835
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,480
multi-team system interaction diagrams

836
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,640
and identifying what teams are

837
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:33,200
interacting with what other teams and

838
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:36,159
under what situation so high medium and

839
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,120
low severity um and how does that change

840
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,080
because it's also important to

841
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:41,760
understand all right what's the

842
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,559
situation and how does that impact who's

843
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,480
speaking to who how does that impact

844
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:48,840
that boundary spanning which can help

845
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:51,440
overcome uh the what we call

846
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:53,840
countervailing forces where you know a

847
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,679
team is really working well together and

848
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:58,399
communicating well but that is at the

849
00:30:58,399 --> 00:31:00,000
expense of how they communicate with

850
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:03,440
other teams so that intentionality plays

851
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,440
out um not only

852
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:07,760
you know early on but also at any level

853
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,480
of of incident as well

854
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,720
awesome um incidentally countervailing

855
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,640
forces this is the name of my prog rock

856
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:15,519
band

857
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:18,880
um yeah i'll attend the concert

858
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,960
um so that's great so kind of what i'm

859
00:31:20,960 --> 00:31:23,919
hearing uh just to sort of wrap this uh

860
00:31:23,919 --> 00:31:26,799
up and together um you know the team is

861
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:28,640
gonna be a lot more on board with a lot

862
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,200
more supportive of goals and metrics

863
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,120
that they have input into and that they

864
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:34,480
believe in

865
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,640
that they're a part of achieving and you

866
00:31:36,640 --> 00:31:38,320
know they can see the team success as

867
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,840
kind of their own successes and vice

868
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,159
versa and on the communication side

869
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,880
having that communication plan which

870
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,200
in ops we often associate like a

871
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,760
communication plan with you know like a

872
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:52,880
run book where it's all about escalation

873
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:55,039
and you know taking action when it

874
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,960
sounds like what you're saying is that

875
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,960
should also include when to engage and

876
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,200
collaborate with other teams like peer

877
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,919
groups experts

878
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,919
so that makes a lot of sense

879
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:08,320
you also mentioned ticketing so i'm a

880
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,720
big fan of adaptive case management and

881
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,640
really tuning your case management

882
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,799
system your incident management system

883
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,559
to support some of these functions and

884
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:17,360
so

885
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,120
i like that you pointed out you know

886
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,880
that adaptive case management should

887
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,760
include where when how to collaborate

888
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,360
with other teams so that's uh that's

889
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,840
very cool

890
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:28,480
um so i'm gonna throw another one at you

891
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,480
i wanna guide us here um you know we

892
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,399
have uh like four or five minutes here

893
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:34,960
so we can also have some time for q a so

894
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,039
give us the overview and i'll jump into

895
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:39,279
the application the research from there

896
00:32:39,279 --> 00:32:41,760
right okay so another kind of anecdotal

897
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,600
case study i built out

898
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,600
manage detection and response service so

899
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:47,200
essentially a threat hunting service

900
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:50,000
offering that my company at the time was

901
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,399
delivering to multiple different remote

902
00:32:52,399 --> 00:32:54,559
clients so a couple different challenges

903
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,559
here again through the lens of some of

904
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:58,480
the research that we're talking about we

905
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,720
had to establish norms for how we were

906
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,200
going to deliver that service okay how

907
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,279
those tasks were were packaged up

908
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,279
delivered to this to the customer you

909
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,679
know deliverables tasks schedules all

910
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:11,519
those kinds of things

911
00:33:11,519 --> 00:33:13,840
we had to really closely manage what we

912
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,960
were doing how we were managing our time

913
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:20,000
uh the experience that the customer had

914
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:22,640
and i found in that scenario that you

915
00:33:22,640 --> 00:33:25,120
know trusting kind of everybody's own

916
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,480
interpretation of norms and expectations

917
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:30,320
not really the most effective way to

918
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,600
keep everyone moving in the same

919
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:33,679
direction um

920
00:33:33,679 --> 00:33:35,279
so you know i was hoping you had some

921
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,360
things here that were relevant in the

922
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:39,279
research as well for how the team could

923
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,000
work

924
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,000
more effectively together given you know

925
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,519
some of those norms and expectations

926
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,840
which aren't always explicit right right

927
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,720
right yeah i'm adding i will build right

928
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,640
off that um being explicit adding

929
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:53,760
clarity and again adding an intentional

930
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:57,279
tool uh can go a long way here so from

931
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:59,600
the research we pulled out this idea of

932
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,919
a team charter or multi-team system

933
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,799
charter where you're developing

934
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:07,600
the the teamwork side not the task work

935
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:09,119
side so we often have process and

936
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:10,960
protocol for the task

937
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,199
but the the team piece also gets its own

938
00:34:13,199 --> 00:34:15,599
process and protocol and a big piece of

939
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:19,199
that is this upfront investment in

940
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,119
aligning everybody what we call a shared

941
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:23,280
mental model on what are the

942
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,918
expectations uh that they are gonna

943
00:34:25,918 --> 00:34:28,320
adhere to and then what happens if they

944
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:29,119
don't

945
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:30,639
you know end up adhering to those

946
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:33,199
expectations either by choice or by you

947
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:35,280
know situational condition

948
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,119
where they're not able to follow through

949
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:38,480
but some of the things that you might

950
00:34:38,480 --> 00:34:40,960
find in a in a team charter or mts

951
00:34:40,960 --> 00:34:42,480
charter um

952
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,399
how we're going to communicate uh around

953
00:34:44,399 --> 00:34:45,918
feedback how we're going to speak to

954
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:47,280
each other how we're going to speak up

955
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,440
and listen um how we're going to handle

956
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:52,000
conflict and disagreement

957
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,040
then also getting into that individual

958
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,639
piece because it matters a lot what are

959
00:34:56,639 --> 00:34:58,079
your strengths and opportunities for

960
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:59,920
growth where do you want to go

961
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,160
get some buy-in get some you know some

962
00:35:02,160 --> 00:35:04,480
opportunities for people to gain value

963
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:06,640
just from this process of being able to

964
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,560
share here's what i'm coming in with and

965
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,160
here's where i want to want to take

966
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,119
things for myself and also for the team

967
00:35:13,119 --> 00:35:15,680
or the multi-team system and then you

968
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:17,599
can get into the task work the division

969
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:20,400
of labor uh as well and so that mts

970
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,440
charter

971
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,760
or team charter those those go a long

972
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,200
way in

973
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,680
giving clarity um to

974
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:30,320
and you know to everyone involved um all

975
00:35:30,320 --> 00:35:33,200
the stakeholders and and then a plan for

976
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:34,960
what happens when that clarity gets

977
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,280
muddled again because we know um that

978
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:39,280
you know teams develop over time not

979
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:40,720
just in that moment

980
00:35:40,720 --> 00:35:42,640
right and a quick hit here because i

981
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:43,920
know we're getting short on time on

982
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,359
knowledge management most of us have

983
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,440
wikis knowledge bases things like that

984
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:49,520
um but they tend to be sort of static

985
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:51,440
kind of dumping grounds quite honestly

986
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,240
for

987
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,720
processes checklists things like that

988
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,720
any insights on knowledge management

989
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:59,040
based on your research

990
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,520
yeah the research refers to this as uh

991
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,040
or one of the remedies for this is

992
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:05,920
shared knowledge of unique expertise

993
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:06,880
and

994
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:09,280
speaks about that in the in the sense of

995
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,640
who knows what

996
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:12,400
within the team and between teams or

997
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,880
across teams um you know task work

998
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:17,040
knowledge and teamwork knowledge do you

999
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,720
know what to do but also do you know who

1000
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:21,119
to involve and again talking about uh

1001
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:23,280
the the ticketing system if you have a

1002
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,040
adaptive case management where you can

1003
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,880
really track some of these things and

1004
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:29,599
how they predict success in in different

1005
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:30,800
scenarios

1006
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,480
and then you mentioned you know having a

1007
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,480
dumping ground a repository

1008
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:36,480
it's part of it is the way you do the

1009
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,880
repository how do you structure the wiki

1010
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,720
um so that a person can go in and

1011
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,359
identify their own expertise but also

1012
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:45,839
giving people the opportunity to share

1013
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:48,640
what they know other people know

1014
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,400
so hey i worked with this person on this

1015
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:51,920
and they have this expertise they might

1016
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:54,320
not even realize that it qualifies as an

1017
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,960
expertise but it gives them a chance to

1018
00:36:56,960 --> 00:36:59,520
to put it in a central place where

1019
00:36:59,520 --> 00:37:01,839
everyone can access it and then you know

1020
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,760
we can talk more

1021
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,160
offline about how to automate some of

1022
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,920
you know bringing that to the surface in

1023
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:11,359
the right situations at the right time

1024
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:14,320
awesome okay well um i wanted to make

1025
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:15,440
sure that we're wrapping up and we're

1026

communication protocols and then

1040
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,520
knowledge management creating that that

1041
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,359
