all right we're just going to get right

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,679
into it because we got a lot of stuff to

5
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:12,719
cover

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:13,679

the other half and i by day am now a

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,000
senior systems engineer at rsa and by

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,600
night over uh black hat defcon community

19
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,600
stuff we do all kinds of things yeah

20
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,399
that that title sounded new

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:51,440
shiny

22
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,760
all right

23
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,000
but we don't do this alone we actually

24
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,680
have a fairly large crew that helps us

25
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,840
pull all of this off

26
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,840
and this is that crew right there we'll

27
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,400
talk a little bit more about um where

28
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:05,360
each

29
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,439
you know a little subset of those folks

30
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,520
come from but aren't we adorable

31
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,320
ow

32
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,320
ow yay what why

33
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,280
like i don't have enough anxiety i need

34
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,560
that

35
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:23,280
all right yeah so

36
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:25,280
so we do that with our knock partners

37
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,520
initially when we started out um doing

38
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:28,960
the blackout knock

39
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:32,079
i've been doing this now for 20 years so

40
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,799
when i started doing it we rolled our

41
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,720
own on everything it was open source

42
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:38,720
scripts and

43
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:41,119
you know basically put together with uh

44
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:43,759
duct tape and spit a little bit and it

45
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:44,799
got to a certain point where it just

46
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,479
didn't scale as the show grew and so we

47
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,399
were like we need additional help we

48
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:49,840
need to actually bring some enterprise

49
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,520
type gear in here and so we went down to

50
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,840
the expo floor and we asked people if

51
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,159
they would be willing to help us and

52
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,560
thankfully for us we got a resounding

53
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,600
yes every single time and so um we work

54
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,079
with palo alto palo alto networks is our

55
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,640
our core our firewalls so they they

56
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:09,038
provide that to us as well as some of

57
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,120
their top-tier engineers to support us

58
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,440
while we're here singapore or las vegas

59
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,879
net witness now witnesses are logs full

60
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:20,560
packet capture

61
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,160
endpoint on some of the registration

62
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:23,520
machines

63
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,160
and identity and access management uh

64
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,000
and we'll get into why we needed some of

65
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,400
those things in a little bit um cisco

66
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,800
for threat grid umbrella we've also been

67
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,879
using uh them for a threat intelligence

68
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:36,400
platform as well

69
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,160
commscope ruckus

70
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,120
um that is our switching and our access

71
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,000
points

72
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,959
ironnet ironnet's new this past summer

73
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:46,239
they came in

74
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,879
uh at the u.s show

75
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,760
they uh they provide some overlap and if

76
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,360
there was a venn diagram between

77
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:54,640
netwitness and ironnet there would

78
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,640
definitely be some overlap there but as

79
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,120
you are probably aware in the industry

80
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,800
there are some features that some folks

81
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,959
do better than others and some they

82
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,120
don't do as well when we found that we

83
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,040
were like okay well let's let's see what

84
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:09,120
we can do to layer these on top of each

85
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,519
other and see if we get to to where we

86
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,599
want to be and having those two teams

87
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,680
together and they work side by side not

88
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,040
competitively none of this is

89
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:19,440
competitive but to

90
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,200
reach the goals that we want to and so

91
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,959
far it's been a huge success so thank

92
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:24,319
you ironnet

93
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:26,560
and welcome welcome to the team and then

94
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,319
gigamon and gigamon we're using

95
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:29,920
essentially as a tap just to mirror

96
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,680
traffic to all the different tools and

97
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:33,599
other things that we need you're selling

98
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,239
cisco short we gave them some new jobs

99
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:37,920
we did yes

100
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,239
sorry cisco they're uh they're doing mdm

101
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:42,640
for us as well on tablets and such uh

102
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,159
around registration yeah we'll get into

103
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:44,959
that

104
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,000
um so architecture quick diagram uh

105
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,040
we've talked about it a little bit if

106
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,440
you've seen us talk uh keep it simple

107
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:53,920
stupid is definitely the

108
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:56,080
mentality that we take the simpler it is

109
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:58,000
hopefully easier to troubleshoot and

110
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,439
then you can secure it know exactly

111
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,519
what's happening so really quick we had

112
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,120
600 meg

113
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,000
of land connection at the show across a

114
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,200
pair of ha 5260 palo alto firewalls

115
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:12,159
those feed into the gigamon tap

116
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:14,319
which feeds all of our tools you can see

117
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,320
netwitness ironnet uh we actually have

118
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,720
another 5260 in tap mode just taking

119
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,959
that data ingesting data as well as the

120
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,199
any other any of the other tools that we

121
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,960
use in the noc we've got

122
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,680
observium we used here we do use oip

123
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:28,960
we'll talk about that you've seen that a

124
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,639
little bit

125
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,240
and then an interesting thing at this

126
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,520
show that's a little unique to what we

127
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:34,800
do in vegas that we haven't really

128
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,040
talked about as much in the past

129
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,880
one of the

130
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,000
issues that we run into in the

131
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,680
international shows that we don't have

132
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,680
in vegas is we actually replace the

133
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,120
distribution switches to all the closet

134
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,199
switches in las vegas so basically the

135
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,639
only thing of the venue that we're using

136
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:50,320
is the cables in the wall

137
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:52,720
that is not the case at these smaller

138
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,759
regional shows so there is some some

139
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:56,880
technical

140
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,160
things to get around using their

141
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:00,400
switches so basically uh we tunnel

142
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,400
everything back through the

143
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,720
aps back to the controllers

144
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:06,479
and at that point we can write our own

145
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:08,800
vlan tags to provide

146
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,520
other networks beyond the hotel's

147
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:14,080
infrastructure and keep that

148
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,520
in line there so

149
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,960
one thing to that as well is that we

150
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:19,039
provide all the wire drops off of the

151
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,720
access point so

152
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,080
we've gone pretty much completely

153
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:24,080
wireless and then in the regional shows

154
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,000
they're providing us a bunch of that

155
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,240
capability by tunneling back through the

156
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,199
uh

157
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,880
to the controllers what gear do we do

158
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,560
that with bart

159
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,479
we talked about it all

160
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,160
here we go so

161
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,759
obviously size-wise is a little bit

162
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,840
smaller um so

163
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,680
three fifty two sixties for paulo they

164
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:44,160
also have an m200 running panorama cisco

165
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,320
has threat gate umbrella and meraki sm

166
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,320
for the mdm

167
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,720
um ruckus we only have two controllers

168
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:53,759
here and 32 aps not as many we have

169
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,240
three icx switches net witness a head

170
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,800
unit hybrid orchestrator

171
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,880
event stream analysis we had 84

172
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:02,960
terabytes total storage not necessarily

173
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,080
used

174
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,120
and then one htc one from gigamon and

175
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,880
iron has a

176
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,319
is 1510. i think uh probably one of the

177
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,160
stats on there for me that just shows

178
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,840
the difference in the scale of the shows

179
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:17,199
and the amount of stuff that we're doing

180
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:19,840
is the number of switches right yes um

181
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,919
when we were updating the slide from the

182
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,680
us to this it went from 32 switches to

183
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,600
three right so the difference between

184
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,720
the us show and the regional show is is

185
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:32,840
quite a

186
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,680
bit so here's some of the dashboards

187
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,199
that we see oips what we were talking

188
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,759
about it's a little uh shiny dots

189
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,039
shooting everywhere we explained that a

190
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:42,240
little bit before

191
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,759
but that is basically representative

192
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,080
packets between hosts we were not using

193
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,120
it here

194
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,360
there's actually some some redevelopment

195
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,000
uh being done on it with uh with pope

196
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,280
and some of the guys

197
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,360
at utah state that originally wrote it

198
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,360
so hopefully you'll see that bigger and

199
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,000
better in the future yeah it's uh again

200
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,599
it's an open source project so if you

201
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:03,280
want to watch your traffic fly around

202
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,520
and look like

203
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,520
you can just go down put it um i think

204
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:09,919
shmucon uses it as well in there knock

205
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,240
uh another dashboard that we have here

206
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:14,720
is this was again where we so things

207
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:17,199
change right now it's it's i want to say

208
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:19,199
post covered but we're still in it right

209
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,240
but

210
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:22,080
um people don't want to touch all the

211
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,759
keyboards or wipe down laptops and

212
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,039
everything like we used to do so now

213
00:07:25,039 --> 00:07:27,599
we're using ipads for registration and

214
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,479
we're using iphones for lead retrieval

215
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,120
and that means that we bring in those

216
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,759
devices and then we also kind of want to

217
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:38,160
keep an eye on them right are they still

218
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,199
um

219
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,720
are they still on the network did

220
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:41,840
somebody run off with them we can

221
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,919
remotely wipe them if we need to

222
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,080
and just a funny point here is that the

223
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,479
reason that that satellite image is so

224
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:50,240
pulled back is because if we got any

225
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,319
closer it kept showing half of the

226
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,560
devices across the river

227
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,639
um and we were like we knew that that

228
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,199
wasn't true so we were like okay well as

229
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,240
long as those devices don't go

230
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,639
further away from that part of the river

231
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:07,120
they probably are still on site

232
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:07,919
but

233
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,639
if you are looking to steal an iphone 7

234
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:13,039
from downstairs on the expo floor now is

235
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,400
your moment

236
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,319
just hang out on the other side of the

237
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,479
river until this ends and then by then

238
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,560
we won't know when you can just run away

239
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,800
so

240
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:27,440
so uh this is ironnet rsa again uh

241
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,120
visibility into the traffic what they

242
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,599
provide has become invaluable honestly

243
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:33,440
we were fighting with some some issues

244
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:35,519
with uh the gigamon device not any

245
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,200
issues but us getting it configured

246
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,679
correctly uh and and the idea of not

247
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,200
having the visibility into the network

248
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,719
was is obviously one of the biggest

249
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,399
things that we do i mean we can set up a

250
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,560
network we've done that before uh but

251
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,480
but we've really been able to grow and

252
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,800
kind of evolve because of the visibility

253
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:52,959
so

254
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:55,360
um general traffic stats from this show

255
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,120
um so

256
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,959
as normal you can see the spikes during

257
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,560
the day a little different here without

258
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:02,560
trainings um we saw a lot of the unique

259
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,920
we see a lot of the unique traffic

260
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,399
generally from those trainings

261
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:08,240
one interesting stat to talk about here

262
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:10,320
is we actually saw less than fifty

263
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:13,200
percent encrypted traffic just less just

264
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,000
a little slightly under half normally a

265
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,040
60 40 split we see and then like 80 20

266
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,360
or is it 90 10 in asia asia's kind of a

267
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,279
lot higher normally it was going up here

268
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,279
too i think in 2019 we were we were at

269
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,560
70 something percent maybe even um and

270
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,839
then the other interesting thing and one

271
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,600
of the big things that we've worked on

272
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,120
for a long time is if you look at i mean

273
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,800
you guys can't necessarily see that we

274
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:36,080
understand how difficult that is

275
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,440
sometimes but go back and steal the

276
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,160
slides uh a lot of aws traffic so for a

277
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,760
long time training courses we're moving

278
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,760
to cloud environments we see demos and

279
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:45,920
stuff moving to cloud environments um

280
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,519
just kind of indicative there of what we

281
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,920
see as far as that type of traffic and

282
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:52,720
then lastly the right one um just some

283
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,480
different url categories and how much

284
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,959
traffic between all of that yeah i think

285
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:58,800
i mean it is interesting the most data

286
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,760
transferred um the by and large that was

287
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,279
all sent to aws to the cloud right so

288
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,040
the chattiest

289
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,240
um so more stats right so just uh some

290
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,880
interesting stats here one um we saw 22

291
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,040
765 clear text credentials right that

292
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,279
sounds like a lot whoa there is a lot of

293
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,200
clear text financials flying around this

294
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:21,839
network however it was generated by only

295
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,000
10 unique accounts

296
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,519
just 10 accounts just out there

297
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,480
screaming will someone please take my

298
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,640
password um

299
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,760
once every two seconds for the length of

300
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:35,920
this show so um

301
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:37,839
there goes one now

302
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:38,959
all right

303
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,720
uh there were 2.6 billion total packets

304
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,320
captured while we were here for the last

305
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:45,839
couple days again and this is without

306
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,279
training so that's a significant amount

307
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,279
of data for such a short amount of time

308
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:50,880
um and five million seven hundred and

309
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,160
sixty eight thousand logs that we um

310
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,560
logged logs that we logged logs that we

311
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,600
logged they're big they're heavy

312
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:58,880
generated

313
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,560
found

314
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,720
um other other interesting

315
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,800
stats you can see there are dns requests

316
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,880
so we've been tracking over time the

317
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:08,640
number of dns requests it just tells us

318
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:10,320
obviously like how much traffic is going

319
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,959
on and we saw that go up up up

320
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,560
clearly the attendance for this show

321
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,800
isn't quite what it was in 2019 i'm sure

322
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,120
we'll get back there but for this one um

323
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,279
because the attendance was lower we saw

324
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:23,519
a lower amount of traffic overall

325
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,360
i'm paid i'm hasting like a caged animal

326
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,959
again that's my bad you want to do that

327
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,440
sorry pope i let you down

328
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,480
uh but also um the types of of files

329
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,399
that we were submitting to cisco threat

330
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,160
grid to tell us like you know hey is

331
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:37,600
there malware that could potentially be

332
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,839
in there uh

333
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,839
we we

334
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:44,000
a significant amount of low threats

335
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,320
there weren't a lot of of high threat or

336
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,160
anything a little bit of medium but

337
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,120
significant low threats so kind of quiet

338
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:53,600
this year it's been uh

339
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,959
somewhat what we would expect again

340
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,959
briefings in comparison trainings versus

341
00:11:56,959 --> 00:11:59,600
briefings even on site is is

342
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:02,079
a very large difference yeah again by

343
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,959
comparison um at the u.s show there was

344
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:07,600
like an active attack on the

345
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,519
registration network from a known

346
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:11,120
russian like actor like you know and

347
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,480
then it was like here we're like hey

348
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,560
look we got a little bit of low malware

349
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,000
like we're like cool

350
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,399
thanks london we can sleep

351
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,120
um so

352
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:23,200
the evolution of the knock so again

353
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,480
we've talked about some things and some

354
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:25,680
of you that have sat through this may

355
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,519
see some of this but kind of starting

356
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,920
way back when from the days of taping

357
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,399
access points to the wall and setting up

358
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:35,680
our own open source devices the the the

359
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,399
big issue that came was was stability we

360
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,920
need to make sure that the network was

361
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,920
stable that was our number one job

362
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,920
trainings and doing uh anything else

363
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,399
that they were doing for labs demos etc

364
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:48,000
our number one job was stability

365
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,839
obviously it kind of grew

366
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,880
into security being at a security event

367
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,120
um and it and it goes from there

368
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,200
yeah we um

369
00:12:57,200 --> 00:12:59,519
in the early days there was a flat

370
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:01,120
network it was pretty flat we just came

371
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,720
in one the again the main goal was just

372
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,560
to keep the freaking network up you're

373
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:05,839
trying to have training classes going on

374
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:08,320
the network was down half the time um

375
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,000
when we came in we were able to

376
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,079
stabilize that i think the first year

377
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,000
there was only a 15 minute outage across

378
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:15,519
the whole conference

379
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,519
black hat was very happy

380
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,760
again that was 20 years ago and we've

381
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,680
been chugging along ever since but we

382
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:23,600
had what we had were classes attacking

383
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,959
each other training classes are

384
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:26,880
interesting and so we'll be back to

385
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,600
in-person trainings here soon enough and

386
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,519
what happens with that is that somebody

387
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,519
learns something new in the class and

388
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,839
then they're like

389
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:37,519
and they just start attacking their

390
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,279
neighbor with it or they don't learn

391
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,760
something new and they get bored yeah

392
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:44,000
and then they uh and so we had classes

393
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,440
attacking other classes everything so we

394
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,040
broke those up

395
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,040
again we wanted to start looking at we

396
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,639
read all these articles that were coming

397
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,720
out about the black hat network that

398
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:54,720
said things like one of the most hostile

399
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,000
networks in the world or most dangerous

400
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,279
networks in the world and we're like is

401
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:58,880
that even true like it sounds cool and

402
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,040
it sounds cool for us to be the folks

403
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,240
running that but we didn't even know if

404
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:04,160
that was true so that's when we were

405
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,920
like we should do some you know get some

406
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,920
visibility into that traffic and try to

407
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,279
understand

408
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,360
you know what's actually going on and

409
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,680
that's when we brought net witness in um

410
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:16,480
to help us take a look then we were

411
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,920
finding malware we were like what do we

412
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,279
want to do with this malware well we

413
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:21,360
want to see what it does so we brought

414
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,839
in cisco with threat grid and we threw

415
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,360
it into threat grid and detonated it to

416
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,079
see what it did

417
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,560
the identity and access management part

418
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:33,440
came because of a partner who's not no

419
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,199
longer a partner and not specifically to

420
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,360
this but just the show grew and our

421
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:38,800
needs changed

422
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:39,680
but

423
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:41,600
with the best intentions they had made

424
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,680
some changes to configurations outside

425
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,440
of like discussing it with us and they

426
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,199
pushed some updates and other stuff and

427
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:49,120
then they they broke things essentially

428
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,920
right so we had a three hour outage it

429
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:53,920
was the longest outage we had had in the

430
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,440
like i think at that point it was like

431
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:58,320
14 years that we had been doing it and

432
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,480
um and it's still the longest outage we

433
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:03,040
ever had so we were like okay only

434
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,800
the two of us should be able to actually

435
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,279
commit and so that's uh that's why we

436
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,720
brought that in

437
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,639
uh and then endpoint one of the big

438
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,639
things there kind of growing where you

439
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:14,639
know as we were seeing what we were

440
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,399
seeing uh controlling what we were

441
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,240
controlling at that point one of the big

442
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,600
concerns became registration so um

443
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:23,199
companies that they rent the laptops

444
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:24,880
from or ipads or whatever would bring

445
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,920
these in uh and at one point we saw a

446
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,160
registration laptop plugged in that was

447
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,240
already owned uh so basically we wanted

448
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:33,839
to make sure that everything there was

449
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,480
sanitized as that's really kind of

450
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,839
the keys to the kingdom if you will

451
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:40,320
everybody at this show it's going to be

452
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:42,399
a big black guy for us if anybody wants

453
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,839
to to take the registration data so

454
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,279
that's obviously kind of

455
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:46,800
what we try and protect the most and

456
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,720
then as you can see everything growing

457
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,639
here automation is a big concern there's

458
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:52,240
there's a whole lot that we've done and

459
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,120
we touch on that here in just a minute

460
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,120
all right so the automation piece was

461
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,360
really about the fact that as the show

462
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,279
scaled we didn't have the capabilities

463
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,279
to go running from room to room because

464
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,639
of the way that we have the network

465
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,240
segmented and we've got you know

466
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,519
different access points and different

467
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:08,959
classes so we know where people are

468
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:11,120
connected or the subnet for that class

469
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,440
we could say in a training class hey

470
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:14,560
this

471
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,560
room there's somebody who's got malware

472
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,160
on their machine or they're passing

473
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,000
clear text creds or whatever it used to

474
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,600
be one of the funnest parts of our job

475
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:22,800
it was fun

476
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:24,959
because like the door you open the door

477
00:16:24,959 --> 00:16:28,479
and you come in and everybody's like oh

478
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,399
someone's in trouble and it's not that

479
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:31,759
you're in trouble we're just trying to

480
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:33,920
educate you but

481
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,160
when we started doing this it was 1500

482
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:40,000
people at the us show now it's 25 000 so

483
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,600
we didn't have the ability to go running

484
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,839
from room to room and so we were like

485
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,600
well let's set something up so that if

486
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,480
we detect clear text credentials confirm

487
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:52,399
malware um or crypto mining we can

488
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:55,440
at least throw up a captive portal page

489
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:58,160
which we do with the palo alto

490
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,839
so that the next time they go to browse

491
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:02,000
to something they'll get this warning

492
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,360
that comes up and says warning from the

493
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:05,839
black hat knock we've detected this and

494
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,199
if you want further information you know

495
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:08,559
they could reach out to us or stop by

496
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,880
the knock if not they just hit continue

497
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:12,480
and they ignore it and they can continue

498
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,160
to beat it out to whatever it is that

499
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,119
they're um communicating to but at least

500
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,319
we felt like we were doing our part

501
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,439
because

502
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,240
as i said previously even though folks

503
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:25,679
described the black hat network as one

504
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,359
of the most dangerous networks in the

505
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,559
world we wanted attendees to leave

506
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:32,720
safer than they had arrived right and so

507
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,559
and i still don't think we can say we've

508
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,280
seen a compromise happen on site

509
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,440
everything that shows up is generally

510
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:41,039
it's already been there you show up with

511
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:44,400
it yeah they come with it right

512
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:45,600
um

513
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,880
do you want to walk through this yeah so

514
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,480
this was uh how that kind of worked and

515
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,559
how this is flowing basically we see

516
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:52,400
that malware crypto mining or clear text

517
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,039
passwords the uh source solution at this

518
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,640
point works between all the vendors that

519
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,799
we need and automates this piece and and

520
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:00,320
kind of has the dead man switch that we

521
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:02,480
approve but basically we identify that

522
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:04,400
through packet we enrich that data

523
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:05,760
through the wireless and firewall for

524
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,919
the users and endpoint machine we

525
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:09,760
automate adding them to a dynamic user

526
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,559
group to palo alto who

527
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,880
then we basically get batch emails

528
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,480
approving those users that have been put

529
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,720
into uh those dynamic user groups the

530
00:18:18,720 --> 00:18:20,160
point of that was

531
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:22,160
so that we didn't all of a sudden

532
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,480
accidentally add everybody if the source

533
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,640
solution had something going on there we

534
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,559
basically respond yes it adds those to

535
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,720
the dynamic user group and the next time

536
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,960
any of those users hit a clear text

537
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,480
website they will be presented with

538
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,480
their captive portal yeah here's the

539
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,799
thing about bart and i sometimes we mess

540
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:39,520
up

541
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,679
and we didn't want it to just start

542
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:43,360
throwing up kept portal to every single

543
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:45,120
person or people on our team and be like

544
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,360
and then with the message stop by the

545
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:49,760
knock for more information right so

546
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:51,440
several thousand people all get the same

547
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,640
message and suddenly uh we're real busy

548
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,799
and then uh you know again the soar

549
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:59,679
solution in this case it's uh rsa's net

550
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,280
witness orchestrator and these are just

551
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:03,120
a couple of playbooks for blocking ip

552
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,960
addresses which we don't often do but

553
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,400
we'll talk about one instance where we

554
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,640
did um or again sending out those um

555
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:12,640
like malware samples to threat grid that

556
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,559
kind of thing so we do try to use

557
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:19,039
automation to help us adapt to scale

558
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,799
all right it's

559
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,960
time storage storage yes

560
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:25,440
so some of the things that we saw at

561
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:26,480
this show

562
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,120
it was it was interesting because

563
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:31,840
we were literally minutes into the

564
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:34,720
keynote yesterday when somebody in the

565
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,240
keynote room

566
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:39,520
like first kind of

567
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,960
did a little

568
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,039
tapping of the keynote speaker a little

569
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,400
hey what's going on there a little

570
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,039
touching of the stanford servers and

571
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,960
then started to scan

572
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,600
uh the network looking for

573
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,120
for goodies

574
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:54,320
we

575
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:57,120
we saw that we clearly knew in that case

576
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,160
that this wasn't somebody doing a demo

577
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,840
that's why we don't block things

578
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,280
normally at black cat is because we

579
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,240
don't want to be the reason that

580
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,480
somebody on stage is trying to do a demo

581
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,559
we see it as malicious and then we we

582
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,880
kill it right our job is to detect the

583
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,720
bad within the bad

584
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,840
a needle in a needle stack if you will

585
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,919
but in this case this is the very start

586
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,360
of the first day

587
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,960
clearly somebody's doing something they

588
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,320
shouldn't

589
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:23,520
and so

590
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,120
we just blocked them

591
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:27,440
and in this particular instance we just

592
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,120
blocked their mac address they didn't

593
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:30,720
roll the mac address they never came

594
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,520
back

595
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:34,000
clearly not the most skilled of users

596
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,840
but um

597
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,760
but either way they're

598
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,280
not give it a shot they're not chatting

599
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,880
on the network or if they started to

600
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:44,640
after um they behaved themselves

601
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,720
what's your sign so um

602
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,840
we'll

603
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,360
call ourselves out if you want to say it

604
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,200
that way we're okay to do that again if

605
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,559
everybody can learn from it this isn't

606
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,960
necessarily us but this was one of our

607
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,520
uh devices if you will uh so the signs

608
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,880
out in front of the knock

609
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,200
rotating through dashboards we've done

610
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,120
that a whole lot of different ways in

611
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,280
the past and that's actually a harder

612
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,559
problem than you'd think to get

613
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,080
dashboards onto a device outside of a

614
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,159
secure location

615
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,679
so basically not providing network there

616
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,360
what we have found is a solution that

617
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,480
you can upload uh images uh and it will

618
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,720
send them to a website that comes back

619
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,480
to a raspberry pi on the back of those

620
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,919
tvs uh everything is encrypted

621
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,200
except

622
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,919
when you upload a asset so

623
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,280
for example when we would push one of

624
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:34,640
those images

625
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:37,200
it would do a clear text post with that

626
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,280
said asset and

627
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,240
said credentials to get into

628
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,880
that location so ideally somebody could

629
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:48,240
go log in and change some signs for us

630
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:51,120
uh we she took that data and are letting

631
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,760
the proper people know but

632
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,039
it was something that we noticed it was

633
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,400
one of the tools that we were using it

634
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,840
was

635
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:00,960
it was looked okay until it wasn't so

636
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,480
interesting to see that again one of

637
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,280
those that uh you just check yourself

638
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:06,720
even trust but verify we say that all

639
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,080
the time people that come say they were

640
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,320
on a vpn and we see stuff just just

641
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:11,440
verify

642
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:13,919
yeah i'll go further jessica always says

643
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:14,640
no

644
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:17,679
zero trust zero trust right

645
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,919
but this is another example of when

646
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,440
you're selecting tools to use in your

647
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,120
environment take a look at what's going

648
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:24,880
on in the wire and look a little bit

649
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:27,280
deeper because in this case everything

650
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,640
looked like it was fine it was all

651
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,720
encrypted until that asset got pushed

652
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,080
and then we could take the credentials

653
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,840
from that go log in and do everything

654
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:35,760
else on the other parts that were

655
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,840
encrypted so um

656
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:39,679
as you're introducing applications or

657
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:40,880
tools or different things to your

658
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,440
environment go see what changes when you

659
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,600
add that thing we've we've seen vpns

660
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,960
before where everything was encrypted

661
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,640
once the vpn was there but the login

662
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,880
into the vpn was was in the clear in the

663
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,400
clear so it's stuff like that just just

664
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:54,240
make sure yeah so you just just check

665
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:55,520
your check your tools look at your

666
00:22:55,520 --> 00:22:56,880
traffic see what's going on you don't

667
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:00,159
know if you don't know so

668
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,960
um in this case

669
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:03,919
we

670
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,039
we saw

671
00:23:05,039 --> 00:23:06,880
what looked like

672
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,960
the dark comet rat like tren like

673
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,240
somebody

674
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:12,080
was communicating to a domain affiliated

675
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,880
with that particular rat

676
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,480
we thought well

677
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,679
maybe this

678
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:19,520
is a demo or something maybe someone's

679
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:21,600
doing something let's just watch it and

680
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:23,039
then we watched it

681
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,960
and we watched it move from access point

682
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:28,640
to access point and we were like oh

683
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,240
probably not a demo then right they're

684
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,679
moving from different rooms oh they're

685
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:34,000
in the expo floor now

686
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:34,960
oh

687
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:37,360
they're shopping for pokemon cards

688
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:39,679
um so we're like this is likely not a

689
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:41,520
demo on stage it's not likely not a

690
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,480
vendor but um you know at least in this

691
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,919
case we were like all right that's

692
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,559
actually malware and we're able again to

693
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:50,320
deliver a captive portal since that

694
00:23:50,320 --> 00:23:51,679
person's moving through this space

695
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:53,520
that's what makes it more difficult

696
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,760
during the briefings themselves is as

697
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:57,440
people are moving around the only way

698
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,880
that we can communicate with them is to

699
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:01,360
say well the next time they talk to us

700
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:03,120
let's give them a message and so we let

701
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,120
them know like hey

702
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,480
malware

703
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,240
sometimes we get email addresses and can

704
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,880
just email them also you gotta jump on

705
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,799
that chansey get it right now whatever

706
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,400
uh reggie

707
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,440
so this one's interesting again uh we

708
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,200
uh one of the vendors that's here

709
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,720
supporting the show

710
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:25,360
uses an application that is for

711
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:29,039
communication uh between that vendor

712
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,760
this tool is generally apparently an

713
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,080
on-site box but they are using a sas

714
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:37,360
solution for this uh and it was

715
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,159
spewing to what looked like to us

716
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,039
initially uh our registration data out

717
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,919
in the clear yeah like genuinely we got

718
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:47,520
this is the closest that we've ever kind

719
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,120
of come to a panic when we saw that so

720
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,240
there was a lot of i just started

721
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,480
rocking back and forth bart was petting

722
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,720
my head he's like it's okay little buddy

723
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,880
it's okay and i was like it's not okay

724
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,880
we uh we took as much information as we

725
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:01,360
could found out where it was uh went and

726
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,760
spot checked all of that against our

727
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,159
registration database it was not our

728
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:08,080
registration user data

729
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,640
there was some amount of pii that was

730
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:13,120
being spewed from that tool used by said

731
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:16,240
vendor um we have provided that in

732
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,400
them that information to go speak with

733
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:20,080
the vendor but again it's one of those

734
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:20,880
that

735
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,880
everything that that was being sent out

736
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,960
to the sas solution was was completely

737
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,559
in the clear uh it gave us uh probably

738
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:30,159
the biggest aneurysm we've had from

739
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,080
anything that we've dealt with but uh

740
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:33,279
again one of those things that just

741
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,799
making sure what it is seeing that

742
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,960
digging in uh and taking all precautions

743
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,159
that we can at that point so um

744
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:41,440
yeah yeah i've seen some weird stuff and

745
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,760
that was scary well and this is again so

746
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,279
these are like we're up here talking

747
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:46,559
about the stuff that we see on the knock

748
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,400
but we're really talking about our

749
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,480
security foundations right now we're

750
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:53,279
talking about oh uh we we chose a

751
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,400
particular

752
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,240
application for us to look at the

753
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,159
screens like have have shiny pictures

754
00:25:58,159 --> 00:25:59,600
come up on the screen outside the knock

755
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,279
and it turns out clear text credentials

756
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,400
right but we wouldn't know that if we

757
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,440
didn't look

758
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,200
in this case now we're talking about a

759
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:08,000
third party bringing a third party into

760
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:10,159
the conference to run a different aspect

761
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:13,520
of the show than we are in control of or

762
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,919
black hat as an organization is really

763
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,760
in control of they select their tools

764
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,080
just like we select our own but in this

765
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:23,039
case the third party vendor chose a tool

766
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,159
that had some issues right so as you're

767
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:29,039
bringing in third parties take a look at

768
00:26:29,039 --> 00:26:30,720
what is happening and what they could be

769
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,520
potentially exposing you to um so again

770
00:26:33,520 --> 00:26:35,760
it seems silly it's a

771
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:39,120
it's a silly knock run by silly guys but

772
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:40,960
in the end again we're talking about

773
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,760
security foundations

774
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,320
um in this case this is just funny

775
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,720
we saw somebody who was attempting to

776
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,679
communicate to the dread forum they were

777
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,320
putting the address uh into their

778
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,000
address bar that means they opened

779
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:58,320
chrome and taking the cod

780
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,080
they put it into their browser and were

781
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,960
like i'm going to get me some meth

782
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:03,919
but

783
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,880
but in reality they have never actually

784
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,679
you know connected to tor so so now

785
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:11,200
they're just asking umbrella can i get

786
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:13,440
to this yeah yeah this is can i get to

787
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,640
this.

788
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,559
um and then in the end they figured it

789
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:18,480
out so you can see here tunneling

790
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,559
outbound tour they were like no whoopsie

791
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:22,320
um and they then they turned on tour and

792
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,080
then they turned on tour and

793
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:25,679
and bought you know

794
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,159
i don't know yeah or human body parts

795
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:30,240
what's on the dark web who knows

796
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:32,480
so um so yeah we just thought that that

797
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:35,279
that was funny although i will say this

798
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:38,480
is another thing um so again as uh you

799
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,720
know a threat hunter that's that's my

800
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,279
gig right i'm a threat hunter

801
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:44,480
this is something that you should be

802
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,880
looking for in your environments as well

803
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,480
look for requests to dot onion addresses

804
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,279
that could potentially tell you one

805
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,120
that just the user is doing something

806
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,200
that they shouldn't be doing right so

807
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,279
they're doing this outside of tour or it

808
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,440
could also be the first indicator that

809
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,320
somebody has a ransomware issue on that

810
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,159
particular machine or the machine

811
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:07,600
sitting next to it i can only imagine

812
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,880
they're going

813
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,200
okay i go to this address and they don't

814
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,320
know that they're supposed to connect a

815
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,159
tour or a tour browser

816
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,120
look for dns requested onion addresses

817
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,039
in your logs if you see something and

818
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,360
it's outside of it it might clue you

819
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,520
into something before it gets really bad

820
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,520
and again that's you know just advice

821
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,559
foundation or type of thing

822
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,520
oh so we've talked about there wasn't

823
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:32,960
well from the amount of time that

824
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,399
ransomware kicked up and then kind of

825
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,240
slowed down and then we saw a huge spike

826
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,360
in crypto mining uh it kind of goes with

827
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,159
uh

828
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:42,399
as bitcoin goes so right now obviously

829
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:45,840
as cryptocurrency is is just soaring uh

830
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:48,559
we saw an uptick in crypto mining so

831
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,520
again we will inform people if we detect

832
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,600
crypto mining from their machines if you

833
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:54,799
just want to use our bandwidth but

834
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,120
you're here doing it then then so be it

835
00:28:57,120 --> 00:28:58,880
uh but we want to inform people

836
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:00,240
obviously when that's the case so if you

837
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,559
can see uh some of those other url

838
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,480
categories

839
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,240
the uh this is this is the odd one so if

840
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,559
you can see the middle uh cryptocurrency

841
00:29:08,559 --> 00:29:10,960
had 3 500 sessions while adult only had

842
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:13,760
1400 so it's a new it's a new us let's

843
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:15,279
all give ourselves a hand we like the

844
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:17,679
money i mean yeah i was going to say

845
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,600
that's not that's not usually the case i

846
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:21,120
can tell you that much crypto is better

847
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,720
than sex you heard it here first people

848
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:24,559
it's right there on the slide we have

849
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,399
the stats to prove it

850
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:27,279
and then

851
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:31,039
dating was uh was a close third to to um

852
00:29:31,039 --> 00:29:33,520
porn so yeah i mean but

853
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:36,000
if you add together adult and dating

854
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:37,840
still not as much as cryptocurrency

855
00:29:37,840 --> 00:29:41,120
shiva eno to the moon ah you did it all

856
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,960
right

857
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,679
he's invested

858
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,480
oh man um and then

859
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,480
this one late this was a good one yeah

860
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,159
this one just happened like this is

861
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,640
freshies the reason these slides are so

862
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,760
bad

863
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:59,120
is because we make them literally just

864
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,640
before we want to get up here we're

865
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:02,399
trying to take the most interesting

866
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,200
stuff that we saw or stats from an hour

867
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,799
before we get up here so we have the

868
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,480
most data that we can

869
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,960
and present it to you i saw feedback one

870
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,320
time from one of these outbreak sessions

871
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:14,240
where someone was like the slides are

872
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,240
are not the best they do suck and i'm

873
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:19,120
like dude i made them on a tablet 15

874
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,840
minutes before i got on stage

875
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,480
but this was interesting which is we

876
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,240
one of the things that we throw into

877
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:28,399
cisco threat grid is you know different

878
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:30,320
file types and pdfs or one of those to

879
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,760
see if there's any malware embedded in

880
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:33,200
the pdf

881
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:35,600
and in this case the preview for it came

882
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,200
up and it was a

883
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,360
you know certificate for a covid test

884
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,080
and the kova test came back negative uh

885
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,640
which is great for this individual

886
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:46,080
but there was a lot of personally

887
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:47,919
identifiable information that was on

888
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,360
this certificate and then um the the

889
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,520
team at cisco started digging a little

890
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,799
bit deeper

891
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:57,200
and they're like huh

892
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:58,240
um

893
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,559
and we don't have the logo

894
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,320
you could go to that domain and pull it

895
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,559
on on you that was readily available on

896
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,000
the internet so it looked pretty bad you

897
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,399
could go to download that pdf yeah so we

898
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,640
were like okay well well

899
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:12,080
like they came up and said oh this is

900
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,679
worse than we thought and we're like why

901
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:15,519
is it worse than you thought

902
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,279
they're like

903
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,120
i don't think this is real

904
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,039
this is a service that somebody is

905
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:23,039
offering where they're printing off

906
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:24,480
they're able to print off a negative

907
00:31:24,480 --> 00:31:26,320
covid test

908
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,360
just

909
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,840
it's a scam like anybody can go and just

910
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:31,840
print it off so they can travel

911
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:32,640
so

912
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,080
we're collecting all the information for

913
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,519
that we'll turn it over to whoever we

914
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:38,000
need to but um you know if you're

915
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,360
looking for a negative coveted test

916
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,919
you've got a couple of minutes

917
00:31:41,919 --> 00:31:44,080
we've shut that down but

918
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,159
yeah so um so that was interesting

919
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:47,600
initially we thought oh this is just

920
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:50,159
about a leaked pii now this is real

921
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:51,760
information about an attendee that's

922
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,039
here because they're filling it out to

923
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,440
have it reflect who they are so they can

924
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,960
travel somewhere

925
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,640
but now it's publicly accessible on the

926
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,080
internet and anybody can browse to this

927
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,640
url and find it um and then that's the

928
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:03,919
kind of thing you get when you're

929
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:05,760
working with like a scam site where

930
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:06,640
you're just

931
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,960
you know paying 10 bucks for a negative

932
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:10,640
covid test result

933
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,880
but um yeah

934
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:15,840
be safe out there kids

935
00:32:16,399 --> 00:32:18,320
the future so we've been talking about

936
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,679
kind of what we're doing going forward

937
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:20,799
and some of the other things that we've

938
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:22,080
grown we've talked about the evolution

939
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:24,159
and all that kind of stuff uh and and we

940
00:32:24,159 --> 00:32:25,760
talked about this a little bit in vegas

941
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:26,799
and and

942
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,880
a lot of the

943
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:32,080
future plans for us are our backend so

944
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,159
um trying to not make shitty looking

945
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:36,159
slides so we've talked about ways to

946
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:38,960
genuinely i will leave this stage right

947
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:40,399
i would not be shocked

948
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:42,880
so a way to provide that data in a

949
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,200
standard format to the to our partners

950
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:48,640
to get back to us in a uh

951
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,120
time that we can put this on stage for

952
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,279
you guys um some other things back-end

953
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:55,360
processes uh we can be much more

954
00:32:55,360 --> 00:32:57,039
efficient in a lot of the things that we

955
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,679
do for our partners and for ourselves

956
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,440
take some of that stress out so that we

957
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,960
have a little more room in our hearts

958
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,399
for the aneurysms when we think the

959
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,559
registration date is disappearing

960
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,799
we have talked about

961
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:11,200
some of the historical data we

962
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,039
we have anecdotal historical data we

963
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:14,240
keep that but we're trying to do a

964
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:16,720
better job of of having a back end to

965
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:19,279
store um

966
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,519
data from show to show and kind of have

967
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:23,120
uh trending data as well so there's a

968
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,880
lot of things that we're trying to do to

969
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,240
make it a little bit easier on a

970
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,760
ourselves but hopefully that will

971
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,279
reflect on you guys

972
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:30,720
but that's also something that we wanted

973
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,880
to make sure

974
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:35,039
we're not doing nothing here um and then

975
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:36,480
giving back to the community i guess the

976
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,320
other pieces we've talked about uh

977
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,000
possibly some white papers with data

978
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,200
that we see or blog posts oip being open

979
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,320
source and kind of working with the

980
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,519
community so

981
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:46,880
look for more from us in the future but

982
00:33:46,880 --> 00:33:48,159
those are some of the things that that

983
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:49,600
we're talking about at this point that

984
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,279
we're trying to get going forward

985
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:52,640
and those will maybe look better than

986
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:55,200
the slides

987
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:57,039
i used to make them told me i used to

988
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:58,559
make them and now he does so you can

989
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:01,120
only imagine what that means but um but

990
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:03,279
yeah so hopefully again like we have a

991
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:04,480
place that we can put them we do have a

992
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:07,039
knock page on black hat but um right now

993
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,560
that normally just says when this is

994
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,079
going to happen and it's a picture of

995
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:12,639
our smiling faces um like if you want

996
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:14,159
that if you want to cut it out put it on

997
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,918
your wall in your cubicle whatever it is

998
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:19,040
you you do what you want um but

999
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:22,079
yeah so the the hope is to have a lot

1000
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,440
more actionable things that we can

1001
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,760
deliver back um folks seem to like this

1002
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,359
session just one to hear the weird

1003
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:29,440
stories but also um because it's

1004
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:31,440
interesting to see what a network

1005
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:34,000
looks like when everybody on it knows

1006
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:36,320
about security and should know better um

1007
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,839
and unfortunately

1008
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:38,560
we

1009
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,119
seem to still get it wrong which

1010
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:43,520
um which means we're we're going to have

1011
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:45,199
jobs for a long time

1012
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,119
hopefully and that

1013
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:49,440
is that quite we have a couple minutes

1014
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,440
for questions if anybody has any mics in

1015
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,280
the back virtual so talk to them yeah

1016
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,199
there are mics back there

1017
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:57,520
no one anyone oh yeah they do yeah this

1018
00:34:57,520 --> 00:34:58,800
is going to stay it says we have four

1019
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,040
minutes and 57 seconds you stare at each

1020
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,079
other or them okay

1021
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:06,320
you're killing me

1022
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:08,240
no they're not even paying attention

1023
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,280
yeah wait wait here we go here we go hi

1024
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:12,320
how are you

1025
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:14,400
i was curious what do you do for pki

1026
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,400
infrastructure if you need to do search

1027
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,560
or anything dls related within the

1028
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:19,599
conference

1029
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:21,040
so within the conference we actually

1030
00:35:21,040 --> 00:35:22,960
don't have pki infrastructure for our

1031
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,960
devices i think a lot of that there is

1032
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,200
some things that we've done for security

1033
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:30,400
around mfa and user id that we do there

1034
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,079
however anything else that we would do

1035
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:33,520
basically i mean some of the biggest

1036
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:34,480
things you're going to be dealing with

1037
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,920
there would be man in the middle and

1038
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,720
decrypting things uh and i assume if i

1039
00:35:38,720 --> 00:35:40,320
try to build a pki infrastructure and

1040
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,480
pushed anything to your devices to man

1041
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,000
in the middle of well some big deals

1042
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:46,720
there's let's try that like years ago we

1043
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,800
did say like hey would you be interested

1044
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:49,760
in us

1045
00:35:49,760 --> 00:35:51,839
like providing a certificate or whatever

1046
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:54,880
and the base the resounding response was

1047
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:57,280
no there is no scenario well i will ever

1048
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,119
install something from black hat onto my

1049
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:00,800
machine and we were like

1050
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,960
this was a test you guys passed i i

1051
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,720
wouldn't install a certificate from

1052
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:05,920
something here pushing for just the

1053
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,760
interest yeah but what about the

1054
00:36:07,760 --> 00:36:10,400
devices like the ipads and tablets you

1055
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,839
have downstairs

1056
00:36:11,839 --> 00:36:13,680
we don't have any full pki at this point

1057
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,200
i think we've kind of

1058
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,800
talked about the solutions and security

1059
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,560
around that i think full pki at this

1060
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:19,760
point is

1061
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,119
not necessarily there again keep it

1062
00:36:21,119 --> 00:36:24,400
simple stupid and i think that we have

1063
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:25,920
i mean we got to be careful on our words

1064
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:26,960
that we choose up here i wouldn't say

1065
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,800
that we're anything proof

1066
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,560
but we feel like we're secure in what

1067
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:34,000
we've got right now with those devices

1068
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:37,040
thank you

1069
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,440
how are you ask um so

1070
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,000
if you find any common

1071
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:46,480
credentials common users in all the

1072
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,000
black hats

1073
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,320
so the same kind of user generally go to

1074
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:53,760
black at us europe and asia admin admin

1075
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:57,200
no that guy goes everywhere i i i meant

1076
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,119
the people no not the

1077
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,040
credentials but like the people the

1078
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:03,440
users uh you know we've never correlated

1079
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:05,520
show to show to be like that's actually

1080
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:07,280
like can't yeah

1081
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,640
don't we don't have most of that data

1082
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,800
and here's yeah and here's why as as

1083
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,560
everything because we do capture all the

1084
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,079
packets that fly around like for

1085
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:16,240
analysis and reports and you know again

1086
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:17,839
to pull malware samples out and throw

1087
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:19,920
them into sandboxes everything but

1088
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,320
like when we tear down which will be in

1089
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:24,640
about what an hour and a half or so

1090
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:27,040
all of the data is wiped completely so

1091
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:29,040
we don't even have access to that we are

1092
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:32,160
security practitioners we are you know

1093
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,240
very big on privacy as well

1094
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:36,240
we don't want to have your data in order

1095
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,240
to be able to do correlation our data is

1096
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:39,839
in there too yeah

1097
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:44,160
so um so while that would be cool

1098
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,079
it's too much risk to just start storing

1099
00:37:46,079 --> 00:37:49,440
stuff and it and it's just kind of a

1100
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:50,800
what's yours should i be looking for it

1101
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:53,359
from sugar show

1102
00:37:53,359 --> 00:37:55,440
wondering if the people you actually

1103
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:57,920
tell that they have issues fix it or it

1104
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:00,480
just remains as it is in the long run so

1105
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,400
yeah i mean that's the thing about about

1106
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,400
broadcasting out and just saying or

1107
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:05,839
putting up a captive portal is we're

1108
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:06,960
like

1109
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,480
here is the type of activity that we're

1110
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,160
seeing

1111
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,839
if this is expected behavior just click

1112
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:15,200
continue and move on we have no way of

1113
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:17,280
of knowing if that person ever goes and

1114
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,440
and cleans off their or if it was

1115
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,040
actually even malicious so again if

1116
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,720
somebody's intentionally doing that on a

1117
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:24,960
box for whatever reason has

1118
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:25,680
and

1119
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,800
that aren't

1120
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,280
unfortunately like i think like our

1121
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:30,640
experience has been

1122
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,200
when we have gone into classrooms and

1123
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,040
said to someone like you have this

1124
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:36,640
coming from your machine

1125
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,880
they're often very resistant to that

1126
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,040
like we're like we are seeing

1127
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,200
documents coming from your machine like

1128
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:44,800
i saw a bunch of financial documents

1129
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:47,040
this was at a us show a couple years ago

1130
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,440
and the the gentleman in question was

1131
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,040
like absolutely not

1132
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:53,440
like he's like i i am i'm a security i

1133
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,880
know what i'm doing i was like all right

1134
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,680
all right well um that's fine he's like

1135
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,839
i'm like you think that

1136
00:38:59,839 --> 00:39:01,520
stuff is encrypted but it's not i assure

1137
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:02,640
you

1138
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:04,480
and he said no look i'm connected to a

1139
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:07,119
vpn and he points to you know the system

1140
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:09,040
trade and says i'm connected to vpn and

1141
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,040
i'm like okay well you have this much

1142
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:12,560
left on your mortgage

1143
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,880
and he was like

1144
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,040
like what and i'm like let's figure this

1145
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,599
out and it was just yeah split tunneling

1146
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,920
wasn't configured correctly and so

1147
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,960
there was a bunch of stuff that was

1148
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,040
going on in the clear and i was like why

1149
00:39:25,040 --> 00:39:26,560
would you even be transferring all this

1150
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,920
financial stuff and he's like well my

1151
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,920
son's going to university in the fall

1152
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:31,839
and i was submitting it for financial

1153
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:34,079
assistance and all whatever but

1154
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:36,240
often because we're security people when

1155
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,079
we are approached that potentially we

1156
00:39:38,079 --> 00:39:39,440
have a problem

1157
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:41,200
resistant to believe it we see people

1158
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,520
