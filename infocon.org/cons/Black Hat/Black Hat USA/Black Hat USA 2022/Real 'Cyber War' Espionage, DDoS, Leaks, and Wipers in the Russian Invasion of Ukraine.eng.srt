1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:03,720
[Music]

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,720
foreign

3
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:12,840
hello everybody thank you so much for

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,839
showing up uh to our first ever black

5
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,580
hat talk

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:19,560
um thanks to everybody that you know has

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,600
sort of supported the whole effort uh my

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,580
name is Juan Andre rosade which is why

9
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:25,859
Jags is fine

10
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,320
um my friend Tom Hagel here yeah Tom

11
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:30,240
Hagel uh senior and threat researcher

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,480
with Sentinel one and we are part of the

13
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:35,160
Sentinel Labs team over at Sentinel one

14
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,420
which you may have become very

15
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:37,860
acquainted with at the airport on the

16
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:39,140
way here

17
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,000
so today we're going to talk about uh

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,540
certain aspects of the invasion of

19
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:48,360
Ukraine Russian war on Ukraine and try

20
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:49,980
to discuss it in terms of some of like

21
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,500
the Cyber war

22
00:00:51,500 --> 00:00:53,840
pontificating that has been discussed

23
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,360
but first and foremost like I just want

24
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:59,460
to take a moment like I know uh Victor

25
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:01,620
joro is here earlier

26
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:03,600
we want to be light-hearted we want to

27
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,040
kind of talk about this in an

28
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,960
entertaining way but it's kind of hard

29
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,060
to overlook the fact that like there's a

30
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:11,040
real war there's people suffering

31
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,260
there's this kind of horrendous thing

32
00:01:13,260 --> 00:01:15,119
happening halfway across the world and

33
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,580
at the end of the day we're playing

34
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,680
games with malware but it's just sort of

35
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,299
important to keep this thing in context

36
00:01:21,299 --> 00:01:22,920
so we definitely don't want to make

37
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:24,780
light of it

38
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,420
and the same breath like we'd love to

39
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,000
pretend that like Sentinel Labs is just

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,280
full of geniuses and we did all this by

41
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,439
ourselves

42
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,860
but that's really not true so I think I

43
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:39,060
need to give a lot of credit to our

44
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,520
friends at ESET the folks at cisa Cyber

45
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,799
command cert UA a thousand percent

46
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:47,340
mandia and semantec inquest Talos Mystic

47
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,900
Red Canary everybody that has been

48
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:50,759
contributing to this from the beginning

49
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,520
of the invasion and sort of the rollout

50
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,100
of these wipers uh I think it's actually

51
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,340
probably been the best period of

52
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:01,079
sort of selfless threat Intel

53
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:03,780
collaboration since the stuxnet phase so

54
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:05,640
I think it just a minute to sort of

55
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:07,020
appreciate the fact that everybody has

56
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,060
kind of come rushing uh to the aid of

57
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,258
this

58
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:13,260
so why cyber War like honestly this term

59
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,520
should make us groan but we've gotten to

60
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,280
a point where like we have said that

61
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,660
cyber is now

62
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:21,840
um the term du jour and cyber War seems

63
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,760
to be like a pet theory of a lot of

64
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,780
folks where Ukraine was gonna be like

65
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,580
where we were going to see this or we

66
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,739
weren't depending on who you were

67
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:34,200
talking to the truth is that this has

68
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,080
been a moving Target every week has been

69
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,360
new developments new wipers new malware

70
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:42,180
new operations it's incredibly hard to

71
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:44,280
keep track not just of the Cyber

72
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,080
operations but also like the reality on

73
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,120
the ground who's telling the truth who's

74
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:50,580
agronizing their claims a lot of

75
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,560
activist stuff DDOS stuff that really

76
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,900
maybe is not as significant a lot of

77
00:02:54,900 --> 00:02:56,700
really significant attacks that lack a

78
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,440
lot of context so it's kind of hard to

79
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:01,200
tell so you can't blame folks for not

80
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,819
necessarily getting it right but then

81
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:04,560
there's folks that maybe don't care to

82
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,959
get it right so if you were watching

83
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,840
newspapers op-eds Etc you could

84
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:12,840
basically get every opinion you could

85
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:14,580
possibly want on whether cyber War was

86
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:15,840
happening right you got a bunch of

87
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,640
articles by folks that are usually

88
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,739
mistaken anyways uh talking about how

89
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:21,120
like cyber War didn't happen they're

90
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,159
written like three days after the

91
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:24,599
invasion started so they were very

92
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,760
present uh then you've got the sort of

93
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,620
like sorta crowd in the middle we're

94
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:29,940
like well you know it's kind of

95
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,500
happening but we missed it or like it

96
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:33,300
isn't what we expected it to be and so

97
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,379
on

98
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:35,879
um and then you've got sort of like the

99
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:37,260
more emphatic crowd of like it is

100
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:38,580
happening

101
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:39,720
um or it's happening and you're not

102
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,760
seeing it which is probably a better way

103
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,099
to to kind of handle it but at the end

104
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:45,480
of the day I think

105
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:47,220
we're just kind of missing some required

106
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,739
reading cyber war is a terrible term for

107
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:51,420
a variety of reasons most importantly

108
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,060
because in a very Western context we

109
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,860
keep expecting it to be its own domain

110
00:03:55,860 --> 00:03:57,299
of warfare self-contained

111
00:03:57,299 --> 00:03:59,400
self-sufficient so like someday we're

112
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,840
going to have a wonderful game of

113
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,340
Battleship and like No One's Gonna Die

114
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,720
we're all just going to hack each other

115
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,879
from far away and that's a war and

116
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:07,260
obviously that's not the reality of War

117
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:08,580
it's certainly not the reality of War

118
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,920
for the Russians uh this is basically

119
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,659
required reading for anybody that cares

120
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:15,299
about the actual like cyber attacks

121
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:18,560
offensive side of the house please

122
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,220
so if you're going to be taking this and

123
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,380
starting to talk cyber war from our

124
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:26,699
perspective there are a few things you

125
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:29,520
need to first uh take into account that

126
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,500
some have obviously missed you know the

127
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,860
first thing is taking uh looking at all

128
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,540
the incidents that have occurred in the

129
00:04:36,540 --> 00:04:39,840
first weeks to months that continue to

130
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:43,320
ongo today within regard to Ukraine and

131
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,300
all the Cyber activity so we're going to

132
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,280
kind of dive into that a bit

133
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,860
um and then the essentially the

134
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,199
consideration for Preparation leading up

135
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:55,380
to and the action's taken uh therein

136
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,740
after right after the invasion so

137
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:00,180
that ultimately brings us to the

138
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:01,940
question of

139
00:05:01,940 --> 00:05:04,680
what in this rises above the threshold

140
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,540
of what should be considered cyber War

141
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:09,720
uh you know what part of this is Warfare

142
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,419
rather than just the traditional

143
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:13,620
run-of-the-mill Espionage or destructive

144
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,540
attacks that we tend to see historically

145
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,780
uh over the years and then we're going

146
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,580
to kind of dive in at the end towards

147
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:23,639
what we kind of look at as the outlook

148
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:26,580
for the Russian threat landscape and

149
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,419
then

150
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:29,400
I think the the changes we might see in

151
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:32,100
from the industry uh related to this

152
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:33,360
conflict or originating from this

153
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,720
conflict

154
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:42,000
so the intention of this is uh quite

155
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,979
messy you're not intended to read it all

156
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:46,680
it's a lot uh so this is a an initial

157
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,740
timeline of about the first two months

158
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:53,400
or so of uh public reporting modified

159
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,680
with what we know today around threat

160
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,080
activity related to Ukraine and kind of

161
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:59,900
everything associated with the conflict

162
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:02,940
uh in the first section number one we

163
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,160
have the uh the the pre-positioning the

164
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,199
preparation leading up to the invasion

165
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:09,419
and this is stuff like we see all that

166
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:13,440
that SMS uh fishing campaign we see the

167
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:15,180
uh the general

168
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:15,919
um

169
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:19,979
uh you know uh fishing for uh Finn and

170
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,139
gov in Ukraine and so forth and that

171
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:24,180
leads us right up to some of the uh

172
00:06:24,180 --> 00:06:26,039
final announcements right before the

173
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:28,259
invasion around like Cyclops blink

174
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:30,600
related to sand worm and then uh

175
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,759
unknowing to us at the time that's right

176
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,340
when the Hermetic wiper campaign really

177
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:37,199
began to get his foot holding

178
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:40,220
organizations ultimately leading up to

179
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:42,840
immediately right after the invasion

180
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:44,759
this is kind of the first wave of

181
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:47,160
attacks we we began to track and again a

182
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,780
lot of this is on public reporting and

183
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,300
I'm sure you know as time continues who

184
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,400
uh to move forward we're going to learn

185
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,380
a lot about new campaigns that occurred

186
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,520
at that time that we just don't know

187
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,360
about

188
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,160
so this is a lot of the initial wipers

189
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:00,960
uh you saw the Hermetic wafer Campaign

190
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,180
which we'll dive to here in a second and

191
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:05,699
a lot of the immediate fishing campaigns

192
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:06,780
to get footholds in certain

193
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:10,139
organizations with throughout Ukraine

194
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:12,840
and and number three here is kind of

195
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,479
right around the time we began to see

196
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,639
more of the the hacktivism stuff to to

197
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,020
kind of start to ramp up in the days

198
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,720
right after the invasion and obviously

199
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,819
the timeline here is fuzzy and there's a

200
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:25,199
lot that kind of overlaps between things

201
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,199
but there's you know the Conti leaks we

202
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,360
start to see

203
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,060
um opinions on from crimeware groups on

204
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,500
who they support and who they're against

205
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,780
politically and so forth so it was an

206
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:39,120
interesting shift in kind of the norm

207
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:41,220
for what we see as the threat landscape

208
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,560
globally at that point

209
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,599
and then as we continue to today this is

210
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,520
obviously a massive cluster of activity

211
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:50,340
and it goes on throughout throughout

212
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:53,280
today but more or less continued efforts

213
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,280
to can conduct Espionage get foothold in

214
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:58,500
certain organizations and then this

215
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:00,539
timeline concludes quite a while ago

216
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:03,300
with the uh the industrator 2 activity

217
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:05,099
which we'll highlight here in a second

218
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:07,460
as well

219
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:11,940
so with all of that we can also consider

220
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:14,639
the amazing work done by Ukrainian cert

221
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,599
team

222
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,060
so this is a timeline indicating

223
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:20,460
public reporting from their alerts on

224
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:22,740
their website that you know a lot of

225
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,539
people don't talk about it like this but

226
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:27,479
the industry as a whole relied on those

227
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:30,360
alerts to get early insight into

228
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,440
activity that we just didn't have

229
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,260
Telemetry on in many cases so the the

230
00:08:34,260 --> 00:08:36,779
alerts from Ukraine's hurt Honestly made

231
00:08:36,779 --> 00:08:39,360
a massive difference to the global

232
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,740
perception of what's happening it

233
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,620
allowed us as threat researchers to dive

234
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,740
in and identify new activity expand the

235
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:48,660
intelligence that they found do some

236
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,399
attribution find a lot of just

237
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,920
interesting links overall so Kudos major

238
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,600
kudos to Ukrainian certain anyone that's

239
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:56,880
been assisting them over the over the uh

240
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,060
the weeks and months of the invasion to

241
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,279
that point I would suggest that for all

242
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:03,480
the discussions that we tend to have

243
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:05,399
about information sharing and public

244
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:06,779
private Partnerships and all this kind

245
00:09:06,779 --> 00:09:07,920
of stuff

246
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,980
um drink the there's something to be

247
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,800
said about sort of what cert UA has been

248
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:15,899
able to do what necessity has bred and

249
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:17,399
the fact that you act like when push

250
00:09:17,399 --> 00:09:19,019
comes to shove you can actually remove

251
00:09:19,019 --> 00:09:21,779
all this ridiculous red tape and enable

252
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:23,880
folks to help you so it's an example

253
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,899
that I hope we learn from going forward

254
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:30,240
yeah absolutely and for context this

255
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,860
timeline shows a couple different things

256
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:34,200
yellow we have more the scam stuff that

257
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,600
they've reported orange Statin tends to

258
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,300
lean heavily into crimeware and red is

259
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,940
leaning very closely into likely apt or

260
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,700
confirmed apt activity related to

261
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:46,920
Ukraine and they've also had multiple

262
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:48,420
cases where they report on stuff not

263
00:09:48,420 --> 00:09:50,279
related to Ukraine such as activity

264
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:51,540
targeting Russian organizations which

265
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:52,800
has been fascinating

266
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,660
and you can see this activity actually

267
00:09:54,660 --> 00:09:56,459
began the green line is when The

268
00:09:56,459 --> 00:09:58,740
Invasion uh kicked off and starting on

269
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,720
the far left-hand side beginning of 2022

270
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,580
so you can see right at The Invasion

271
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:04,560
it's just been a complete flood and

272
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,300
shift in the way that they do reporting

273
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,040
so it's been quite fascinating to see

274
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,380
from the outside

275
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:12,839
oh sorry my theme is like completely off

276
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:15,360
here no worries give me one second guys

277
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,279
just so this will look a little better

278
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,420
slides so what you're seeing here is

279
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,300
kind of a summary of Spark Notes so to

280
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:28,019
say of that giant mess of a timeline of

281
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:30,660
what we see actors uh what we see

282
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:32,459
related to actor wise and malware

283
00:10:32,459 --> 00:10:34,320
campaigns associated with uh with each

284
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,839
actor and their aliases so the top gray

285
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:38,880
boxes are what we refer to as the

286
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,279
primary name of the certain actor the

287
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:42,839
purple text underneath is an alias used

288
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:44,480
by either one organization or another

289
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,860
and then the the text underneath

290
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:48,180
obviously leads to their malware

291
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,740
campaigns or certain activity that

292
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,839
they've been associated with like this

293
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:53,820
has been particularly it's been a big

294
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:56,519
headache like look just because

295
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:59,100
the people who hate like sort of all the

296
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,360
naming conventions all the vendor stuff

297
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,740
like I totally get it it's not any

298
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,660
easier for us either like you end up

299
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,579
having to do a whole lot of uh cross

300
00:11:05,579 --> 00:11:07,079
matching and trying to figure out like

301
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:09,300
what so and so calls this actually maps

302
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,760
onto that more importantly because it's

303
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,740
a shifting landscape we've had so much

304
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,200
early reporting that there were a lot of

305
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,079
unks or threat actor names or UAC number

306
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:20,700
number

307
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,880
um that ultimately would fold into our

308
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,100
known naming schemes or into groups that

309
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:27,660
we already knew about but you don't know

310
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,980
that in the first few hours in the first

311
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,540
few weeks in the first few months so

312
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:32,339
there's been a lot of going back and

313
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:34,620
just trying to kind of keep these things

314
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:36,360
straight and if you're you know paying

315
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:37,620
attention there's some that are continue

316
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:39,600
to be unattributed on cluster that to

317
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,700
this day we just haven't quite figured

318
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,140
out what bucket they're in if it's a new

319
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,820
team if it's someone we've dealt with

320
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,279
before yeah and a perfect example that

321
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,860
is sand worm you know the the activity

322
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,660
related to the Hermetic wiper Campaign

323
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:53,459
which was that that first wiper that

324
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:55,500
kicked off in the three hours or so

325
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,860
before the actual Invasion began that

326
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:00,360
was initially

327
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,920
um we had attributed to the sunflower

328
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,519
cdapt or a certain number of unks and

329
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:07,320
later on we began to learn more thanks

330
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,420
to public reporting from the industry

331
00:12:09,420 --> 00:12:11,880
and overall that it's associated with

332
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,200
sand worm and then we can build an

333
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,040
overall large list of more confidently

334
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,500
linked attribution at that point and an

335
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,540
important thing to note here is you know

336
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,220
this is everything we're seeing all the

337
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,320
actors associated with the the conflict

338
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:28,320
overall one in particular is at the top

339
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:31,320
right that one is Tonto team we reported

340
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,959
on them just recently and this one isn't

341
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:36,920
associated with a Chinese apt attacking

342
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:39,000
Ukraine this one is actually an

343
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,220
organization in China attacking Russian

344
00:12:41,220 --> 00:12:42,720
organizations government organizations

345
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,839
so overall we see this as just generally

346
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,339
the actors involved within the conflict

347
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:49,560
or have made interesting pieces of

348
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:50,700
activity

349
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,620
because of the conflict overall you

350
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,240
might also note the Bella Russians sort

351
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,600
of in the bottom right like this it's a

352
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,880
pretty complicated space I also urge all

353
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,459
of you to remember especially before you

354
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:04,980
write your next op-ed like this is the

355
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,959
tip of the iceberg this is the loud

356
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:09,540
things that we have gotten lucky some

357
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,100
organization has tripped over somebody

358
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,540
has been willing to share we've all been

359
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,459
able to corroborate to some extent or

360
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:19,019
another but this is a snapshot lacking a

361
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:22,380
great deal of granularity and I assure

362
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,420
you there's much more activity beneath

363
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:26,100
the surface that we aren't even aware of

364
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,860
yeah absolutely

365
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,839
so an important piece that we don't want

366
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:33,060
to skip over but we just really want to

367
00:13:33,060 --> 00:13:35,940
highlight is there is a large amount of

368
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:39,120
hacktivism and the information operation

369
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,019
side to the entire conflict and there's

370
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:45,360
there's more than we can more than to

371
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,279
discuss and we have time here but on the

372
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,720
hacktivism side the ones that really

373
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,320
stick out to us are two here we have the

374
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,120
Belarusian cyber partisans if you're not

375
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,800
familiar with them they're a

376
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:58,800
long-running organization uh of It's a

377
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,380
small team out of Belarus that has made

378
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,639
significant efforts to actually

379
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:05,940
disrupting uh belarus's participation in

380
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:08,459
the in the um the conflict overall one

381
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:09,959
in particular case is when they were

382
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:13,680
able to disrupt the uh the train train

383
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,279
system to carry resources into Ukraine

384
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:19,380
from Belarus to support Russia so

385
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,480
amazing work done being done by by them

386
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,339
then you have the kilnet side very

387
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:25,740
pro-russian organization even this week

388
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,300
I believe there's been reporting on them

389
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:28,800
they're at their founder apparently

390
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,500
really making claims that they want to

391
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,600
become a hero in Russia and they want to

392
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:37,139
cause casualties in to Nato citizens so

393
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:39,240
there's a very Stark difference on the

394
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:40,680
hack system side and there's so much

395
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,060
more that we could even highlight here

396
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,100
stuff that's been unverified stuff from

397
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:45,420
groups that have come up within the last

398
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,519
day or two so overall it's just

399
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,899
generally overwhelming to keep up with

400
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:51,000
that site alone don't go getting killed

401
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:54,480
by a DDOS yeah DDOS might get you

402
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,440
on the information side there's so many

403
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:01,380
again pieces of disinformation or

404
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,899
misinformation that has kind of stemmed

405
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:06,180
from this war and been associated with

406
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:09,120
pro-russian or pro-ukrainian stances but

407
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:10,800
there's there's so many things that

408
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,600
stand out but ultimately I think that

409
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:15,600
when you look at these there is the the

410
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:18,060
impact that it makes either locally or

411
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,639
internationally such as is this piece of

412
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,560
information being manipulated in a way

413
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:26,040
where it's trying to Garner uh interest

414
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:29,839
from the West to support Ukraine or to

415
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,160
have a change in opinion about the state

416
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,100
of Russian Affairs so there's there's a

417
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,899
lot and it's coming from both sides in

418
00:15:36,899 --> 00:15:39,240
many cases

419
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:42,120
But ultimately from the Russian end we

420
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,279
do see a lot of the traditional

421
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:46,440
disinformation approach that they are

422
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,540
they are known for uh in my opinion it's

423
00:15:48,540 --> 00:15:49,800
kind of like the spray and pray approach

424
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,000
uh you know claims against

425
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,220
assassinations the bio labs this and

426
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:56,220
that so uh there's a lot and

427
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,600
I think that's kind of the longest

428
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,000
running effort of the the Russian side

429
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,260
is the continued push of trying to tune

430
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:07,019
public opinion on the conflict in in

431
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:09,740
Russia overall

432
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:12,720
all right so obviously we've been kind

433
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,279
of glossing over a whole lot of

434
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:15,779
different types of activity because we

435
00:16:15,779 --> 00:16:18,959
wanted uh to focus as much as we could

436
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:23,339
on what you might classify as attacks or

437
00:16:23,339 --> 00:16:25,260
you know offensive operations more so

438
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,540
than Espionage than hacktivism then

439
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,579
nuisances and so on

440
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:32,220
um and sort of the biggest part of that

441
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,620
really comes down to the prevalence of

442
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,779
wipers and fake ransomware which might

443
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:38,459
as well be sort of equivalent in a lot

444
00:16:38,459 --> 00:16:40,880
of ways

445
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:44,579
so there's I'm great you can't read it

446
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:46,440
um so there's this notion sort of that

447
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,779
Western European countries a lot of

448
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:50,459
cyber commands have been sort of kicking

449
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:52,259
around this idea of having cyber ranges

450
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:53,880
and the idea is that you would train

451
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:55,380
your forces there in this sort of

452
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:57,060
virtual environment

453
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:58,500
um and and that way you would know how

454
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,779
you're gonna move forward

455
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:04,020
um when cyber War does come

456
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:06,059
um Russian threat actors

457
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:09,240
are about live fire exercises they don't

458
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:11,160
really care for cyber ranges nobody's

459
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:13,020
wasting their time on that and the truth

460
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,859
is that uh 2016 to 12 2017 sort of set

461
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:20,339
the tone uh essentially they gave us a

462
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:22,859
flavor of what they were planning to do

463
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:24,720
what they meant to rely on and for them

464
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,640
I mean it was already in the context of

465
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,260
an invasion just under a much more

466
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:31,080
limited scope so obviously not petsia

467
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,220
was sort of the big thing everybody

468
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:36,000
remembers not petia unfortunately named

469
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:36,720
um

470
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,440
but the whole point of

471
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,240
napatia was you you had this sort of

472
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,880
devastating Cyber attack because this

473
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,320
thing was self-spreading because it was

474
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,059
a fake ransomware which is essentially a

475
00:17:48,059 --> 00:17:49,799
wiper because it was supply chain attack

476
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:52,980
targeting a single country but having no

477
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:55,080
limits on its spreading capabilities had

478
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:57,960
this amazing amount of spillover and

479
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:00,000
while that was perhaps a victory in

480
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,880
their minds or something metal worthy

481
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,220
um it really

482
00:18:05,220 --> 00:18:08,160
in in a lot of ways has sort of seemed

483
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,559
to set some boundaries that have

484
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:13,740
informed some of the wiper operations of

485
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:16,140
the past however many six months or so

486
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:20,460
so as Tom mentioned February 23rd sort

487
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:24,360
of uh first day of the invasion we were

488
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:26,280
sitting in like a super boring like

489
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,260
sales kickoff or something and

490
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:30,059
thankfully

491
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:32,039
um our friends at ESET had tweeted out

492
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:35,280
these hashes uh and

493
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,660
you know we sort of jumped on it just

494
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:37,919
trying to figure out what was going on

495
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,980
uh and that turned into this non-stop

496
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,919
work shift overnight because it was the

497
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,120
first sighting of what we called

498
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,700
hermetic wiper uh what Microsoft calls

499
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:50,100
Fox blade uh

500
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,080
it comes in the neat little sort of

501
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:54,539
package it's a this it's actually the

502
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:56,640
default for like vs code if you don't

503
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,260
put an icon but it looks like a nice

504
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,720
little gift and

505
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:03,179
what hermetic wiper does is it

506
00:19:03,179 --> 00:19:05,299
communicates with this device

507
00:19:05,299 --> 00:19:07,740
this sort of driver that at first we

508
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,720
didn't really recognize uh it was

509
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,460
actually contained two copies of it are

510
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,780
contained

511
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,299
um in you know x86 x64 flavors and then

512
00:19:15,299 --> 00:19:17,100
depending whether you're in XP or newer

513
00:19:17,100 --> 00:19:19,440
uh not that much newer though I I

514
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,600
wouldn't work on like Windows 10 or

515
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,340
wherever like driver attestation has

516
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,559
actually been picked up

517
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:28,320
um and then you would what the wiper

518
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:30,059
would do is it would communicate with

519
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:33,419
this driver in order to have it do all

520
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:36,419
of the wiping uh it turns out that the

521
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:37,919
driver is this thing called es us

522
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,200
partition Master which I had never heard

523
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,179
of before this

524
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:44,280
um but if you think about it it's sort

525
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,780
of adopting what we might call the

526
00:19:45,780 --> 00:19:48,000
shamoon school of wiping

527
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,039
um from like Ras gas Saudi aramco days

528
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:52,620
or the destover school of wiping from

529
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,940
the Sony picture entertainment days

530
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:56,520
which is just to say that they bring

531
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,559
their own legitimate driver in those

532
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,320
cases there was eldos raw disc

533
00:20:01,320 --> 00:20:04,080
um in this case it's just this new kind

534
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,400
of driver but the whole point of it

535
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,559
being you have a legitimate piece of

536
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:08,940
software that's meant to bypass all of

537
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:10,320
these apples and protections and then

538
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,539
you use you abuse that in order to get

539
00:20:12,539 --> 00:20:16,140
to do the wiping right to disk

540
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:18,720
so after that

541
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:19,740
um

542
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:21,299
there's the appearance of hermetic

543
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:22,919
wizard which was kind of interesting

544
00:20:22,919 --> 00:20:24,720
right the wiper hermetic wiper doesn't

545
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,580
spread itself at all the way that it was

546
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:27,720
seen it was sort of spreading through

547
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:30,360
like GPO and scheduled tasks which meant

548
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,620
that you already had some kind of access

549
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,380
before afterwards

550
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:36,299
um hermetic wizard comes along which it

551
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:38,760
turns out was sort of the the a

552
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,940
decoupled spreader interestingly

553
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,100
compiled February 22nd

554
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:46,980
um well UTC so who knows how that plays

555
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:47,940
out

556
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:49,679
um I really like to point out her medic

557
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,679
wizard because despite what some of the

558
00:20:52,679 --> 00:20:55,400
uh naming conventions like romance.dll

559
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:58,740
might suggest it's really important to

560
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,559
make sure like we don't draw these

561
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:03,900
unnecessary corollaries to not Petty out

562
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:05,460
like we're sort of expecting to see the

563
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:07,200
same thing these wipers that are going

564
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,080
to spread themselves all over the place

565
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,059
but we have seen not what I would call

566
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:14,460
restraint but some kind of operational

567
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,500
decision not to just let these things

568
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:19,860
spread like wildfire but rather to use

569
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,840
these accesses in more contained ways

570
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:24,840
you use GPO policies you use sort of

571
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,299
internal networks for your spreading and

572
00:21:27,299 --> 00:21:28,980
you I guess deploy them whenever you

573
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,360
feel is appropriate

574
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:32,760
so after this like this was sort of the

575
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:33,840
beginning and we're like oh my God

576
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:35,460
hermetic wiper is going to be the thing

577
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:37,020
keep in mind that before this like

578
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,480
there's maybe half a dozen wipers used

579
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,059
by nation state groups like it wasn't

580
00:21:42,059 --> 00:21:45,419
like something that you saw every day

581
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:47,760
but instead you know courtesy of Mystic

582
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,799
uh you have this sort of interesting

583
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:52,200
timeline of destructive uh malware

584
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:54,299
attacks uh I say it's interesting

585
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:56,220
because if you pay attention they've

586
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,080
broken it down by weeks

587
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,640
um you can see sort of the deployment of

588
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,340
a bunch of different tools I also really

589
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,980
love week two where there is zero

590
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:07,380
destruction incidents I feel like I

591
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:08,580
don't want to read into it I don't know

592
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,840
if somebody had to kind of scale it back

593
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:11,039
and figure out how they were actually

594
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:12,659
going to run something that didn't end

595
00:22:12,659 --> 00:22:15,000
in three days but

596
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,820
you see sort of the persistence and

597
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:19,860
deployment of not hermetic not just

598
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,960
hermetic wiper but a variety of tools a

599
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,820
sort of like Fiverr mentality of like

600
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:25,559
just right wipers and wipers and wipers

601
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:27,600
and see what sticks

602
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,419
um around that same time you have this

603
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:33,240
um piece of go ransomware we called

604
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:35,159
party ticket based on some of these like

605
00:22:35,159 --> 00:22:37,740
bizarre inflammatory strings inside of

606
00:22:37,740 --> 00:22:39,179
it there's like a lot of references to

607
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:41,220
like Biden and the White House and like

608
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,780
all the stuff

609
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,059
um it's written in go so it was just a

610
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:49,080
joy to reverse and you get this nice

611
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:50,220
little screen sort of pretending that

612
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,600
it's a ransomware telling you to like

613
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,360
sort of send them uh whatever for like

614
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,460
getting your files back but it's

615
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,260
actually absolute garbage it barely

616
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:00,059
works it doesn't work as a ransomware

617
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:01,679
you can actually decrypt the files but

618
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,860
the truth is that they made some very

619
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:08,340
uh standard mistakes for newcomers to go

620
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,480
where they didn't handle the

621
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:10,919
multi-threading ride so this thing just

622
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:13,320
like could kill a CPU before it actually

623
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:17,280
gets to fully encrypt a drive

624
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,900
after that we get

625
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:20,940
um Isaac wiper or

626
00:23:20,940 --> 00:23:23,700
what Microsoft calls the same raw I'm

627
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:26,640
not sure that I'm saying that accurately

628
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:27,960
um I like to point out sort of the

629
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:29,100
timeline of compilations you know

630
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,840
February 24th February 25th but the

631
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:32,700
truth is that the earliest compilation

632
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,980
is pointed out by ESET in a sample we

633
00:23:34,980 --> 00:23:37,140
haven't seen but you know I think we can

634
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:40,620
trust them uh it's October 2021 so for

635
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:41,880
those folks that are trying to figure

636
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,380
out sort of a timeline of preparation

637
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:45,179
whether they wrote everything at the

638
00:23:45,179 --> 00:23:48,059
last minute or there is some tooling

639
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:49,919
that suggests that some of it had

640
00:23:49,919 --> 00:23:51,360
already been sitting around and then

641
00:23:51,360 --> 00:23:53,880
some of it that is clearly being sort of

642
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:55,440
written on the back of a napkin very

643
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,240
quickly trying to like support this war

644
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,640
effort

645
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,120
um what you get with Isaac wiper is uh

646
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:05,100
sort of an it's just a different style

647
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:09,600
of wiping but essentially uh this is the

648
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:11,159
it's called Isaac wiper because

649
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:12,840
originally folks thought that this was

650
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,659
using like the ISAC prng it turns out

651
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:17,039
that it's just the mercy and twister

652
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:18,960
prng it really doesn't matter it's just

653
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:21,360
sort of like a random number generator

654
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:24,900
um that they're feeding directly to uh

655
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,780
sort of a device based on like uh

656
00:24:27,780 --> 00:24:30,120
specific octals and then writing out

657
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,480
that random data directly uh to these

658
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,240
devices and thankfully at least in some

659
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:37,860
of the earlier versions they give us a

660
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:39,480
nice set of strings just letting us know

661
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:42,179
exactly what they're up to like erasing

662
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:43,700
physical drives

663
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:46,020
then we get yet another one we get

664
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:48,600
double zero which apparently Microsoft

665
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:51,600
calls fiber Lake cert UA actually brings

666
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,820
this to everybody's attention

667
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:54,900
um

668
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:56,340
but

669
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:59,000
it's actually this dot net

670
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,740
obfuscated to bits

671
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:04,740
um horrible thing and rather than claim

672
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,780
credit for de-obfuscating it which is a

673
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,400
Fool's errand on my part I'll point to

674
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,039
Talos having done a great write-up and

675
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,020
sort of figuring out yet another wiper

676
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:16,799
hard-coded physical paths and

677
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:19,860
look it's almost like droning on but the

678
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:21,240
point of this is it's not understanding

679
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,620
how detection is going to work not

680
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:23,760
knowing what's going to work for how

681
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:24,960
long not knowing what's going to get

682
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:28,320
caught it's basically we went to fiber

683
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,720
we like we sat there and wrote as many

684
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,520
different wipers as we could think of in

685
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:34,559
slightly different ways to just

686
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,440
accomplish the same goal uh towards the

687
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,299
later part of

688
00:25:39,299 --> 00:25:40,980
um well the in I was going to say later

689
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,120
part of the invasion I wish that were

690
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:45,539
the case towards like week four five you

691
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:47,640
start to see desert blade uh which is

692
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,820
actually written in go uh it's uses it

693
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,919
abuses things like Microsoft's go when

694
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:56,820
IO and um this hectane uh package for

695
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,640
apples uh I actually really enjoy

696
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,020
reversing goes we wrote this thing

697
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:02,880
called alphagolang that makes it

698
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,919
relatively easy so I can actually show

699
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:07,380
you the entire logic of the wiper in two

700
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:10,140
screenshots it's just you know we've got

701
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:13,039
what like eight functions two packages

702
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:16,980
and it's relatively well documented on

703
00:26:16,980 --> 00:26:18,360
their part but essentially they're

704
00:26:18,360 --> 00:26:20,820
abusing this Microsoft package to get

705
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,039
directly at the physical drives uh

706
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,600
they're adjusting the Echoes based on

707
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:26,520
this hectane package and then they're

708
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,500
just dumping a bunch of like random

709
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,720
garbage directly into the drives

710
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,520
this is actually better written than

711
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:34,740
party ticket at least

712
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:36,360
so the real question becomes you know

713
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,100
why so many wipers right it's almost

714
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,360
like droning on about all these

715
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:41,039
different capabilities

716
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,720
um I would actually point out that

717
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:44,640
rather than saying that this is a wiper

718
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,520
heavy uh

719
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,400
thick or strategy uh I think it actually

720
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:53,340
reflects more about our bias as

721
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,440
observers and what we can see there's

722
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,059
this sort of telemetrical fog of War

723
00:26:57,059 --> 00:26:59,700
that's happening with Ukraine uh by that

724
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,159
I mean like they're in a real war folks

725
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:03,679
are

726
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,000
not exactly sitting at their desk

727
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,299
staring at their computers and

728
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:12,059
there is actually a lack of telemetry

729
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:13,740
going to most of us that are trying to

730
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,500
do this work so what you're seeing is

731
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,480
the activity that we're meant to see the

732
00:27:18,480 --> 00:27:20,100
reason wipers weren't very popular with

733
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,080
nation state groups before is you had to

734
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,299
make a decision to lose the access you

735
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:26,039
had that you could have had for two

736
00:27:26,039 --> 00:27:28,260
years in order to like make a political

737
00:27:28,260 --> 00:27:30,779
statement or write some dumb thing to a

738
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:33,360
drive and most threat actors wouldn't

739
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,480
you know go that route instead here

740
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,000
since it's part of some you know larger

741
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,320
tactic of operations and sort of

742
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:44,580
disabling it is actually worth investing

743
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:47,039
into it but it's only the the loudest

744
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,080
part that's sort of yelling at us that

745
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:51,539
it's there so it's inevitably this tip

746
00:27:51,539 --> 00:27:53,279
of the iceberg situation as far as what

747
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:55,260
we know

748
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:57,240
so there's this big question of whether

749
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,760
the use is random or tactical by that

750
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,100
like we're kind of fighting back and

751
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,360
forth with folks that are trying to

752
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,039
figure out if like the Russians are

753
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:06,779
incredibly well organized and they're

754
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:08,820
deploying their wipers

755
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:11,460
um coordinated with like kinetic attacks

756
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,960
and like you know you go you wipe the

757
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,940
place and then the Cavalry shows up and

758
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,500
you know I think that's giving them a

759
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,419
great deal of credit

760
00:28:18,419 --> 00:28:20,760
um that maybe they don't deserve but we

761
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:22,559
do have this really interesting case for

762
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:23,940
those of you I hope that you went to

763
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:26,279
eset's talk earlier today

764
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:27,659
um they're absolutely the right people

765
00:28:27,659 --> 00:28:29,100
to talk about in Destroyer so we're not

766
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:31,380
going to go into guts of Industry itself

767
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,880
but I think it is important to talk

768
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:35,159
about this case overall because it

769
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:36,659
teaches us something about the use of

770
00:28:36,659 --> 00:28:38,340
the wipers

771
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:40,380
as a slight deviation I think if there's

772
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,240
any sense of humor left in the gru it's

773
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,179
being measured in argue patch variants

774
00:28:44,179 --> 00:28:46,500
argue patch is this really interesting

775
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:50,039
really kind of funny uh piece of malware

776
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:51,480
that's meant to sort of be for like

777
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,520
early stage deployment I say that it's

778
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,220
funny because the first version of argue

779
00:28:56,220 --> 00:28:57,960
patch also called April acts by

780
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:01,200
Microsoft that was discovered is this

781
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,080
sort of backdoor trojanized uh

782
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,340
Ida Pro debugger binary there is no

783
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,679
reason to use that other than just get a

784
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:12,020
kick out of things

785
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:15,900
then the next one we ever see actually

786
00:29:15,900 --> 00:29:19,260
uses like an ESET executable to load the

787
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:21,480
Shell Code so someone over there is

788
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:23,039
still having a bit of a sense of humor

789
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,799
about this whole thing so if you think

790
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:27,659
about it caddy wiper Isaac wiper both of

791
00:29:27,659 --> 00:29:28,860
them are discovered in this sort of like

792
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,480
slightly decontextualized manner like

793
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:31,620
there are some attacks on specific

794
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:33,720
organizations but you know how they're

795
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,340
using it where they're deploying it how

796
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,200
they're deploying it Etc is not very

797
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:38,520
clear

798
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,200
caddy wiper

799
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:43,880
interestingly enough is Tiny it's nine

800
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:48,659
kilobytes it has very simple logic to it

801
00:29:48,659 --> 00:29:50,700
you you know you can basically see all

802
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:52,260
the relevant functions actually it might

803
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,940
be all the functions

804
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:56,159
um and you know you've got your stack

805
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:57,840
strings and they're just going again

806
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,080
device idle control specific actules

807
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,679
walk into PV trying not to touch any

808
00:30:03,679 --> 00:30:05,940
apis that may have been hooked by any of

809
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:09,840
the AVS and so on and then recursively

810
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,399
enumerating all these files adjusting

811
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:13,679
privileges writing zeros out there you

812
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,360
know the usual

813
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:15,899
um

814
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:17,460
this is where it gets a little more

815
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:20,100
interesting yeah so we can begin to add

816
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,740
some context into caddy wiper overall

817
00:30:22,740 --> 00:30:25,919
and the campaigns so thanks to uh this

818
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:28,919
ESET for this timeline here uh what they

819
00:30:28,919 --> 00:30:30,899
began to see and report on overall was

820
00:30:30,899 --> 00:30:34,620
the deployment of uh caddy wiper and the

821
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:36,299
timeline leading up to the end Destroyer

822
00:30:36,299 --> 00:30:38,760
side so you know they begin by saying

823
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,200
hey we're starting to see this in

824
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,760
Ukrainian Banks and then the government

825
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,820
agencies and then starting to step into

826
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:47,640
the energy provider's side and that's

827
00:30:47,640 --> 00:30:49,200
what leads up to the industry or two

828
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:54,000
side ultimately acting as in a sense a a

829
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,760
an operational lead into in Destroyer

830
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:59,220
we're talking about a second so again

831
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:01,500
kudos to ESET on their in Destroyer 2

832
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,960
talk if you haven't seen it uh I hope we

833
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,220
can catch a video online at this point

834
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:07,200
since this morning but definitely the

835
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,820
right sources to talk to about industry

836
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:09,840
or two

837
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:12,600
But ultimately this leads us to the

838
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,640
attempt of

839
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:18,899
catty wiper acting as a step leading

840
00:31:18,899 --> 00:31:21,720
into disrupting the recovery from in

841
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:24,960
Destroyer 2. so great chart from from

842
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,659
them here again so we have caddy wiper

843
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:30,899
uh ultimately being used to stop the

844
00:31:30,899 --> 00:31:33,299
recovery of the damage caused by in

845
00:31:33,299 --> 00:31:35,700
Destroyer 2. so folks that missed the

846
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,340
the talk earlier and you know it might

847
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,860
be gibberish to you in Destroyer was

848
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:43,320
used to to cause the Ukrainian blackout

849
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,659
in 2016

850
00:31:44,659 --> 00:31:48,120
to see and Destroyer come back around it

851
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,860
was particularly interesting but just

852
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:51,539
equate it in your minds to trying to

853
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:55,440
shut down power substations essentially

854
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,539
yeah so power substations going offline

855
00:31:57,539 --> 00:32:00,480
then the ability for The Operators to

856
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,760
recover that being uh

857
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:04,860
Irreplaceable at that point

858
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:07,500
so that leads us to the the seconds uh

859
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,760
the right hand side where we start to

860
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,880
step into the Solaris and Linux sides of

861
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,799
the the wipers so

862
00:32:13,799 --> 00:32:15,539
this is where we start to see newer

863
00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:18,179
reports on a few different things so the

864
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:20,640
first one is is orc Shred

865
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,779
this is

866
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:23,880
um The Shred terminology is kind of

867
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:25,919
their their way of saying wipe however

868
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,980
orc shred in particular isn't actually

869
00:32:27,980 --> 00:32:30,240
wiping anything it's actually more used

870
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:33,059
for an SSH spreader mechanism internally

871
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:35,520
within networks so being able to

872
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,919
essentially Brute Force

873
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:40,740
um local IP addresses inside their

874
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:43,919
Network and try and deploy the the

875
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,700
proper Linux or Solaris

876
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,460
um wafer at that point and I promised I

877
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,440
wouldn't do this in a Russian accent but

878
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:55,559
you can see the art most security there

879
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:57,600
we go

880
00:32:57,600 --> 00:33:00,000
so yeah there we go it kicks off talking

881
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,380
about that and then this is where it

882
00:33:01,380 --> 00:33:03,659
does the checks for you know if this is

883
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:05,940
a Solaris host inside this network

884
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:08,640
deploy the Solaris wiper and if not

885
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,220
deploy the Linux side

886
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:14,340
so and this is what you're looking at is

887
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,740
the uh the The Brute forcing mechanism

888
00:33:16,740 --> 00:33:19,559
essentially to spread laterally and this

889
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:21,360
reminds me a lot of just like the really

890
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:24,419
really terrible cryptocurrency miners we

891
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:25,620
see on like Cloud infrastructure that

892
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:27,899
just all use the same crappy script

893
00:33:27,899 --> 00:33:30,720
looks just like that to me unfortunately

894
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,760
but brute forcing internal IPS and

895
00:33:32,760 --> 00:33:34,919
trying to spread the uh the script to

896
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:36,779
them at that point

897
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:39,480
so on the Solaris side we have solo

898
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:44,039
shred uh very simple no obfuscation done

899
00:33:44,039 --> 00:33:47,220
and I think this speaks a lot to the

900
00:33:47,220 --> 00:33:51,120
lack of requiring to evade the detection

901
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,399
mechanisms on Solaris host just because

902
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:55,380
of I think products that kind of support

903
00:33:55,380 --> 00:33:56,519
that end

904
00:33:56,519 --> 00:34:00,120
so ultimately it's doing very basic uh

905
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:03,179
mechanisms of finding

906
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:04,260
um

907
00:34:04,260 --> 00:34:07,140
system directories and then system disks

908
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,780
to then delete irrecoverably at that

909
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:11,159
point

910
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:14,219
you're a nice rmrf no preserve route for

911
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:15,659
everybody who's ever made that mistake

912
00:34:15,659 --> 00:34:16,918
before

913
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:18,599
the Linux size a little bit different we

914
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:19,590
have awful Shred

915
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:21,480
[Music]

916
00:34:21,480 --> 00:34:24,119
this one actually has a a decent amount

917
00:34:24,119 --> 00:34:28,260
of obfuscation and thanks to uh wands

918
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,060
last minute slide preparation we were

919
00:34:30,060 --> 00:34:33,480
able to de-obfuscate them and I'd rather

920
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,219
the obfuscate at the script manually

921
00:34:35,219 --> 00:34:38,040
than make slides yeah so I'm sorry very

922
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:40,560
basic mechanisms to uh to obfuscate make

923
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:41,820
it more difficult for us to understand

924
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:43,679
it overall but once you get past that

925
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:49,020
there again is more of the uh simple yet

926
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:53,820
much more specific and wider methods of

927
00:34:53,820 --> 00:34:56,040
wiping that host you know we're not just

928
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,320
seeing them uh deleting directories and

929
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,820
disks we're seeing them also Purge

930
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:02,700
memory we're seeing them uh you know

931
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,500
look for a lot more different

932
00:35:04,500 --> 00:35:06,599
directories what else is there clean

933
00:35:06,599 --> 00:35:09,900
bash history they're going for the MTD

934
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:12,119
block devices they're you know cleaning

935
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:13,920
out the swap they're just trying to make

936
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,839
sure like they they're incredibly

937
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:18,300
thorough on the Linux side

938
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:20,160
um you know stop Services kill demons

939
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,619
like everything you could think of

940
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:24,420
um they're they're being incredibly

941
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:28,740
thorough in the logic of this script

942
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:30,540
and really you know after having the

943
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,099
obfuscated thing like this is the main

944
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:33,599
logic like you can just see sort of how

945
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:36,660
this thing flows and it they're just uh

946
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:39,540
simple but effective simple like it's

947
00:35:39,540 --> 00:35:40,920
actually this is why I've been like

948
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,359
tweeting about the state of like Linux

949
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:43,560
security lately it's like you can

950
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,700
complain as much as you want about

951
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:48,180
Windows but like this is what like a 200

952
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:50,940
line script that'll just break a Linux

953
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:53,400
system yeah uh no questions asked so

954
00:35:53,400 --> 00:35:55,079
yeah so looking at all three of those

955
00:35:55,079 --> 00:35:57,480
it's important to note that there's not

956
00:35:57,480 --> 00:35:59,460
really from our perspective any shared

957
00:35:59,460 --> 00:36:01,079
code to other stuff that's floating

958
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:02,640
around there and they're all unique in

959
00:36:02,640 --> 00:36:04,859
their own ways where this is all

960
00:36:04,859 --> 00:36:06,839
essentially from our perspective stuff

961
00:36:06,839 --> 00:36:10,140
that was slammed together right when it

962
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:12,000
was uh ended up getting being or being

963
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:13,500
used at that point rather than any sort

964
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,079
of thing that's on on the tool shelf for

965
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:17,940
for months at that point or maybe a

966
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:19,500
statement about how bad Linux security

967
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,180
is and we just haven't caught this

968
00:36:21,180 --> 00:36:23,760
before I'm just saying I have no idea

969
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:25,140
yes

970
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:27,240
um so then there's the case of acid rain

971
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:30,000
sort of near and dear to our hearts

972
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,020
um

973
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:32,940
so there's been a lot of discussion

974
00:36:32,940 --> 00:36:35,460
about attacks on telecommunications uh

975
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:38,820
in Ukraine a lot of sort of like DDOS

976
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,460
and sabotage whether physical or cyber

977
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:43,500
uh and trying to intermittently take

978
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,380
down isps and internet uh I do think

979
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:47,820
that it was kind of half-hearted in the

980
00:36:47,820 --> 00:36:49,500
beginning which isn't surprising

981
00:36:49,500 --> 00:36:51,180
considering that you know if you're

982
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:53,040
invading a country with walkie-talkies

983
00:36:53,040 --> 00:36:54,480
and cell phones who probably don't want

984
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,920
to take their Communications

985
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:57,960
infrastructure down

986
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,200
um and it it you have a very interesting

987
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:03,119
incident with biosa that sort of work

988
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,380
this is what we're going to discuss with

989
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:06,180
acid rain but then sort of Starling

990
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,400
comes into the picture and credit to

991
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,200
them from what we hear they actually

992
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,619
have been incredibly useful in in

993
00:37:13,619 --> 00:37:17,040
Ukraine so what ends up happening is at

994
00:37:17,040 --> 00:37:18,839
the very beginning of the invasion and

995
00:37:18,839 --> 00:37:20,820
you know this article is from the 28th

996
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:25,020
February we start to see public reports

997
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:26,640
about

998
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,760
um wind turbines in Germany uh going

999
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:31,980
down and let's be be sort of careful

1000
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:33,540
about the terminology right like they're

1001
00:37:33,540 --> 00:37:36,300
they're not exploding they're not not

1002
00:37:36,300 --> 00:37:38,400
functioning they were still spinning

1003
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,800
well I don't know if we'll go that far

1004
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,599
they they essentially they were

1005
00:37:42,599 --> 00:37:44,280
incommunicated which is enough for them

1006
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,880
to not function it's about 8 500 of them

1007
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:51,260
um and given the timing and sort of the

1008
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:53,880
bizarreness of the choice to conduct

1009
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,440
this Invasion at least from our

1010
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:58,200
perspective it made it I think a lot of

1011
00:37:58,200 --> 00:37:59,820
folks started to kind of panic a little

1012
00:37:59,820 --> 00:38:01,980
bit right like are we starting to see

1013
00:38:01,980 --> 00:38:04,079
like also attacks on Western Europe and

1014
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,300
like we have no idea sort of how far

1015
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:09,720
this is going to go in reality what we

1016
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,119
start to get is sort of ViaSat confirms

1017
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:15,000
the suspected Cyber attack mostly in the

1018
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:16,980
context of Ukraine

1019
00:38:16,980 --> 00:38:18,119
um and I

1020
00:38:18,119 --> 00:38:21,300
actually should probably speed up so

1021
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:23,220
something interesting is ViaSat kind of

1022
00:38:23,220 --> 00:38:25,380
comes out with this statement and they

1023
00:38:25,380 --> 00:38:28,440
say you know they got network access and

1024
00:38:28,440 --> 00:38:31,079
it's sort of like used to execute

1025
00:38:31,079 --> 00:38:33,240
legitimate stuff but like no malware no

1026
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,400
supply chain attack no nothing

1027
00:38:35,400 --> 00:38:37,079
um at this point I need to be fair to

1028
00:38:37,079 --> 00:38:39,359
biasat like they didn't we call it

1029
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:40,740
device that hack which is really unfair

1030
00:38:40,740 --> 00:38:42,240
to them they bought a company called

1031
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,099
utel sad that's managed by an Italian

1032
00:38:44,099 --> 00:38:46,079
company called Sky logic and it just so

1033
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:48,720
happens that like vid you tell sad got

1034
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,099
popped

1035
00:38:50,099 --> 00:38:52,560
um at the time we had this reporting

1036
00:38:52,560 --> 00:38:54,119
from Reuben Santa Marta who was like

1037
00:38:54,119 --> 00:38:57,660
dumping the uh driver the sorry the

1038
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:00,300
modems that were you know pre and post

1039
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:02,760
attack and of course you can't see it

1040
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:05,760
there but basically the entirety

1041
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,339
um of the contents of the modem was just

1042
00:39:08,339 --> 00:39:10,980
sort of wiped with this like ffff uh

1043
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:15,060
like decrementing from ffff by one uh

1044
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:16,980
and sort of looping over and over

1045
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:18,720
something like this and it's

1046
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:19,980
particularly interesting I mean there's

1047
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:22,500
an obvious pattern right like FFF E3

1048
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,260
ffff E2 and so on

1049
00:39:25,260 --> 00:39:26,040
um

1050
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:30,240
so we had stumbled upon this binary on

1051
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,920
VT I say stumbled because like we had

1052
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:34,619
some fairly basic traps around

1053
00:39:34,619 --> 00:39:36,420
um after

1054
00:39:36,420 --> 00:39:39,240
seeing some of the early reporting and

1055
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,760
there's a binary called ucrop which can

1056
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,220
mean parsley but it's apparently also a

1057
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,020
derogatory term that Russians call

1058
00:39:46,020 --> 00:39:49,200
ukrainians uh was uploaded from Italy to

1059
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,900
virustotal you can see sort of the name

1060
00:39:51,900 --> 00:39:54,540
the date March 15th

1061
00:39:54,540 --> 00:39:56,220
um interestingly and this is kind of

1062
00:39:56,220 --> 00:39:57,660
where we had based some of our stuff

1063
00:39:57,660 --> 00:40:00,119
it's like an l-32

1064
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:02,579
um it's binary

1065
00:40:02,579 --> 00:40:04,740
never seen before or never seen again

1066
00:40:04,740 --> 00:40:06,960
sort of submitted from just one place uh

1067
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:09,000
with a sort of interesting name this is

1068
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:10,980
what we started to call acid rain if you

1069
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:12,720
look at it it's basically like a Brute

1070
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,780
Force wiper for Linux systems mostly

1071
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:18,000
like embedded systems so it'll walk all

1072
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,440
these directories like I kind of want to

1073
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,520
speed it up because I know like we're

1074
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,320
far in but it'll walk all these

1075
00:40:22,320 --> 00:40:24,300
directories it'll hit all the sort of

1076
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,980
types of devices that you might normally

1077
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,500
see in an embedded system uh it has two

1078
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,480
types of wiping mechanisms we'll call A

1079
00:40:30,480 --> 00:40:31,920
and B

1080
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:33,480
um I'm going to run through this real

1081
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:35,280
quick if you really care about the

1082
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,740
details go

1083
00:40:36,740 --> 00:40:39,420
just look for acid rain on Google you'll

1084
00:40:39,420 --> 00:40:41,099
find a report but essentially same

1085
00:40:41,099 --> 00:40:43,619
wiping mechanism that we had seen that

1086
00:40:43,619 --> 00:40:46,020
would produce that ffff decrementing

1087
00:40:46,020 --> 00:40:48,380
pattern

1088
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,880
credit to max van omarongan who might be

1089
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:52,560
in the crowd for the reversing on the

1090
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:55,260
mips side hey there you are Thanks Max

1091
00:40:55,260 --> 00:40:57,420
um interestingly so we put this out in

1092
00:40:57,420 --> 00:40:58,619
this sort of tentative way of saying

1093
00:40:58,619 --> 00:41:00,180
look this is a wiper came around at the

1094
00:41:00,180 --> 00:41:01,800
same time that would produce what we're

1095
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:04,320
seeing from from ViaSat like something

1096
00:41:04,320 --> 00:41:06,720
doesn't jive with their statement

1097
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,700
um and interestingly via sat the very

1098
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,440
next day like it was you know very

1099
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,760
forthcoming very kind he just said yeah

1100
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,500
this is the malware that was involved in

1101
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:15,119
the attack I'm sure there's a lot more

1102
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,440
to it they have a great incident

1103
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:18,000
response company I hope that someday

1104
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,920
they provide the incident response

1105
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:22,740
report but that's really up to ViaSat on

1106
00:41:22,740 --> 00:41:23,880
you know deciding how they're going to

1107
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:25,380
handle that

1108
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:27,720
um the other wiping mechanism uh what we

1109
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:29,460
call B which runs if you're running as

1110
00:41:29,460 --> 00:41:33,119
root is interesting in that it uses the

1111
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,520
same kind of by octals and sort of the

1112
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:37,740
way that they would do the wiping

1113
00:41:37,740 --> 00:41:42,240
um as a plugin called dstr destroy

1114
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:44,460
whatever you want to consider it that

1115
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,680
was actually a part of VPN filter stage

1116
00:41:46,680 --> 00:41:48,480
3 plug-in so if anybody remembers VPN

1117
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:51,119
filter publicly attributed by the FBI to

1118
00:41:51,119 --> 00:41:53,400
sanworm back in the day is that enough

1119
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,140
for a conclusive link

1120
00:41:55,140 --> 00:41:57,000
I I don't know that I'd say that but

1121
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,680
there's definitely smoke there like

1122
00:41:58,680 --> 00:41:59,880
there's something sort of worth looking

1123
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:02,640
at you can check out the details in the

1124
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:04,880
report after about a month after this

1125
00:42:04,880 --> 00:42:07,560
the US UK you actually come out and

1126
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:09,839
officially sort of blame

1127
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:12,300
so it's concerning in that it's more

1128
00:42:12,300 --> 00:42:15,540
generic and they can basically deploy it

1129
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:17,339
wherever they want at this point so

1130
00:42:17,339 --> 00:42:19,200
waiting for the next supply chain attack

1131
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,960
so with that what happens now where do

1132
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,339
we see the the Russian threat landscape

1133
00:42:23,339 --> 00:42:25,680
go where do we see the conflicts in

1134
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:27,480
Ukraine going from the the Cyber

1135
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:28,619
perspective

1136
00:42:28,619 --> 00:42:32,640
so are we entering the ICS doomscape I

1137
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,440
wouldn't quite say so however there's so

1138
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:37,020
much unknown at this point and that

1139
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:40,920
really steps us into a lot of the

1140
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,500
I would say the the newer activity that

1141
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,300
we're seeing related to the ICS side

1142
00:42:45,300 --> 00:42:47,160
that we just don't know if they're going

1143
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,160
to be used elsewhere uh in controller in

1144
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:51,660
particular is of interest to us because

1145
00:42:51,660 --> 00:42:53,460
there's a lot of mystery around where it

1146
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:57,480
was found in kudos to UA cert and ESET I

1147
00:42:57,480 --> 00:43:00,380
believe uh man the end

1148
00:43:00,380 --> 00:43:04,740
sorry yeah yeah and uh so is this is

1149
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:06,540
this a new ICS piece of malware that

1150
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:08,579
we're going to begin to see more leading

1151
00:43:08,579 --> 00:43:10,619
up to the winner and the energy crisis

1152
00:43:10,619 --> 00:43:12,540
throughout Europe is this going to be

1153
00:43:12,540 --> 00:43:15,359
used to force certain organizations to

1154
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,599
come back to Russia for energy if they

1155
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:20,160
were able to be disrupted through this

1156
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:22,380
this type of malware

1157
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:26,220
and then we have it overlapping into uh

1158
00:43:26,220 --> 00:43:28,560
potentially links to what we see coming

1159
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:31,560
out of North Korea is this uh a way that

1160
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:33,359
they're going to start to fund

1161
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:36,180
themselves as a state similar to what

1162
00:43:36,180 --> 00:43:39,540
North Koreans do through cyber crime

1163
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:42,240
um more I guess interaction with the

1164
00:43:42,240 --> 00:43:44,700
cybercrime community to fund themselves

1165
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,619
financially

1166
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:49,800
and so I'll just kind of let it go here

1167
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,180
but essentially then there's the

1168
00:43:51,180 --> 00:43:52,200
question of whether we want to start

1169
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:54,720
talking about cyber attacks as part of

1170
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,280
things that the international criminal

1171
00:43:56,280 --> 00:43:57,720
court should investigate I know that

1172
00:43:57,720 --> 00:43:59,220
it's been described as something maybe a

1173
00:43:59,220 --> 00:44:00,720
silly idea it is something that we

1174
00:44:00,720 --> 00:44:02,280
should test and consider as far as the

1175
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,660
international criminal Criminal Court

1176
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:05,700
scope there's a great article about it

1177
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:06,900
it's a wonderful Folks at Berkeley

1178
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:08,760
working on it uh but just something to

1179
00:44:08,760 --> 00:44:10,740
keep in mind about how to actually start

1180
00:44:10,740 --> 00:44:12,900
to put some gravitas and weight behind

1181
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:15,300
the idea that cyber attacks are going

1182
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:18,540
after civilians recklessly uh and is the

1183
00:44:18,540 --> 00:44:20,940
sort of systematic fashion so with that

1184
00:44:20,940 --> 00:44:23,099
we have way overstayed our welcome thank

1185
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:25,500
you all so much for showing up we can do

1186
00:44:25,500 --> 00:44:29,480
questions back there thank you

1187
00:44:29,700 --> 00:44:32,700
foreign

1188
00:44:37,020 --> 00:44:40,119
