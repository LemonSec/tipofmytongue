wow we are back in full effect this year

12
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:51,299
for the 25th anniversary this is amazing

13
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:54,299
uh everybody just keeps coming and

14
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:56,939
coming to the show and uh

15
00:01:56,939 --> 00:01:58,259
and I want to share with you a little

16
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:01,680
bit of the history of uh of how we all

17
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,259
got here but before we get started I've

18
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:06,899
got some little announcement notes I'm

19
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:08,340
going to talk a little bit about the

20
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,739
creation of of black hat a couple of my

21
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:12,239
thoughts and then it's going to be my

22
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,819
pleasure to introduce a keynote speaker

23
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:17,220
today Chris Krebs

24
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,680
so okay let's get started

25
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,900
um I normally run through all the

26
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:24,180
countries where people have come to

27
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:26,280
Black Cat to attend to try to show how

28
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:29,700
Global of a community we are

29
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:32,239
um this year there's people from 111

30
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,379
different countries

31
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:36,480
here which is I'm not going to go

32
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,099
through them

33
00:02:38,099 --> 00:02:39,540
it's going to take a while I used to go

34
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,340
through just the countries that had one

35
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,440
person and then you get to 30 or 40

36
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,760
countries that had just one person

37
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,440
attending so now I'm just kind of

38
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,060
aggregating it but I'm letting you know

39
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:50,220
the planet is here

40
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:52,800
and it's because we're all hungry for

41
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,060
the same thing we're all trying to

42
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,780
figure out what the is going on

43
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:59,940
I mean just when we think we have it

44
00:02:59,940 --> 00:03:01,800
figured out things change and if you ask

45
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,840
me 25 years ago

46
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,060
like how Dynamic would it be I would

47
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,879
seriously say most of security would be

48
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,760
baked in 25 years right and they figured

49
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,620
out how to launch rockets in 25 years

50
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:16,019
get to the moon in 25 years a lot of

51
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:17,340
things have been figured out in a

52
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,080
quarter century

53
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:20,640
we're still like trying to figure out

54
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:22,860
did you try turning it on and off

55
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:25,680
you know so

56
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,019
so don't feel bad if you're still trying

57
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:30,659
to figure out what's going on

58
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:31,620
um

59
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,599
to try to keep the community growing

60
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,760
because we all are getting older because

61
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,920
we're not solving this problem space

62
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,799
anytime soon how do we bring up

63
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,220
the Next Generation how do we encourage

64
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:46,500
more inclusion more diverse perspectives

65
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,480
because when it was just a network

66
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:50,220
engineer trying to get the computer to

67
00:03:50,220 --> 00:03:51,480
work

68
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,000
you needed a certain engineering

69
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,319
perspective

70
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,060
but now when you're dealing with Miss

71
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,400
and dis Mal information you're dealing

72
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,220
with social impacts of Technology we

73
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,739
need a lot more people in the room

74
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:07,860
trying to explain what's going on right

75
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:09,959
what the unintended consequences of the

76
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:11,580
technology are

77
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:14,220
and so to do that black hat over the

78
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:17,060
years have been sponsoring

79
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,139
scholarships for different communities

80
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:21,978
to try to bring them in to our community

81
00:04:21,978 --> 00:04:25,860
and so no different this year we have a

82
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:27,620
student scholarship program

83
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:31,199
132 scholarships were handed out if

84
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,720
you're in the audience when I'm calling

85
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,919

00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,320
apply for the scholarship

102
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:30,680
and welcome

103
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:34,740
so I'm going to delve briefly in to sort

104
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,860
of the early days of of black hat and I

105
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,840
don't talk about this much because when

106
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:41,699
you're so close to it you sort of assume

107
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:44,580
everybody knows it but

108
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:46,440
you realize they probably don't and

109
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,880
maybe you'd find it interesting on our

110
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:50,340
25th anniversary

111
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,500
um so in the early days

112
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:54,660
there was nothing really of consequence

113
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:57,240
online so there really wasn't a lot of

114
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,600
damage you could do if you hack stuff

115
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:03,060
um but when they when the.com boom

116
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:05,400
started building and everybody wanted to

117
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,220
go online and try e-commerce

118
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,800
the hackers we naturally ended up being

119
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,240
the people who got the jobs because

120
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:14,100
there weren't enough people who

121
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:17,580
understood how the network worked and I

122
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,380
knew something was boiling around Defcon

123
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,759
3

124
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:23,220
Defcon three or four I started getting

125
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,500
requests to make a professional sounding

126
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,120
announcement

127
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,060
and if you know Defcon I mean if it's a

128
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,819
half party half hacker Shenanigans it's

129
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:34,380
like the last thing I wanted to do is

130
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,639
make a professional sounding

131
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:36,960
announcement

132
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,360
for Defcon but I did I made it all very

133
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,280
professional you could give it to your

134
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,960
boss and trick him into thinking he was

135
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,860
going to a real conference

136
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:48,600
and and then it happened the next year

137
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:49,800
again

138
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:51,300
and it's like I don't want to keep

139
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,280
making these fake professional

140
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,100
announcements and my friend Ray Kaplan

141
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,259
one of the original Unix greybeards from

142
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:02,039
deck he said you know what you should

143
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:05,400
just do the conference they want

144
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,750
charge them a lot of money

145
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:10,460
[Laughter]

146
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:14,940
give them food like a program make it a

147
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,380
real conference

148
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:18,000
that's like that's a brilliant idea but

149
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,620
I don't have any money

150
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:21,840
and so I started it a year later we

151
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,400
started blackout a year later than I

152
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:26,880
wanted to but I had got a loan and uh

153
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,940
and it was originally called well

154
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:33,360
it was almost called the network

155
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:35,580
security conference

156
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,979
how brilliant sounding is that because

157
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:39,419
you know there's some networking and

158
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:40,620
there's some security

159
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:42,720
but also at the time we were starting to

160
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,400
put colors on everything right the black

161
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,460
hat and the white hat and uh

162
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,979
and so I was I was talking over with

163
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:52,500
some friends at work and and the

164
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,060
marketing director came by for the

165
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:55,380
company I was working at secure

166
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,539
Computing Corporation no longer in

167
00:07:57,539 --> 00:07:59,759
existence the very first internet

168
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,020
security stock ever listed on the NASDAQ

169
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:05,580
and the marketing director came by and

170
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:07,800
said NSC sounds terrible black hat

171
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,900
sounds spooky you should do that and she

172
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,318
walks away

173
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:15,419
and I was like okay if she says she's a

174
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:17,340
marketing person I'll believe her and it

175
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,660
was originally called the black hat

176
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:21,120
briefings now we're black hat but we

177
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,039
were the black hat briefings because the

178
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,340
idea was we wanted to tell you

179
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,500
what the black hats were up to we were

180
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:30,960
going to brief you on the black hats

181
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,419
and the whole concept was sort of a

182
00:08:33,419 --> 00:08:37,080
crystal ball of if the hackers in the

183
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,820
early security researchers thought this

184
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:40,679
stuff was interesting

185
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,659
then maybe you would think it was

186
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:44,580
interesting and if they were worried

187
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,680
about it today maybe it'll be a problem

188
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,000
for you tomorrow

189
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,279
and that was sort of our formula very

190
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:53,580
applied Hands-On practitioner

191
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:56,399
and that wasn't a master plan that was

192
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,260
just who I knew I mean I literally

193
00:08:58,260 --> 00:08:59,880
called up my friends and said hey I'm

194
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,080
trying to do this thing you want to

195
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:01,800
speak

196
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:04,260
so the community forms around who you

197
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:07,680
know and so it was like Bruce Schneider

198
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,019
and Mudge and Dominique Brzezinski Alex

199
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:14,160
schostak Hobbit it was just route the

200
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:16,440
editor of Frack magazine it's whoever

201
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,880
you knew you called your buddies

202
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,839
together

203
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:20,880
and none of us knew how to run a

204
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:21,959
conference

205
00:09:21,959 --> 00:09:24,300
right there's no books on it there was

206
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,399
no Google or Amazon books on how to run

207
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,019
a conference so we figured it out much

208
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:29,820
like everything else in security we've

209
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:30,899
had to learn

210
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:32,940
along the way

211
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:36,660
and we've seen it all remember when um

212
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,839
we were going to publish reports and

213
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:42,000
inform the consumers on how to buy

214
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,640
products and inform consumers would make

215
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,320
the better choice and buy the more

216
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,180
secure product

217
00:09:48,180 --> 00:09:49,380
yeah

218
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,680
I don't that didn't work

219
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,560
um but that's okay we have our backup

220
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:57,240
plan our backup plan is insurance

221
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,700
companies because now companies are

222
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,560
moving online and once companies are

223
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,760
online

224
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,080
they're beholden to the insurance

225
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,880
companies and the insurance companies

226
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,620
will force them to buy the more secure

227
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,720
product and then when the companies buy

228
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:14,060
secure product the consumers will follow

229
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,180
okay but that's okay we have a backup

230
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:21,240
plan it's called regulation

231
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:23,360
yeah

232
00:10:23,399 --> 00:10:25,440
okay so now we're back to trying to

233
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,779
educate consumers again

234
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:32,100
so we're in this life cycle and

235
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:34,440
we have a couple new challenges going

236
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,459
forward

237
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:37,380
and I'm going to briefly just talk about

238
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:39,480
one of them

239
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,640
um

240
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,740
so

241
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,540
we think we kind of know how it all

242
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,519
works I've talked in the past about sort

243
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:50,040
of Team rule of law

244
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:53,880
and team undecided all the countries in

245
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:55,920
the middle who are being pulled pulled

246
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,060
one way or the other and then team

247
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,040
authoritarian

248
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:01,260
and really it's an argument over control

249
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:03,420
of information

250
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,459
the team rule of law is a little bit

251
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:09,600
more open on axis of information more uh

252
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,180
transparent mode of information sharing

253
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:14,279
team authoritarian really wants to

254
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:16,680
control information more information can

255
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,019
be very dangerous and harmful and

256
00:11:19,019 --> 00:11:20,579
therefore they need to restrict it and

257
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,800
control it and then you've got the

258
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,420
people in between who haven't decided

259
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,640
and they may never decide

260
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,279
you've got the people being tugged

261
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,440
between the two

262
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,959
and as time goes on this will probably

263
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:36,720
intensify and I wouldn't be surprised if

264
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,279
in years

265
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:40,740
there's really sort of the rule of law

266
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,700
Network

267
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,800
and routing in sort of the authoritarian

268
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:46,920
model of routing and those in between

269
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:49,079
that's a little controversial I don't

270
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:52,560
like it coming from icann I want one

271
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,480
open interoperable

272
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:58,680
internet but I'm also kind of a realist

273
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:01,560
now thrown into the mix of this between

274
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:04,019
those kind of competing groups

275
00:12:04,019 --> 00:12:06,000
um

276
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,980
I guess they were always there but they

277
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,940
were never

278
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,880
in the Forefront and when Russia invaded

279
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,779
the Ukraine a new Force emerged or

280
00:12:15,779 --> 00:12:18,060
presented itself and I'm calling them

281
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:20,339
and I got this idea I can't remember the

282
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,260
original Source but it's the super

283
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,240
empowered individual

284
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,180
or the super empowered organization and

285
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:28,560
it's not government

286
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:31,500
and it's not Microsoft it could be a

287
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:32,940
group of people or an individual let me

288
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,279
give you an idea

289
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,740
um about the super-powered individual

290
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:40,140
how many people here show of hands use

291
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,079
uh spam block lists

292
00:12:43,079 --> 00:12:45,360
right how many people use like the drop

293
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,320
list

294
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,079
or bogon filtering lists

295
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:51,720
right you're counting on other people to

296
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,360
create these lists that then you use to

297
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,579
restrict access to your email or your

298
00:12:56,579 --> 00:12:58,260
routing

299
00:12:58,260 --> 00:13:00,360
right so

300
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:02,880
think of it this way the people who are

301
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,740
on spam house

302
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:07,019
they're super empowered they could add

303
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:10,920
something a domain name to the spam list

304
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:13,680
and you would drop that traffic

305
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,779
right they have an outsized amount of

306
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:18,120
influence

307
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,380
so

308
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:22,560
Russia invades Ukraine and people are

309
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:25,260
outraged human rights violations war

310
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,660
crimes people want to make an impact

311
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:29,399
people are pissed

312
00:13:29,399 --> 00:13:31,079
and they don't think the government's

313
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:33,180
doing enough

314
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,399
governments start sanctioning

315
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,760
what do people do well

316
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:40,860
the mongodb project

317
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:44,339
open source database big project they

318
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:45,480
decide

319
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:48,000
that they don't want any more Russian

320
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:51,480
projects on the mongodb Hub and they

321
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,399
just delete all Russian projects boom

322
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:55,639
gone

323
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:57,660
that'd be sort of like GitHub just

324
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,820
deciding to delete everything in Russia

325
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:01,860
right

326
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,420
um nominet

327
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:06,360
internet registrar in the UK

328
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,399
the board gets together here's from the

329
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,040
lawyer lawyer says there are these

330
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,139
sanctions against these wealthy Russians

331
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:17,579
and you're selling domains in Russia and

332
00:14:17,579 --> 00:14:19,019
we're concerned about credit card

333
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:21,480
payments there's a lot of liability of

334
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:24,839
you processing credit cards in Russia

335
00:14:24,839 --> 00:14:27,000
so the board nominant says you know what

336
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:30,360
we won't process credit cards in Russia

337
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:32,579
nobody in Russia can renew their domain

338
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:34,760
names

339
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,139
do you think somebody Might Squat on

340
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:40,620
them and they expire like so companies

341
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,600
are rushing in

342
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,459
communities that want to do something

343
00:14:44,459 --> 00:14:46,800
are super empowered and they're

344
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,740
they're a new player on the field

345
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,720
and we're going to have to learn to live

346
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,040
with that

347
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,660
um in the olden days

348
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:56,820
um Paul if you're in the room I might

349
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:59,459
make a little fun of you Paul vixi

350
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:00,779
um

351
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:04,500
when Paul was a principal uh author of

352
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:08,399
mine the DNS program at the time bind

353
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,240
had

354
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,100
this is years ago maybe 10 years ago 15

355
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,560
years ago it had about 82 percent of the

356
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:15,180
market

357
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:17,880
so 82 percent of the Internet domain

358
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,279
name resolution was coming from bind and

359
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:22,920
if Paul wanted to change bind guess who

360
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:26,519
controlled name service on the internet

361
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:30,240
who's essentially Paul one guy right

362
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,459
and so we would have all these debates

363
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:35,760
about governments and Regulation and I

364
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,459
was just thinking yeah but Paul

365
00:15:38,459 --> 00:15:40,380
you know I mean you gotta if Paul's not

366
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,060
happy with it you might say you know

367
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:44,279
what we're not going to have a domain

368
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:46,860
name service to Russia anymore

369
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,079
Paul wanted to change the root dot hints

370
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:52,620
file and add new root servers

371
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:55,740
my one guy could

372
00:15:55,740 --> 00:15:58,740
and I think what's happening now is we

373
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,300
have to recognize this it's always been

374
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:03,480
around but we have an outsized amount of

375
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,399
influence our communities have an

376
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:07,199
outsized amount of influence just think

377
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,940
about how much influence the log 4J

378
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,500
developer had

379
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:13,199
right

380
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,959
and if we're going to have to recognize

381
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:16,860
that

382
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,839
and own it

383
00:16:18,839 --> 00:16:20,459
because I think this is going to be the

384
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:22,560
tip of the iceberg right these super

385
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,420
empowered individuals and so when I talk

386
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:27,360
to people in government say uh

387
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,519
there's this uh initiative that there's

388
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:30,720
going to be a talk

389
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,380
um

390
00:16:31,380 --> 00:16:32,880
uh later on in the week about

391
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,920
sanctions.net

392
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:37,019
and the idea behind sanctions.net there

393
00:16:37,019 --> 00:16:39,720
was an open paper around it and the

394
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,399
thinking is

395
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:43,740
just like your spam block lists just

396
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:46,380
like your drop list should there be a

397
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,699
list

398
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:50,040
that enumerates all the net blocks and

399
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,699
domain names of sanctioned individuals

400
00:16:52,699 --> 00:16:56,220
sanctioned companies or governments

401
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:58,560
so instead of mongodb having to delete

402
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,079
everything in Russia mongodb could just

403
00:17:01,079 --> 00:17:03,420
say you know what we're implementing the

404
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,699
sanctions list nobody on the sanctioned

405
00:17:05,699 --> 00:17:07,740
list can connect to our services email

406
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,959
addresses whatever and they can Target

407
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:11,760
it much more specifically to a

408
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,679
government entity and not the general

409
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,419
population of these innocent internet

410
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:17,880
users that have nothing to do

411
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,819
with the invasion of Ukraine

412
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:24,780
and so interesting results

413
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:27,660
some people debate it and said yes we

414
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:29,760
should no we shouldn't it kicked off

415
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,400
this big debate other people and some of

416
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:36,240
the more uh engineering type communities

417
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:38,400
caused them to think about maybe their

418
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,160
role do they have any obligation are

419
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,120
there any

420
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,460
ethical considerations on what they're

421
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:45,419
doing

422
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:48,000
so the engineers had to huddle no we're

423
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,160
fine no problem everything we're doing

424
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:52,799
is perfect no need to question any of

425
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:55,280
our decisions

426
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,600
I'm glad that soul-searching happened

427
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,100
over the weekend and you know we're all

428
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,900
fine now

429
00:18:00,900 --> 00:18:03,000
um so when I talk to people in

430
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,039
government about this they say you know

431
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,020
we're a little nervous because sanctions

432
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,900
are what we do governments

433
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,880
it's like yeah but I mean companies have

434
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,559
the right to serve whoever they want if

435
00:18:13,559 --> 00:18:14,700
they don't want to route to you they're

436
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:17,460
not routing to you oh yeah we understand

437
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:19,020
that

438
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,000
still makes us nervous

439
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,919
like yeah well Welcome to our world you

440
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:23,820
know we're

441
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,559
really nervous about a lot of stuff

442
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,240
going on and um

443
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,559
so you better step it up government

444
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:30,179
because we're going to fill in the gaps

445
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:33,000
if you're not on the job

446
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,520
so with that I'm thinking looking

447
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:38,640
forward where do we go from here

448
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,620
I can see it's going to be more chaotic

449
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:43,260
I can I can see that what we do is going

450
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:46,740
to become even more consequential

451
00:18:46,740 --> 00:18:48,480
I can see we're probably going to be

452
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,640
asked to deal with issues that were not

453
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,679
traditionally topics we dealt with right

454
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:56,100
Miss Dismount information wasn't really

455
00:18:56,100 --> 00:19:01,140
an area of study until 2015 2014 2015.

456
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,440
um now it's all about how we create

457
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,720
models and filter content or identify

458
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:08,700
content

459
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,260
so it's going to be my pleasure to

460
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,419
introduce the keynote Chris Krebs the

461
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:14,820
first director of sisa

462
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,240
and partner at uh kreb Stamos Group

463
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,280
which is kind of cheating because the

464
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:22,200
other the Stamos is Alex Stamos who's

465
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,980
also been a past black hat Keynote

466
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,260
and he's going to give us his insights

467
00:19:28,260 --> 00:19:30,419
to see where he thinks we're going from

468
00:19:30,419 --> 00:19:32,460
here what comes next we've survived the

469
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:34,380
first quarter Century what are we going

470
00:19:34,380 --> 00:19:36,419
to be facing in the future

471
00:19:36,419 --> 00:19:38,100
so with that it's been my pleasure to

472
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:40,140
welcome you all thank you very much for

473

and now I'm going to hand it over

475
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:44,000
to Chris Krebs

476
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:48,390
[Applause]

477
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:52,890
[Music]

478
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:56,700
wow uh good morning everybody Jeff

479
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:00,179
thanks for the introduction uh this talk

480
00:20:00,179 --> 00:20:03,840
is rated TLP red pants

481
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,880
it's great to be back here thanks for

482
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:08,280
that uh introduction this morning uh

483
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,020
it's a little bit early and we are back

484
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,280
in Vegas I don't know how many times

485
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,220
y'all have been back since uh covid uh

486
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,440
but it's a little weird to be back in

487
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:18,660
these big groups so thanks for coming

488
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,100
out this morning

489
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,559
um and this is this could be fun so when

490
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:25,140
when Jeff and Steve reached out to me

491
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,840
and said hey uh you know we'd like you

492
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:31,200
to consider opening up black hat I was a

493
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:32,820
little stumped on on what I'd say

494
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:35,100
because when you're a government

495
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,740
official you've got like this whole raft

496
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,900
of staff that you can ask three months

497
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:42,480
in advance to go develop some initiative

498
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,179
that you can launch at a big conference

499
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:47,220
so I don't have that when you're a

500
00:20:47,220 --> 00:20:49,080
vendor right you can launch a new

501
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,720
product I don't have that and so I was

502
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:53,280
thinking about I was like oh God all

503
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:55,980
right so what do I what do I have what's

504
00:20:55,980 --> 00:20:58,020
different what can I bring to this and

505
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:59,400
so I really kind of started thinking

506
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,720
about my time at this uh why I was there

507
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:06,299
what I got done there and and what it is

508
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:09,240
that that I might add that's interesting

509
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:12,059
and what I really kind of came down to

510
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:14,160
is

511
00:21:14,160 --> 00:21:16,559
I'm a I'm a bridge builder I'm a partner

512
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:18,840
Builder I I bring people together to

513
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:21,660
solve problems I'm a middle child and

514
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:23,100
that's part of it right you're always

515
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:25,980
working to find compromise identify

516
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:29,520
problems put together Solutions with

517
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,500
groups and address some of the

518
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:34,039
challenges we have and that's frankly

519
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:37,500
why I tend to think that we at ciso were

520
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:40,140
successful I was in the right place at

521
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:42,419
the right time it is singularly

522
00:21:42,419 --> 00:21:45,840
important moment in American history and

523
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:48,480
I think we did a pretty damn good job

524
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:51,419
and so what I wanted to do is bring a

525
00:21:51,419 --> 00:21:53,700
little bit of that experience that

526
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:56,220
flavor to this talk

527
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:59,760
and what I've been doing over the last

528
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,240
18 months is kind of wandering in the

529
00:22:03,240 --> 00:22:04,500
wilderness

530
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:07,140
going across the country other countries

531
00:22:07,140 --> 00:22:11,159
as well talking to officials in the

532
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:13,559
private sector federal government state

533
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:16,620
and local and trying to understand what

534
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,419
they're trying to accomplish

535
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:20,460
what their aspirations are what their

536
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:23,220
hopes are what their concerns are what

537
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,500
their challenges are and kind of what

538
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:27,360
keeps them up at night

539
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,659
and so through the course of all these

540
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:32,460
conversations

541
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:36,059
it seems that we all are orienting

542
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:37,620
around

543
00:22:37,620 --> 00:22:40,500
three main questions

544
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,360
the first question is

545
00:22:42,360 --> 00:22:44,820
why is it so bad right now

546
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:47,039
why does it seem that we're fighting

547
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,840
this uphill battle

548
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:51,960
and so as we work through kind of my

549
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,539
take their take the collective take

550
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:58,200
of why we think it's so bad right now

551
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,720
you know it kind of goes to this pivot

552
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:02,400
of like well I mean it's gonna get

553
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,720
better right and then they see my

554
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:05,640
reaction

555
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,659
um and they're like what do you mean

556
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:08,940
it's gonna get worse

557
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,799
so then we kind of work through well

558
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:13,020
what are the trend lines that are out

559
00:23:13,020 --> 00:23:14,340
there what are the market pressures what

560
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:15,900
are the forces and inflection points

561
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,360
that we're seeing out ahead of us that

562
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,460
are influencing technology governments

563
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,640
Bad actors us people

564
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,460
and then everyone kind of like slumps

565
00:23:26,460 --> 00:23:28,320
back in their chair it's like what the

566
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,179
hell are we gonna do about it

567
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:32,820
because this isn't hopeless right there

568
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:35,580
are things that we can do here

569
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,080
and that's what I want to work through

570
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,059
with you today here

571
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:42,059
why is it so bad right now

572
00:23:42,059 --> 00:23:45,120
what do you mean it's going to get worse

573
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,880
and third what do we do about it how can

574
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:50,820
we as a community in this room in Vegas

575
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:52,620
right now this week

576
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:55,679
what are we able to do to contribute to

577
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:57,360
solve the challenges that are in front

578
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,980
of us

579
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,580
so why is it so bad it's four reasons as

580
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:05,039
I see it not exclusively for reasons but

581
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,380
four main reasons

582
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,539
it's the technology it's the Bad actors

583
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:11,039
it's the government and yeah it's us

584
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,299
it's people

585
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:15,480
so on the technology side

586
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,220
I think

587
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:19,380
what sums it up best for me is a quote

588
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:22,559
from a couple years ago by Daniel misler

589
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,600
and if you're not following Daniel sign

590
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:27,000
up for his Weekly Newsletter you're

591
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:29,120
really missing out but but his quote is

592
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,880
basically software remains vulnerable

593
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,620
because the benefits of insecure

594
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:38,220
products far outweigh the downsides once

595
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:39,539
that changes

596
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:41,520
software Security will improve but not a

597
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,260
moment before

598
00:24:43,260 --> 00:24:44,700
that Echoes something that Bruce

599
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:48,539
schneier said a decade or so ago

600
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:50,340
we operate

601
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:54,059
inside a larger ecosystem right inside

602
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:55,500
businesses that are focused on

603
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:58,679
productivity reducing friction they tend

604
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:01,500
to see us security at slowing things

605
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,240
down first to market right you want to

606
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:04,740
be first to Market or even second to

607
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,240
Market

608
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:10,440
but security is seen as friction

609
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,200
and what's happening

610
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,600
is as we are integrating more and more

611
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:18,360
secure insecure products

612
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,179
into use cases

613
00:25:21,179 --> 00:25:23,880
we're making it more complicated to

614
00:25:23,880 --> 00:25:27,539
manage risk now as I see it one of the

615
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:29,700
areas where this is happening in

616
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:33,059
accelerated pace is in the cloud so over

617
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:37,080
the last couple years covid drove this

618
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:39,440
incredible acceleration to the cloud

619
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,559
during the digital transformation

620
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:46,400
now what we've done is increase

621
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:50,159
flexibility elasticity productivity

622
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,539
efficiency

623
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:54,200
but we've also reduced things right

624
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:56,400
transparency you can't see what's

625
00:25:56,400 --> 00:26:00,380
happening on the back plane of the cloud

626
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:04,880
so we've made it more complex

627
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:07,500
and we've also started adding on

628
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,500
additional products on top of

629
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,380
the infrastructure on the platforms and

630
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:16,260
we have this explosion of software as a

631
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:17,240
service

632
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:21,539
opportunities and options out there

633
00:26:21,539 --> 00:26:24,840
and then along the way our leadership

634
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:27,960
has become radically efficient

635
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,220
that's happening right now in

636
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,679
accelerated pace is economic headwinds

637
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,779
are on the horizon

638
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:35,580
in organizations are saying look if I

639
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,679
can't do it well

640
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,600
I'm gonna have somebody else

641
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,600
that does it well do it for me

642
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:44,640
we're talking about things like HR and

643
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,940
payroll and Business Management Services

644
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:51,419
so we're building more products that are

645
00:26:51,419 --> 00:26:52,860
insecure by Design because of the market

646
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:55,380
pressures and then we're making it more

647
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,380
and more complex

648
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,700
now

649
00:26:59,700 --> 00:27:02,640
there is good news right

650
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,059
we are here evidence of that

651
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:07,679
10 years ago think back how many

652
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,140
products were there vendors security

653
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,600
products right we have a vibrant robust

654
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:13,860
ecosystem

655
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,179
and yes

656
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:18,179
vendors technology vendors are

657
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:20,779
addressing some of the underlying

658
00:27:20,779 --> 00:27:22,559
vulnerabilities

659
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,900
but is it happening at the pace that we

660
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,940
want it to

661
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,500
but what are we really talking about

662
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,580
here through this diversity of products

663
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,860
and complexity and use cases

664
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,799
it's a tax surface right

665
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:39,960
it's opportunities

666
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:42,299
for the bad guys to come in and get what

667
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:43,980
they want

668
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:48,299
and I think over the last couple years

669
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:50,100
the biggest

670
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,340
perhaps Collective falling down

671
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:57,240
of government of Industry

672
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,039
is on ransomware

673
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,520
what is ransomware right it is a bad guy

674
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,700
that's figured out how to monetize

675
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:07,799
a vulnerability or misconfigured system

676
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:11,700
that's it they've extracted value

677
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,740
from that stuff that Daniel miesler is

678
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,840
talking about

679
00:28:15,840 --> 00:28:18,299
and it's been able to shift through

680
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:20,039
cryptocurrency

681
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:22,380
to safe havens

682
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:25,700
and what that's done in the meantime

683
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:29,100
is distracting

684
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,720
our intelligence Community our national

685
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,340
security community that was five years

686
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:34,020
ago focused

687
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,059
on the highest order threat

688
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:40,140
the MSS of China the pla Russia svr Gru

689
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:44,400
FSB Iran irgc

690
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:48,240
and now they have had to broaden their

691
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,100
View

692
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,980
of threat actors to include cyber

693
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:55,500
criminals

694
00:28:55,500 --> 00:28:59,039
my take here is that we've kind of

695
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:01,320
fetishized the advanced persistent

696
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:02,400
threat

697
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,580
we've over rotated on the MSS we've over

698
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:08,880
rotated on the svr

699
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,320
when cyber criminals have been eating

700
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,299
our lunch in the meantime when that was

701
00:29:12,299 --> 00:29:14,820
the design basis threat

702
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:16,679
that was the threat model for every

703
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:19,679
organization all along

704
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,419
if you're on the internet

705
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:23,220
you're on the playing field for them if

706
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,240
you're

707
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,100
using email

708
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,440
if you're connecting anything

709
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:30,659
they're opportunistic

710
00:29:30,659 --> 00:29:34,760
Target sets are much much greater

711
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,340
that said can't take a rise off the top

712
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:40,799
of the threat hierarchy and what we're

713
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:42,120
seeing

714
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:46,500
is the threat actors at the top

715
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,779
they understand what the shifts in our

716
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:50,340
businesses are they understand that

717
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:52,500
we're making things more complex that

718
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,720
we're relying on more software and

719
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,620
trusted updates

720
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,720
my business partner Alex

721
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,340
said something in a meeting about six

722
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:05,399
months ago that really stuck with me

723
00:30:05,399 --> 00:30:07,740
companies

724
00:30:07,740 --> 00:30:09,600
that are shipping products or shipping

725
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,580
targets

726
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,200
if you're hosting

727
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:16,260
a service you're the target

728
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,480
that's how the targeting sets are

729
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,600
happening for the svr and the MSS they

730
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:23,340
understand the dependencies and the

731
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,620
trust connections that we have on our

732
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:27,000
software services and Technology

733
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:29,279
providers

734
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:31,620
and they're working up the ladder

735
00:30:31,620 --> 00:30:33,299
through the supply chain

736
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:36,240
there's a terrible joke I'll tell

737
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,440
um

738
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,840
decades ago Willie Sutton big bank

739
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,760
robber they asked Willie

740
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,159
why do you rob banks

741
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:45,240
he said because that's where the money

742
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:46,740
is

743
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:49,080
it's the same idea here

744
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,000
with software providers with managed

745
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:53,580
service providers why do do adversaries

746
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:56,580
Target software supply chain because

747
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,740
that's where the access is that's where

748
00:30:58,740 --> 00:31:01,200
the data is the ability to work in at

749
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,000
scale and go one to many and conduct

750
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,559
breakouts

751
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:06,360
that's what we're seeing the actors

752
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:08,100
doing

753
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:12,120
so what's the government been doing well

754
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:14,520
the government has struggled

755
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:16,980
and I'll use the U.S government here

756
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,020
the government has struggled with

757
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,299
balancing

758
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:24,419
Market interventions regulation

759
00:31:24,419 --> 00:31:27,360
with the desire in a capitalist economy

760
00:31:27,360 --> 00:31:29,760
to allow Innovation to grow

761
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:30,899
right

762
00:31:30,899 --> 00:31:32,520
you we hear that all the time that

763
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:34,740
regulation stifles innovation

764
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:37,740
and as a result what we've had isn't

765
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:39,240
uneven

766
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:41,220
application of Market interventions or

767
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,020
regulations if you ask the financial

768
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,640
services folks they'll say what do you

769
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,159
mean uneven we're regulated six ways to

770
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:50,039
Sunday and that's right duplicative at

771
00:31:50,039 --> 00:31:52,080
the federal and state level regulations

772
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:55,500
on Banks and then it kind of drops off

773
00:31:55,500 --> 00:31:57,960
and so we've seen the government

774
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,080
struggle here and as a result we're not

775
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,899
getting the outcomes we want and I have

776
00:32:03,899 --> 00:32:05,760
to think

777
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,200
that even when the government does

778
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,520
regulate

779
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:10,140
they don't necessarily do it right they

780
00:32:10,140 --> 00:32:12,000
don't do it well

781
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,159
we see an over-reliance on checklists

782
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:15,440
and compliance rather than

783
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,760
performance-based outcomes

784
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,279
I think we're seeing an improvement here

785
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:22,559
since a release some performance guide

786
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:27,299
guidance recently we need more of that

787
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:29,340
we're also seeing it

788
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:32,220
the case where it's it's still difficult

789
00:32:32,220 --> 00:32:34,679
to work with the government

790
00:32:34,679 --> 00:32:37,380
it's still difficult for a private

791
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:40,080
sector organization to know who to work

792
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:42,299
with is it the FBI is at cisa is it the

793
00:32:42,299 --> 00:32:44,159
department of energy is it treasury I

794
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:45,840
don't know where to go

795
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:48,899
it's still just too hard to work with

796
00:32:48,899 --> 00:32:51,539
government in the value prop

797
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:54,179
isn't as clear as it needs to be got to

798
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:55,380
fix that

799
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:58,860
the last thing is a government also has

800
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:01,740
to kind of clean up its own Act

801
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:04,320
one of the recommendations that I saw in

802
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,620
the cyberspace Solarium report from two

803
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:08,940
years ago

804
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:11,460
was it Congress needs to figure it out

805
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:13,860
as well Congress needs to establish

806
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,600
select committees in the house and the

807
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:19,140
Senate that consolidate oversight over

808
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:21,059
the various

809
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:22,980
departments and agencies particularly in

810
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:24,960
the civilian Branch where you have a

811
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,940
hundred and one

812
00:33:26,940 --> 00:33:29,760
civilian agencies and every single one

813
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:31,019
of them is running their own email

814
00:33:31,019 --> 00:33:33,380
service

815
00:33:33,419 --> 00:33:35,940
so we got to fix that

816
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,700
and then the last reason here is it's

817
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,500
it's it's us it's the people right our

818
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:43,140
leaders are not leading

819
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:46,140
the CEO that understands

820
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:48,899
cyber risk as a business risk is few and

821
00:33:48,899 --> 00:33:51,659
far between now it's changing

822
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:53,640
you know I think Colonial woke a lot of

823
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,620
people up last year

824
00:33:55,620 --> 00:34:00,000
but so we don't have a system

825
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,880
that changes that

826
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:04,500
balance

827
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:10,280
of the value of secure products

828
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:12,839
we also have Workforce challenges there

829
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:14,639
was a summit two weeks ago at the White

830
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:15,719
House

831
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,460
big tech companies came and they made

832
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,099
pledges and promises and support

833
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:23,119
we have various initiatives right now

834
00:34:23,119 --> 00:34:25,320
alongside black hat we have the Diana

835
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:28,260
initiative so so we have mechanisms in

836
00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,719
place but we have to accelerate we have

837
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,639
to accelerate I have five kids

838
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:35,159
in the K-12 system

839
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:38,219
and they go to a pretty good school

840
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:42,678
but there aren't opportunities for them

841
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:46,020
to experience coding

842
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:48,540
we don't have a technology-oriented

843
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:51,000
curriculum like some other countries

844
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:54,260
another thing we got to fix

845
00:34:54,260 --> 00:34:57,240
and so as we kind of move out of this

846
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,220
and think about well where are we going

847
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:00,720
from here

848
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:04,080
I reached out to a network of folks

849
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,880
much smarter than me and I said look

850
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:08,339
what's your take on what's happening

851
00:35:08,339 --> 00:35:11,099
right now three four or five years out

852
00:35:11,099 --> 00:35:13,440
are things going to be better they gonna

853
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:16,320
be worse so you bearish or bullish

854
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:19,980
in the the general responses

855
00:35:19,980 --> 00:35:21,359
were

856
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:24,060
bearish in the short term bullish in the

857
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,859
long term things are going to get worse

858
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:27,480
before they get better is is kind of the

859
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:30,020
takeaway which is really a fascinating

860
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:32,460
dichotomy and so I wanted to kind of

861
00:35:32,460 --> 00:35:34,140
break down and understand why are we

862
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,579
seeing that what what are the pressures

863
00:35:35,579 --> 00:35:38,400
we're seeing right now or lack thereof

864
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:41,579
bitter can continue these trend lines

865
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:44,480
that I think we all agree or are not

866
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:47,280
sufficient they're not where we as a

867
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:50,099
community want them to go

868
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:53,880
and so back at the top with technology

869
00:35:53,880 --> 00:35:56,280
I think we all agree there's gonna be

870
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,140
more stuff connected we have a

871
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:00,960
pathological need to connect things to

872
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,579
the internet seemingly has said that in

873
00:36:02,579 --> 00:36:04,500
a congressional testimony

874
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,180
last year

875
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:08,339
in kind of a little rhetorical device

876
00:36:08,339 --> 00:36:11,520
I'll use is ask people close your eyes

877
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,560
sit back think three four years into the

878
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,839
future uh you're at the office you're at

879
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,220
home you're in your car you're at the

880
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,200
doctor's office whatever are there going

881
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:21,780
to be more things around you

882
00:36:21,780 --> 00:36:24,480
that are collecting data that are

883
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,040
generating data

884
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,500
I mean the answer of course

885
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,339
is more

886
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:35,160
in a car at home on our body in our body

887
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,900
more

888
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:38,640
I mean how many of you are wearing those

889
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,119
aura rings to compare sleep patterns

890
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:44,839
against each other

891
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,400
things are generating an incredible

892
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:50,940
amount of data exhaust digital exhaust

893
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:53,400
and and so again it's this opportunity

894
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:57,420
space and they're becoming more complex

895
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,880
not less

896
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:04,040
and I think back to 1984 the year

897
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:06,980
William Gibson released the book

898
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:09,240
Neuromancer I think most people remember

899
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,800
Neuromancer

900
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:14,700
for coining the term cyberspace

901
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:17,940
but it to me it's how he describes

902
00:37:17,940 --> 00:37:20,160
cyberspace

903
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:22,200
that was so captivating that really

904
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,060
resonated with me

905
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:27,180
the unthinkable complexity

906
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:31,020
of cyberspace we're there right now

907
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,579
I've asked people like do you really

908
00:37:32,579 --> 00:37:35,400
understand how the cloud works across

909
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:38,339
the various hyperscale vendors and how

910
00:37:38,339 --> 00:37:40,140
you interact with it what visibility you

911
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:41,460
have

912
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:44,280
the answers aren't always what you want

913
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,839
to hear

914
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:48,540
so things are getting more complex we're

915
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,400
generating more data

916
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:54,240
but I'll say this again evidenced by

917
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,599
black hat at 25.

918
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:01,400
we have a maturing industry

919
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:04,440
we're producing and generating products

920
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:07,260
that are solving problems

921
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:10,380
we have technology vendors that are

922
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:13,140
working to solve core problems in the

923
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:15,119
infrastructure

924
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,220
but is it happening at the pace we want

925
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:20,579
it to that we need it to why because the

926
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:22,320
Bad actors

927
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,859
are getting their wins

928
00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:28,800
and until we make meaningful

929
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,839
consequences

930
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,359
and impose costs on them

931
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,240
they will continue

932
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:39,359
ransomware is here and it's so prevalent

933
00:38:39,359 --> 00:38:41,820
and it's gotten professionalized in the

934
00:38:41,820 --> 00:38:43,740
barriers to entry have dropped and now

935
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,980
they have availability or options

936
00:38:46,980 --> 00:38:50,400
to exploits that were the remit of

937
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,380
nation states

938
00:38:52,380 --> 00:38:54,300
only a couple years ago

939
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:56,900
because the money's there

940
00:38:56,900 --> 00:38:59,700
profiting and it's not costing them

941
00:38:59,700 --> 00:39:02,579
anything they're not feeling pain

942
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:05,160
fortunately that has changed to a

943
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:08,400
certain extent we just saw a mixer get

944
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:11,460
sanctioned tornado the other day so we

945
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:14,400
have to do more of that

946
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,200
and that's just the non-state actors

947
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:17,700
what about the state actors so we we

948
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:21,660
typically talk about China Russia Iran

949
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,160
North Korea right

950
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:25,619
but here's the thing

951
00:39:25,619 --> 00:39:28,500
I mean literally every country on the

952
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,440
face of this Earth is looking

953
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:34,020
at the digital ecosystem

954
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:37,200
as a new domain the fifth domain they're

955
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:40,920
developing capabilities for espionage

956
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:43,859
for domestic surveillance

957
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:46,079
and yeah they're also looking at

958
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:49,260
capabilities for dis destruction and

959
00:39:49,260 --> 00:39:51,060
disruption

960
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,980
so we have a threat actor set that's

961
00:39:52,980 --> 00:39:55,320
absolutely exploding and guess what

962
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:59,400
there are going to be splashy new in

963
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,900
novel events

964
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:03,540
in the near future

965
00:40:03,540 --> 00:40:06,060
just think back the last several years I

966
00:40:06,060 --> 00:40:08,339
mean let's just start with Ukraine with

967
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:09,599
the Russians turning the lights out in

968
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:10,920
Ukraine two years in a row then we had

969
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:13,200
wannacry then we had not pet you then we

970
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,359
had bad rabbit and then you get in to

971
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,240
the uh

972
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:21,060
svr in nobellum and solarwinds

973
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:24,060
it is continuing to happen and it will

974
00:40:24,060 --> 00:40:27,060
continue to happen

975
00:40:27,060 --> 00:40:30,420
and on the government side we have seen

976
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:33,000
in the last year or so

977
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:35,700
in interest in improving authorities

978
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:38,520
sisa continues to get the funding it

979
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:40,740
needs and empowerment it needs and the

980
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:43,079
authorities it needs

981
00:40:43,079 --> 00:40:44,640
but I think we're going to see a

982
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:45,900
Slowdown

983
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,640
in some of that funding I think we're

984
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,920
going to get a see a Slowdown

985
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,200
in the congress's interest

986
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:54,780
in providing additional authorities so

987
00:40:54,780 --> 00:40:56,640
that we can have appropriate Market

988
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,359
interventions

989
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:02,700
government still has to figure out

990
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:05,520
how to engage

991
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,820
how to manage its own systems

992
00:41:08,820 --> 00:41:11,820
and then we have the people part

993
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:13,859
yeah our leaders

994
00:41:13,859 --> 00:41:17,339
are getting smarter every day

995
00:41:17,339 --> 00:41:20,700
we have someone exit the workforce we

996
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:22,380
have someone that enters the workforce

997
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:24,320
and our Workforce is becoming

998
00:41:24,320 --> 00:41:27,660
increasingly Tech native this is

999
00:41:27,660 --> 00:41:29,400
actually probably the area

1000
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,640
that I'm most optimistic every day that

1001
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:35,040
goes by our Workforce becomes

1002
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:37,200
increasingly Tech native

1003
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:38,760
on the upside

1004
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,920
they're savvier

1005
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:42,900
but kind of what Jeff was alluding to

1006
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:44,579
with the Miss dis and Mal information

1007
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:49,020
piece are they becoming more discerning

1008
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,880
are the critical thinking skills coming

1009
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:55,020
along with the technology savviness that

1010
00:41:55,020 --> 00:41:57,740
we're looking for

1011
00:41:58,200 --> 00:42:00,900
the second question that I asked the

1012
00:42:00,900 --> 00:42:02,640
network

1013
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,040
was fine

1014
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:07,680
your near-term

1015
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,380
bearish long-term bullish

1016
00:42:10,380 --> 00:42:13,079
help me understand that pivot

1017
00:42:13,079 --> 00:42:16,020
what are what's the dichotomy

1018
00:42:16,020 --> 00:42:18,540
how are we going to make that change

1019
00:42:18,540 --> 00:42:20,280
what are the influence points the

1020
00:42:20,280 --> 00:42:21,960
inflection points

1021
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,940
the moments the opportunities to shape

1022
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:26,420
the future

1023
00:42:27,000 --> 00:42:30,180
so starting on the technology side

1024
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:32,520
again their answers

1025
00:42:32,520 --> 00:42:35,040
oriented around a core set of themes so

1026
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:39,060
on technology what we've kind of arrived

1027
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:42,240
at is as Jeff was talking about with

1028
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,160
some of the decisions

1029
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,900
around the Russian invasion of Ukraine

1030
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:49,500
we organizations businesses have to have

1031
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,780
a set of principles

1032
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:54,599
you have to establish your values who

1033
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:57,240
you are is a company

1034
00:42:57,240 --> 00:42:59,880
what you're out there to accomplish how

1035
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:01,500
you're going to do it what your red

1036
00:43:01,500 --> 00:43:04,079
lines are

1037
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,540
when Russia invaded Ukraine we were

1038
00:43:06,540 --> 00:43:07,440
working with a couple different

1039
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,500
companies that said look we're we're not

1040
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,960
impacted by sanctions so so we're good

1041
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,579
we don't really need to worry about it

1042
00:43:14,579 --> 00:43:18,599
our take was no look I'm telling you

1043
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:21,480
when images of war crimes

1044
00:43:21,480 --> 00:43:24,540
start showing up on TV and on Twitter

1045
00:43:24,540 --> 00:43:26,760
and elsewhere you're going to have a

1046
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,859
problem if you're continuing or at least

1047
00:43:28,859 --> 00:43:30,540
perceived to continue

1048
00:43:30,540 --> 00:43:33,599
to support the Russian war machine you

1049
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:35,640
have to make decisions now

1050
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,560
on the kind of company you are and how

1051
00:43:37,560 --> 00:43:39,540
you're holding yourself out so you have

1052
00:43:39,540 --> 00:43:41,640
to have those principles as a part of

1053
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:42,780
that

1054
00:43:42,780 --> 00:43:45,900
we have to also understand that if you

1055
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:47,819
are core to the fabric of the internet

1056
00:43:47,819 --> 00:43:50,160
right now which is really the core to

1057
00:43:50,160 --> 00:43:51,960
the fabric

1058
00:43:51,960 --> 00:43:54,859
of the economy

1059
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,599
yeah you're part of the National

1060
00:43:57,599 --> 00:43:59,400
Security community

1061
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:00,900
you may not be in the intelligence

1062
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,540
Community but your mission is oriented

1063
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:07,200
around National Security outcomes and

1064
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,020
you have to take security seriously you

1065
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:13,079
have to have it as a board room issue

1066
00:44:13,079 --> 00:44:15,300
and this isn't just the big Banks the

1067
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:17,400
big technology companies this is

1068
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:19,619
increasingly mid-market

1069
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:21,540
technology companies and software

1070
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:23,099
providers

1071
00:44:23,099 --> 00:44:25,260
that have become systemically important

1072
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:27,660
over the last decade

1073
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:30,180
that have elevated privileges within

1074
00:44:30,180 --> 00:44:32,300
networks and the ability to access

1075
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:35,280
sensitive crown jewels of an

1076
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:36,480
organization

1077
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,819
you have to be thinking differently

1078
00:44:38,819 --> 00:44:40,740
about your threat model

1079
00:44:40,740 --> 00:44:42,960
so you have to set

1080
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:46,020
those principles the second part

1081
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:48,480
is our products right we need to

1082
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:50,099
continue

1083
00:44:50,099 --> 00:44:53,040
to develop products that solve the

1084
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,720
challenges that we encounter every

1085
00:44:54,720 --> 00:44:56,339
single day

1086
00:44:56,339 --> 00:44:58,619
but we also need the technology vendors

1087
00:44:58,619 --> 00:45:02,400
that own manage operate develop deploy

1088
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,099
the core yeah we're working on the edge

1089
00:45:05,099 --> 00:45:07,079
we're doing a great job at the edge but

1090
00:45:07,079 --> 00:45:09,000
back to the Core

1091
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,819
products and solutions out there

1092
00:45:11,819 --> 00:45:16,740
we have to solve the hard problems that

1093
00:45:16,740 --> 00:45:19,560
continue to persist

1094
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:23,099
and yes it may impact the bottom line of

1095
00:45:23,099 --> 00:45:26,540
your Security Services business

1096
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:30,180
but it's more important to solve the

1097
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:31,920
underlying challenges rather than the

1098
00:45:31,920 --> 00:45:34,200
Band-Aid on the edge

1099
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:37,619
and the last thing is we need leaders to

1100
00:45:37,619 --> 00:45:42,240
plan out beyond the next two quarters

1101
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:44,760
you have to look three to four years out

1102
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,440
so right now

1103
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,980
every single company out there

1104
00:45:49,980 --> 00:45:51,599
should be conducting simulation

1105
00:45:51,599 --> 00:45:53,700
scenarios impact assessments tabletop

1106
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:56,460
exercises at the executive level

1107
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:58,980
around what's happening

1108
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:01,920
in the Taiwan Strait Strait of Taiwan

1109
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,599
organizations need to be saying how

1110
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,160
could a Chinese invasion of Taiwan

1111
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:09,180
impact me my supply chain my market how

1112
00:46:09,180 --> 00:46:12,960
could the political headwinds affect me

1113
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:14,819
how could it affect my I.T operations

1114
00:46:14,819 --> 00:46:19,140
you have to game these things out

1115
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:20,460
because I don't know if it's going to

1116
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:22,140
happen

1117
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:24,119
tomorrow next year three or four years

1118
00:46:24,119 --> 00:46:25,680
out but based on the conversations I

1119
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,619
have with National Security officials

1120
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:31,380
they're pretty confident

1121
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:32,940
that that's going to come to a head

1122
00:46:32,940 --> 00:46:36,359
between China China and Taiwan and if

1123
00:46:36,359 --> 00:46:39,599
you want to be in a position to de-risk

1124
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,260
your operations to manage risk to your

1125
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:44,700
organization

1126
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:47,339
you have to start that yesterday

1127
00:46:47,339 --> 00:46:50,819
if you want to physically segment your

1128
00:46:50,819 --> 00:46:52,859
Networks

1129
00:46:52,859 --> 00:46:56,160
in Taiwan you gotta start that now

1130
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,839
so we need organizations thinking

1131
00:46:57,839 --> 00:46:59,099
forward not just dealing with today's

1132
00:46:59,099 --> 00:47:01,680
problems but planning ahead and starting

1133
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,300
to implement for where you want to be

1134
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:06,260
two to three years out

1135
00:47:06,359 --> 00:47:09,180
and then we have government how can the

1136
00:47:09,180 --> 00:47:11,520
government shape the future so I tend to

1137
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,500
think about the government as having

1138
00:47:13,500 --> 00:47:15,660
four main roles in how they interact

1139
00:47:15,660 --> 00:47:17,460
with

1140
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:21,300
the technology and the digital ecosystem

1141
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:22,800
consumer

1142
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:26,940
enforcer Defender and enabler

1143
00:47:26,940 --> 00:47:28,319
consumer

1144
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:29,760
Department of Defense the U.S Department

1145
00:47:29,760 --> 00:47:32,280
of Defense is is likely the largest

1146
00:47:32,280 --> 00:47:34,920
customer of most of the big Tech firms

1147
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:38,040
the US government itself is a massive

1148
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,740
tens of billions just shy probably of

1149
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:42,300
100 billion that's just on the civilian

1150
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:43,079
side

1151
00:47:43,079 --> 00:47:46,319
consumer of I.T products and services

1152
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:49,140
they have incredible purchasing power

1153
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:53,040
they need to use it they have to set the

1154
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:55,319
bar higher lowest price technically

1155
00:47:55,319 --> 00:47:58,079
acceptable cannot be the procurement and

1156
00:47:58,079 --> 00:47:59,700
acquisition model we have to move faster

1157
00:47:59,700 --> 00:48:01,980
we have to fail faster we have to

1158
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:05,000
continue moving forward

1159
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:08,880
the second piece on the enforcement side

1160
00:48:08,880 --> 00:48:12,060
that's regulation and that's law

1161
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:13,920
enforcement

1162
00:48:13,920 --> 00:48:16,440
so on the regulation side I'm

1163
00:48:16,440 --> 00:48:20,040
the market is not working right now

1164
00:48:20,040 --> 00:48:23,880
we need not necessarily more regulation

1165
00:48:23,880 --> 00:48:26,040
we need smarter regulations that are

1166
00:48:26,040 --> 00:48:29,220
determined based on outcomes and not

1167
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:32,099
checklists it has to be smart looking at

1168
00:48:32,099 --> 00:48:34,560
the economy itself and what those core

1169
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,660
functions are so we're not necessarily

1170
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:38,400
talking about small and medium

1171
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:39,660
businesses

1172
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:41,880
but if your critical infrastructure that

1173
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:43,920
underpins

1174
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,260
the continuity of the economy we have to

1175
00:48:46,260 --> 00:48:48,540
have a better understanding

1176
00:48:48,540 --> 00:48:51,780
of the security posture

1177
00:48:51,780 --> 00:48:54,780
on the law enforcement side I've seen

1178
00:48:54,780 --> 00:48:57,240
the right kind of movements out of the

1179
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:59,460
Department of Justice and FBI of going

1180
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:02,040
more aggressively at

1181
00:49:02,040 --> 00:49:04,380
the adversary at command and control

1182
00:49:04,380 --> 00:49:07,200
infrastructure of cyber criminals we

1183
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,880
need to continue that we need to shift

1184
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:11,520
from longer term investigations

1185
00:49:11,520 --> 00:49:14,880
towards more destruct disruptive actions

1186
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:17,400
in preventing their ability imposing

1187
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:21,420
costs and eliminating their ability

1188
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:24,180
to extract value from

1189
00:49:24,180 --> 00:49:28,098
companies here in the U.S

1190
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:32,040
on the defender side we need cyber

1191
00:49:32,040 --> 00:49:33,480
command we need the intelligence

1192
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,000
Community to continue pushing out moving

1193
00:49:36,000 --> 00:49:38,180
forward

1194
00:49:38,339 --> 00:49:41,460
in preparation of the 2020 elections the

1195
00:49:41,460 --> 00:49:43,260
U.S government Department of Defense

1196
00:49:43,260 --> 00:49:45,960
worked with Partners over there

1197
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:48,119
to have a better understanding of what

1198
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:50,819
the ttps what the capabilities and the

1199
00:49:50,819 --> 00:49:54,540
malware of State actors what what were

1200
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:56,460
those advantages they had brought it

1201
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:58,859
back here we exposed some of those

1202
00:49:58,859 --> 00:50:01,079
campaigns but what I found more

1203
00:50:01,079 --> 00:50:03,180
important are valuable was we we also

1204
00:50:03,180 --> 00:50:05,640
figured out what their targeting set was

1205
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:07,260
and what they were going after election

1206
00:50:07,260 --> 00:50:09,300
night reporting voter registration

1207
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,980
databases

1208
00:50:10,980 --> 00:50:13,619
that sort of insight allowed state and

1209
00:50:13,619 --> 00:50:15,960
local election officials

1210
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:19,859
to prepare to put that last dollar

1211
00:50:19,859 --> 00:50:21,780
to harden a Target that you knew the

1212
00:50:21,780 --> 00:50:24,780
adversary was interested in we need more

1213
00:50:24,780 --> 00:50:29,460
of that and lastly on the enabler side

1214
00:50:29,460 --> 00:50:32,040
yeah I'm going to say it I'm a homer

1215
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:35,579
continue to invest and build cisa out

1216
00:50:35,579 --> 00:50:40,380
make it easier less complex

1217
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:42,240
for organizations to work with the

1218
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,880
government and get value out of it

1219
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,740
instead of going to five or six

1220
00:50:46,740 --> 00:50:48,900
different agencies

1221
00:50:48,900 --> 00:50:51,780
make the front door clearly visible and

1222
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:54,420
as I see it that Sissa we also need to

1223
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:56,579
do more of what we saw on the run-up to

1224
00:50:56,579 --> 00:50:58,680
Russia Ukraine where the intelligence

1225
00:50:58,680 --> 00:51:01,700
Community was rapidly declassifying

1226
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:03,900
sensitive information about the battle

1227
00:51:03,900 --> 00:51:07,619
plans that froze the Russians

1228
00:51:07,619 --> 00:51:10,680
that was information Warfare that worked

1229
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:12,240
we need more of that we need to put that

1230
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,559
information in the hands of the

1231
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:16,040
Defenders

1232
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:19,619
all that said I'm not naive enough to

1233
00:51:19,619 --> 00:51:21,440
think

1234
00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:24,420
that slight course Corrections of

1235
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:26,579
individual agencies is going to be

1236
00:51:26,579 --> 00:51:28,760
enough

1237
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:32,099
I'm ready to make the argument

1238
00:51:32,099 --> 00:51:34,020
that the digital environment around us

1239
00:51:34,020 --> 00:51:36,300
has changed so dramatically in the last

1240
00:51:36,300 --> 00:51:38,099
25 years

1241
00:51:38,099 --> 00:51:40,559
while our government

1242
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:42,780
hasn't kept up pace

1243
00:51:42,780 --> 00:51:46,920
has lagged as slow the slope lines don't

1244
00:51:46,920 --> 00:51:50,099
have the same trajectory I think it's

1245
00:51:50,099 --> 00:51:52,140
time to rethink

1246
00:51:52,140 --> 00:51:54,900
the way government interacts with

1247
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:56,700
technology

1248
00:51:56,700 --> 00:51:58,500
I think we need to take a hard look at

1249
00:51:58,500 --> 00:52:00,660
the way governments organized and

1250
00:52:00,660 --> 00:52:03,440
there's there's precedent for this

1251
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:05,160
1939

1252
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:07,079
President Franklin Delano Roosevelt

1253
00:52:07,079 --> 00:52:08,579
worked with the Congress to pass the

1254
00:52:08,579 --> 00:52:11,940
reorganization act of 1939. passed three

1255
00:52:11,940 --> 00:52:12,920
different

1256
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:15,540
reorganization plans Congress approved

1257
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:18,240
to reshape to make a government of the

1258
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:19,800
people that worked for the people we're

1259
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:23,099
in that same space right now I think we

1260
00:52:23,099 --> 00:52:25,260
have to take a hard look at the way

1261
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:27,720
we're organized and make a smarter more

1262
00:52:27,720 --> 00:52:29,940
efficient more organized government and

1263
00:52:29,940 --> 00:52:32,220
I'm ready to lead that charge working at

1264
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:33,900
the Aspen Institute with the team at

1265
00:52:33,900 --> 00:52:35,400
Aspen digital we're going to take a look

1266
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:38,099
at this we're going to look at what are

1267
00:52:38,099 --> 00:52:40,680
the various outcomes

1268
00:52:40,680 --> 00:52:42,300
what are the various organizational

1269
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:45,300
structures that we could see from uh

1270
00:52:45,300 --> 00:52:47,520
far into the Spectrum heavy package of

1271
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:49,980
establishing a U.S digital agency that

1272
00:52:49,980 --> 00:52:52,500
could take elements of cisa elements of

1273
00:52:52,500 --> 00:52:55,319
nist and ntia the department of energy

1274
00:52:55,319 --> 00:52:57,420
and the National Labs maybe bits and

1275
00:52:57,420 --> 00:53:00,240
pieces of the FTC and the FCC

1276
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:03,599
but make an agency that's focused on

1277
00:53:03,599 --> 00:53:06,599
empowering a better Digital Risk

1278
00:53:06,599 --> 00:53:09,000
Management Services and I'm not just

1279
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,980
talking about cyber

1280
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:12,839
talking about privacy

1281
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:15,420
talking about trust and safety issues

1282
00:53:15,420 --> 00:53:17,579
we're not where we need to be and we're

1283
00:53:17,579 --> 00:53:19,319
falling behind and Americans are

1284
00:53:19,319 --> 00:53:21,420
suffering as a result but you know what

1285
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:22,800
I also don't have a whole lot of

1286
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,200
confidence right now that this Congress

1287
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:27,720
can get that done can get something as

1288
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:30,300
Broad and in envisioning

1289
00:53:30,300 --> 00:53:31,920
is an effort like that so we're going to

1290
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:33,839
have to look at different possible

1291
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:36,059
outcomes the other side of the spectrum

1292
00:53:36,059 --> 00:53:37,980
could be something as simple as pulling

1293
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:39,540
sisa out of the Department of Homeland

1294
00:53:39,540 --> 00:53:40,500
Security

1295
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:43,200
as a sub cap in an agency it's allowed

1296
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,059
to operate as an operational Agency on

1297
00:53:45,059 --> 00:53:46,140
its own

1298
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:47,760
we also have to kind of think through

1299
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:50,640
what are we prioritizing for what are we

1300
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,440
optimizing for

1301
00:53:52,440 --> 00:53:55,559
is it public-private Partnerships is it

1302
00:53:55,559 --> 00:53:58,079
a regulatory framework we have to take a

1303
00:53:58,079 --> 00:54:02,300
harder look at the way we're organized

1304
00:54:02,819 --> 00:54:06,780
I'm also not naive enough to think that

1305
00:54:06,780 --> 00:54:09,480
the technology vendors that that the

1306
00:54:09,480 --> 00:54:12,240
government on their own are going to fix

1307
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:13,559
this

1308
00:54:13,559 --> 00:54:15,660
fix any other

1309
00:54:15,660 --> 00:54:17,220
ultimately

1310
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:19,740
my take

1311
00:54:19,740 --> 00:54:21,780
as Jeff mentioned it's going to come

1312
00:54:21,780 --> 00:54:24,000
down to the people in this room that are

1313
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:26,940
here for summer camp this week

1314
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:30,000
that are in this community

1315
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,700
it's going to take us as leaders

1316
00:54:32,700 --> 00:54:35,579
to make the changes that we want to see

1317
00:54:35,579 --> 00:54:38,700
and so as I was thinking back to my time

1318
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:42,000
at sisa I had a had a pretty basic

1319
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:44,579
approach to leadership and it was based

1320
00:54:44,579 --> 00:54:46,559
on a framework that I stole from a boss

1321
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:48,240
at Microsoft

1322
00:54:48,240 --> 00:54:51,359
and it was the five P's

1323
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:55,260
people policy programs public affairs

1324
00:54:55,260 --> 00:54:58,020
and politics I said if we succeed and

1325
00:54:58,020 --> 00:55:00,300
win in those five P's then we're going

1326
00:55:00,300 --> 00:55:02,099
to be successful as an agency

1327
00:55:02,099 --> 00:55:04,980
over time as we were working through how

1328
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:07,200
we were doing it occurred to me that we

1329
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:09,420
were missing a p

1330
00:55:09,420 --> 00:55:12,059
and that P was Partners this is a again

1331
00:55:12,059 --> 00:55:13,680
fundamentally as a voluntary

1332
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,300
Organization for public-private

1333
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:16,680
Partnerships

1334
00:55:16,680 --> 00:55:18,420
so yeah you got to have your people

1335
00:55:18,420 --> 00:55:19,800
without your people you don't have

1336
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:21,839
anything so you had to have that the

1337
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:23,040
next most important thing for us was

1338
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,599
partners

1339
00:55:24,599 --> 00:55:26,160
and then policy and programs public

1340
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:28,260
affairs and politics but the

1341
00:55:28,260 --> 00:55:30,780
that made it six P's and I like fives

1342
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:33,359
you know odd numbers

1343
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:36,000
so we dropped the politics and there was

1344
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,200
a reason for that

1345
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:39,480
because right now cyber security

1346
00:55:39,480 --> 00:55:41,400
has to be

1347
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:44,220
apolitical non-political bipartisan

1348
00:55:44,220 --> 00:55:46,440
nonpartisan however you want to call it

1349
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,500
that's how we ran since it's awesome to

1350
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:51,900
see Jenny easterly continue that

1351
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:53,819
tradition

1352
00:55:53,819 --> 00:55:56,220
and it was my job as the Senate

1353
00:55:56,220 --> 00:55:57,839
confirmed director

1354
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:00,900
to handle the politics piece

1355
00:56:00,900 --> 00:56:02,880
so that was the five P's we ran under

1356
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,599
People Partners policy programs public

1357
00:56:06,599 --> 00:56:09,540
affairs so as I'm standing up

1358
00:56:09,540 --> 00:56:11,280
a Consulting practice said how do I

1359
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:15,059
apply that same model that same mindset

1360
00:56:15,059 --> 00:56:16,980
of leadership

1361
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:20,280
and it came down to principles

1362
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,079
got to know what you stand for what's

1363
00:56:22,079 --> 00:56:24,240
important to you and how you're going to

1364
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,040
act

1365
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:30,599
people of course your People Partners

1366
00:56:31,400 --> 00:56:33,960
planning talked about the planning piece

1367
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,000
and then public engagement the public

1368
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,040
engagement piece is about being

1369
00:56:38,040 --> 00:56:39,720
transparent about being candid being

1370
00:56:39,720 --> 00:56:41,940
forthright maintaining and establishing

1371
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,380
trust with your partners just look at

1372
00:56:43,380 --> 00:56:45,900
the incident response Communications

1373
00:56:45,900 --> 00:56:48,000
over the last year or so the

1374
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:50,579
organizations that are up front

1375
00:56:50,579 --> 00:56:52,800
in candid and transparent about what's

1376
00:56:52,800 --> 00:56:54,540
going on and what the plan is and how

1377
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:56,339
they're working on the problem they're

1378
00:56:56,339 --> 00:56:58,740
the ones that maintain Trust

1379
00:56:58,740 --> 00:57:01,440
of their partners of their customers of

1380
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,000
the government

1381
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:05,339
so public engagement is an incredibly

1382
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:09,480
important part of leadership

1383
00:57:09,480 --> 00:57:13,079
but back to that people part

1384
00:57:13,079 --> 00:57:16,079
again we need more of them and it's been

1385
00:57:16,079 --> 00:57:17,760
kind of

1386
00:57:17,760 --> 00:57:21,000
confounding to me how we continue

1387
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,040
to face

1388
00:57:23,040 --> 00:57:25,319
Workforce shortages we hear about the

1389
00:57:25,319 --> 00:57:27,000
three million open cyber security jobs

1390
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,800
in the community

1391
00:57:28,800 --> 00:57:30,300
and I'm just trying to figure out like

1392
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:32,339
why are we not

1393
00:57:32,339 --> 00:57:35,099
solving the gaps why are we not closing

1394
00:57:35,099 --> 00:57:38,400
the gaps so a couple weeks ago I was at

1395
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:41,160
an event and and Dr Hugh Thompson

1396
00:57:41,160 --> 00:57:44,220
formerly of Symantec now with Crosspoint

1397
00:57:44,220 --> 00:57:45,839
capital I think he runs another

1398
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:49,260
conference in San Francisco or something

1399
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:49,920
um

1400
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:53,700
he had his own kind of five elements of

1401
00:57:53,700 --> 00:57:56,280
how you talk about our community what it

1402
00:57:56,280 --> 00:57:58,680
is we do here and how rewarding a career

1403
00:57:58,680 --> 00:58:00,480
in this industry is

1404
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,480
the first thing is it's fun

1405
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,040
I don't know about y'all but like the

1406
00:58:05,040 --> 00:58:06,660
last 18 months for me have been probably

1407
00:58:06,660 --> 00:58:09,180
the most fun in my

1408
00:58:09,180 --> 00:58:12,059
career yes I had fun at sisa we're

1409
00:58:12,059 --> 00:58:13,740
having more fun now

1410
00:58:13,740 --> 00:58:16,980
the second is it's lucrative

1411
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:19,680
we get paid pretty well in this industry

1412
00:58:19,680 --> 00:58:22,920
I had to run a whole bunch of different

1413
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:25,680
compensation models and comparisons at

1414
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,900
as we were at sisa to figure out why are

1415
00:58:27,900 --> 00:58:30,059
we not attracting the talent we need

1416
00:58:30,059 --> 00:58:33,180
and when you look at pay in this

1417
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:35,520
industry it's it's pretty Illuminating

1418
00:58:35,520 --> 00:58:37,680
so yeah it pays well

1419
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,099
the third relatedly it's durable

1420
00:58:41,099 --> 00:58:43,619
we are going to be dealing with these

1421
00:58:43,619 --> 00:58:45,660
challenges

1422
00:58:45,660 --> 00:58:49,079
for the rest of our lives

1423
00:58:49,079 --> 00:58:51,359
in perhaps the rest of human history

1424
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:53,700
there will be digital and

1425
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:55,619
technologically related risk issues that

1426
00:58:55,619 --> 00:58:57,240
we're going to have to solve

1427
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:59,520
so it's durable it's also really

1428
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,859
interesting stuff

1429
00:59:01,859 --> 00:59:04,859
I mean the last six months alone

1430
00:59:04,859 --> 00:59:07,260
of geopolitical risk colliding with

1431
00:59:07,260 --> 00:59:09,660
technology risk have been fascinating

1432
00:59:09,660 --> 00:59:13,380
problems we've had to solve

1433
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:15,480
and the last thing I've already talked

1434
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:16,980
about this but these are National

1435
00:59:16,980 --> 00:59:18,839
Security issues

1436
00:59:18,839 --> 00:59:20,880
the mission the impact the import of

1437
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:22,740
what we're doing is incredibly important

1438
00:59:22,740 --> 00:59:24,960
so we have to start talking about what

1439
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:28,920
we do here in terms I think that are

1440
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:30,420
going to draw the workforce and I think

1441
00:59:30,420 --> 00:59:32,819
Hughes got a good start on that that

1442
00:59:32,819 --> 00:59:34,619
narrative

1443
00:59:34,619 --> 00:59:37,260
but the last piece here

1444
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:39,240
it's not on the leaders

1445
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:40,740
it's not on everybody else in the

1446
00:59:40,740 --> 00:59:43,140
workforce it's on us individually

1447
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:46,440
and so last week I had the chance

1448
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:49,380
to go on a a podcast it's called five

1449
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:51,240
Factor authentication with a guy named

1450
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:54,780
Hill Harper and he's a Harvard lawyer

1451
00:59:54,780 --> 00:59:57,180
but he's also an actor he was in He Got

1452
00:59:57,180 --> 00:59:59,940
Game and CSI New York and the good

1453
00:59:59,940 --> 01:00:01,980
doctor but now he does his podcast about

1454
01:00:01,980 --> 01:00:04,200
life in this

1455
01:00:04,200 --> 01:00:05,760
digital

1456
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:09,839
environment how do you maintain a

1457
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:11,819
wholesome fulsome life and he asked this

1458
01:00:11,819 --> 01:00:13,559
question at the end that I wasn't ready

1459
01:00:13,559 --> 01:00:16,619
for but the question was

1460
01:00:16,619 --> 01:00:19,980
what are the five factors

1461
01:00:19,980 --> 01:00:22,140
that you live your life by

1462
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:25,319
to lead a meaningful life online and

1463
01:00:25,319 --> 01:00:27,359
offline like I said I wasn't really

1464
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:28,799
ready for it took me a little bit of

1465
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:31,260
time to figure it out

1466
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:34,079
but but my first answer was again

1467
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:36,900
principles figure out who you are what

1468
01:00:36,900 --> 01:00:38,700
you stand for how you're going to live

1469
01:00:38,700 --> 01:00:41,579
your life and live your life accordingly

1470
01:00:41,579 --> 01:00:45,119
you got to know what's important to you

1471
01:00:45,119 --> 01:00:47,579
and what you stand for and then take a

1472
01:00:47,579 --> 01:00:49,559
stand when you have to

1473
01:00:49,559 --> 01:00:51,480
the second thing

1474
01:00:51,480 --> 01:00:53,280
was people

1475
01:00:53,280 --> 01:00:54,980
I've talked about people a lot today

1476
01:00:54,980 --> 01:00:57,839
find your people find your support

1477
01:00:57,839 --> 01:01:00,839
networks if it's family great part of

1478
01:01:00,839 --> 01:01:03,059
what we're doing this week out here is

1479
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:05,400
about our people our Networks

1480
01:01:05,400 --> 01:01:07,079
find your people they're going to be

1481
01:01:07,079 --> 01:01:09,359
there for you help them

1482
01:01:09,359 --> 01:01:11,819
they will help you

1483
01:01:11,819 --> 01:01:14,819
the third factor is Life's too short to

1484
01:01:14,819 --> 01:01:18,480
work for so don't

1485
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:19,920
right

1486
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:22,579
all right

1487
01:01:23,099 --> 01:01:23,720
now

1488
01:01:23,720 --> 01:01:26,160
I'm not saying quit your job tomorrow

1489
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:29,299
because that would be stupid

1490
01:01:29,640 --> 01:01:31,380
but if you're not happy if you're not

1491
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:33,359
valued if you're not respected if you're

1492
01:01:33,359 --> 01:01:35,460
not treated

1493
01:01:35,460 --> 01:01:37,079
like you think you deserve to be treated

1494
01:01:37,079 --> 01:01:39,059
make a plan

1495
01:01:39,059 --> 01:01:41,940
find that place for you work with your

1496
01:01:41,940 --> 01:01:44,040
people

1497
01:01:44,040 --> 01:01:45,900
the fourth Factor

1498
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:50,599
is Life's too short to eat bad food

1499
01:01:50,940 --> 01:01:54,119
what I really mean

1500
01:01:54,119 --> 01:01:57,420
is find something you enjoy that gives

1501
01:01:57,420 --> 01:01:58,200
you

1502
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:01,380
meaning value outside of your day job

1503
01:02:01,380 --> 01:02:03,960
right that's what I think this community

1504
01:02:03,960 --> 01:02:06,900
does so incredibly well so during covet

1505
01:02:06,900 --> 01:02:10,020
Bryson bort did unicorn Chef I got to go

1506
01:02:10,020 --> 01:02:11,819
on a couple times but it brought people

1507
01:02:11,819 --> 01:02:15,599
together in something outside of just

1508
01:02:15,599 --> 01:02:18,119

a group around you

1533
01:03:14,520 --> 01:03:17,640
