2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,720
hey everyone

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:12,059
um so before we get started just out of

4
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:13,920
curiosity if if you could raise your

5
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,740
hand if you either run a bug Bounty or

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,779
have participated in a bug bounty in

7
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:20,699
some form

8
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:23,039
looks like maybe half half the audience

9
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:25,199
has their hand up I think the case that

10
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:26,640
we're gonna make

11
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,680
for the half of Their audience that did

12
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:31,260
not raise their hand that you may have

13
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,719
actually unwittingly participated in a

14
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:35,579
bug bounty in some form

15
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,920
through another security tester's

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,719
research and we're going to go through a

17
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:41,160
couple examples that kind of outlines

18
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,660
that

19
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:45,540
so first like why are we qualified to

20
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:47,640
talk about this um who are we

21
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,860
so my name is Dylan I'm a security

22
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:52,739
researcher I'm a Bug Hunter I was for a

23
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:53,579
little while

24
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,680
um top 100 on bug crowd but that was a

25
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,680
couple years ago these days I co-founded

26
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,960
a company called truffle security which

27
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,699
is built on top of an open source tool

28
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:05,040
called truffle hog and I do security

29
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,460
research on the side so talking at black

30
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:10,799
hat this is my second time and probably

31
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:12,720
third time talking at either Defcon or

32
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:13,860
black hat

33
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:16,140
hi everyone I'm Whitney

34
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,580
um I'm an attorney but I'm not your

35
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:18,840
attorney

36
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,280
um I work really closely with security

37
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:23,400
teams at various in-house companies that

38
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,680
I've worked at throughout the years I

39
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,820
helped build the coordinated

40
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,740
vulnerability disclosure program at

41
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:30,840
Electronic Arts and I support my current

42
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:34,200
security team at Asana in our various

43
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:37,579
bug Bounty programs

44
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,780
so in general if you look at most bug

45
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,020
Bounty programs they say don't touch

46
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:47,700
other users data

47
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,320
um like they say try not to touch other

48
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,020
users data they say only test with your

49
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:56,640
own account don't involve other users in

50
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,920
your in your testing so this is an

51
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,780
example of of

52
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:03,299
Uber's policy for their bug Banning

53
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:04,680
where they they outlined that in one of

54
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:06,060
the bullet points

55
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,439
um and you can see like this is pretty

56
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,080
common language it's actually in a lot

57
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,540
of different programs they say make sure

58
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,160
you're only testing your data don't

59
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,080
access other people's data

60
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:17,400
so

61
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,379
um this talk being about data privacy

62
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:21,420
and Bug bounties

63
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:23,459
um we're in a pretty good spot we've

64
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:27,120
told our hackers to not touch data that

65
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,900
doesn't belong to them and uh I think we

66
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:34,319
should be good yeah we're good

67
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,060
damn

68
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,700
so close we almost had it

69
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:39,599
um

70
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,420
well I mean this this was for me when I

71
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,879
was testing I accidentally caused some

72
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:45,900
problems

73
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,459
um hey Whitney

74
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:50,340
um listen I was I was testing a program

75
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,739
doing their bug Bounty and I

76
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,959
accidentally accessed some data that I I

77
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,120
shouldn't have accessed um I just I

78
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,220
wanted to check with maybe my neighborly

79
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:01,800
friendly lawyer is there anything I

80
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,239
should do here could I get in trouble

81
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:05,819
for this accident oh that's a good

82
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:07,140
question why don't you tell me what

83
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:07,920
happened

84
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,800
yeah so um I was testing this type of

85
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,900
vulnerability called Blind cross-site

86
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:15,599
scripting basically I just replaced my

87
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,400
username with some JavaScript and I

88
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:18,900
threw it into a system and forgot about

89
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,840
it and then that JavaScript what it does

90
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,700
is if anyone

91
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:26,220
executes that JavaScript unsafely by

92
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,440
rendering my user data unsafely it'll

93
00:03:28,440 --> 00:03:30,000
take a screenshot of whatever that page

94
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,099
is and it'll send me a copy of that page

95
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:34,500
so what happened was somebody had

96
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,239
accessed an admin page that was

97
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,340
insecurely rendering user data and it

98
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:40,440
had a list of every user of the entire

99
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:42,480
system and all of that got screenshotted

100
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,280
and got sent to me and I accidentally

101
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,680
got a copy of everyone's user data

102
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,019
oh did you disclose everything to the

103
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:51,540
program yeah yeah yeah so I definitely

104
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,599
uh attached all the screenshots I walked

105
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,580
them through all the steps that I did I

106
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:58,739
was 100 transparent every step of the

107
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:01,799
way that's great since you told them you

108
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:04,440
had some of the data uh did you delete

109
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:09,060
the copy of the data that you had uh

110
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,980
no uh

111
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:13,379
uh yeah is that something I should do uh

112
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:15,360
yeah didn't the program ask you to

113
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,040
delete all of the data that you had in

114
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,858
your possession uh no no they never

115
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:22,079
asked me that and actually now that I'm

116
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:24,180
thinking about it it might be kind of

117
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,100
complicated to have to delete all this

118
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:28,199
data it's it's like a cup like it's it's

119
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:31,259
not super straightforward oh interesting

120
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:32,880
complicated how

121
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,020
yeah

122
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,300
um so about that um there's actually

123
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,220
like a couple of systems that I use when

124
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:41,100
I do my testing and um it probably

125
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:43,440
results in like a copy of this user data

126
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,600
ending up in like a couple of different

127
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,940
places some third-party systems some

128
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:50,340
systems in my control uh it's not just

129
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,160
like one copy of the data oh no it

130
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:54,479
sounds like the data's everywhere

131
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,259
everywhere uh what systems how uh can

132
00:04:58,259 --> 00:05:01,380
you list them all uh yeah yeah I think I

133
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,960
think we can walk through this okay so

134
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,080
um basically the employee browse to that

135
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,060
admin page and that's where the data

136
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:12,419
started and then I use a third-party

137
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:14,820
testing system called xss Hunter to

138
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,380
manage that like screenshotting thing I

139
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:17,820
talked about

140
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,620
um so that from the laptop the

141
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,500
screenshot got sent to xss Hunter which

142
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,479
is not managed by me it's managed by

143
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:28,740
just like a a person yeah and then he

144
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:31,979
runs that in AWS so we have like AWS

145
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:34,440
that has a copy the a random person that

146
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,259
has a copy and then that emailed me a

147
00:05:37,259 --> 00:05:39,240
copy of the screenshot too so I guess my

148
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,580
email provider has a copy and then I

149
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,979
downloaded a copy onto my hard drive and

150
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:46,680
then I run time machine so there's

151
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:49,199
another copy on my backup hard drive and

152
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,479
then I attached all of that to the bug

153
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:54,240
tracking system so there's another copy

154
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,520
in the bug tracking system I think

155
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,699
that's all of it wow okay

156
00:05:59,699 --> 00:06:01,620
um let's try to delete data everywhere

157
00:06:01,620 --> 00:06:04,979
you possibly can if your backups don't

158
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:08,100
roll off try to delete your backups do

159
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:09,419
some of the third parties where the

160
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:11,160
data's been captured allow you to delete

161
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,419
the data

162
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:15,240
oh uh that's a good question

163
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,100
um let me check

164
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,280
um so it looks like xss Hunter has a

165
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,340
button that says delete but there's no

166
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,319
like terms of service or anything like

167
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:27,240
that so I don't actually know if it is

168
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:29,400
deleting the data on the back end when I

169
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,380
click that button

170
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,960
um and then the bug platform itself

171
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:37,199
actually doesn't have a delete button so

172
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,600
I don't think that there's an ability

173
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,479
for me to delete that copy but I can

174
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:43,680
definitely delete the copy on my hard

175
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:45,660
drive I can delete the copy of my backup

176
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:48,419
and I can probably delete the Gmail copy

177
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:51,000
since Gmail terms of service says that

178
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,319
deletes the data when you click that

179
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,819
button

180
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:54,720
um

181
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,639
has this been resolved with a company

182
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,100
you know have they closed the ticket and

183
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,900
fixed the vulnerability

184
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,479
so uh yes

185
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:05,400
um they they closed the ticket but I I

186
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:07,860
still have access to the ticket

187
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,840
um and actually now that I'm thinking

188
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,620
about it um my my bug platform account

189
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,479
um like I'm scrolling through some of my

190
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:16,979
old submissions and I'm finding like

191
00:07:16,979 --> 00:07:18,740
there there have actually been other

192
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:21,599
examples in my in my account where I've

193
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,460
accidentally accessed user data and it

194
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,800
looks like all of those old tickets

195
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,539
I can still log into them and still

196
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:29,400
access that data like none of it has

197
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,900
been cleared out of the bug system even

198
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:32,220
though the tickets were closed out as

199
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,599
fixed a while ago

200
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,479
wow I I have to imagine other bug

201
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,960
Hunters have this problem do they

202
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,520
um I can ask I know I know a couple

203
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,080
friends there are some proliferate bug

204
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:45,500
Hunters

205
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,259
um

206
00:07:46,259 --> 00:07:49,860
so uh turns out I I talked to a couple

207
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,180
of friends that I know that are pretty

208
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,220
good bug hunters and a hundred percent

209
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:55,680
of them said that their bug crowd

210
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,419
accounts and hacker one accounts are

211
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:00,060
exactly the same when they log in they

212
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:01,919
just have like a ton of different

213
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:03,660
privacy issues that are years old and

214
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,000
they can still access those issues and

215
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,039
they can download the data yeah yeah

216
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:10,080
yeah even though the issues were closed

217
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,120
a while ago they still have access to

218
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,620
the data that they attached to the

219
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:15,360
ticket

220
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,020
um

221
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:19,379
maybe because these these bug tracker

222
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:21,720
systems have the ability to request

223
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,819
public disclosures I mean there's enough

224
00:08:23,819 --> 00:08:26,400
of these examples maybe if we request

225
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,800
all of them some of them might actually

226
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,080
let us talk about this and share some of

227
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:34,679
these examples I mean it doesn't exactly

228
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,799
um you know it they might say no but I

229
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:39,719
mean we could try and then we could have

230
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:40,979
specific examples that we could share

231
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:42,419
with other people and bring some

232
00:08:42,419 --> 00:08:44,580
visibility to this

233
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,420
um

234
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:46,620
oh

235
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:49,980
yeah that didn't work uh so they they

236
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:52,260
they did not allow uh us to publicly

237
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:54,779
talk about this okay well look there's a

238
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:56,339
bunch more researchers and a bunch more

239
00:08:56,339 --> 00:08:58,440
tickets uh maybe if we just keep

240
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,300
requesting eventually we'll find some

241
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,100
programs that allow us to pop publicly

242
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,880
about these issues

243
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:09,060
I was not expecting that uh okay uh

244
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:10,140
looks like

245
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:11,820
um there there was a programmer too

246
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,019
that's actually going to let us talk

247
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:14,940
publicly about these issues

248
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:16,440
um that's pretty cool

249
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,480
neat okay so

250
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,700
um just wanted to maybe break the fourth

251
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:23,279
wall for a bit and highlight

252
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,519
um most of these requests got denied um

253
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:28,320
the vast majority of programs did not

254
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,360
want us talking about privacy leaks that

255
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,820
impacted their companies

256
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:35,220
um of the small number of companies that

257
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,380
approved these requests we just want to

258
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:39,300
give a huge shout out to these companies

259
00:09:39,300 --> 00:09:41,580
for allowing us to talk publicly about

260
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,980
these issues we don't by any means mean

261
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,660
to shame these companies since these are

262
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,980
the ones that are allowing us to be

263
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:49,260
transparent and the vast majority of

264
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:51,360
these companies actually denied the

265
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,380
request

266
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,720
so with that being said

267
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,399
um here's a real world example of this

268
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,279
happening I was pen testing indeed the

269
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,000
job search company and a developer over

270
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,519
there had run a little one-off sketch

271
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,339
Notebook on their laptop that they had

272
00:10:08,339 --> 00:10:11,040
written their own custom HTML to do some

273
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,080
research on some of their users and so

274
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:14,580
they pulled in a whole bunch of users

275
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,580
onto their local notebook it was maybe

276
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:20,339
on the order of thousands of users

277
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:23,640
uh and they insecurely rendered those

278
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:26,279
users and blind cross-site scripting

279
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:28,800
fires a screenshot gets sent up and I

280
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,300
accidentally end up with a whole bunch

281
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:34,620
of pii or personal data that I didn't

282
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,440
mean to access but I got a copy of it

283
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:39,720
and what's interesting here is that when

284
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:42,180
we requested to publicly talk about this

285
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:43,500
issue

286
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,839
um they said sure no problem just make

287
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:47,519
sure if you have any screenshots you

288
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,140
redact out any of the personal

289
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,700
information

290
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,720
um and that's super interesting because

291
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,399
they're kind of self-aware of the fact

292
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,740
that I still have maintained access to

293
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,200
the data through this ticket even though

294
00:10:58,200 --> 00:11:00,240
the issue was closed out years ago in

295
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,740
this example

296
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:04,920
so three basic questions here was I ever

297
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:07,440
asked to delete data no

298
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,240
um do I maintain access to the data

299
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,820
through the ticket yes and then was

300
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,740
there ever a public disclosure or

301
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:17,279
notification about this data leakage not

302
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,680
to my knowledge and my email address was

303
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:22,079
included in the league so if they had

304
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,120
emailed all the people affected I

305
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:26,940
probably would have gotten an email

306
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:28,200
okay

307
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,300
um so here's another example um this one

308
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,220
is with Google

309
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,339
um basically a very similar situation

310
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:36,959
where an employee was doing a little

311
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:37,980
one-off

312
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,019
um on a script that they had written

313
00:11:40,019 --> 00:11:42,240
locally they had pulled in in this case

314
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,579
tens of thousands of user records which

315
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:48,060
includes Pi personal information

316
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:50,339
um and in this case same deal they

317
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:52,380
insecurely rendered it screenshot got

318
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,720
sent up to xss Hunter and I end up with

319
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,760
accidentally a copy of tens of thousands

320
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:58,620
of user records

321
00:11:58,620 --> 00:12:01,140
um what about in this case uh was I

322
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:03,320
asked to delete my copy of the data no

323
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:06,839
did I maintain access through the ticket

324
00:12:06,839 --> 00:12:10,019
yes and in this case it uses Google's

325
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:11,700
issue tracker since they don't use a

326
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:14,100
third-party issue tracker and within

327
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,260
Google's issue tracker still able to log

328
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,779
in and access that data and do they do

329
00:12:18,779 --> 00:12:20,700
any notifications not to my knowledge

330
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:24,060
again my email was in that

331
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:26,820
so that's what the story was until a

332
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,980
couple of days ago when I actually

333
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:31,260
shared an advanced copy of the slide

334
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:33,240
Deck with them and we got this email

335
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,579
back saying um we're going to actually

336
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:37,620
change some of our processes can you

337
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,380
please delete your copy of the data so

338
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:42,180
this issue is like two years old or

339
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,700
something like that and for those two

340
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,500
years it was never asked to delete my

341
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,560
copy so I had access to the ticket Etc

342
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:51,360
but as of a couple days ago as a

343
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,860
consequence of this talk Google is

344
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,240
actually changing their processes

345
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,800
internally and they're going to be

346
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,360
deleting data that's attached to tickets

347
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,440
which is pretty neat

348
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:03,060
okay one final example that I was going

349
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:04,380
to share with you all

350
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:06,779
um was another uh pretty large

351
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:09,240
significant company with a similar story

352
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,820
albeit it impacted a lot fewer user

353
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,440
records

354
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,120
um and when they got an advanced copy of

355
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,320
the slide deck they actually changed

356
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,360
their minds um they gave us preliminary

357
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:20,220
permission to talk about it and then in

358
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:21,720
the Zero Hour they said actually we're

359
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,800
not comfortable with you sharing this

360
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:26,279
publicly and they uh they said please uh

361
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,019
you know remove any information about

362
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:29,279
this book

363
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,040
very similar story to the others but um

364
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:34,680
can't I can't talk about this one

365
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,240
okay so we talked about some other

366
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,680
researchers

367
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,540
um so what's the deal there

368
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,200
um

369
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,720
I reached out to a couple of hug testers

370
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,760
that I knew and I said hey do any of you

371
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,380
have stories that you might be able to

372
00:13:46,380 --> 00:13:48,540
share publicly and

373
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:51,720
um you know of those similarly most of

374
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:53,519
these stories no cannot be shared

375
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:56,279
publicly but I did find two researchers

376
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:58,920
who did have bugs that had already been

377
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:00,120
written about publicly that they already

378
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:02,339
had permission and it did impact user

379
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:04,019
data and so

380
00:14:04,019 --> 00:14:06,720
um they said yeah go ahead include those

381
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,180
the first one is to repent tester his

382
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,100
name is shubs and he was doing some

383
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:14,100
testing against Uber and he found that

384
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:16,139
he could get access to others users data

385
00:14:16,139 --> 00:14:19,260
through a bug in AMT script

386
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,399
so

387
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,040
um he was trying to just pull basically

388
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,079
like his user by putting in his name

389
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:28,980
Chubbs but as it turns out that is a

390
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,320
less unique name than maybe he assumed

391
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:34,680
uh and he ended up with everyone who had

392
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,480
the word shoves anywhere in their user

393
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,180
data um so he queried that name and then

394
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,160
came back a whole bunch of people that

395
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,660
just had shubs anywhere in their user

396
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,339
data and he ended up with a bunch of

397
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:47,760
user records unwittingly here is his

398
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,399
blog post that he put on asset note and

399
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,880
you can see he has redacted out the user

400
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,740
data but I asked him in the original

401
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,959
ticket was it redacted or did you have

402
00:14:57,959 --> 00:14:59,579
the raw data and he said well the

403
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:01,740
original ticket had the raw data and I

404
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,019
said okay well um were you asked to

405
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:06,600
delete it he's like no I was like okay

406
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,579
well did you like do you still have

407
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:10,440
access to the ticket that has the raw

408
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:12,480
unredacted data and it was like I mean

409
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,980
yeah I can still log into it it was a

410
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,660
couple years ago but you know I can I

411
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,760
can still log into my old tickets and

412
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,839
then I asked okay well did they ever

413
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:20,579
notify fight the other shelves and he

414
00:15:20,579 --> 00:15:22,560
was like to my knowledge the only public

415
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,600
disclosure that ever happened here was

416
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:27,120
the write-up that I did on my blog and

417
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:31,040
that the other services weren't notified

418
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:33,060
um similar story

419
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:35,820
um here with another prolific bug Bounty

420
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,920
or Sam Curry I reached out to him and

421
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,240
asked him if he had any stories and he

422
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:40,380
said yeah I did a write-up a little

423
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,300
while ago on Starbucks where I could

424
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,699
actually access 100 million customer

425
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:46,320
records

426
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,579
um and so maybe the title was a little

427
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:49,560
bit clickbait here I asked him did you

428
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:51,839
actually access 100 million records and

429
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:54,000
he was like well no I mean I proved that

430
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,040
I could but I didn't actually access 100

431
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:58,440
million records I accessed you know

432
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,300
maybe five or six people's records that

433
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,320
weren't mine

434
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,899
and it was a bunch of information that

435
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:06,120
came from those five or six records

436
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:09,300
um and I asked him the same question uh

437
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,880
but before I get to his answers I just

438
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:13,800
want to maybe call out here

439
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:15,420
um if it's not obvious

440
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:18,899
um I've been using Dolly to enhance some

441
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:21,300
of the imagery in this talk and I

442
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,220
thought this one was particularly good

443
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,459
uh it was basically Digital Data spills

444
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:28,320
out of coffee and I thought this was a

445
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,579
pretty cool image that came back from

446
00:16:29,579 --> 00:16:30,600
that

447
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,399
um but I asked him

448
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,639
did you delete your copy of the data

449
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:37,500
um or were you asked to delete your copy

450
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,360
of the data and he said no I said if you

451
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,800
log into the ticket today does it still

452
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,660
have the unredacted data from the fiber

453
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,240
6 that you tested with he said yes and I

454
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,980
said were there ever disclosure

455
00:16:46,980 --> 00:16:48,360
notifications that went out to the

456
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,980
people that were impacted and he said

457
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:51,779
you know not to his knowledge other than

458
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:54,600
the write-up that he did on his blog

459
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:56,579
so I think the takeaway here

460
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:58,800
um is that these are like not one-off

461
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,440
examples these privacy leaks in bug

462
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,619
bounties are actually really common and

463
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:07,439
for every example that we can share

464
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,720
publicly there are a hundred examples

465
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:12,480
that can't be shared publicly and so I

466
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,859
think it's time that we start a

467
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:15,720
conversation about it and see what we

468
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:18,000
can do to reduce the impact of some of

469
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,319
this

470
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,480
so why does it happen like why do we

471
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:22,980
have these leaks

472
00:17:22,980 --> 00:17:25,380
um well sometimes uh it's an accident

473
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,780
right like in the example that I walked

474
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:28,860
through before with the cross site

475
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,299
scripting

476
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:32,100
um usually when you test blind

477
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:33,840
cross-site scripting you have no idea

478
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:35,340
where that payload is going to render

479
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,320
you throw it into one system sometimes

480
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,419
it comes out in another system you don't

481
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:41,160
really know what that screenshot is

482
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:43,500
going to be there are different ways to

483
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:45,660
test blind cross-site scripting but uh

484
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,160
in in general some of the most popular

485
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:49,980
ways can lead to data leakages by

486
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,480
accident

487
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:53,940
um so that's fairly common

488
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:56,039
but another another thing is like

489
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:57,480
sometimes it's it's not an accident

490
00:17:57,480 --> 00:18:00,360
right like sometimes the researcher

491
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,580
um goes that extra step because they

492
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:03,900
either feel like they have to prove

493
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:06,299
impact or because honestly in this

494
00:18:06,299 --> 00:18:09,480
screenshot the triager in the bug Bounty

495
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,760
requests that they go that extra step

496
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,380
and in this example this is a real

497
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,940
screenshot I took from my issue tracker

498
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,140
it said

499
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,539
um please prove that you can leak

500
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:21,059
sensitive information that I showed them

501
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:23,220
that you can you know have access to

502
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,260
this thing that's not enough please show

503
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,700
that sensitive data can actually be

504
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:27,900
leaked out of that

505
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:29,220
um and like have you do that without

506
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:32,340
accessing the sensitive information

507
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:34,919
um so I guess in those two Dimensions

508
00:18:34,919 --> 00:18:38,039
like the first uh incentive to leak this

509
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:40,080
sensitive data is just because if the

510
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,000
researcher can show more impact usually

511
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,320
they get paid more

512
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,000
um so that's the way bug bounties are

513
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,880
set up the more impactful the bug is the

514
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:50,039
more the researcher is compensated and

515
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:53,100
so in proving that they can access other

516
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:55,380
people's data they might be showing more

517
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,940
impact and trying to get paid a little

518
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:58,200
more

519
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,360
the other incentive is from the triager

520
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:02,280
and this one is a little bit more

521
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:04,679
interesting I think the triager is often

522
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:06,419
inundated with a whole bunch of garbage

523
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:08,280
submissions basically a whole internet

524
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,860
of people saying I found some bug I

525
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,059
found this thing or whatever and the

526
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:13,500
vast majority of them are not actually

527
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,900
valid bugs and the triagra feels

528
00:19:15,900 --> 00:19:17,760
fatigued they feel wore down and if they

529
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,320
were to actually run every single one of

530
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:21,179
these submissions to the ground it would

531
00:19:21,179 --> 00:19:22,799
take more hours than they have in the

532
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:25,799
day and so oftentimes they'll just reply

533
00:19:25,799 --> 00:19:28,080
to all of these submissions hey can you

534
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,160
give me a little bit more information

535
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,740
can you push that bug one step forward

536
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,260
can you show me a little bit more so

537
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:36,120
that I can get through these issues a

538
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:37,860
little bit faster because there's so

539
00:19:37,860 --> 00:19:39,900
much garbage that came in so those are

540
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,940
the two main incentives that can play

541
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,220
both from the triage and the researcher

542
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,539
side that can lead to some of these

543
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:47,580
privacy issues

544
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,919
and then um you know like we mentioned

545
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,240
before thank you so much to the

546
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,559
companies that allowed us to talk

547
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,419
publicly about it but for every one of

548
00:19:54,419 --> 00:19:55,740
those companies there are hundreds more

549
00:19:55,740 --> 00:19:57,240
that will never allow us to talk

550
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,460
publicly about them and then beyond that

551
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:01,260
there's a universe of companies that

552
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:03,480
aren't even running bug bounties that

553
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,340
have these data leakages and they aren't

554
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:06,960
even notified about them because they

555
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,820
don't have a mechanism to have that

556
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,440
disclosure path

557
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,000
um so you know a couple things to call

558
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,980
out here the first is that we do believe

559
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,020
bug bounties are a positive force for

560
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,120
Change and that companies that run bug

561
00:20:18,120 --> 00:20:19,799
bounties are in a better place than

562
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,480
companies that don't

563
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:22,679
um and the other thing to call out here

564
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:25,020
is we don't by any means mean to shame

565
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,520
any of the companies that we've talked

566
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,480
about

567
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,919
um because there are so many more

568
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:30,780
companies that are gonna never talk

569
00:20:30,780 --> 00:20:32,160
about these things because they don't

570
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,640
want to ever talk about them publicly

571
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:37,559
um and in that same vein I think it's

572
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:39,960
pretty common for journalists to run

573
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,000
clickbait gotcha articles every time a

574
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,740
company does talk about an internal

575
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,120
incident

576
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,400
um here's an example of that if people

577
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:51,059
don't know um hacker one runs their own

578
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:53,700
bug Bounty for their own infrastructure

579
00:20:53,700 --> 00:20:55,799
so they're a company like any other

580
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:57,299
company and they've got internal

581
00:20:57,299 --> 00:20:59,160
services that they need to secure like

582
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:01,620
any other company except they've always

583
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,480
championed a spirit of transparency

584
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,580
where any bugs that they have they're

585
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:07,559
going to talk about them publicly they

586
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,179
believe that that's the best long-term

587
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:10,500
direction for the industry and so that's

588
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,299
kind of neat that they always publicly

589
00:21:12,299 --> 00:21:14,220
talk about their bugs but it comes back

590
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:16,080
to bite them because every time they do

591
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,780
some clickbait gotcha article comes out

592
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:20,400
and says

593
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,960
um look look at the bad thing that

594
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,080
happened and that is a pressure for

595
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,179
other companies to not talk publicly

596
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:29,100
about their issues

597
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:32,039
and so a reframing of maybe what that

598
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:34,200
article could have looked like

599
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:36,179
um might be to say

600
00:21:36,179 --> 00:21:39,179
hacker one Champions transparency and

601
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:40,620
shares an internal incident that other

602
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:44,120
companies wouldn't have otherwise shared

603
00:21:44,820 --> 00:21:46,440
okay

604
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,360
so why should you care

605
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,140
um

606
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,480
you know data seems to be everywhere

607
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,120
what can we do about it can we even get

608
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,940
to fixing this problem the answer is

609
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,380
probably we're never going to get to

610
00:21:58,380 --> 00:22:00,840
perfect but we can take incremental

611
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,940
steps to move forward

612
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:05,700
so here's one reason why you should care

613
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:08,159
about this I talked about xss Hunter as

614
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:09,960
a third party testing service that's

615
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:12,179
just maintained by a guy

616
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:14,520
um well that guy I happen to know so I

617
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,679
just pinged him and I said how much data

618
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:18,720
has leaked into your system like can you

619
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,280
just send me a screenshot of your

620
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,020
database so I have an idea of like how

621
00:22:22,020 --> 00:22:24,360
big this is industry-wide that's the

622
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,419
screenshot it's 1.66 terabytes of data

623
00:22:27,419 --> 00:22:29,700
that has been blind cross-site scripting

624
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:31,260
screenshots that have been sent up to

625
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,960
this service I mean it is a huge amount

626
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:36,600
of data sitting on this Central

627
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,120
point of weakness

628
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:42,539
similarly as a result of this talk I

629
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:45,059
realized my user account in the bug

630
00:22:45,059 --> 00:22:47,900
systems did not have two-factor enabled

631
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:50,700
that meant that if somebody were to log

632
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,440
into my account

633
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,000
um you know the the bar for doing that

634
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,380
was a lot lower than it could have been

635
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,600
and that's probably the case for a lot

636
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,640
of other researchers probably a lot of

637
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,860
researchers run their account without a

638
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:04,020
really hardened authentication mode and

639
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:05,820
if these researchers have access to many

640
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,620
tickets that have many different privacy

641
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,059
issues

642
00:23:09,059 --> 00:23:10,380
um you can see how that might be a

643
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,580
problem

644
00:23:11,580 --> 00:23:12,980
okay

645
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:16,679
so we can tell it's a trend

646
00:23:16,679 --> 00:23:19,140
um so let's try to clean up some of it

647
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:21,240
let's take some of that toxic waste to

648
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:24,539
make it a little bit uh less toxic

649
00:23:24,539 --> 00:23:26,820
so let's start with the bug Bounty

650
00:23:26,820 --> 00:23:29,520
program if you build it you have to

651
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:32,400
prepare for the worst so you can't go

652
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,380
into building a bug Bounty program

653
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:37,440
without making sure that you have the

654
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:39,539
fundamentals built first you have to be

655
00:23:39,539 --> 00:23:41,400
prepared to receive the vulnerabilities

656
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:44,039
to address the issues

657
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:47,039
um to work with an attorney like myself

658
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:49,260
in your company if you have access to

659
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:51,480
one or other stakeholders in your in

660
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,320
your

661
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,100
um uh at your disposal so I'm a lawyer

662
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,960
I've said this already but I'm not your

663
00:23:57,960 --> 00:23:59,580
lawyer so none of this should be

664
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:01,799
construed as legal advice and if there's

665
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:03,720
one thing that you take away from my

666
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:04,679
talk

667
00:24:04,679 --> 00:24:08,280
to a lawyer it's not there it's not that

668
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,260
scary we're here to help

669
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,880
um and while we can't get to perfect

670
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:14,039
there are lots of opportunities for

671
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:16,320
prevention basic data governance

672
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:17,940
principles

673
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,400
um data life cycle best practices will

674
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,200
help get you there you have to think

675
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,020
about a bug Bounty program as a series

676
00:24:25,020 --> 00:24:28,140
of data life cycle so

677
00:24:28,140 --> 00:24:31,080
let's work closely uh with the privacy

678
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:33,120
and compliance teams to make sure that

679
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,919
you're building a bug Bounty program

680
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:36,900
with that in mind

681
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:40,140
so let's walk through where we can make

682
00:24:40,140 --> 00:24:43,080
small incremental progress and steps in

683
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,960
each of the uh areas that Dylan outlined

684
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:49,380
in his example so first of all with the

685
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:51,000
researchers in the program create

686
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:53,520
policies asking researchers to stop

687
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,039
before pulling data and stick to it

688
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:58,679
right if the incentive to get paid out

689
00:24:58,679 --> 00:25:00,600
is only if you're asking them to pull

690
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:02,280
extra data and you don't know what

691
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,140
that's going to look like you need to be

692
00:25:04,140 --> 00:25:06,059
prepared for the consequences of what

693
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:08,220
that might mean for your company your

694
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,380
legal obligations as a company to

695
00:25:10,380 --> 00:25:13,260
potentially do breach notification which

696
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,820
is internal

697
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,340
um examination that you need to do with

698
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,559
your legal team

699
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:21,000
think about what your end-to-end program

700
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,520
looks like and where data might leak and

701
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,140
consider that when you're communicating

702
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:27,600
with your stakeholders the first time

703
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:29,460
that your legal team hears about your

704
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:32,520
bug Bounty program should not be when

705
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:35,100
you have an issue so tell them explain

706
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,720
to them what you're doing there are a

707
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:38,760
lot lots of lawyers who are new in this

708
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:41,760
area who are and a lots that are

709
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:43,260
experienced if you work with them

710
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,000
they're going to help you build a better

711
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,159
bug Bounty program

712
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:49,080
so let's start with the employee laptop

713
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,539
first internal apps should have the same

714
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:54,480
level of security as external elaps the

715
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:58,200
type of data processed should Define the

716
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,000
level of security so even if it's

717
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,980
happening internally you need to make

718
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:03,299
sure that you're thinking about the

719
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:06,360
security on your internal apps also make

720
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,679
sure you're thinking about roles and

721
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,260
responsibilities right every time I am

722
00:26:10,260 --> 00:26:13,020
the first person in my company whenever

723
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,460
someone's like do you need access to

724
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:16,260
this data I'm like dear God no I don't

725
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:18,120
want to be the person that causes a

726
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:20,340
potential breach or issue give me

727
00:26:20,340 --> 00:26:22,559
temporary access whatever it may be so

728
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:25,320
really think about does the person need

729
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:27,360
access to hundreds of thousands of

730
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,340
Records do they need access to all of

731
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:31,500
the data tailor your access controls

732
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,200
accordingly now that's a big ask but

733
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,940
it's going to help in the long run and

734
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:39,080
prevent larger leaks from happening

735
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,059
second as we're looking at platforms

736
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:44,940
like xss Hunter and other platforms be

737
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:47,039
aware of what data they collect so as a

738
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:49,200
researcher when you're going through be

739
00:26:49,200 --> 00:26:51,059
aware of what potentially might be

740
00:26:51,059 --> 00:26:53,340
ending up somewhere else because a

741
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:55,020
company may come to you and say where's

742
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:58,140
the data who has it because I ask these

743
00:26:58,140 --> 00:27:00,360
questions myself when I work with folks

744
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,580
on bug Bounty programs have you deleted

745
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:05,039
it so keep track of that so you're

746
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,740
prepared to answer those questions and

747
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,799
even if the answer is no I I don't know

748
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,779
if I can delete it or it's in this

749
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:14,940
program and I don't have the ability to

750
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,520
like fix it Etc

751
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,980
um so where you can go back and delete

752
00:27:19,980 --> 00:27:23,580
relevant data and try to make it so if

753
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:25,260
possible you're not sending data to

754
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,059
places that you don't want the data to

755
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:28,200
go

756
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:31,440
for Gmail I this this is an obvious one

757
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,900
but it's shocking to me how many times

758
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:36,840
people just send stuff over email

759
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:37,799
um

760
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:39,779
in fact the number of times I'm asked to

761
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:42,000
send my Social Security over email is is

762
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:44,400
alarming but don't put stuff in email

763
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,860
just avoid it if you can

764
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:48,600
um delete the email so you don't have a

765
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:50,220
copy of in your possession if you're

766
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:52,980
thinking about how to share data with a

767
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:55,380
company you know stick it in a G Drive

768
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:58,500
Link and share the link so that the data

769
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,360
is not being perpetuated in various

770
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:02,039
email systems because you're going to

771
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:04,620
send it to maybe a security ad email if

772
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,960
there's not a bug Bounty program and now

773
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:10,080
we have data in who knows how many email

774
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,940
boxes because that email may have been

775
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:15,000
forwarded to an entire security team

776
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:15,539
um

777
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:17,520
in your hard drive you know as a matter

778
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,440
of course again this is an obvious one

779
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:22,080
but don't download anything to your

780
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:25,020
machine if possible you know if you have

781
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:26,220
to do it

782
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:28,080
um delete it when you do and delete it

783
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,059
after you submit it

784
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:33,900
um finally for backups have a good uh

785
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,480
data retention on backups let it roll

786
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,559
off

787
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:40,440
um Implement a data retention policy or

788
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:42,360
spot remove it from backup if necessary

789
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:45,240
I hate spot removal from backups I never

790
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,799
like to touch backups they're the

791
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,539
emergency so good retention on your

792
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:49,980
backups is really going to be the best

793
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,419
bet here

794
00:28:51,419 --> 00:28:54,779
and then finally platforms we love the

795
00:28:54,779 --> 00:28:57,659
platforms but they need to get better

796
00:28:57,659 --> 00:28:59,760
um at giving their customers the ability

797
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:02,520
to do data governance in the program

798
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:03,360
um

799
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:06,120
you cannot currently delete attachments

800
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:09,659
it is difficult to automatically remove

801
00:29:09,659 --> 00:29:11,700
the researcher from a ticket after it's

802
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:13,980
been closed out these platforms are

803
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:16,679
Treasure troves of personal data and

804
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:19,200
customer vulnerabilities if leaked this

805
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,360
could have major consequences and you

806
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:23,100
need to think through how they store and

807
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,760
manage this in a bug Bounty platform

808
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,559
and so companies if you use platforms

809
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:32,340
ask them to consider allowing you to set

810
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:34,260
a data retention policy to have more

811
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:36,179
control over your data so we're not just

812
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:39,000
adding more and more into a handful of

813
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,399
accounts like Dylan's where it becomes a

814
00:29:41,399 --> 00:29:44,640
treasure Trove of personal data

815
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:46,740
um and then finally there are lots of

816
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:48,600
places the data could flow that we have

817
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,940
not mentioned here so this is just one

818
00:29:50,940 --> 00:29:53,220
particular scenario the data could leak

819
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,220
to so many other places

820
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:58,799
so I mean what should this data flow

821
00:29:58,799 --> 00:29:59,880
look like

822
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:02,700
um we talked about researcher using

823
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,320
access Hunter

824
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,419
um and that causing like a whole bunch

825
00:30:06,419 --> 00:30:07,620
of issues and then there were a couple

826
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,140
other third-party systems involved I I

827
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:11,820
think maybe there's an opportunity here

828
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:16,200
for the platforms themselves to operate

829
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,480
their own testing infrastructure to be

830
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,899
able to consolidate all of the testing

831
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:24,600
data inside the bug platform where they

832
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,460
have total access to the data governance

833
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,799
and maybe even better usability like

834
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:31,080
push to file a ticket buttons that are

835
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,659
easier on the researchers as well right

836
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:35,940
now the researchers don't have what they

837
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:37,799
need to do their testing and in a lot of

838
00:30:37,799 --> 00:30:39,299
cases they may not be sophisticated

839
00:30:39,299 --> 00:30:40,679
enough to stand up their own

840
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:42,840
infrastructure so they're having to go

841
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,460
out and seek out these third parties

842
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:47,220
that aren't involved with the bug

843
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,899
bounties explicitly and then they get

844
00:30:48,899 --> 00:30:50,820
inadvertently involved as a result of

845
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,679
the testing and maybe another thing to

846
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:55,980
call out is this is also an issue with

847
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,980
General Security testing whether that be

848
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:00,960
a

849
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,020
a pen tester from a professor firm or a

850
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:05,340
bug Bounty

851
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:07,980
um but we can at least solve for maybe

852
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,140
the 80 by consolidating the bug

853
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,539
platforms and having them run their own

854
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:14,460
testing infrastructure

855
00:31:14,460 --> 00:31:17,399
I really hope we see uh the platforms

856
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:19,679
develop in this space it it would have a

857
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,360
large impact

858
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,580
um so maybe some of you are here to

859
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,720
understand what are the legal

860
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,640
obligations I'm sure this is what

861
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,380
everyone wants to know

862
00:31:28,380 --> 00:31:29,700
um that's why I'm here I want to know if

863
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:32,279
I'm going to get sued well uh good news

864
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:33,720
I'm going to give you a very typical

865
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,899
legal answer and that is it depends

866
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:40,559
um this is there's no one clear cut this

867
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:43,020
is how you avoid legal liability you're

868
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,399
okay

869
00:31:44,399 --> 00:31:46,740
um so let's go over a quick refresh

870
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,140
really high level of bug bounty in the

871
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:51,720
law so in the United States there's a

872
00:31:51,720 --> 00:31:55,559
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act ooh yeah

873
00:31:55,559 --> 00:31:58,559
um and uh as a result it has been used

874
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:00,600
to against security researchers in the

875
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,620
past

876
00:32:01,620 --> 00:32:04,440
um generally bug bounties operate in

877
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,860
this idea of what is authorized

878
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:10,500
um so by asking and having a program you

879
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,440
are kind of allowing uh individual

880
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,179
researchers to be authorized to

881
00:32:15,179 --> 00:32:17,880
potentially hack your systems in a way

882
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,580
that would be allowed under cfaa there

883
00:32:20,580 --> 00:32:23,779
has has also been a new doj memo which

884
00:32:23,779 --> 00:32:25,919
recently announced

885
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,659
specifically

886
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:28,320
um

887
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,720
that if you are hacking in good faith

888
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:33,179
the doj is not going to prosecute yay

889
00:32:33,179 --> 00:32:35,760
but that good faith line could really

890
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:38,039
really vary depending on the current on

891
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:40,260
the situation so it's important to just

892
00:32:40,260 --> 00:32:43,679
be thoughtful here because legal issues

893
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,080
happen when people get pissed at each

894
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:49,260
other that's just if people feel not

895
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,539
heard if they feel frustrated if they

896
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:53,460
feel like you're not coming to the table

897
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,980
and having a conversation with them this

898
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:57,899
is one of the reasons where like the law

899
00:32:57,899 --> 00:32:59,580
starts to come into play and we don't

900
00:32:59,580 --> 00:33:01,679
want it there so there are some

901
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,179
resources here

902
00:33:03,179 --> 00:33:05,100
um that I recommend you know if you have

903
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,860
any questions or want to know more but

904
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:10,020
again engage your legal teams should you

905
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:11,279
have any questions or if you're a

906
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:12,899
researcher you know there are lots of

907
00:33:12,899 --> 00:33:14,700
resources out there about you know kind

908
00:33:14,700 --> 00:33:16,500
of best practices and I hope that you

909
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:19,380
will take some of these General

910
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:21,179
um guidelines that I'm about to give so

911
00:33:21,179 --> 00:33:22,740
what are the legal obligations that's

912
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,840
what everyone wants to know

913
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:26,399
um

914
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:29,460
here are some company takeaways to make

915
00:33:29,460 --> 00:33:32,159
sure that any data polled may not result

916
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,500
in any potential harm to an individual

917
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:37,500
or customer that's generally when when

918
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:39,419
somebody does do I have to do breach

919
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:42,360
notification It ultimately comes down to

920
00:33:42,360 --> 00:33:43,919
um you know is there potential harm to

921
00:33:43,919 --> 00:33:45,539
the individual that's the standard in

922
00:33:45,539 --> 00:33:48,720
the EU that generally is what triggers a

923
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:50,100
lot of breach notifications we don't

924
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,720
quite have that same standard here in

925
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,519
the United States it has to be specific

926
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,559
types of data actually we live in a

927
00:33:55,559 --> 00:33:59,399
53-state uh breach notification regime

928
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:02,220
um and I say 53 Virgin Islands Puerto

929
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:03,899
Rico Etc

930
00:34:03,899 --> 00:34:07,320
um but make sure that um the date you

931
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:08,760
know that the data doesn't persist on

932
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,560
any system so you need to ask the

933
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,899
researcher hey please delete the data

934
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:14,699
and confirm with me in writing that you

935
00:34:14,699 --> 00:34:16,800
have deleted the data you need to do

936
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,659
this you need to make sure that you are

937
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:21,659
mitigating any potential harm

938
00:34:21,659 --> 00:34:23,760
because that relates to that legal

939
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:25,379
analysis of whether or not you have to

940
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:27,659
do breach notification and the reality

941
00:34:27,659 --> 00:34:29,460
is no one wants to be harmed by this

942
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:31,619
data we want to keep it this program is

943
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:35,040
good so make sure that if you're being

944
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:36,659
asked to delete the data that you

945
00:34:36,659 --> 00:34:39,599
actually do it so along those lines some

946
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,879
researcher takeaways Say It Don't Spray

947
00:34:41,879 --> 00:34:43,500
it tell the company about the

948
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:45,960
vulnerability don't pull and spray data

949
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,899
to various third-party systems your hard

950
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:51,300
drive your backup Drive the bug Bounty

951
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:54,659
platform and if the company says to you

952
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,280
have you deleted all the copies of the

953
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,460
data don't say you did if it's not true

954
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,920
lying is not going to help you here it

955
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,080
is much much better to just be honest

956
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:06,359
and truthful hey here's where I think

957
00:35:06,359 --> 00:35:08,460
the data is I've deleted all the data

958
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,800
that I can possibly delete there might

959
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:13,200
be a copy here but I I you know I can't

960
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,339
be sure

961
00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:16,560
I guarantee those companies will work

962
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,200
with you to address the issue or close

963
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,260
out the ticket accordingly

964
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:24,060
if you used other third-party systems to

965
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:26,040
pull your data delete it we kind of

966
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,660
talked about that earlier but that's

967
00:35:27,660 --> 00:35:29,940
really important in making sure as

968
00:35:29,940 --> 00:35:32,820
you're building your kind of repertoire

969
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:35,099
of tools that you understand where data

970
00:35:35,099 --> 00:35:36,720
might go and how you might be able to

971
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,640
govern that data accordingly

972
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:41,099
and finally the platforms you know

973
00:35:41,099 --> 00:35:43,020
enable your customers to have more

974
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,660
control over their data in the product

975
00:35:45,660 --> 00:35:47,940
um you know allow programs to set

976
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:51,420
mandatory 2fa for hackers this has been

977
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:54,480
a huge success apparently

978
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,300
um when implemented and we'd love to see

979
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,579
this more broadly used and then finally

980
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:01,740
accurately talk about your privacy

981
00:36:01,740 --> 00:36:04,740
practices in your privacy statement or

982
00:36:04,740 --> 00:36:07,140
in your privacy policy and if you don't

983
00:36:07,140 --> 00:36:09,780
use a platform still think through how

984
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,400
you're sharing the data again to that

985
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:13,680
email example really make sure that

986
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:17,220
you're not spraying the data everywhere

987
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,619
so the general takeaways that we want

988
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:21,060
you to get from this is we love bug

989
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:23,160
bounties and we love the companies that

990
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,900
allowed us to talk about it and we don't

991
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,880
want to shame them but we're hoping to

992
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:28,800
get to a next level of conversation

993
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,200
about now that bug bounties are much

994
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,839
more prevalent that they are a must-have

995
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:37,140
for companies to triage and coordinate

996
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:39,540
vulnerabilities

997
00:36:39,540 --> 00:36:42,119
um we'd really like to get to a 2.0 and
