[Music]

2
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:09,599
and thank you for having us here it's an

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,639
honor to be at black hat

4
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:13,380
um today we're really excited to discuss

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,179
with you the techniques that we're

6
00:00:15,179 --> 00:00:17,039
observing advanced persistent threats

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,740
use when they perform job-themed social

8
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:21,119
engineering

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:22,880
my name is

10
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,619
I'm a principal for intelligence Analyst

11
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:29,460
at PWC where I track apts based in the

12
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,619
Asia Pacific region particularly in

13
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:34,020
North Korea and I'm joined today by a

14
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:36,180
veritable expert on iran-based for

15
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,160
actors Allison Michael

16
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,600
I think Savannah just called me a

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,559
dinosaur

18
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,800
so I'm Allison Wyckoff I've been in the

19
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,920
field about 20 years my focus on the

20
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,660
last half of my career has been on

21
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:49,920
incident response and threat

22
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,340
intelligence with a specific focus on

23
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:55,079
iran-based threats and in my copious

24
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:57,600
amounts of spare time I also guest

25
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,699
lecture at Columbia University so with

26
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:00,780
that I'll hand it back over to Savannah

27
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:02,579
to kick us off

28
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,580
so just to set a little bit of context I

29
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,500
would like you to raise your hand if

30
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:08,939
you've changed jobs in the past 12

31
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:10,140
months

32
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,880
how many views okay a few now what we

33
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,580
know is that a further one in five

34
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,979
people is likely to change jobs over the

35
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:21,840
next 12 months and you might all be

36
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:23,220
familiar with the concept of the great

37
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,080
resignation that phenomenon where in the

38
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:26,880
wake of the pandemic so many people have

39
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,920
decided that they needed to change

40
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:31,320
company or maybe change career entirely

41
00:01:31,320 --> 00:01:34,500
and what we see as a cyber angle to the

42
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:37,079
social context is that apts are taking

43
00:01:37,079 --> 00:01:39,900
advantage of this and increasingly using

44
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,960
job team lures particularly North

45
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,119
korea-based and iran-based redactors

46
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:47,100
stand out for their operational Tempo

47
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,140
and their brazenness in operating this

48
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,420
kind of activity so what we want to do

49
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:53,040
today is take you through a few case

50
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,619
studies of threat actors that are doing

51
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:57,840
this and their tools techniques

52
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,700
procedures so that you can learn to

53
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,500
recognize these attempts and maybe your

54
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,360
blue team or your red team might pick up

55
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,700
a couple tips and tricks throughout this

56
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,320
presentation

57
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,239
so we're going to start talking about a

58
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:11,340
threat actor that PWC tracks internally

59
00:02:11,340 --> 00:02:14,459
as black Artemis this is a product that

60
00:02:14,459 --> 00:02:16,860
is known in open source as hidden Cobra

61
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,780
which is how the US government refers to

62
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:21,239
it and Lazarus group I should caveat

63
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:22,920
that Lazarus cook is a bit of a broad

64
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:25,260
designation there's a lot of activity

65
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:27,900
that gets attributed to Lazarus that's

66
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,700
not surprised this is a threat actor

67
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,800
that has been active since at least 2007

68
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,680
and has changed a lot since then but for

69
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,480
the purposes of this presentation I want

70
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,819
to discuss with you a specific campaign

71
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:41,280
by black Artemis which is known as

72
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,340
operation dream job more broadly this is

73
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,220
an Espionage motivated campaign that is

74
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:50,160
incredibly persistent in targeting the

75
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,260
Aerospace sector the defense industrial

76
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,140
based manufacturing chemical sector for

77
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,280
everything for military secrets to

78
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:01,019
intellectual property to confidential

79
00:03:01,019 --> 00:03:03,420
information of strategic interest

80
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,819
so let's take a little bit of a look at

81
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:08,099
how black car thing is approaches its

82
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:10,739
initial access like social engineering

83
00:03:10,739 --> 00:03:13,260
I am very sad to report that email

84
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,780
phishing is not that I you know I wish

85
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:17,640
it was dead we all wish it was that it's

86
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,620
not so black Artemis does continue to

87
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:22,620
send emails with malicious attachments

88
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:24,000
to its targets

89
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,500
past couple years we've observed black

90
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,319
Artemis also people over to social

91
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,599
engineering of social media particularly

92
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:33,000
LinkedIn by building recruiter personas

93
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,159
and directly approaching targets so what

94
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:37,560
we see right there on screen is an image

95
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:39,599
that ESET actually shared in one of the

96
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,940
reports in this campaign where we see

97
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,680
the threat actor trying to approach a

98
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,560
victim and if I may in a very

99
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,540
unprofessional manner for an alleged

100
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:51,599
recruiter being like hey you know how

101
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,459
are you what are you doing now my

102
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:54,780
parents aren't home do you want a new

103
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,659
dream job which is kind of like you know

104
00:03:57,659 --> 00:04:00,299
a bit strange and the victim is like oh

105
00:04:00,299 --> 00:04:02,340
you know I'm working I can't talk to

106
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,680
right now and the third actor is like no

107
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:06,780
do you want to work for our company

108
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:08,519
question mark question mark which is a

109
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:10,500
bit aggressive I'd be like okay maybe

110
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:13,560
something's off but no what black

111
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:16,320
Artemis also does is it will follow up

112
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,760
with its targets via messaging apps such

113
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,860
as WhatsApp to make sure that the

114
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,259
victims do open the malicious viewer

115
00:04:25,259 --> 00:04:27,060
documents or the malicious executables

116
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:28,919
that the traductor has sent

117
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:32,460
black Artemis will also set up domains

118
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:34,740
these can be for command and control of

119
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,139
its malicious implants to send emails

120
00:04:37,139 --> 00:04:40,020
that appear to come from a legit site or

121
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,300
indeed to perform web exploitation as an

122
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:44,340
initial access method so let's take a

123
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:45,540
look at that

124
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:49,139
now black Artemis has set up a domain

125
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:51,600
like this which if you look at it it

126
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,160
kind of looks like indeed right very

127
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,139
prominent job search and applications

128
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:57,300
website but if you look at the Domain

129
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,280
it's not indeed.com which is the

130
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,759
legitimate site it's indeed us.org

131
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:05,639
free good fake wood for me at a first

132
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,680
glance and the third actor would post

133
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,440
here fake job descriptions for positions

134
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,240
at Google or Oracle so really high

135
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,540
profile companies and when the victim

136
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,680
navigated to these links in the third

137
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,440
doctor sent unbeknownst to them their

138
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:21,960
browser would get exploited with a zero

139
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,020
day at the time which is a remote code

140
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:26,880
execution vulnerability in Google Chrome

141
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,800
so they would be compromised and be

142
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,720
delivered like a back door without

143
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,539
knowing now we live in an economy's

144
00:05:33,539 --> 00:05:35,759
information we are constantly bombarded

145
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,160
with everything digital and so it's not

146
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,780
practical to tell people don't click

147
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:41,699
links don't open attachments like

148
00:05:41,699 --> 00:05:44,039
seriously we all have to do that but

149
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:45,660
there is a little piece of user

150
00:05:45,660 --> 00:05:46,680
awareness

151
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,539
um that leads to prevention here because

152
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:51,180
just taking one second to check out

153
00:05:51,180 --> 00:05:53,639
whether that domain that you have been

154
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:55,680
sent is the legitimate one could prevent

155
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,860
compromise so sometimes even just a

156
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:00,960
double check matters let's take a look

157
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,699
at an intrusion chain instead using lure

158
00:06:02,699 --> 00:06:04,020
documents which is what we're all here

159
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:06,720
for because we love them so in the first

160
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,960
instance black Artemis will build a fake

161
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:12,120
job specification for some fabulous job

162
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,759
at a high profile company and it will

163
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:17,460
send it to the victim which you know at

164
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,919
some point might enable macros as this

165
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,720
happens the victim will be presented

166
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,020
with a doc RTF docx document but what

167
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:26,460
happens in the meantime is that the

168
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,080
macros are leading us to the next stage

169
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,600
of the intrusion they might for example

170
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,300
in one case that we've observed drop a

171
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:35,580
base64 encoded payload in a folder that

172
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:37,979
the victim is not likely to look into in

173
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:40,979
this case it was C drivers and then this

174
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:42,440
reductor will make sure that

175
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,699
certificate.exe is dropped to that same

176
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:48,240
folder and renamed surgery listen used

177
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:52,500
to run and decode The space64 Blob and

178
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,180
the renaming is interesting by the way

179
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:56,100
because it means that that Defender that

180
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,660
is doing forensics won't necessarily

181
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,699
know that search YouTube was used

182
00:06:59,699 --> 00:07:02,699
this leave us with a loader executable

183
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:05,039
which is then going to connect to a

184
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:07,620
further remote server and pull out the

185
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:09,120
actual payload which is going to be a

186
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,340
fully featured backdoor you know pull

187
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,680
down for their file execute commands

188
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,300
uploads files

189
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,340
and the product is going to ensure that

190
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,220
the loader also

191
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:21,840
establishes persistence on the bikini

192
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,759
machine so that even after machine

193
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,860
reboot this redactor has access

194
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:28,740
and this is done by in most cases that

195
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,780
we've observed by black Artemis through

196
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,479
running round

197
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,560
yellow32.exe pointing at the final stage

198
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,259
payload through a scheduled task

199
00:07:37,259 --> 00:07:39,240
let's take a moment

200
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,400
so let's say that your email filtering

201
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,560
solution unfortunately got fooled this

202
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,240
time but this kind of phishing email

203
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,759
let's say that your user got compromised

204
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,500
but that's okay because initial access

205
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,680
is just that initial access there is a

206
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,419
whole kill chain that the product has to

207
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:55,919
go through before you're fully

208
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:58,680
compromised and you can stop that so an

209
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,360
example of a detection opportunity here

210
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,919
would be monitoring your environment for

211
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,440
one year l32.exe running as a scheduled

212
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,720
task and pointing at an unusual like

213
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,819
file path that should not be normal in

214
00:08:08,819 --> 00:08:10,860
your environment so you can monitor for

215
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,660
that to have an idea that something

216
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:14,940
malicious going on let's look at the

217
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:16,259
lure documents

218
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:18,000
this is what they look like so they have

219
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,919
that little you know enable content

220
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:22,259
because this document is protected

221
00:08:22,259 --> 00:08:24,300
now the aesthetic of these lure

222
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,400
documents might change but what helps us

223
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,699
as Defenders is the metadata so in some

224
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:31,979
of these cases we saw that a lot of

225
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:33,958
newer documents built by black Artemis

226
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:37,740
had this Mickey author metadata many of

227
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:39,958
them had markers that would convert

228
00:08:39,958 --> 00:08:42,719
uuids into 32-bit or 64-bit chocolate

229
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,800
payloads maybe they were doing specific

230
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,920
Windows API aliasing some variable

231
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:52,920
definitions custom message boxes this is

232
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,540
all the kind of things that we can find

233
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:56,760
in macros that can help us as Defenders

234
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:59,399
hunt for more of that activity and even

235
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,260
detect it when it's on our Network

236
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,660
actually I should mention here that all

237
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,519
indicators of compromise for activity

238
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:07,140
related to this talk are going to be on

239
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:09,240
our public GitHub which is in the

240
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,160
reference to this talk when the slides

241
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,019
are published tomorrow so you can all go

242
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,240
you know look at those files and build

243
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:17,820
your own detections

244
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,380
so far we've talked about a North

245
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:21,180
korea-based redactor that performs

246
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:24,720
Espionage motivated operations and now I

247
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,180
want to talk as a different case study

248
00:09:27,180 --> 00:09:29,519
about another North korea-based redactor

249
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,320
that instead is financially motivated

250
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,260
this is a product that at plbc we track

251
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:37,680
internally as black alicanto and who is

252
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,240
very specifically focused on

253
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:41,640
cryptocurrency you're gonna tell me you

254
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,740
know okay fine crypto is all the rage

255
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,200
recently but why is a North korea-based

256
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,540
reactor interested in it well I've got

257
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,560
you

258
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,800
so since at least 2017 North korea-based

259
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,120
reductors have been known to

260
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,160
consistently Target cryptocurrency

261
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,060
exchanges compromise them to steal money

262
00:10:00,060 --> 00:10:03,120
so much so that in 2021 the usdoj

263
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:05,040
indicted three North Korean Nationals

264
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,839
for their role in targeting Western

265
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:09,660
Banks and cryptocurrency companies for

266
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,339
the purposes of Revenue generation

267
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:14,580
actually just a couple months ago North

268
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,620
korea-based reductors were attributed to

269
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:19,680
the compromise of this web 3.0 company

270
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,820
axi infinity and they made off with

271
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:27,540
625 million US dollars yes last week I

272
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:29,339
got tagged in a Twitter thread because I

273
00:10:29,339 --> 00:10:31,019
probably published like a lot about

274
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:34,019
black alicanto about this Daffy company

275
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:36,899
that was said that they got compromised

276
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:39,060
using the same ttps that I was talking

277
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,160
about black alicanto like two weeks

278
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,899
earlier which are the same ttps that

279
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:45,060
we're gonna see now so this is actively

280
00:10:45,060 --> 00:10:47,459
going on and it's targeting and it is in

281
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:49,800
the finance and cryptocurrency space so

282
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:52,339
watch out

283
00:10:52,940 --> 00:10:55,019
open source as dangerous password

284
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:57,540
cryptocore crypto mimic so quite a few

285
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,000
names and as we said it's financially

286
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,800
motivated

287
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:03,779
in terms of the social engineering that

288
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:05,700
black alicanto might conduct

289
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:08,279
email again but this director like

290
00:11:08,279 --> 00:11:11,040
system compressed archives with link

291
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,279
files or

292
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,660
other type of documents maybe a password

293
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:18,240
protected Word document and then a link

294
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:19,560
file

295
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:22,380
this is also in keeping with a shift

296
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:23,760
that we're seeing the broader threat

297
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,519
landscape where with Microsoft disabling

298
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:29,279
internet macros productors are having to

299
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,440
Pivot a bit in their initial access

300
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,540
techniques and using more and more link

301
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:36,899
files ISO files MSI installers and stuff

302
00:11:36,899 --> 00:11:39,360
like that black alicanto also abuses

303
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,180
enough rewarding so in mind for word it

304
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:45,300
targets an email while impersonating an

305
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:47,399
acquaintance of theirs so that the

306
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:49,320
victim goes like Oh look this person

307
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:51,240
that I know shared me

308
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,180
um forwarded me this analysis of stable

309
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,740
coins that's really interesting let me

310
00:11:55,740 --> 00:11:57,360
have a look but but actually they're

311
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:59,100
getting compromised

312
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:01,740
La calicanto also does social media

313
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,779
approaches pretending to be a recruiter

314
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:05,940
maybe it entices the victim into asking

315
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,980
more about their company

316
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,019
black alicanto does also do means

317
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:12,600
proofing we see here gsox hr.com which

318
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,040
is a Goldman Sachs proof or daiwains.com

319
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,180
investment is a Japanese Venture Capital

320
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:19,740
company

321
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:22,079
there is a hunting opportunity that I

322
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,640
think is really fun and I've really

323
00:12:23,640 --> 00:12:26,100
enjoyed using to find more black alicant

324
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:27,959
infrastructure which is this thread

325
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:30,180
actor loves to register domains through

326
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:33,480
pork bun registrar and if you look at

327
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,300
the underlying servers that these

328
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,579
domains resolve to they all have very

329
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:41,640
specific combinations of Apache PHP and

330
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:44,940
openssl versions in the server headers

331
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:47,940
so you can go and build that query and

332
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,040
find more infrastructure all of that

333
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:52,079
information is meant to be in the iuc's

334
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:54,420
on our GitHub so again you can go and

335
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,220
hunt for more

336
00:12:56,220 --> 00:12:59,040
in terms of an intrusion chain we've

337
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,800
said that this reactor will send an

338
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:03,839
email and then maybe there is like a DOT

339
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,480
pdf.link or a dot doc dot link so you

340
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,160
know the victim thinks this is this is

341
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,560
fine this is just a normal document when

342
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,540
they click on it they might just be

343
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:14,459
presented with a decoy document so

344
00:13:14,459 --> 00:13:16,620
they're like oh this you know this

345
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:18,180
analysis of the crypto Market is so

346
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,399
fascinating but in the background the

347
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,880
lnk file is actually calling mshta.exe

348
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,100
which is connecting to a remote server

349
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,740
to pull down a malicious JavaScript

350
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:31,980
script that we call cabbage loader what

351
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,959
cover Twitter does in the first instance

352
00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:36,360
is to place a link file in the victim

353
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,760
startup folder to ensure persistence and

354
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,260
then pulls down a whole series of other

355
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,880
JavaScript payloads

356
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,519
these are called a whole series of them

357
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,560
cabbage rot and they've been described

358
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,680
in great detail by entity Security in a

359
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,839
conference talk at virus bullet in 2020

360
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:54,060
they brought a whole report about it so

361
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,800
please do check it out if you're

362
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,180
interested in this

363
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,459
these are essentially profilers they

364
00:13:59,459 --> 00:14:02,160
want to make sure that the actual person

365
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,500
that's interacting with them is not a

366
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,959
Sandbox it's not a researcher but it's

367
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,060
actually a target of interest and at

368
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,220
this point the threadactyl manually

369
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,480
deploys

370
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,120
further JavaScript payload cab address C

371
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,680
which is a fully featured backdoor you

372
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,600
know uploads download files execute

373
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,639
commands All That Jazz

374
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:23,100
and from there the product can then move

375
00:14:23,100 --> 00:14:24,959
it laterally across the network

376
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:27,480
other detection opportunity are you

377
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,860
monitoring your environment for like

378
00:14:28,860 --> 00:14:32,040
link files that cool mshk exe and then

379
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:34,560
you know pull down and execute a file

380
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,120
from a remote source

381
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,920
if that's common in your environment

382
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:40,440
that's kind of weird if it's not make

383
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,180
sure that you're looking for this this

384
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,760
is not only specific to this redactor a

385
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:46,800
lot of reductors use these ttps so it's

386
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,079
a good thing to keep an eye out for you

387
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:50,699
know if you'll pass me the phone the the

388
00:14:50,699 --> 00:14:52,500
pawn it's a bit like something fish is

389
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:55,139
going on so you don't want that

390
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:57,420
this is what a black alicanto job

391
00:14:57,420 --> 00:15:00,019
simulator document might look like so

392
00:15:00,019 --> 00:15:02,940
this is an interesting one because

393
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,680
you can see that the product is saying

394
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,940
this is a position for blockchain

395
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,199
intelligence group

396
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:09,420
but then it says welcome when you work

397
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,180
for Commerce real Ag and then the

398
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,860
picture is Chase back so like if you

399
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,300
want to spoofer company at least decide

400
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,100
which one you don't need to give me

401
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,600
three all at once

402
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,000
and talking about the metadata that we

403
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,620
can use to detect this kind of activity

404
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,740
and this is your documents well actually

405
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:27,120
link files have these really interesting

406
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,980
field which is called the machine ID so

407
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:30,720
unless the third actor has scrubbed it

408
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:33,060
out you can use the machine ID metadata

409
00:15:33,060 --> 00:15:36,180
to Cluster all the documents that these

410
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:39,060
reactor is building pivot to hunt for

411
00:15:39,060 --> 00:15:41,519
more or detect them on your network and

412
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,260
all those heuristics we talked about so

413
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:46,199
like the double extension files the link

414
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:48,839
file invoking a command or calling mshta

415
00:15:48,839 --> 00:15:50,760
all of that is really interesting we

416
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,500
have IR role on our GitHub to detect

417
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,120
stuff like this

418
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:55,920
I wanted to highlight these documents as

419
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,740
well because just a few months before

420
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,839
black alicanto was using this we had

421
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:02,760
seen black Artemis product or we

422
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,560
mentioned before using a very similar

423
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:05,639
one

424
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:07,620
so you can see that both of them have

425
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,779
the same structure they say welcome when

426
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:11,820
you work for Blah Blah by engineering

427
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:13,500
the future well-being of humanity you'll

428
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,440
do XYZ this tax is taken word for word

429
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,779
from the Lockheed Martin careers website

430
00:16:18,779 --> 00:16:20,820
what do you know like Artemis was

431
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:23,160
proofing Lockheed Martin but then black

432
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:26,040
alicanto has taken all of that and put

433
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,839
it for blockchain intelligence group or

434
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,880
whatever so you know in all these

435
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,220
resignation has a North korea-based

436
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,320
operator move teams

437
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,240
it's a really interesting question it's

438
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,680
one that I'm working on in terms of like

439
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,660
attribution and in clarifying the

440
00:16:39,660 --> 00:16:41,699
relationship between black alicanto and

441
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:43,259
black Artemis if you track these

442
00:16:43,259 --> 00:16:44,399
reluctors and you want to have a

443
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,320
conversation about it I'm only years you

444
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,940
can catch us later and we can have a

445
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:51,120
chat and otherwise I'll get back to you

446
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,720
finally I could not not mention

447
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:56,579
um something that came up a few months

448
00:16:56,579 --> 00:16:59,160
ago so the US Department of the treasury

449
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:03,180
released an advisory saying that North

450
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:06,480
Korean I.T workers are seeking jobs

451
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:10,380
abroad often under fake identities

452
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,720
um maybe through proxy companies or

453
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:16,199
proxy identities in third countries and

454
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:18,780
this is in order to you know make money

455
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:21,839
they might work as application web

456
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:25,079
developers digital coin Developers

457
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:27,900
and there's a human rights angle here

458
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,940
which is that these I.T workers often

459
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:33,059
are in a forced labor situation and what

460
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:34,919
the advisor also said is that their

461
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:37,980
wages get taken away to finance the

462
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,740
North Korean regime not only if these

463
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,780
North Korean I.T workers get access to a

464
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,940
company of Interest they might actually

465
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,700
hand off that access to North

466
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:50,280
korea-based apts that then might

467
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:53,280
exfiltrate you know your crown jewels or

468
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,200
your information of Interest

469
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:58,679
so on one hand we know that the U.N

470
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:01,020
security Council has said that all of

471
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,200
the funds the North Korea

472
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:05,760
workers and North korea-based apt

473
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,100
generate go to fund the North Korean

474
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,919
nuclear weapons program and on the other

475
00:18:10,919 --> 00:18:13,320
you know think about it if you're a

476
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,440
company and you run the risk of hiring a

477
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,660
North Korean I.T worker

478
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,580
on what have you risked reaching

479
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:23,220
International sanctions and on the other

480
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:26,280
you risk a North korea-based apt than

481
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:28,380
being in your network you don't want

482
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,700
that so

483
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:32,039
I I guess one of my key takeaways here

484
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:34,740
is the job market right now is a really

485
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:37,080
key area for North korea-based

486
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:39,780
productors so keep your eyes peeled make

487
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,919
sure you're aware of who you're

488
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,360
interviewing

489
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:44,220
and For the Love of All That is Holy

490
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,660
don't open those links that you get sent

491
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:48,360
on LinkedIn do not open them

492
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:50,280
on that note I'm gonna hand off to

493
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,740
Allison thanks forever all right so

494
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:53,940
let's move forward and talk a little

495
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,260
about some of the recruiting that we're

496
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,299
seeing uh in the Middle East and by

497
00:18:57,299 --> 00:19:00,120
recruiting I mean recruiting

498
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:01,919
um before before we get into that let's

499
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,660
talk a little bit though about some of

500
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,400
the threat actors that really love a

501
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:07,679
recruiting theme in terms of iran-based

502
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,000
threat actors because there's not just

503
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,000
one so first up we have a group that PWC

504
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,220
calls yellow Garuda they're probably

505
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:15,960
more commonly known as Charming kitten

506
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,360
and open sources this is a really active

507
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,039
group we're not going to be talking

508
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:22,879
about them today

509
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:24,660
um but uh some of the recruiting type

510
00:19:24,660 --> 00:19:26,280
things they do is they specifically

511
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,860
Target journalists uh and other very

512
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:30,480
specific people of Interest with job

513
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,220
opportunities whether it be conferences

514
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:34,559
or specific jobs themselves

515
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,660
uh then we've got a group that we call

516
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,280
yellow light Arc they're more commonly

517
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,080
known as tortoise shell and open sources

518
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,179
and this group has set up fake

519
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:43,679
recruiting companies equipped with

520
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:45,980
personas on social media platforms

521
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,080
specifically uh targeting U.S veterans

522
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,720
so several years ago they created a fake

523
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,340
recruiting company that was specifically

524
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:55,679
specifically geared towards hiring

525
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:57,120
veterans

526
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,240
foreign

527
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,860
that we call Yellow marrow and this

528
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:03,720
group has been active for many many

529
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,360
years they're more commonly known as

530
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,460
apt-34 oil rig or Cobalt Gypsy in open

531
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:11,640
sources like uh yellow lighter they do

532
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,400
run a lot of personas or have run a lot

533
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,799
of personas on various social media

534
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,720
platforms again purporting to be

535
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,960
recruiters from valid and fake companies

536
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,640
but we're not talking about any of these

537
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,020
folks today we're talking about a group

538
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:28,200
that we call Yellow Dev 13. and again

539
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,820
for people who are in the room and do

540
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,740
iran-based research I do realize this is

541
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:33,120
not an exhaustive list this is just

542
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:34,679
highlights

543
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:39,120
okay so who is yellowdev13

544
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,559
um there has been a little bit of Open

545
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,620
Source reporting on them so there was a

546
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:46,080
report that came out from meta I believe

547
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:49,140
it was their q1 or maybe Q2 report that

548
00:20:49,140 --> 00:20:50,640
came out in April of this year that

549
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,200
talked a little bit about some takedown

550
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:54,179
activity that they did for some of the

551
00:20:54,179 --> 00:20:55,919
personas that this group was running

552
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,200
there was also some work done by

553
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,299
Microsoft to take down

554
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:02,880
um some brand infringement type work

555
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,320
that this group was doing and that was

556
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,720
reported under uh the nomenclature

557
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,900
borium this group does overlap with some

558
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:12,059
reporting under Imperial kitten for

559
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:13,740
those who subscribe

560
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,419
um to that flavor of threat and tell but

561
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:16,980
they've been active for a fair amount of

562
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,720
time in the grand scheme of things so

563
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,720
they've been around since about 2019 we

564
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,760
believe that their Espionage Focus we

565
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,140
haven't seen any indications that

566
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,460
they've been performing other types of

567
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,980
operations and again in terms of their

568
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:30,419
targeting it's pretty run-of-the-mill

569
00:21:30,419 --> 00:21:32,940
for iran-based operators so we're seeing

570
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:35,720
uh in terms of targeted regions the US

571
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,600
UK Canada obviously places in the Middle

572
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,000
East like Israel Saudi Arabia and then

573
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,740
some targeting in Russia and India as

574
00:21:43,740 --> 00:21:46,320
well and then the sectors that they were

575
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:47,940
targeting again with the with their

576
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,380
particular operations pretty

577
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:51,179
run-of-the-mill in terms of iran-based

578
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:54,380
Espionage operations energy technology

579
00:21:54,380 --> 00:21:57,240
Transportation semiconductor and then we

580
00:21:57,240 --> 00:21:59,640
also saw some Logistics uh and Maritime

581
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:02,220
targeting as well

582
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:04,080
but um what we're really here to talk

583
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,880
about with them today is a lot of the

584
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,679
fake stuff that they use so this group

585
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:10,260
really likes fake stuff and that is a

586
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:11,700
technical term and you can quote me on

587
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,320
that if you want

588
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,659
um so they have done a Litany of fake

589
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:16,440
things

590
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,940
um we are going to focus on the HR

591
00:22:17,940 --> 00:22:19,919
themed aspect of that but I did want to

592
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,720
cover just the broader operations in

593
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:23,220
terms of all the fake stuff that they've

594
00:22:23,220 --> 00:22:25,260
created so they've created a lot of

595
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:27,780
spoofed companies again geared towards

596
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,640
those targeted verticals and regions

597
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,100
that we were talking about they've also

598
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:34,620
created spoofed legitimate recruiting

599
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:36,179
companies both broad ones and very

600
00:22:36,179 --> 00:22:37,860
specific ones in terms of the types of

601
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:40,380
folks that they were targeting but more

602
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:43,020
interestingly they have set up a couple

603
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,299
of fake recruiting companies one's

604
00:22:45,299 --> 00:22:46,980
called apply talents and that was set up

605
00:22:46,980 --> 00:22:50,220
first and the other is called or was

606
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:52,740
called careers finders and along the

607
00:22:52,740 --> 00:22:55,440
lines of these organizations they also

608
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,780
have set up some personas associated

609
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,760
with them now in the past with some of

610
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,620
the groups that we mentioned that do

611
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:04,200
have done uh Persona based social

612
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:06,659
engineering we've seen those groups use

613
00:23:06,659 --> 00:23:09,539
uh pictures of real people in the case

614
00:23:09,539 --> 00:23:12,360
of yellow Dev 13 we've actually think

615
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,220
that they're using AI generated images

616
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:15,480
and we'll look at some of those later

617
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:17,159
but in terms of hunting for this

618
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:19,440
activity on your network as of earlier

619
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,480
this week the apply Talent site was

620
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,240
still active so if you are concerned

621
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,860
about these threat actors potentially

622
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:26,840
being

623
00:23:26,840 --> 00:23:28,919
targeting your employees or being on

624
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:30,179
your network I would take a

625
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:32,460
retrospective look in my network for

626
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,900
these two domains that we've put on the

627
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,580
slides and again this will be available

628
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,740
after the talk

629
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,840
okay so you might be wondering why

630
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,520
yellow Dev 13 doesn't have a beautiful

631
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,700
mythical creature uh name as opposed to

632
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:46,080
some of the other groups that we talked

633
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,820
about and that's because we didn't have

634
00:23:47,820 --> 00:23:50,100
a full intrusion chain uh for this

635
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,140
particular group so they're not a group

636
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,179
that we're comfortable uh bumping into

637
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:56,700
some of our existing groups or breaking

638
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,980
out into its own group so a little bit a

639
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:00,419
little backstory there but we do have a

640
00:24:00,419 --> 00:24:01,740
fairly good idea of how they're using

641
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,240
apply talents in terms of their

642
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:04,799
operations

643
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:08,220
um so this like a lot of these starts on

644
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:10,919
social media we think so we're not sure

645
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:13,919
exactly how they are delivering the

646
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,559
links to their particular victims but it

647
00:24:16,559 --> 00:24:18,600
could be a myriad of ways we know they

648
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:20,820
run social we know they run profiles on

649
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:23,280
LinkedIn and they also run them on some

650
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,620
other social media platforms but what we

651
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,419
did see was that links were delivered to

652
00:24:27,419 --> 00:24:28,380
people

653
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,600
um that would encourage them to download

654
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:33,539
a zip file from the apply talents

655
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,940
website

656
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:39,600
and if the victim opens that it launches

657
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:42,059
something called online interview.exe

658
00:24:42,059 --> 00:24:44,640
and we're like cool here's the malware

659
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,980
um and when we started doing analysis of

660
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:49,140
the malware itself it actually wasn't

661
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:52,320
malware it was just an exe and something

662
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:53,760
funny happened with this and we will

663
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,960
look at it momentarily but the online

664
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:59,280
interview.exe actually prompts the user

665
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:01,080
for credentials and this isn't a

666
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,640
credential stealing operation we

667
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,200
actually think that yellow Dev 13

668
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,260
supplies the credentials to the victim

669
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,580
and there's a couple reasons for that

670
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,980
one it evades uh detection for

671
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,620
sandboxing uh this particular exe and

672
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:16,260
two it keeps people like Sven and I uh

673
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:18,299
the ability to to fully understand the

674
00:25:18,299 --> 00:25:20,220
full intrusion chain so we think what

675
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:22,740
happens is yellow Dev 13 authenticates

676
00:25:22,740 --> 00:25:25,440
the uh the victim and then there is some

677
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,539
payload that's that's dropped that will

678
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:30,000
essentially take things off the targeted

679
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:30,900
Network

680
00:25:30,900 --> 00:25:32,880
uh and again if you're concerned about

681
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,640
this check for apply talents on

682
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,279
um on your network but let's take a look

683
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:39,500
at online

684
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,700
interview.exe because it's sort of fun

685
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,860
uh so this is what the interface looks

686
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:44,820
like

687
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:47,580
um I didn't squeeze or pull the image at

688
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:50,340
all this is it uh I love that people

689
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,260
enjoyed it as much as I did I was so

690
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,179
pumped when I saw this

691
00:25:54,179 --> 00:25:55,860
um there is hashes available on public

692
00:25:55,860 --> 00:25:57,539
sandboxes if you want to take a look at

693
00:25:57,539 --> 00:25:58,860
it yourself

694
00:25:58,860 --> 00:26:00,539
um for me I looked at this and like

695
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:02,100
what's the first thing everyone wants to

696
00:26:02,100 --> 00:26:04,559
click right I know what it is like I

697
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:06,120
want to talk to somebody live so we

698
00:26:06,120 --> 00:26:07,919
obviously we looked at that nothing fun

699
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:10,620
happened unfortunately but I do want you

700
00:26:10,620 --> 00:26:12,480
to know like it wasn't just like there

701
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:13,980
you could actually click on and it pops

702
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:16,320
up a chat panel we didn't we didn't get

703
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,539
anywhere with this

704
00:26:18,539 --> 00:26:20,580
um so up next we kind of went through

705
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:24,179
the whole interview guide or Duty uh if

706
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:26,100
you enjoy the misspelling there

707
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,360
um and again we were trying to navigate

708
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,799
through to kind of figure out what the

709
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:31,020
end goal was with online interview.exe

710
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:34,020
the the feedback from uh our team as we

711
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,820
were looking at this is wow this is

712
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,260
homemade

713
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,059
um so here's the prompt that we got with

714
00:26:39,059 --> 00:26:41,100
the credentials and this is about as far

715
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,020
as we got we did try to click around

716
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,120
some more and we got a couple error

717
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,640
messages uh like this one so one of the

718
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:50,059
things I failed to mention

719
00:26:50,059 --> 00:26:52,799
thank you that's that was our reaction

720
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,299
too one of the things that I failed to

721
00:26:54,299 --> 00:26:56,520
mention is apply talents and careers

722
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:58,919
finders both purported to be UK based

723
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:02,039
recruiting companies so one would assume

724
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:04,799
um that uh either there would be some QA

725
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:07,140
process with this online interview Tool

726
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:11,100
uh perhaps by uh somebody who would be

727
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:12,840
probably a native English speaker so

728
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,279
have not passed your technical Test

729
00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:16,440
please pass it first there's a lot going

730
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,520
on there

731
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,200
we're not going to go there

732
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,059
but yeah we really we really enjoyed

733
00:27:21,059 --> 00:27:23,279
looking at this okay so let's let's

734
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:25,440
switch gears a little bit and look at

735
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,320
some of the illustrious team behind

736
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,240
um this awesome tool

737
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,980
um and I pulled a quote from the careers

738
00:27:31,980 --> 00:27:33,720
finders website then I'm just going to

739
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:35,520
read because again we love this this is

740
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,159
a direct quote we'll help you find a job

741
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:41,279
that fulfill your desires uk-based

742
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:44,039
company so we would yeah

743
00:27:44,039 --> 00:27:46,320
I enjoyed it too a lot a little too much

744
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,080
I put it on the slides right okay

745
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,020
so I mentioned that the this uh yellow

746
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:55,799
Dev 13 runs a handful uh of personas

747
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,260
associated with their operations

748
00:27:58,260 --> 00:28:00,059
um and what we have seen with this group

749
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:02,460
is most of the images

750
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:05,159
um were uh were likely AI generated in

751
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:08,340
the case of Abigail Walker uh we think

752
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:09,900
it was a real woman whose images were

753
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:11,279
being used hence being blanked out

754
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,380
because they changed the profile image

755
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:15,900
over time uh Abigail Walker is not a

756
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,460
real person though and one of the things

757
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:19,799
I absolutely love about these personas

758
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:21,480
particularly the ones on LinkedIn is if

759
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:23,279
you actually look at them they make no

760
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,860
sense whatsoever so Abigail Walker is a

761
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,900
human resources information systems

762
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:30,720
consultant according to a job title

763
00:28:30,720 --> 00:28:32,820
um but if you look at her bio she's a

764
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:35,220
recruiter or a staffing expert that

765
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,740
doesn't make any sense uh the other

766
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:38,880
thing that we always look at when we're

767
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,500
looking at these profiles is how many

768
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,360
connections they have that gives us an

769
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:43,919
indication of how successful they might

770
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:45,000
have been with some of their social

771
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:47,159
engineering operations so in this case

772
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:50,400
Abigail 265 connection and still a

773
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,559
little scary all right then we've got

774
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,240
Brian Claire

775
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,980
um and I'm not going to point out the

776
00:28:55,980 --> 00:28:57,840
specifics of these AI generated images

777
00:28:57,840 --> 00:29:01,080
where we think that they are fake but I

778
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:02,940
will give you guys some Clues when you

779
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:06,179
start looking at these uh backgrounds

780
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:11,640
ears eyes glasses jewelry hair like some

781
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,740
of those are major towels with the AI

782
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:15,600
generated images

783
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,039
um so Brian

784
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,720
Brian

785
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,559
um

786
00:29:19,559 --> 00:29:21,840
Brian's great Brian's profile is great

787
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,640
too this is another just profile that

788
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,919
makes absolutely no sense so linkedin's

789
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:27,840
a professional Network we would assume

790
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:28,799
that people are on there for

791
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,600
professional reasons

792
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,320
um

793
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,659
we think Brian was probably purporting

794
00:29:33,659 --> 00:29:35,039
to be a recruiter even though his job

795
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:37,320
title suggests otherwise and if you want

796
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,760
to get in touch with Brian here's this

797
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:40,860
really sketchy Gmail account that you

798
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,419
can email

799
00:29:42,419 --> 00:29:44,399
doesn't make any sense he had a lot of

800
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:45,539
connections though which is a little

801
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:48,059
concerning and uh his profile was active

802
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:49,860
for a fair amount of time it is no

803
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:50,760
longer

804
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,760
okay so let's meet the team as they

805
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:57,539
purport to be on the actual websites

806
00:29:57,539 --> 00:29:59,940
themselves so this is literally a screen

807
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:02,640
grab from the apply talents website and

808
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,500
the careers finders website nothing's

809
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:07,440
modified here grainy image and all

810
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,600
um and again both of these

811
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:12,600
um apply talents was created first and

812
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:14,340
careers finder was created shortly

813
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:18,539
thereafter back in uh 2019.

814
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:20,580
so at first we've got the apply talents

815
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:23,820
Team Edward miles Scarlett Grant James

816
00:30:23,820 --> 00:30:25,380
Sharp and don't worry I'm going to show

817
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,779
the pictures a little bit more closely

818
00:30:26,779 --> 00:30:29,820
so we can enjoy what these actually look

819
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:33,419
like and then we've got

820
00:30:33,419 --> 00:30:35,340
Edward miles

821
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,460
Scarlett Grant

822
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:41,940
and James Sharp of careers finder same

823
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:45,120
names same order completely different

824
00:30:45,120 --> 00:30:47,460
people uh the other thing that was

825
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,899
similar on these websites is they had

826
00:30:48,899 --> 00:30:51,600
the same UK based phone number

827
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,940
all right so let's have a little fun and

828
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:56,760
drill in specifically to some of these

829
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,020
images

830
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,520
just so everyone can get a look remember

831
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,320
what I told you about looking at AI

832
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:02,820
generated people

833
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:04,740
so we've got Edward miles of Applied

834
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:07,620
talents and then Edward miles of careers

835
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,659
finder

836
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:12,000
now apply talents was created first I

837
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,919
think they clearly used a different AI

838
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,039
generated and I would say better uh

839
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,039
Imaging uh software or whatever they

840
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:22,260
decided to use for their personas for

841
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:25,100
careers finder

842
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,539
some of these are pretty good some of

843
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:29,760
these are pretty bad uh here's Scarlett

844
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:31,919
Grant of apply talents

845
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:34,140
and careers finder remember what I told

846
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:35,360
you

847
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,260
backgrounds

848
00:31:37,260 --> 00:31:39,779
sometimes the eyes the ears

849
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:41,580
hopefully people can see a couple funny

850
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:44,480
things with this one

851
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,620
all right we've got James Sharp of

852
00:31:49,620 --> 00:31:51,179
Applied talents

853
00:31:51,179 --> 00:31:53,880
and careers finder

854
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,340
I actually think James of careers finder

855
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,480
is pretty good you're going to see a

856
00:31:57,480 --> 00:31:58,919
watermark on the image that's from us

857
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:02,399
pulling the image from a VM uh not from

858
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:05,178
the image itself

859
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:09,000
I hope everyone has fun looking at these

860
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,580
okay so these are the fake people of um

861
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:13,080
the two recruiting companies I have a

862
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:15,059
couple more that were associated with

863
00:32:15,059 --> 00:32:18,360
yellow Dev 13 operations but uh not

864
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:19,919
necessarily the recruiting companies but

865
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:22,440
I think they're interesting examples if

866
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:23,760
you want to look at some more AI

867
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,960
generated humans

868
00:32:29,940 --> 00:32:31,799
hopefully people notice some things that

869
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:33,120
are like yeah that doesn't pass the

870
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:35,658
sniff test

871
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:40,860
great

872
00:32:40,860 --> 00:32:42,539
okay

873
00:32:42,539 --> 00:32:45,059
so let's let's round things out in

874
00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:47,520
keeping with the the HR theme uh and

875
00:32:47,520 --> 00:32:49,740
recruitment theme of this talk

876
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,899
um when we think about what we talked

877
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:54,779
about today from a network Defender uh

878
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:57,240
blue team red team perspective

879
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,520
um you know we can really kind of again

880
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:01,860
continue this theme of HR recruitment

881
00:33:01,860 --> 00:33:04,380
when we look at the ttps of the threat

882
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:06,240
actors particularly the ones we talked

883
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,679
about today this is really their CV

884
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,600
their skill set their resume like these

885
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,980
are all the things we can do and how

886
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:13,620
good we're at we are at it and then

887
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:16,919
we've got the targeting itself so

888
00:33:16,919 --> 00:33:17,519
um

889
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:20,399
that gives us the motivations uh gives

890
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:22,440
us an idea of like what they're out to

891
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:25,860
do uh we have threat actors that are

892
00:33:25,860 --> 00:33:28,380
Espionage focused and threat actors that

893
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,880
are financially focused that we talked

894
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,039
about today and then finally in the case

895
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:33,659
of these three groups that we've talked

896
00:33:33,659 --> 00:33:36,360
about they literally build networks of

897
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:38,399
people to help perform their operations

898
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:42,260
which is really really interesting

899
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,399
but finally let's like take these

900
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:46,980
takeaways up uh just a notch

901
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,720
um you know threat actors are

902
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,419
capitalizing on the great resignation so

903
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:53,820
yellow Dev 13 is a great example yes

904
00:33:53,820 --> 00:33:56,640
they were active since 2019 but what we

905
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:58,140
saw over the course of the last three

906
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,120
years is they updated their site

907
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,220
particularly apply talents to kind of

908
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,860
roll with the climate in terms of hiring

909
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:06,600
so right now the site has a lot of

910
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:10,080
covid-19 themed uh Pages it's also got a

911
00:34:10,080 --> 00:34:13,260
whole page for how to hold page on uh

912
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:15,599
remote work so threat actors are paying

913
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,000
attention to what's uh what's happening

914
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,040
and pivoting accordingly uh 2. social

915
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,739
engineering still works I know we're

916
00:34:25,739 --> 00:34:27,599
super tired of talking about it but

917
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:30,300
we're seeing it evolve so again like

918
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:32,099
with the personas that we're seeing use

919
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:33,780
and the way that threat actors are

920
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:35,879
approaching uh our employees they're

921
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:38,520
reaching out on on WhatsApp on LinkedIn

922
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:41,580
uh on on other mediums they're using AI

923
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:44,040
generated images to make their personas

924
00:34:44,040 --> 00:34:45,839
look more legitimate we're going to

925
00:34:45,839 --> 00:34:48,300
continue to see an evolution uh not just

926
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,859
in how they approach but how they

927
00:34:49,859 --> 00:34:52,800
deliver so Microsoft did uh disable

928
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,080
internet macros on things going forward

929
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:57,060
that's awesome we're going to see threat

930
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,560
actor shift in terms of how they deliver

931
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:00,240
malware though in these fishing

932
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,500
exercises

933
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,960
and and then finally

934
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:05,820
um you know how do we defend against

935
00:35:05,820 --> 00:35:08,640
this sort of stuff when we don't own our

936
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,760
employees social media profile so as we

937
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:12,900
saw

938
00:35:12,900 --> 00:35:14,520
um you know these people are or the

939
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:16,200
threat actors are reaching out to people

940
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:19,440
on things that we just don't control and

941
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:21,300
and I kind of challenge the people in

942
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,500
this room to think about your

943
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,500
organizational security culture well are

944
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,900
your employees empowered or do you have

945
00:35:27,900 --> 00:35:29,820
a culture where they can come to you and

946
00:35:29,820 --> 00:35:32,700
say hey I think I've been fished by a

947
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:34,560
fake recruiter I mean I I personally

948
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,480
don't know many many employees who'd be

949
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:37,740
comfortable going and saying hey I'm

950
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,660
looking for another job and I think I

951
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:42,780
got socially engineered

952
00:35:42,780 --> 00:35:44,760
all right so with that I think we have

953
00:35:44,760 --> 00:35:47,820
about three minutes for for talks or we

954
00:35:47,820 --> 00:35:49,260
can kind of move to the the speaker

955
00:35:49,260 --> 00:35:52,560
Breakaway room we do have um a GitHub

956
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:55,140
page that we have published this morning

957
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,760
did we do it right before the talk we

958
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,560
did it today that has all of the

959
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,119
indicators that we talked about today

960
00:36:00,119 --> 00:36:01,800
and again the slides will be available

961
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,079
uh tomorrow morning

962
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:06,599
yep the GitHub link will also be in the

963
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:08,160
reference lights when they're published

964
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:11,730
more so no prepped on that

965
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:14,840
[Music]

966
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,770
