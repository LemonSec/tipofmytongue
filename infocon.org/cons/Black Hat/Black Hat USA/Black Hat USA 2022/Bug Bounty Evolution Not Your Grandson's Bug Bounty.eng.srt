2
00:00:07,580 --> 00:00:10,800
okay thank you all for coming thank you

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,500
so much can I ask you a huge favor this

4
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,039
is my first in-person presentation in

5
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:19,260
over two years and I want to see your

6
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:21,539
faces if you could all just get up and

7
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,400
move closer to me that would make me

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:25,560
feel a lot better because it's been a

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:26,820
long time since we've all been together

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:28,980
and I do want to see your smiling faces

11
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:32,040
up close so please do come in and fill

12
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:34,200
in now I apologize for us getting

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,600
started a little late as if we are here

14
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:38,460
at a hacker conference

15
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,140
I guess it's a professional hacker

16
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,540
conference but we're going to cover a

17
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,340
bunch of things that have been dear to

18
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:46,739
my heart important to me not just bug

19
00:00:46,739 --> 00:00:49,379
bounties but a little bit of Labor

20
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,780
rights a little bit of capitalism a

21
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,219
little bit of the way that we treat each

22
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,800
other so I'm thanking you for being on

23
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,719
this journey with me and let's get

24
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,660
started so this is not your grandson's

25
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:02,879
bug bounty

26
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,860
they said the clicker would work they

27
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,960
told me the clicker would work they

28
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,400
promised this clicker would work and

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,619
apparently it does not work all right

30
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:13,500
we'll just have to do it this way so how

31
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,840
do most people spend their lives there's

32
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:18,180
a lot of time sleeping it turns out and

33
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,979
plenty of time working and you have to

34
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:23,580
cram in everything else fun eating sex

35
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:26,159
everything Hobbies into the rest of the

36
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,720
time you have left

37
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:29,340
hackers spend their time a little bit

38
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:31,439
differently I don't know this is

39
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,080
allegorical experience but essentially

40
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,299
we spend very little time sleeping and

41
00:01:36,299 --> 00:01:39,299
doing everything else versus hacking and

42
00:01:39,299 --> 00:01:41,100
I've been a hacker my whole life my mom

43
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,780
had to remove all the screwdrivers from

44
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:44,759
my house and I figured out butter knives

45
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,860
work just as well so I'm always looking

46
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,720
for creative ideas to problem or

47
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,700
creative ways to solve problems and new

48
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,840
ideas

49
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,000
so how many of you are familiar with the

50
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,520
parable of the long spoons

51
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,439
okay I'm going to tell you the parable

52
00:01:58,439 --> 00:02:00,360
of the long spoon so the setup is what

53
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:03,840
you see there it is a table that is too

54
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,820
large to reach the food in the middle

55
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:08,098
but everybody has long spoons so they

56
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:10,500
can reach the food but when they try to

57
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,080
feed themselves hilarity and tragedy

58
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,940
ensues and people are miserable and

59
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,860
starving so what does this have to do

60
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,959
with System Dynamics well some of you

61
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:20,819
who are familiar with my previous work

62
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:24,000
and research know that we live in

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,860
complex systems think of it like the

64
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,780
butterfly effect a little effect here

65
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,480
has a profound effect elsewhere and when

66
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,420
I first became accustomed to looking at

67
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,099
things from a System Dynamics

68
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:37,680
perspective it was to try to answer the

69
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,319
question should we just outbid the black

70
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:42,780
market on bugs right would that be a

71
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:44,879
viable strategy this question was first

72
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,459
posed to me in the form that I

73
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:49,200
understood it in as it applied to our

74
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:51,420
industry and Bug bounties by Dan gear

75
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:54,000
when he gave a keynote speech so one of

76
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,739
the things that I had done with research

77
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:57,300
colleagues was looked at the System

78
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,099
Dynamics of the vulnerability economy

79
00:02:59,099 --> 00:03:01,620
and exploit market and tried to answer

80
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,900
that question could you just pay higher

81
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,720
prices and outbid the offense Market is

82
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,459
what I like to call it because Black

83
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:10,500
Market implies a lot of things that are

84
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:12,959
not cool but also it implies that it's

85
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,420
illegal the offense Market is not

86
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,819
illegal and there are reasons why it

87
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:19,379
shouldn't be illegal but I could go into

88
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:21,180
that during q a if you're really curious

89
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,280
however we did answer the question

90
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,340
during our research of whether or not it

91
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:29,400
made sense to try and buy out the

92
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,140
vulnerability Market by raising prices

93
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,900
and it turned out that lever was the

94
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,519
least efficient lever

95
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,360
to tipping the balance from defense or

96
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:41,940
from offense to defense

97
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,040
the lever that was the most effective

98
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,200
that we found wasn't price

99
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,500
it was actually whether or not you could

100
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,099
close the tooling Gap in not identifying

101
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,659
vulnerabilities but identifying

102
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:56,099
exploitability

103
00:03:56,099 --> 00:03:58,500
because lots of the tools are similar

104
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,200
however the exploitability will

105
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,659
determine one its value to the offense

106
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:06,540
market and two the urgency of the

107
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,000
defense Market to try and fix it

108
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,319
so let's go into the Talk itself oh now

109
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:16,019
the clicker works but it works backwards

110
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:17,820
hold on

111
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:19,680
all right backwards is better than not

112
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,660
working at all

113
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:24,180
so what are we going to cover in this

114
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,919
briefing we're going to talk about some

115
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,020
of the problems that I've seen occurring

116
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,720
over the last decade of modern bug

117
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,699
bounties we'll go into a brief history

118
00:04:32,699 --> 00:04:35,759
of bug bounties exploitation of Labor

119
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,280
and a few bugs what hackers and

120
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:40,320
organizations deserve in terms of better

121
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,940
outcomes on both sides of this

122
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:44,220
Marketplace and some ideas for what's

123
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:46,620
next for hackers for organizations and

124
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,960
the security industry as a whole we also

125
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,600
have a surprise announcement to make and

126
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,120
we'll wrap it all up by telling you the

127
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,060
punch line of the long spoon story

128
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,180
foreign so what is the problem that

129
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:02,460
we've been observing you know I'm a big

130
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,259
believer in bug bounties I like bug

131
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:06,720
bounties and I cannot lie but the fact

132
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,400
is they have not delivered on their

133
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,020
great promise

134
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:12,540
we wanted them to have revolutionary

135
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,840
Security benefits we wanted to keep

136
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,660
hackers out of jail and get them paid

137
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:21,900
but ideally a consistent livable wage

138
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,539
and we also wanted to help build the

139
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:27,720
Cyber Workforce pipeline of tomorrow

140
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:30,120
and unfortunately it hasn't delivered on

141
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:32,280
all these promises but I think there's

142
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:33,180
still hope

143
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:35,880
because why we know why there isn't one

144
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,580
size that fits all and the key here is

145
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,100
organizational maturity you know you can

146
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:43,500
tell an organization all you want about

147
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:45,360
their security vulnerabilities but if

148
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:47,400
they don't have the capacity to fix them

149
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:50,220
and fix them consistently they will

150
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:52,440
always be falling behind and other

151
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:55,080
priorities will always take more

152
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,139
precedence than the security priorities

153
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:01,320
so what we really need to do is organize

154
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,840
around the evolving maturity of each

155
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,060
side of this Marketplace and think of it

156
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,220
in terms of System Dynamics

157
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,979
so let's talk about some solutions this

158
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:14,460
talk is going to probably lend itself to

159
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:16,979
some interesting questions I will try to

160
00:06:16,979 --> 00:06:18,539
leave time for questions at the end but

161
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:19,979
we did get a little bit of a late start

162
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,740
so I'll do my best

163
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,259
okay what's happened so far in bug

164
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,539
bounties well everybody knows that they

165
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:30,240
didn't start with half the Pentagon they

166
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,340
started actually many many years earlier

167
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:34,740
with a concept from Don knuth when he

168
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:36,720
published his book and he would pay out

169
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,020
one hexadecimal dollar for any kind of

170
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:42,720
error that was in that book so it wasn't

171
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,520
strictly about software bugs it was

172
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:46,199
about any kind of bug it could be an

173
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:48,479
editorial issue or a typo

174
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,780
and then in 1995 Mozilla came out with a

175
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,720
500 bug Bounty for security bugs and

176
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:56,819
that was sort of one of the first true

177
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:59,880
security bug bounties nothing was really

178
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,919
happening under the bug Bounty Sun until

179
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,100
Google resurrected this idea in order to

180
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,199
Bounty they're brand new at the time

181
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:10,500
Chrome browser and it made perfect sense

182
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:12,720
for them to do so why they didn't have a

183
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:15,180
legacy code base to support they wanted

184
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,819
to try and surface as many bugs in a

185
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:19,199
shorter period of time while they were

186
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,199
still building Chrome as possible and so

187
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:23,880
it was very low risk for them to not

188
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:26,280
only offer a bug Bounty but make it

189
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,319
almost three times higher than the going

190
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,780
rate of bug bounties at the time that

191
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,940
same year in 2010 they raised the prices

192
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:34,259
yet again

193
00:07:34,259 --> 00:07:36,599
to over three thousand dollars so

194
00:07:36,599 --> 00:07:39,479
suddenly this question of can we outbid

195
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:41,580
the black market the offense Market

196
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:44,819
suddenly became much more viable and

197
00:07:44,819 --> 00:07:46,380
everybody started asking me who was

198
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,599
working at Microsoft at the time when is

199
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:50,639
Microsoft going to start paying for bugs

200
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,060
well unfortunately the VPS and

201
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,039
Executives at Microsoft at the time had

202
00:07:56,039 --> 00:07:58,080
sworn publicly that they would never

203
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,419
ever pay for vulnerabilities now there's

204
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:02,819
a good reason for that at the time

205
00:08:02,819 --> 00:08:04,800
um back then and even now they are still

206
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:06,479
the largest intake funnel of

207
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,039
vulnerability reports in the world

208
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:10,020
probably in the world combined quite

209
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:13,979
frankly they receive over 250 000 to 300

210
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:16,440
000 non-spam email messages a year of

211
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,880
people trying to report vulnerabilities

212
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,280
to Microsoft for free so why would you

213
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,379
dangle cash in front of a fire hose like

214
00:08:22,379 --> 00:08:25,800
that right they had no idea that there

215
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,479
were ways in which we could structure

216
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:29,699
the bug bounties to make it beneficial

217
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:31,740
for both sides so when I created

218
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:34,559
Microsoft's bug Bounties in 2013 we

219
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,240
launched not just with the highest bug

220
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:39,240
Bounty of any industry uh vendor in the

221
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:41,339
world at the time we launched with

222
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:43,979
specific strategic security goals and

223
00:08:43,979 --> 00:08:45,959
outcomes in mind we were already getting

224
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:48,540
bugs for free so we started looking at

225
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,880
when we were getting those bugs we got

226
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,279
some of those bugs after the beta period

227
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,980
of products were over why because the

228
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,140
only thing a hacker could get was 10

229
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,959
point aerial font their name Credit in a

230
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,600
bulletin so in fortunately they would

231
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,399
hold on to their vulnerabilities during

232
00:09:05,399 --> 00:09:07,800
the entire beta period the best time to

233
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,899
receive vulnerability reports and they

234
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:12,360
would spike with us with a huge Deluge

235
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:15,060
of cases right after the product was out

236
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:17,700
of beta so what I suggested to the IE

237
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,860
team at the time rest in peace Internet

238
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,080
Explorer you're a wonderful tool to

239
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,640
download Chrome

240
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,540
um

241
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:28,019
but what I told to the uh the

242
00:09:28,019 --> 00:09:31,680
head of IE at the time was look you can

243
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:34,640
align your engineering bug fixing effort

244
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:37,980
with the security discovery of bug

245
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,320
hunters in the world if you just put a

246
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,940
bug Bounty at the beginning of the beta

247
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:44,760
period we can shift the traffic to the

248
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,339
best time for both both sides they get

249
00:09:47,339 --> 00:09:48,899
credit they get a little bit of money

250
00:09:48,899 --> 00:09:51,000
and you get the bugs at the earliest

251
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,760
time possible to maximize the number of

252
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:55,380
bugs that you're fixing

253
00:09:55,380 --> 00:09:58,680
we absolutely reverse the trend and that

254
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:01,260
was one of the key things that took bug

255
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:03,899
bounties into the Modern Age the hundred

256
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:05,339
thousand dollar bug Bounty went to my

257
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:06,959
friend James Forshaw and that was also

258
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:08,820
unique in the at the time in the

259
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:10,620
industry it wasn't just looking for

260
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:13,140
proof of concept latest exploit it was

261
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,700
looking for a brand new exploitation

262
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,740
technique because those are the things

263
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:18,600
that would take the platform the longest

264
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:20,580
to adapt to

265
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:24,540
so after that it seemed that some bug

266
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:26,040
Bounty platforms that had been around

267
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,279
for a couple of years suddenly had a

268
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:31,920
viable market so after the Microsoft bug

269
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,100
Bounty launched in 2013 that's when we

270
00:10:35,100 --> 00:10:37,800
saw the series a Investments coming into

271
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:40,440
the bug Bounty platform so that was when

272
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,720
they got their big boost big pushes and

273
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,459
that's when I joined one of them with

274
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:46,260
the great hope that we were going to be

275
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,779
addressing all of these problems that we

276
00:10:48,779 --> 00:10:49,800
were seeing

277
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,000
so

278
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,540
I had been invited to a guest lecture at

279
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,519
Harvard Kennedy School MIT Sloan School

280
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:58,740
in that audience was my friend Michael

281
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:01,920
solmire who at the time was head of

282
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,899
cyber security policy for the office of

283
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:05,399
the Secretary of Defense

284
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:08,040
I was asked to brief the Pentagon fast

285
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:11,040
forward two years later we launched not

286
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,680
only the very first bug Bounty program

287
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,899
of the U.S government but we launched

288
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:17,700
the very first program where the US

289
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,800
government was actually inviting to

290
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,360
engage directly with the hacker

291
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:24,260
community on finding bugs in its systems

292
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:27,959
that was a Monumental point in time and

293
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,180
after that in the years since

294
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:33,000
we've seen so many organizations jump on

295
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,519
the bug Bounty wagon but so many before

296
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,800
they're ready so many before they have

297
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,959
ironed out the internal processes needed

298
00:11:39,959 --> 00:11:43,940
to actually fix the vulnerabilities

299
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:46,320
so I don't know how many of you follow

300
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,420
me on Twitter but the other day I

301
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:50,160
decided to take my life in my hands and

302
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,360
say yes to the driverless ride from Lyft

303
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:57,660
and uh I took a couple photos but I was

304
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:59,820
expecting like a car to show up with no

305
00:11:59,820 --> 00:12:02,339
people in it there were two people in it

306
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:04,980
the driver and the Observer to help the

307
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,380
the whole experience along so what's

308
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:09,300
funny about the bug Bounty platforms now

309
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,399
is that you see them investing more and

310
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:15,180
more in additional bug Discovery through

311
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:18,360
AIML Etc and what I'm telling you here

312
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:20,820
is that not only you know our driverless

313
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:23,279
vehicle is pretty far from being useful

314
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:26,100
and truly driverless we are still in

315
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:28,260
that state as well so if you're looking

316
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,360
to Ai and machine learning to help you

317
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,220
through some of these process problems

318
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,860
look no further than the human being who

319
00:12:34,860 --> 00:12:37,560
you actually need to train to do this

320
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,420
work

321
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,100
so what are the three most common things

322
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:43,260
that we've found and we've observed over

323
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:46,320
the course of watching bug bounties and

324
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,720
Bone disclosure programs grow up in this

325
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:51,060
industry so the vulnerability

326
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,100
coordination maturity model is a free

327
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,380
framework that I developed based on

328
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,019
observation of five capability areas

329
00:12:58,019 --> 00:13:01,560
that were key to understanding where are

330
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,360
the weak points what are the basic

331
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,459
minimum capabilities in each of these

332
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:09,959
areas in order to survive a constant

333
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:12,240
influx of vulnerabilities whose

334
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,160
disclosure you may not necessarily be

335
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,040
able to choose right it's an it's an

336
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,620
unsteady and semi-unpredictable workflow

337
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,320
and to handle it you have to have

338
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:25,940
capabilities in these areas

339
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,740
so what have we observed about what are

340
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,779
the most important capabilities the key

341
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:33,000
predictors of success or failure of

342
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,980
these bug Bounty programs well

343
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,839
organizational commitment you have to

344
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:39,240
commit to fixing the bugs

345
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,980
you would not believe how many

346
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,800
organizations we see that are performing

347
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,019
what I call Bug Bounty Botox right they

348
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:48,120
launch a bug Bounty and it might even be

349
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,040
in private mode and they check a box

350
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,320
saying they have one and they literally

351
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,399
use the platform terms of non-disclosure

352
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,920
to lock all those bugs away they might

353
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:01,019
pay for them but they're not fixing them

354
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:03,180
right so there's no organizational

355
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,360
commitment at that level to actually fix

356
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,940
the bugs what does that come down to

357
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,260
does that come down to just more

358
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,079
Engineers well you know Microsoft has a

359
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:15,300
few Engineers I would say but every

360
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:17,639
second Tuesday of the month we can see

361
00:14:17,639 --> 00:14:19,500
that more Engineers doesn't make it so

362
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,839
that you have no bugs or fewer bugs

363
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:25,680
there are process pieces roles and

364
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,019
duties and even some tools internally

365
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:30,480
that are missing and it's not just about

366
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,579
the security development life cycle it's

367
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:34,680
actually about processing the

368
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,200
vulnerability reports using the metrics

369
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:38,940
that you get from running these programs

370
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,579
and having that shape your intelligence

371
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:44,339
of just not just response but of how

372
00:14:44,339 --> 00:14:45,420
you're going to make your security

373
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:47,639
investments in the future

374
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:49,920
and what I've noticed so last year I

375
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:52,079
hacked Clubhouse I didn't mean to it was

376
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,320
a accident totally accidents happen and

377
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:57,120
what happened was I tried to report a

378
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,320
vulnerability it took me a couple of

379
00:14:58,320 --> 00:14:59,940
weeks even to find the right point of

380
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:02,100
contact and they weren't responding to

381
00:15:02,100 --> 00:15:04,079
me even when I did until I had to send

382
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,540
them a video of myself presenting the

383
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,399
five stages of vulnerability response

384
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,540
grief

385
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,160
um so that they could kind of get over

386
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,680
the denial the anger you know the

387
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,660
bargaining Etc and get to acceptance so

388
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:17,339
that we could work together I also had

389
00:15:17,339 --> 00:15:18,660
to send them a video of me walking

390
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,279
through the international standards for

391
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:21,839
vulnerability disclosure and

392
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,880
vulnerability handling processes explain

393
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,220
I was a co-author and co-editor and that

394
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,899
I was going to drop Oda on them if they

395
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:29,100
didn't respond

396
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,160
so you shouldn't have to threaten to

397
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:34,380
just publicly disclose and you certainly

398
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,180
shouldn't have to be one of the two

399
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:38,160
co-editors of the ISO standards on how

400
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:39,720
to do this to get an organization's

401
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,760
attention and what I found out when I

402
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,079
tried to report these vulnerabilities to

403
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:46,139
clubhouse was that they had a bug bounty

404
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:48,660
it was Private they tried to get me to

405
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,399
report through that bug bunny platform

406
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,639
to which I refused why because I don't

407
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:56,160
accept the disclosure terms that would

408
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,459
require me to keep silent if they don't

409
00:15:59,459 --> 00:16:01,320
fix it so I just explained to them no

410
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:03,959
we're going to stay an email and you

411
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:05,699
know I'm going to give you you know a

412
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:07,260
reasonable amount of time to fix it

413
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:10,440
happy to test your fixes but we are you

414
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:11,820
know unless you have an engineering

415
00:16:11,820 --> 00:16:14,760
reason to delay I will I will disclose

416
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,920
this to the public because the clubhouse

417
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:19,260
vulnerabilities I found were where you

418
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:22,740
could basically end up being a silent

419
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:26,399
listener or disrupter with no way to

420
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,260
kick you out even with by the moderators

421
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,420
because you were invisible I called it

422
00:16:30,420 --> 00:16:32,720
Banshee bombing for the noisy ghost

423
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:36,899
version and uh you know and and

424
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:39,120
um I called it something else reasonable

425
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,680
oh Poltergeist something like that

426
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:42,899
anyway the point is

427
00:16:42,899 --> 00:16:45,779
I tried to tell them they had a flawed

428
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:48,000
intake process they tried to shuffle me

429
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,279
off into a bounty program a bounty

430
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:51,600
platform that would have forced

431
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,980
non-disclosure

432
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:56,339
and in fact when I finally talked to one

433
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:58,320
human it was one of the founders and I

434
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,120
asked him you know why did this bug

435
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,800
exist in the first place you know this

436
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,660
was kind of a basic session in

437
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:06,119
validation issue you should have come up

438
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:08,699
in your testing and you know it's it's

439
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:10,380
clear you're missing some pieces in your

440
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,599
security development life cycle

441
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,699
and he said no we're building it

442
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:16,799
securely and we have this bug Bounty

443
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,599
program and I said you know how many

444
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,760
security people do you have and he said

445
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,619
well it's it's actually it's me who's

446
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:23,640
handling it this was one of the

447
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,980
co-founders of Clubhouse

448
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:29,340
so there they were a unicorn valuated

449
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,080
company that at the time was being

450
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,140
entertained to be bought by Twitter for

451
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,940
four billion dollars was the number that

452
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,679
was floating around

453
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:39,780
and I also found out they had fewer

454
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,059
employees at that company than I have at

455
00:17:42,059 --> 00:17:45,240
my company so that's the kind of

456
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:48,179
audience that we've got all excited to

457
00:17:48,179 --> 00:17:49,980
start bug bounties but they're using

458
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:52,559
them inconsistently they're lacking some

459
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,600
of the basic capability areas and in

460
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:56,280
some instances they're just lacking the

461
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:58,380
humans

462
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:02,039
now let's talk about how the gig economy

463
00:18:02,039 --> 00:18:04,740
exploits labor

464
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:07,200
when I was at Microsoft of course we

465
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,840
performed labor law checks not just with

466
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,820
Microsoft lawyers but with outside

467
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:14,100
counsel and it was determined that bug

468
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:16,440
Bounties in fact do violate labor laws

469
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,840
but that it was relatively low risk that

470
00:18:18,840 --> 00:18:22,080
a class-action lawsuit would occur

471
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,840
fast forward the gig economy has become

472
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,020
famous with Rideshare apps delivery apps

473
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:28,919
Etc

474
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:32,100
and those companies have spent a ton of

475
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:35,760
money lobbying against Fair Labor

476
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,460
practices in their area

477
00:18:38,460 --> 00:18:41,400
one thing I want to caution our industry

478
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,179
with is that if we don't come up with

479
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:47,640
different and better ways to engage with

480
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,220
gig labor that is more fair

481
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:53,760
our industry will capitulate to the same

482
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:57,240
forces that are successfully driving the

483
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,660
decreasing labor rights across delivery

484
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,740
drivers

485
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:04,860
across Rideshare drivers and all the

486
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,080
other areas of the gig economy

487
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:09,900
so why did I start a bug Bounty program

488
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,580
if it violates labor laws and I care

489
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,860
about Labor well because the way that we

490
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:16,020
were structuring these they were still

491
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:18,059
win-win for everyone

492
00:19:18,059 --> 00:19:20,880
right we were doing things in a way that

493
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:23,400
there were very few bug collisions right

494
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:26,160
so the problem with bug Bounties in that

495
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,080
you can find the exact same bug as

496
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:29,460
someone else but if you're not the first

497
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,140
to report it you get zero that's

498
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:33,539
definitely worse than a lift or an Uber

499
00:19:33,539 --> 00:19:35,820
ride right at least when they accept a

500
00:19:35,820 --> 00:19:37,320
ride and they do the work they will get

501
00:19:37,320 --> 00:19:40,679
paid not so with bug bounty hunters

502
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,980
so we had a way of structuring these

503
00:19:43,980 --> 00:19:46,320
things and we had a problem set that

504
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,660
didn't lend itself to so many of the

505
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:51,960
exploity areas of exploiting people more

506
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:54,720
exploiting bugs so in the industry writ

507
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,880
large is it worth it though right are

508
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,320
people getting enough of what they need

509
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,840
out of this this economy to make it

510
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,340
worth it because bug bounties are making

511
00:20:02,340 --> 00:20:03,780
us more secure

512
00:20:03,780 --> 00:20:06,600
well not so much so how many of you

513
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,179
heard about a big coinbase bug Bounty

514
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:10,200
payout

515
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,760
there's like a quarter million dollars

516
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,679
coming out of coinbase this happened

517
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,559
earlier this year that's a lot of money

518
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,020
must have been a big bug

519
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:21,059
it was an API with no authentication

520
00:20:21,059 --> 00:20:23,820
that was reported right

521
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:28,799
so why would they spend 250 000 on a

522
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:31,380
very obvious class of bug that should

523
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,240
have been prevented elsewhere

524
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,340
and why are we not noticing as an

525
00:20:35,340 --> 00:20:38,340
industry that these basic bugs are the

526
00:20:38,340 --> 00:20:39,900
ones that are getting higher and higher

527
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:41,940
payouts as a whole

528
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:44,400
a lot of security theater going on

529
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:48,360
so while bug bounties have a lot of good

530
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,520
energy right I can't thank the bug

531
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:52,620
Bounty platforms enough for the fact

532
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:55,080
that they've made it easy for us to

533
00:20:55,080 --> 00:20:57,780
explain the benefit of a well done bug

534
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,179
Bounty I can't thank them enough for

535
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:02,700
having gotten so many hackers involved

536
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,559
in thinking that they might be able to

537
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,080
make a living this way but this great

538
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,660
strength and this reach

539
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,760
is really leading us to a dark side

540
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,900
without discipline

541
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,260
so

542
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:21,240
the numbers of bugs that are being

543
00:21:21,240 --> 00:21:24,000
reported keep increasing we're seeing

544
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,940
more and more duplicates being reported

545
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:29,039
because the low-hanging fruit is not

546
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,659
being taken care of appropriately

547
00:21:30,659 --> 00:21:32,820
internally

548
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,460
bug Bounty programs themselves by

549
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,760
themselves cannot fix an organization's

550
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:41,340
lack of commitment or lack of security

551
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,440
people who are in specialized roles

552
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,020
these are not the developers who wrote

553
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,179
The Buggy code in the first place you

554
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:50,340
can't just solve this with adding more

555
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:52,020
Developers

556
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:54,720
there are security processes that are

557
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,460
specific to what I call the internal

558
00:21:56,460 --> 00:21:58,980
digestive system of bugs you get bug

559
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,419
indigestion with a lot of these bug

560
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:02,400
Bounty programs

561
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,559
so what's next

562
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,960
There Is A Better Way Forward for the

563
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:09,120
labor market for better security

564
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:11,640
outcomes and we will be announcing a

565
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,380
bounty as well

566
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:15,360
so I'm going to give you some news you

567
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,220
can use right away

568
00:22:17,220 --> 00:22:19,620
first of all I've complained about the

569
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:23,039
bug Bounty platforms requiring ndas I do

570
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,140
not believe that bug bounties should

571
00:22:25,140 --> 00:22:27,960
require an NDA why because they're just

572
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,640
a paid thank you

573
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:32,100
on top of a vulnerability disclosure

574
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,179
process

575
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:36,419
why would I ever sign an NDA for the

576
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:38,039
privilege of telling you what's wrong

577
00:22:38,039 --> 00:22:41,220
with you that's insane right

578
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:44,039
but it's a fair contract if it's a

579
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:45,480
penetration test

580
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:48,360
so how do we hybridize these models in

581
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,520
the work that we do to make it win-win

582
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:53,039
for both sides of the equation

583
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:54,720
when I joined Microsoft there was a

584
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,360
program already in place called Tango so

585
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,179
we do still call it Tango today in in

586
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:02,580
our work and what that means is you know

587
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,460
Tango is an intimate dance one-on-one

588
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,140
and what it means is getting an

589
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:09,000
individual researcher under penetration

590
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:11,940
testing contract to perhaps explore a

591
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:14,700
certain class of vulnerabilities or

592
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,159
deliver you know on an ongoing basis

593
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:19,200
anything that they find under contract

594
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,600
that is a fair use

595
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,659
of an NDA because the researcher is

596
00:23:24,659 --> 00:23:26,400
definitely getting paid

597
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,919
now you begin to think well they get

598
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:31,020
paid even if they find nothing not the

599
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:33,059
way that we've been implementing them so

600
00:23:33,059 --> 00:23:35,280
let the duplicates be your guide

601
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,200
any of you running bug Bounty programs

602
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,419
and have a researcher submit one bug get

603
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:42,659
paid and then submit a similar bug a

604
00:23:42,659 --> 00:23:44,700
duplicate but on a different endpoint

605
00:23:44,700 --> 00:23:48,299
raise your hands yes so we look at those

606
00:23:48,299 --> 00:23:51,000
kinds of cases and it seems very obvious

607
00:23:51,000 --> 00:23:52,799
to us that this researcher has a

608
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:55,140
methodology perhaps even a tool that

609
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:57,360
they could actually point and and

610
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,179
identify all the instances of that same

611
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:02,520
vulnerability on different endpoints so

612
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,320
we reach out to them and we ask them are

613
00:24:04,320 --> 00:24:06,480
you open to a limited time-bound pen

614
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:09,480
testing contract simply to enumerate all

615
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,880
of the instances of that bug on all the

616
00:24:11,880 --> 00:24:13,559
endpoints you can find

617
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:16,020
now while they may make less in theory

618
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:18,059
than if they got paid out individually

619
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:20,039
for each one most bug Bounty programs

620
00:24:20,039 --> 00:24:21,840
will not pay out individually for each

621
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,740
one

622
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,960
at best they'll pay you know maybe the

623
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:26,640
first couple and then after that just

624
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,380
say the rest of them are duplicates

625
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:30,659
we're not going to pay you anymore

626
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:32,880
there's also no matter of when does the

627
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:35,340
hacker get paid so this solves a few

628
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:37,440
problems right

629
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,240
both sides of the marketplace benefit

630
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:41,520
both sides walk away getting what they

631
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:43,620
need and what they want

632
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,500
so yeah why not both by the way that

633
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:50,340
Meme that is the grown-up actual actress

634
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,500
um in that Meme and so what I'm saying

635
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:55,380
here is that this part of the industry

636
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,419
definitely needs to grow up it's always

637
00:24:57,419 --> 00:25:00,539
been a false dichotomy of saying that

638
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:03,179
the you could only have

639
00:25:03,179 --> 00:25:05,820
many eyes working on the problem if you

640
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:08,340
do it bug Bounty wise or you can only

641
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:11,520
have a safe bug bounty to run if you

642
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,440
impose ndas

643
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,299
well I think that there's a hybrid model

644
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:18,780
we've made it work and every party has

645
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:21,120
walked away happier

646
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:23,640
with more predictable results with more

647
00:25:23,640 --> 00:25:26,159
efficient results on both sides

648
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:27,840
and this is something that you know

649
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:30,240
honestly we should be doing across the

650
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:31,020
board

651
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,120
so here's some more news you can use

652
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:35,640
right now most organizations cannot

653
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:37,740
count when we go in and we ask them and

654
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,240
we're doing a vulnerability coordination

655
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:40,980
maturity model assessment rolls off the

656
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:43,500
tongue when we're doing this they can't

657
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:44,940
count we ask them how many security

658
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,980
vulnerabilities they have

659
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,960
they're sort of saying well we have this

660
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:51,240
many you know bug crowd cases or hacker

661
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,340
One cases and I'm like right so how many

662
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:55,740
of those identified one root cause how

663
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:58,200
many of those are you know uh had to be

664
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,539
reopened you know Etc they find that

665
00:26:00,539 --> 00:26:02,340
when we ask them these what seemed like

666
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,799
basic metrics questions they haven't

667
00:26:04,799 --> 00:26:07,980
been counting they've just been chasing

668
00:26:07,980 --> 00:26:09,299
fixes

669
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:11,340
right so metrics that you should be

670
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,440
thinking about whether you are thinking

671
00:26:13,440 --> 00:26:14,700
about starting a vault disclosure

672
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:16,320
program or bug Bounty or you're already

673
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,299
running one start looking at your mean

674
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:20,460
time to repair how long does it take you

675
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,679
to fix critical cases on average and the

676
00:26:22,679 --> 00:26:25,380
lower severity cases how many duplicates

677
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:27,120
now bug Bounty platforms will tell you

678
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,220
the overall duplicate rate

679
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:32,220
they will not tell you necessarily the

680
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:34,320
per bug duplicate rate

681
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,539
why does that matter why does that

682
00:26:36,539 --> 00:26:37,919
matter to us

683
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:41,580
because how many individual finders are

684
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:45,120
able to identify the same exact bug

685
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:47,159
should tell you how discoverable it is

686
00:26:47,159 --> 00:26:49,860
and potentially how exploitable it is

687
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:53,100
so let's say it's a low severity bug

688
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,440
but so many researchers are reporting it

689
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,039
that should increase your urgency to fix

690
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:01,020
that bug that should change

691
00:27:01,020 --> 00:27:03,360
your response time

692
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,020
that should put the relevant criticality

693
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:09,299
of getting that work done in

694
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:11,820
context-aware perspective

695
00:27:11,820 --> 00:27:13,980
this is something again that the bug

696
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,600
Bounty service providers and the

697
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,880
platforms are not doing right now

698
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,580
which is why organizations and

699
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:23,279
governments keep coming to us to have

700
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:26,279
them untangle this and figure out how

701
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:28,020
can we be more efficient and stop

702
00:27:28,020 --> 00:27:30,419
chasing whack-a-bug

703
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:32,460
so other useful metrics that you should

704
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,500
think about how often in your

705
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:36,539
organization are cases having to be

706
00:27:36,539 --> 00:27:39,600
reopened that indicates that you are not

707
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,299
understanding the root cause or applying

708
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:46,080
a comprehensive fix or testing the fix

709
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,840
Etc right this is another opportunity

710
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:51,480
for Tango for example if you have a

711
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:54,120
researcher that comes back with a bypass

712
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,179
to your fix and you try again and they

713
00:27:57,179 --> 00:27:58,980
come back with another bypass to your

714
00:27:58,980 --> 00:28:01,440
fix that would be a Tango candidate

715
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:03,059
right

716
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:05,159
percentage of cases with the same root

717
00:28:05,159 --> 00:28:07,320
cause this op this identifies

718
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,840
opportunities for you to retrain your

719
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:11,520
developers perhaps introduce different

720
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,380
Tooling in your development life cycle

721
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:16,620
there are so many efficiencies that

722
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,240
you're missing just because you don't

723
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,919
have the data

724
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:22,260
and then finally bug fixing is really

725
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:24,720
it's a relay race and you need to know

726
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,179
who's dropping the Baton when you start

727
00:28:27,179 --> 00:28:29,159
actually measuring some of these

728
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:31,919
outcomes and some of the places in the

729
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:32,820
process

730
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:35,820
that get stalled or have to be

731
00:28:35,820 --> 00:28:39,000
relitigated and redone that's when you

732
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,700
can identify you know what it's this one

733
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,100
product team that's understaffed or they

734
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:46,919
need more training it's this or it's

735
00:28:46,919 --> 00:28:49,500
this organization over here that you

736
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,779
know we thought we were uh giving them

737
00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:54,659
adequate Repro steps and information but

738
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:56,940
apparently we weren't and we need to up

739
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:59,100
our game as security practitioners to

740
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,740
help the developers understand

741
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:03,900
also it can be from your bug Bonnie

742
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,720
platform itself unfortunately over the

743
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:09,539
years as these platforms have aged we've

744
00:29:09,539 --> 00:29:11,640
noticed you know in the beginning there

745
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:14,059
were no real differences between triage

746
00:29:14,059 --> 00:29:17,700
and any kind of delays there we're

747
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,220
seeing a big Divergence at this point as

748
00:29:20,220 --> 00:29:21,659
more of these programs are becoming

749
00:29:21,659 --> 00:29:24,120
commoditized and so watch your bug

750
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,980
Bounty platform providers for them

751
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:28,140
dropping the Baton for them missing

752
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:31,440
their slas inaccurate triage the kinds

753
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,299
of things that will make your program

754
00:29:33,299 --> 00:29:36,299
not work efficiently and also give you a

755
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:38,039
bad reputation among the researchers

756
00:29:38,039 --> 00:29:41,419
that you're trying to integrate with

757
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,899
okay

758
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:47,340
so you've got the metrics now what do

759
00:29:47,340 --> 00:29:49,260
you do

760
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,179
you know I often say that we're kind of

761
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:54,120
like Dr house and we give a diagnosis

762
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:56,880
based on the bugs that we see the number

763
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,700
and type and severity of bugs and the

764
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,700
trending of your bugs so understanding

765
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:05,039
your vulnerability handling process is

766
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,140
more important and understanding it at

767
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,480
this moment in time is more important

768
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,419
than how much bug Bounty money you've

769
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:15,059
spent or even how many bugs you got

770
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:17,279
because the trend you're looking for is

771
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,740
you need to go from lots of low-hanging

772
00:30:19,740 --> 00:30:21,720
fruit lots of duplicates easy to

773
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:24,419
discover vulnerabilities to fewer and

774
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:27,299
fewer more complex harder to find

775
00:30:27,299 --> 00:30:30,059
requiring higher skills because that is

776
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:32,100
an indication that you are getting more

777
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:35,220
mature in your security practices

778
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:38,100
so open up pen test contracts especially

779
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:39,659
to some of the bug bounty hunters that

780
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:41,520
have tools

781
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:45,419
make a Tango program of your own

782
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:47,159
this is also a way to potentially

783
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:49,440
identify talent but just understand that

784
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,360
knowing is less than half the battle

785
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,580
when I was a pen tester in the early

786
00:30:53,580 --> 00:30:55,799
2000s I got sick of it because we were

787
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:57,779
coming back year after year quarter

788
00:30:57,779 --> 00:30:59,399
after quarter and we could basically

789
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,320
just change the data on the report all

790
00:31:01,320 --> 00:31:03,059
the bugs were still open

791
00:31:03,059 --> 00:31:04,740
why because they didn't have enough

792
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:07,260
people in different security roles

793
00:31:07,260 --> 00:31:08,880
internally

794
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:11,039
to fix these issues and to

795
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,140
systematically eradicate them from

796
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:16,080
future software development

797
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,539
the other thing that I have to say is

798
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:22,440
that in 2008 Popular Science called the

799
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:25,080
job Microsoft security grunt among the

800
00:31:25,080 --> 00:31:27,539
top 10 worst jobs in science it was

801
00:31:27,539 --> 00:31:29,880
between elephant vasectomist and whale

802
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,440
feces researcher

803
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,000
it was like right in the middle there

804
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:35,460
and that was accurate we got t-shirts it

805
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:37,919
was amazing but planned for cyber

806
00:31:37,919 --> 00:31:40,140
Workforce attrition in some of these key

807
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:42,480
process roles

808
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,899
when we try to staff organizations and

809
00:31:45,899 --> 00:31:48,539
fill in the gaps for them on these key

810
00:31:48,539 --> 00:31:50,960
internal security program manager roles

811
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,240
we tell them that look you can actually

812
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,820
uh if you want we have the opposite of a

813
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,620
no poaching clause in our contract we

814
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:00,899
say you can poach these contractors and

815
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:03,120
offer them full-time jobs you just flip

816
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,039
the badge color on them you know once

817
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:07,260
once our engagement is done why do we do

818
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:09,179
this because we know

819
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:11,340
that it's among the worst jobs in

820
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,600
science and there's going to be a high

821
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:14,760
attrition rate and so once people get

822
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:16,860
really good at these jobs after a couple

823
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:18,960
years they want to move on

824
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,360
so plan for this in your own cyber

825
00:32:21,360 --> 00:32:23,279
Workforce do not try to make your

826
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:25,200
developers where all of these bug Bounty

827
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,299
hats program management hats Etc because

828
00:32:27,299 --> 00:32:29,220
what you will find is that about the

829
00:32:29,220 --> 00:32:31,860
18-month or two-year Mark of running a

830
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:34,440
bug Bounty program internally you will

831
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,020
lose key people

832
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,299
and the program will collapse under its

833
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:41,220
own weight

834
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:43,799
so just understand that fixing bugs

835
00:32:43,799 --> 00:32:45,899
themselves is treating the symptoms of

836
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:48,179
your underlying security problems fixing

837
00:32:48,179 --> 00:32:49,860
your process is the cure and

838
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:52,020
anticipating the places where your

839
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:54,840
process is going to need help

840
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:57,059
so one thing we're happy to announce I

841
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:58,919
was recently at the White House for a

842
00:32:58,919 --> 00:33:00,779
cyber Workforce and education Summit I

843
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:02,159
don't know if you can see me in that

844
00:33:02,159 --> 00:33:03,419
picture

845
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:05,220
oops

846
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:07,200
um but what was interesting about that

847
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,299
Summit was they announced a cyber

848
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:11,039
security apprenticeship Sprint so the

849
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:12,600
federal government state and territory

850
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:15,299
governments have have apprenticeship

851
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:18,240
programs where they work with companies

852
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:20,340
and they work with them on developing

853
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,679
Apprentice apprenticeships

854
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:24,600
for those companies

855
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:27,480
so that you can hire and train the

856
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:28,919
workforce of tomorrow

857
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:30,899
they announced an accelerator program

858
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:34,500
and we have started the process of

859
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,360
actually creating cyber Workforce

860
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,740
apprenticeship problems this is exactly

861
00:33:37,740 --> 00:33:39,240
the way we've had to hire this whole

862
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,679
time

863
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:43,740
we hire contractors and then we get them

864
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:46,740
trained because you know what not that

865
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:48,419
many people want to have this job ever

866
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:50,700
again once they've had it so there's not

867
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:52,500
a huge Workforce to choose from but

868
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:54,840
there is a Workforce of people who need

869
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,539
experience in cyber security and can't

870
00:33:57,539 --> 00:33:59,580
qualify for the job listings that we see

871
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:02,039
so often requiring 10 years of expert

872
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:03,419
experience

873
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:05,519
foreign

874
00:34:05,519 --> 00:34:07,980
this is the other thing we're announcing

875
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,839
we have been a bootstrapped startup

876
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,719
since the beginning I did toy with the

877
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:15,119
idea of getting VC cash but all they

878
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:16,980
wanted to do was fund my company to make

879
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,960
another bug Bounty platform who needs

880
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:20,760
another one of those what they didn't

881
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,980
understand was that I wanted to make a

882
00:34:22,980 --> 00:34:25,080
broader Workforce platform

883
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:28,020
so what are we doing now

884
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,639
the fact of the matter is we do

885
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:32,099
end-to-end manage bug Bounty Services

886
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:34,619
where we are the ones who are deciding

887
00:34:34,619 --> 00:34:37,139
which bug Bounty platform to work with

888
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:39,300
we are hiring the bug Bounty platforms

889
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,239
and directing them in order to get the

890
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,099
deliberate security outcomes that our

891
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:46,619
customers need but we've never spent one

892
00:34:46,619 --> 00:34:49,440
dollar on sales and marketing so why

893
00:34:49,440 --> 00:34:51,300
wouldn't I crowdsource that I mean come

894
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,760
on incentives are my thing right so the

895
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,260
fact of the matter is as long as it's

896
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:57,060
not illegal for you to collect a

897
00:34:57,060 --> 00:34:58,859
referral fee

898
00:34:58,859 --> 00:35:03,180
we're offering referrals fees to anyone

899
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,640
who understands the concept of what

900
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,680
we're doing and knows of an organization

901
00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:12,440
that desperately needs this kind of help

902
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:16,800
so maturity actually matters

903
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,859
where you are today in your program you

904
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:22,619
may be flying high but again when Key

905
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:24,000
Personnel leave

906
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:26,640
your process May collapse so you

907
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:28,619
actually have to be deliberate about

908
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:30,960
building maturity and sustaining that

909
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,240
maturity over time

910
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,820
bug bounties are fantastic but they

911
00:35:35,820 --> 00:35:38,520
can't be used as Botox covering up your

912
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,200
internal security flaws you've got to be

913
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,940
pretty on the inside

914
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:46,020
so don't use them in isolation don't use

915
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,520
them when you don't have security

916
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:50,520
Personnel to deal with these issues you

917
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,079
can use you can have a home disclosure

918
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,820
program I'm not saying you know don't

919
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,740
listen to the the community and have no

920
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:58,079
way to report phones just saying that a

921
00:35:58,079 --> 00:36:00,599
bug Bounty and trying to control the

922
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:02,280
outcome by non-disclosure agreements

923
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:04,500
it's not the way

924
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,599
VCS aren't bad people but they've been

925
00:36:06,599 --> 00:36:08,760
grown in the petri dish of capitalism as

926
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,040
we all have been

927
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:14,099
and I would say that capitalism as its

928
00:36:14,099 --> 00:36:16,680
practice today it's like the Kobayashi

929
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:19,320
Maru you know the rules are not meant

930
00:36:19,320 --> 00:36:21,480
for most of us to win so we've got to

931
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,119
change the rules we've we're hackers

932
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:27,619
right or at least some of us are

933
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,720
the final thing is that we should be

934
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:33,420
deliberately working towards finding

935
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:36,780
more exploits for bugs not finding ways

936
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,820
to exploit people

937
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:40,800
there is a way to harness the power of

938
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,420
hackers without exploiting their labor

939
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:47,280
and finally I promised you the end of

940
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,980
the long spoons game so the parable goes

941
00:36:49,980 --> 00:36:52,380
there's another room with the exact same

942
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,800
setup

943
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,660
foreign

944
00:36:57,660 --> 00:37:00,420
but that exact same setup everyone's

945
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,740
behaving differently

946
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:04,759
they're feeding each other

947
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:08,339
it's the difference between Heaven and

948
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:10,578
Hell

949
00:37:10,619 --> 00:37:12,839
we have all the tools

950
00:37:12,839 --> 00:37:14,940
every person in this room is highly

951
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:18,680
privileged your spoons are long

952
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:22,640
your days might be short

953
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,340
do you have any questions

954
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:28,449
[Music]

955
00:37:31,579 --> 00:37:34,579
thank you
