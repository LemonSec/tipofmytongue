foreign

3
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,860
now it's my pleasure to Welcome to the

4
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,360
stage

00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,420
Stephen duchenne

6
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,000
I'm sorry

7
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,939
and Simon have it yes

8
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:23,410
thank you very much

10
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,360
in 1961 a 28 year old New York bartender

11
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,180
is coming home from work quite early in

12
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:38,040
the morning it's quite dark

13
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:40,140
if you see someone on the way as she

14
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,780
goes home she doesn't recognize him she

15
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:45,420
doesn't realize that he follows her home

16
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,399
and as she Parks her car and walks a

17
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:49,200
very short distance from the car park to

18
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,760
the front of her very well-lit building

19
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,420
he follows her and sadly he stabs her

20
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,420
twice

21
00:00:56,420 --> 00:00:59,879
unsurprisingly she screams out

22
00:00:59,879 --> 00:01:01,260
now the fascinating thing is what

23
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:03,239
happens inside the building

24
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:05,159
there was a spectrum of behavior from

25
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:07,439
the residents in that place

26
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,080
some people hear her cry but dismiss it

27
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,180
entirely as something that isn't really

28
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:14,760
relevant one man leans out of a window

29
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,860
and shouts let that girl alone

30
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:18,420
it doesn't do anything more than that

31
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,159
that's where it stops

32
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:23,040
some people do call the police but when

33
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,360
they do they describe the murder

34
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:26,520
unfolding in front of them as a domestic

35
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,140
argument or a scuffle

36
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,780
others still asked other people for

37
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:32,820
advice trying to defer their

38
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:33,960
responsibility

39
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:37,380
now whilst the 38 Witnesses who take no

40
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:39,180
action is a gross oversimplification of

41
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:40,380
what happened

42
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:43,500
no one directly intervened in that most

43
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,240
obvious of threats

44
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,979
and no one was able to communicate the

45
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:48,720
situation effectively enough to prompt

46
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:50,759
an urgent police response

47
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,579
now anyone who's had any time in a psych

48
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:55,740
course uh or anyone who's kind of

49
00:01:55,740 --> 00:01:57,420
interested in True Crime might have come

50
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:00,720
across this story of Kitty Genovese

51
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,700
and whilst there are some facts in

52
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,380
question it's become a parable in

53
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:06,659
Psychology about people consciously

54
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:09,538
engaging with a situation that

55
00:02:09,538 --> 00:02:11,160
definitely should prompt behavior and

56
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:13,980
yet for some reason didn't

57
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,260
it's prompted Decades of psychological

58
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:18,900
research into the the blockest of people

59
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,120
interceding in an emergency or when

60
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,620
witnessing or even personally

61
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,680
experiencing social injustice

62
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,080
and now honestly speaking

63
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,360
I'm not entirely convinced that whilst I

64
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,680
like to think of myself as the kind of

65
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,720
person who might want to intercede if I

66
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,400
saw someone with a knife there is no way

67
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:36,599
on Earth I'm getting involved and that's

68
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,640
really dangerous isn't it

69
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,020
but

70
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,420
we're lucky because we're interested in

71
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,160
a similar phenomenon but in a very

72
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,379
different context

73
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:48,560
foreign

74
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:51,900
engagement I typically don't want to get

75
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,180
caught yeah that's typically bad for me

76
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,800
if I can get in

77
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,959
get the goods and get out that's great

78
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:00,959
but as I walk around people see me they

79
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,700
can't help but see me I'm you know six

80
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:05,160
foot three guy I kind of stand out I'm

81
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:07,680
outside of their Norm

82
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,599
what we see as we walk around is people

83
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,920
looking up they know you're there

84
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:12,720
something's wrong

85
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,060
and then they go back to typing

86
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:17,700
now I can subdue almost any of that with

87
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:19,319
the recti contact and the best I can

88
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:21,959
manage for a charming smile

89
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:25,319
we call this this perception of a threat

90
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:28,080
with a choice of inaction the fail to

91
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:30,900
challenge vulnerability we want to know

92
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,879
why this happens and what we can do

93
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:35,299
about it

94
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,459
too many clicks

95
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:43,080
I'm side habit the head of cyber

96
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:44,459
awareness behaves and culture for the UK

97
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,680
Ministry of Defense I'm responsible for

98
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,180
setting the Strategic Direction and

99
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,620
approaches for influencing secure

100
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:52,260
Behavior across the organization my

101
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,720
career has had two major themes firstly

102
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,540
as a forensic psychologist my academic

103
00:03:57,540 --> 00:03:59,220
research specifically looks into

104
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:00,959
malicious active Behavior why the bad

105
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:03,060
guy does what they do and then what we

106
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,500
can do about it how can we put

107
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,840
mitigations in place through unusual and

108
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:09,239
interesting strategies like gamification

109
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:12,060
the second theme of my career is as a

110
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,220
professional social engineer and I've

111
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:15,599
LED teams that have conducted

112
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:17,639
socio-technical investigations Audits

113
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,560
and assessments at countless high

114
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,560
security sites globally I now act with

115
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:25,440
one foot in both camps detecting and

116
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,180
then seeking to remediate behavioral

117
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:29,660
vulnerability

118
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,479
consultant with Atkins in the UK

119
00:04:35,479 --> 00:04:38,100
I've worked with multiple public and

120
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,540
private sector clients to help change

121
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,340
cultures and behaviors within those

122
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:43,500
organizations and currently I'm a

123
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,419
behavioral scientist it's part of the

124
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,100
Cyber awareness behaviors and culture

125
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,620
team would say like I like to put my

126
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,419
social engineering skills to good use as

127
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:53,520
well looking to apply them to see how we

128
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,199
can help change behaviors within those

129
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,720
organizations

130
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,220
so cyber awareness behaviors in culture

131
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:01,139
in the UK Ministry of defense is an

132
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:02,639
internal capability operating in

133
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,080
partnership with my colleagues here at

134
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,460
Atkins

135
00:05:05,460 --> 00:05:07,979
our mission is simple

136
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:09,960
we want to demonstrably reduce cyber

137
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,000
security Risk by developing new and

138
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,100
reinforcing existing positive behaviors

139
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,900
through targeted and measurable

140
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:17,580
intervention

141
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,780
it's really important to know the

142
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:20,880
audience size we're dealing with we have

143
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,280
240 000 people in the organization that

144
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,900
run the gamut of every demographic and

145
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,120
trade group but it's wider than that

146
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,860
we're also tasked with impacting service

147
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:31,500
families veterans Cadet forces and even

148
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:34,080
the defense industry base all in all I

149
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,220
am responsible for Shifting the

150
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,560
behaviors of over 3 million people it it

151
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,440
can be an unenviable task

152
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:43,860
we do this through through four key

153
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,960
pillars of effort at the very center of

154
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:48,120
everything that we do is data we can't

155
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:49,560
do anything unless we know the human

156
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,120
terrain and know whether or not we're

157
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,380
having an impact

158
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,800
we can we conduct high level frequently

159
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,259
sampled socio-behavioral questionnaires

160
00:05:58,259 --> 00:06:01,320
to gain a large macro picture and we

161
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,180
also conduct in-depth analyzes of

162
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:05,340
specific data sources which detail

163
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:07,440
individual risky behaviors

164
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,900
on top of this we have the Discord

165
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:11,699
shaping content team

166
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:13,979
all ideas have words attached to them

167
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:16,680
and all words exist to communicate ideas

168
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:19,440
language use is an essential window into

169
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:21,240
the value the meaning and the position

170
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,340
of underlying mental models that prompt

171
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,440
secure Behavior unless we consider the

172
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,600
way that language and the vast lexicon

173
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,880
of cyber phrasing is used we're going to

174
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,380
find it very hard to shift behavior on

175
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,460
top of that

176
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,840
next we have the training team

177
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:35,460
unsurprisingly no one could be able to

178
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:37,199
perform a task unless they know how to

179
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:39,479
perform that task now I think training

180
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:41,520
is incredibly valuable but I do think we

181
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,919
overestimate how much it's required in

182
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,080
this specific landscape

183
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,060
and last but not least we have the

184
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:50,400
behavioral interventions team they're

185
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,340
responsible with finding detecting and

186
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:55,080
looking at specifically changing

187
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,819
behavior in specific groups now I'm not

188
00:06:56,819 --> 00:06:57,660
going to talk too much about that I'm

189
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:58,740
going to leave that to Steve a little

190
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:01,199
bit later on

191
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,960
we've done a huge amount of work over

192
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,699
the last couple of years

193
00:07:05,699 --> 00:07:07,979
and it's been visible and it's been very

194
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:09,240
effective

195
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,280
we've got some examples like the fact

196
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,039
that we have knowingly impacted the

197
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:15,600
likelihood of reporting a suspicious

198
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,539
event we've developed and broadcast a

199
00:07:18,539 --> 00:07:20,340
game show that thousands of people took

200
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:21,300
part in

201
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,639
we changed the landscape of unauthorized

202
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,800
USB device usage

203
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,780
and we built and toured a physical

204
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:29,400
escape room and I'll talk about that in

205
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,539
a bit

206
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:32,160
now I could talk to all of the work that

207
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,660
we do for days and I'm not going to do

208
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:34,979
that because I've run out of time but if

209
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:36,060
there is anything you want to catch up

210
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:38,940
on do grab me after this

211
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,400
so that's the what we've done but let's

212
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:43,380
talk about why it works

213
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,300
the prevailing approach to dealing with

214
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:48,180
a socio-behavioral issue is based on a

215
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,919
really simple premise

216
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,039
if our staff know cyber security they

217
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,199
will behave in a secure way

218
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,880
that's the the kind of underlying

219
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,160
argument behind the two big words that

220
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:00,720
float around on on this subject

221
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:03,120
awareness and education

222
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,160
but if knowledge was all that was

223
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,380
required to shape Behavior then no one

224
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,880
would smoke

225
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,039
we cannot expect staff to hold the same

226
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,520
level of interest in security as us and

227
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,960
it's fundamentally true that degree of

228
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,120
interest in a task is a major factor in

229
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,400
the prioritization applied to that task

230
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,680
even so it's been my observation that

231
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,199
within the security profession we often

232
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,479
unconsciously do just this

233
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:29,759
it's that audit moment when you spot a

234
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:32,339
password on a Post-It note and you think

235
00:08:32,339 --> 00:08:33,899
oh I can't believe someone would do that

236
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:35,159
it's blindingly obvious that we

237
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:37,200
shouldn't do that right well what's

238
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,580
Happening Here is we're transferring our

239
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:41,039
own value system onto somebody else and

240
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:43,440
quite obviously that person has a very

241
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,760
different decision-making process than

242
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,740
we do

243
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,160
so what do what we need to do is to

244
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,720
consider the sociobehavioral landscape

245
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,060
from a different perspective

246
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,040
as is reinforced throughout numerous

247
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:57,839
themes of psychological research we need

248
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,399
to consider the motivation underpinning

249
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:00,600
the action

250
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,399
now that's great on paper but how do we

251
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,080
do that so I'm going to pitch three

252
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,180
things that I think we need to consider

253
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,680
in order to get to a place where we're

254
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,760
centering the song motivation

255
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:14,220
first off we need to streamline the

256
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,660
problem

257
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,120
two things that we really need people to

258
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,140
do

259
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,140
and that's to see something and identify

260
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,839
it and try and intervene if they can and

261
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:26,519
if they can't they need to communicate

262
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:27,600
that issue to someone who's more

263
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,580
equipped than they are we need people to

264
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:31,440
challenge and Report now it's really

265
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,519
important to note that these are

266
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,560
behaviors not points of knowledge and

267
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,760
there are points of knowledge behind

268
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,120
them but what we want is the behavior

269
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,620
next

270
00:09:40,620 --> 00:09:42,720
there are two systems of motivation and

271
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,820
what we really want is for people to do

272
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:46,620
things of their own volition to be

273
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:48,779
intrinsically motivated

274
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:50,760
right now we typically base our idea of

275
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,380
security against the expectation that

276
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:54,180
people should follow rules and in doing

277
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:57,839
so we'll achieve a minimum standard

278
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:00,420
but this externalizes security decisions

279
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,180
into a state of compliance

280
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,040
to better draw our intrinsic motivation

281
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,080
we need to empower our people to make

282
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,660
informed risk-based decisions

283
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,519
this kind of thinking already floats

284
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,899
around our industry to be honest we

285
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:15,060
don't see anything as 100 secure why

286
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:16,920
should we see people that way

287
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:18,660
now

288
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:21,420
speaking of intrinsic motivation how do

289
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:23,580
we do intrinsic motivation better well

290
00:10:23,580 --> 00:10:25,019
luckily there's some Theory out there to

291
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:26,519
help us

292
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:27,839
according to Ryan inductory

293
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,160
self-determination Theory there are

294
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,920
three elements to intrinsic motivation

295
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,300
we need to ask ourselves are we working

296
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,760
to meet these factors do people feel

297
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,860
like they have a degree of autonomy or

298
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:41,160
even better how do we Champion autonomy

299
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:43,680
are we facilitating competence remember

300
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,120
that's not the same as bullying people

301
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,440
into building knowledge about something

302
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:48,240
that doesn't interest them it's about

303
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,920
giving them the opportunity to feel like

304
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:51,180
they're getting better at something that

305
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,100
matters and overcoming challenges which

306
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,519
are pitched at the right level to them

307
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:57,899
lastly

308
00:10:57,899 --> 00:11:01,019
how do we connect with those around us

309
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:02,519
do people feel a heavy burden of

310
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:04,500
individual responsibility or are they

311
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:07,140
free to pass the bucket to the IT team

312
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,060
it's these factors that make

313
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,980
gamification such an incredibly powerful

314
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:13,019
tool

315
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:15,540
so I think there is one fantastic

316
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,579
example of gamification let me tell you

317
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:20,459
a little bit of background

318
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:23,459
Niantic Labs started in 2010 with a

319
00:11:23,459 --> 00:11:25,440
mission to create a new kind of gameplay

320
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,779
in which the real world becomes the game

321
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:28,560
board

322
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,240
their foundational principles were to

323
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,880
explore new places to get exercise to

324
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,920
have social interaction with others or

325
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,260
in in a better phrasing autonomy of

326
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:39,779
exploration competence in health and

327
00:11:39,779 --> 00:11:41,820
relatedness with other players

328
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,920
in 2016 they released one of the most

329
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,600
successful apps ever

330
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,160
anyone know

331
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,480
Pokemon go fantastic a year later

332
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,660
users had collectively recorded 15.8

333
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,480
billion kilometers of walking

334
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:58,800
if anyone's doing the math that's

335
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,360
roughly the distance from Earth to the

336
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,180
edge of the solar system

337
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:05,519
for me the story of Pokemon go is one of

338
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:06,899
the best examples of how powerful

339
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:08,880
gamification can be because through all

340
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,440
of their incredible success they met

341
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,300
their core mission of getting people to

342
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,160
go up and do some exercise

343
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,079
but the user did not download it for

344
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:17,940
that purpose they were just playing a

345
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:19,320
game

346
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,420
and the core of the game is really

347
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:22,200
simple

348
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,600
it's about fun it's about enjoying

349
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:27,360
something plays a freeing act and it's

350
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,440
safe

351
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,100
now good gamification keeps that in mind

352
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:35,700
it keeps a true essence of a game

353
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,440
whilst on the surface it's the action of

354
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,300
distilling down a game mechanic and

355
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:40,860
applying it somewhere else

356
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:42,959
drawing only on the mechanic itself and

357
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:44,459
this is a spirit of what gamification

358
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:47,040
can offer so to get it right we need to

359
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,779
consider a few elements

360
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:51,360
firstly we have to walk a knife edge of

361
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,279
difficulty

362
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,000
now the knife edge has two sides of

363
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,880
course on one side we have railroading

364
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:03,240
your freedom to mess up is obviously

365
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,100
like taken away from you

366
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,899
when we apply this to the gamification

367
00:13:06,899 --> 00:13:09,420
problem in learning well it's an issue

368
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,740
isn't it it can be hard to avoid because

369
00:13:10,740 --> 00:13:11,880
we want people to hit the learning

370
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:12,839
objectives

371
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:14,880
uh what happens if they're really good

372
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,260
and they bypass everything then we've

373
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,760
got a bit of a problem

374
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,260
but the other side of the difficulty

375
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:19,980
knife

376
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:22,139
is that there sorry the other side of

377
00:13:22,139 --> 00:13:23,220
the

378
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:26,160
knife edge is the difficulty wall

379
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,200
now the difficulty well when you play a

380
00:13:28,200 --> 00:13:30,360
game a good game has a difficulty curve

381
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:32,100
that allows you to grow competence as

382
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:33,899
you get better at the game and you face

383
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:36,180
bigger challenges as you play but some

384
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,100
games have a curve it's so sharp it's

385
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,480
like a wall

386
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,399
now that blocks all but the most

387
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:43,320
committed of players for pure

388
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,180
entertainment that really can work and

389
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,279
it does grow a cult following but that's

390
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:48,300
really not what we're after with

391
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,040
gamification

392
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:52,440
the next thing you need to consider is

393
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,880
the game world

394
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,800
getting world is incredibly important as

395
00:13:55,800 --> 00:13:57,899
a concept the aim is to communicate a

396
00:13:57,899 --> 00:13:59,940
new layer of reality in which all

397
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:01,440
players can inhabit in-game roles

398
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,380
sometimes as themselves but in which the

399
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,700
game World the environment or the

400
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,500
adversary can't hurt you

401
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:08,940
now this concept of a game world can

402
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,920
sometimes be confused with the Fidelity

403
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,800
of a synthetic environment uh especially

404
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:16,500
agent in the age of VR but in terms of

405
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:18,060
gamification the definition is much

406
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:21,420
wider it can be rich detailed experience

407
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:25,139
like Halo or it can be just as detailed

408
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:26,399
without the need for any visual

409
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:28,139
representations like Dungeons and

410
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:28,920
Dragons

411
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,200
it can be incredibly simple like

412
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,480
dominoes now in all of those examples

413
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,579
players are constantly aware that their

414
00:14:35,579 --> 00:14:37,139
actions and their decisions are

415
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:40,199
operating in the game world alone

416
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:42,120
poorly designed gamification fails to

417
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,800
take this into account

418
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:45,660
and simply expects participants to

419
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:47,220
respond to the game mechanic without

420
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:50,100
buying the world it lives in

421
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,779
and don't don't worry if this takes a

422
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:54,360
while to get right uh Monopoly is famous

423
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,920
for dragging all of those social

424
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,660
frictioners out into the real world and

425
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:00,540
ruining the good family get together

426
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,300
now lastly for games there is a really

427
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,040
important factor it's almost a defining

428
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,720
factor of a game

429
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,180
you've got to win okay

430
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,220
winning is vital and the easiest way to

431
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,139
build a positive sentiment that you've

432
00:15:13,139 --> 00:15:14,579
got to remember the knife edge and these

433
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:16,440
two are intention here we want our

434
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:19,199
players to win definitely but we want

435
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,940
them to feel like it wasn't guaranteed

436
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:22,620
it's kind of manipulative but that's how

437
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:24,060
games work

438
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:25,860
this means pitting players against one

439
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,860
another can be fundamentally problematic

440
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,360
so who do I suggest the player should

441
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,980
run against

442
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,959
a major theme in my academic research

443
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:35,399
centers on the idea that we can build

444
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:38,040
more secure behaviors among Defenders by

445
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,079
understanding inhabiting the role of and

446
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:41,579
by having a personalized lived

447
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:44,339
experience of a villain importantly

448
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:46,680
wrapped in a bubble of psychological

449
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:47,940
safety

450
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,040
in order to prompt a mitigation Behavior

451
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:52,620
we need two forces in balance a

452
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,300
meaningful basis for what bad could be

453
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:57,300
importantly enacted by an external actor

454
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,740
who can't just threaten them from inside

455
00:15:58,740 --> 00:15:59,880
the company

456
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,800
and a commensurate set of tools that

457
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:04,680
manage that specific problem

458
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,620
excess knowledge begs the question why

459
00:16:07,620 --> 00:16:09,240
should I bother and what it does is

460
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,180
results in work to amounts

461
00:16:11,180 --> 00:16:13,500
alternatively if we throw too much

462
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:16,019
threat understanding or present the

463
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:18,120
threat in the wrong way then it prompts

464
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,459
fear and paralysis

465
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:21,720
when we look at the typical approach to

466
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:23,279
managing behaviors we spend a

467
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:25,320
disproportionate amount of time and

468
00:16:25,320 --> 00:16:26,639
effort asking people to perform

469
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,860
behaviors without generating a real

470
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:31,139
psychological platform for the threat

471
00:16:31,139 --> 00:16:33,360
sometimes we talk about how often we get

472
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:35,399
breached or how much money we lose

473
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:37,560
but when we ask someone to carry out the

474
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:40,079
behavior do we explain clearly what the

475
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:41,579
competing threat the problem set control

476
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:43,980
actually is and this is what the aim of

477
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:47,579
the threat Avatar is we use a consistent

478
00:16:47,579 --> 00:16:49,560
relevant narrative expression of a

479
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,839
villain which can offer both a model of

480
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,660
real threat but we control it we curate

481
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,339
it in a fashion that it feels safe to

482
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:57,540
interact with

483
00:16:57,540 --> 00:17:00,360
for me the perfect stereotype of the

484
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:02,820
threat Avatar is Team Rocket

485
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,619
they have a theme song that tells you

486
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:06,599
they're going to start doing bad stuff

487
00:17:06,599 --> 00:17:10,020
yeah it's uh widely coyote or literally

488
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,359
any adult in Scooby-Doo

489
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:14,339
as an audience we know that every time

490
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:17,459
they're introduced they're up to no good

491
00:17:17,459 --> 00:17:19,140
we don't need a deep comprehensive

492
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,939
understanding of their motives although

493
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,099
that can be built over time we just know

494
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:24,419
that they're going to try and ruin the

495
00:17:24,419 --> 00:17:25,980
hero's day

496
00:17:25,980 --> 00:17:28,500
we also know without a doubt

497
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:31,440
absolutely unervingly they're going to

498
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:33,299
fail

499
00:17:33,299 --> 00:17:35,700
we can explore all their wild schemes

500
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:37,140
everything they're doing right there

501
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:39,179
along with them but know that there was

502
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:41,760
never any real harm to the hero

503
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,799
so what happens when we take steps to

504
00:17:43,799 --> 00:17:45,660
transport our staff members into the

505
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:47,400
role of the protagonist in their own

506
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:51,179
story when we cast them as the hero

507
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:53,280
we can express our antagonists in two

508
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,380
different ways either as an enduring

509
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,059
story that we can draw from time and

510
00:17:57,059 --> 00:18:00,840
time again or as a transient experience

511
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:02,520
in the ministry of Defense we use both

512
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,320
and subtly imply connections between

513
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,280
them

514
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,620
they're a living story we have the

515
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:09,720
ministry oh you love this the ministry

516
00:18:09,720 --> 00:18:13,620
of defiance get it

517
00:18:13,620 --> 00:18:15,539
fantastic marketing

518
00:18:15,539 --> 00:18:17,580
right

519
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,559
your feelings are active history and

520
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:20,880
they are continually trying to attack

521
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,820
defense in cyber Awareness Month 2021 we

522
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,980
told several stories about Defiance and

523
00:18:25,980 --> 00:18:28,260
they were all interconnected we had a

524
00:18:28,260 --> 00:18:29,580
physical escape room which toured around

525
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,740
the country and it was based on new

526
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,740
model military accommodation

527
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,900
players were locked in a bedroom when a

528
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:39,059
young verbose and playfully belligerent

529
00:18:39,059 --> 00:18:41,039
Defiance hacker took over their iot

530
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:43,500
devices in their room players escaped

531
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,240
the room by securing those vulnerable

532
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,740
devices through simple puzzles

533
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:53,520
we also had and developed a magazine

534
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,740
which we called revolt

535
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,380
uh it's very good and if you want to see

536
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,059
it do come and grab me afterwards but

537
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:01,380
it's from the perspective of the bad

538
00:19:01,380 --> 00:19:02,820
guys I'm telling you how they do what

539
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:03,840
they do

540
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,700
this is written by the way by a

541
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:07,860
character we call the editor he's on the

542
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,140
front and he broke into one of our

543
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:12,419
broadcasts so we put out videos he took

544
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:15,059
over there and spilled all of defiance's

545
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:17,539
Secrets

546
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:21,840
this this is all obvious fiction none of

547
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,700
this is real and it's presented in such

548
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,020
a way that's why it's such a kit image

549
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:26,820
of a hacker because we want something

550
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,240
that you immediately know isn't real

551
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,679
as I said there is an alternative

552
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:33,960
modality of my theory and that's based

553
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,640
on the idea of establishing a game world

554
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,919
as quickly as possible and this will

555
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:39,360
become relevant soon

556
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,460
but before that I'm going to let Steve

557
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,500
explain how a targeted intervention

558
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,539
resulted in the application of these

559
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:47,900
theories

560
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,559
thank you

561
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:52,020
so just how do we know then that

562
00:19:52,020 --> 00:19:53,640
developing these novel and innovative

563
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,220
ideas and inviting people into our game

564
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,260
world is going to have the effect that

565
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,520
we want it to

566
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,919
we work to three key principles in

567
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,020
everything that we do as part of a wider

568
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:05,100
process

569
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,900
we always make sure we are addressing

570
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,720
one target audience that we get to know

571
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:12,360
intimately and we are working to one

572
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:14,400
specific behavior

573
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,140
we make sure that all of this is

574
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:17,880
grounded in proof so that we can

575
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,860
evidence what impact we are having on

576
00:20:19,860 --> 00:20:22,639
both of those things

577
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:24,840
this means that when a request comes to

578
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:27,660
us to say look at a particular thing we

579
00:20:27,660 --> 00:20:29,160
make sure that we take all the politics

580
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,080
or the emotion or the opinion out of

581
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,640
that request and make sure that we are

582
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:35,160
focusing on the specific action it's not

583
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,419
a case if I need you to look at this

584
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:37,740
because it's making me look bad to my

585
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:39,539
seniors it's a case if we know that

586
00:20:39,539 --> 00:20:41,160
people are doing this it's happening

587
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:42,660
this many times and we can evidence

588
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:45,120
exactly what it is we make sure that we

589
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:47,039
understand the specific actions and

590
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,380
behaviors that people are doing

591
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,299
but understanding this alone isn't

592
00:20:51,299 --> 00:20:53,460
enough we need to understand why people

593
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:55,440
are doing these things and so we take

594
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:57,000
all of that data from the modeling and

595
00:20:57,000 --> 00:20:58,679
make sure that and apply it to different

596
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:00,840
behavioral models

597
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,460
things like the ones that sign mentioned

598
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:04,679
earlier or the combi model of behavior

599
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:07,020
change by Susan Michie and colleagues

600
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:09,059
this helps us to understand why people

601
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,919
are doing the things they're doing

602
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:12,240
but we can't neglect the fact that

603
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,980
people do not operate in isolation

604
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:16,620
they're part of a system and that system

605
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,720
also informs behaviors so we look into

606
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,460
the wider context to understand how

607
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,500
organizational factors things that

608
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:24,840
leadership are doing for example might

609
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:27,179
also be influencing behaviors

610
00:21:27,179 --> 00:21:28,919
this means that when we develop our

611
00:21:28,919 --> 00:21:30,900
interventions when we start to apply

612
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:32,700
gamification we know that we're going to

613
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:34,860
be pushing on the right levers we know

614
00:21:34,860 --> 00:21:36,059
that we're going to be able to have the

615
00:21:36,059 --> 00:21:37,740
effect that we want and Target the right

616
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,900
behavior and again we're able to prove

617
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:40,740
it

618
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,480
we make sure that we refine and trial

619
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,220
all of our interventions before we

620
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,360
actually deploy them to our target

621
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,940
audience to again understand what impact

622
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,500
we're going to have and then eventually

623
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,659
we get to deploy and of course we make

624
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:53,400
sure that we review and monitor and make

625
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,220
sure that we are having the right impact

626
00:21:56,220 --> 00:21:58,260
now as I mentioned we're going to talk

627
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,960
about challenge behaviors now this stems

628
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:02,340
from a piece of work that started back

629
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:04,980
in 2020 and effectively we were asked to

630
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:06,539
look at reducing the prevalence of

631
00:22:06,539 --> 00:22:08,220
people taking Peds or portable

632
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:10,500
electronic devices into areas of our

633
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:11,940
organization where they're not supposed

634
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:14,460
to be information protection zones

635
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:16,679
now from our work from that first half

636
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:19,020
of that process we effectively come to

637
00:22:19,020 --> 00:22:21,059
understand that the problem was that

638
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:22,500
whilst everyone knew that this was

639
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,659
happening no one was willing to stand up

640
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:26,880
to it and say that you can't do that you

641
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:28,260
can't bring your phone in here or can

642
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,159
you please leave your smart watch

643
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:30,840
outside in the lockers that's what

644
00:22:30,840 --> 00:22:32,880
they're for

645
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,919
and this is a really important problem

646
00:22:34,919 --> 00:22:37,080
and we know that this problem exists in

647
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,580
lots of different groups in lots of

648
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,140
different organizations and industries

649
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,820
around the world

650
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:43,799
again as I mentioned challenge is one of

651
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:45,600
two most important behaviors that

652
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,400
non-technical staff can do along with

653
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,659
reporting

654
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,159
to make sure that the organization

655
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,140
remains safe

656
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:54,120
yet we don't really get the opportunity

657
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,100
to practice that behavior

658
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:58,200
and when we do it's a real life

659
00:22:58,200 --> 00:23:00,179
situation that comes with real social

660
00:23:00,179 --> 00:23:01,559
pressures right

661
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:03,240
who wants to go to their colleague and

662
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:04,440
tell them that the thing that they're

663
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:06,240
doing is risky for their organization

664
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:08,580
who wants to feel like that stick in the

665
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:10,380
mud or the barrier to progression even

666
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,880
if you're doing the right thing and

667
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:14,700
trying to keep your organization safe

668
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,740
imagine a firewall that was afraid to

669
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:18,419
query a request because it felt

670
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:20,280
self-conscious or was scared about being

671
00:23:20,280 --> 00:23:21,900
judged

672
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,460
it wouldn't be much use as a form of

673
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,320
protection would it and the human

674
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,480
network is exactly the same

675
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:29,880
we have to empower our people to feel

676
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,400
confident and able to challenge because

677
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:36,200
that's what keeps an organization safe

678
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,220
so to help Define it a little bit

679
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,200
further and make sure that we're pushing

680
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:41,700
people towards the right behavior that

681
00:23:41,700 --> 00:23:43,740
we actually want them to exhibit cyan

682
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:45,419
and I have developed a model for

683
00:23:45,419 --> 00:23:48,419
challenge this is based on two key

684
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:51,120
principles the onward social impact of

685
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:53,340
the of the action and the actual quality

686
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,720
of the intervention

687
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,000
effectively do you upset anyone in the

688
00:23:57,000 --> 00:23:58,679
process and does it actually remove the

689
00:23:58,679 --> 00:24:00,360
risk

690
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,500
so

691
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:03,539
the first part of this model the

692
00:24:03,539 --> 00:24:06,120
unconstructive partial challenge it may

693
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:07,919
be overly aggressive a little bit robust

694
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:10,140
perhaps more so than we would like and

695
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,000
on its own it doesn't actually remove

696
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,100
the risk it doesn't intervene on that

697
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,260
behavior

698
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,240
up to the constructive partial slightly

699
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,799
more polite a little bit more more of a

700
00:24:19,799 --> 00:24:21,840
friendly style a challenge but again

701
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,240
still not removing the risk something is

702
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:26,640
still there that is a problem

703
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,400
due to the unconstructive complete

704
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,559
again back to that maybe slightly overly

705
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:33,659
abrasive style of challenge but on this

706
00:24:33,659 --> 00:24:35,760
occasion it actually removes the risk it

707
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:39,419
stops that risky behavior from happening

708
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:41,700
right up to the Holy Grail of challenge

709
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:44,400
for us the constructive complete it's

710
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:47,100
robust but it's polite and it removes

711
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:48,780
the risk it intervenes on that

712
00:24:48,780 --> 00:24:50,340
particular behavior and stops it from

713
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:52,820
occurring

714
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:54,780
so we understand that we need to reduce

715
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:57,240
the number of Ip of PEDs being taken

716
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:00,179
into ipz and in order to do that we need

717
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:02,280
to increase the peer challenge of risky

718
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,720
behaviors

719
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,640
now before we demonstrate to you just

720
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:08,039
how we actually do that there's just one

721
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:09,960
more uh model that we want to try and

722
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,220
explain

723
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,200
so in the environment around us there

724
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,340
are thousands of pieces of information

725
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,380
that we always take in to help

726
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:18,900
understand that environment

727
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,360
we have to start to make a sense of this

728
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:23,280
we have to put meaning to it we take all

729
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:24,480
of those different bits of information

730
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,940
all of those stimuli and put our own

731
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,440
perceptions around them to understand

732
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,779
what is happening in the environment

733
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:32,580
this then starts to affect our

734
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,740
cognitions what we actually think about

735
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:37,080
the situation what do I need to do as a

736
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,460
result of this thing that I've just

737
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:41,279
perceived which again in turns it starts

738
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,659
to affect our Behavior the things we

739
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:43,679
actually do

740
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,140
now the world we operate in influences

741
00:25:46,140 --> 00:25:48,539
this process and vice versa to a certain

742
00:25:48,539 --> 00:25:49,559
extent

743
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:51,480
and that's a really important thing to

744
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:52,320
remember

745
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:53,940
because if we want to start thinking

746
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:55,500
about how we can impact challenge

747
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:58,080
behaviors we need to get people up to

748
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,640
the point of understanding that they

749
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,799
actually need to do something about it

750
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:03,419
we need to give them all of those little

751
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:05,159
bits of information all of those

752
00:26:05,159 --> 00:26:07,500
different stimuli help them to put their

753
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,120
own perceptions around it and realize

754
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,460
that it is risky so that they start to

755
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,020
think and realize that they need to do

756
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,940
something about it and then act upon

757
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:17,120
them

758
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:18,960
so

759
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,100
I was going to show you a little

760
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,380
demonstration of how we actually do that

761
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,820
now for the purpose of this

762
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:26,760
demonstration I am just another person

763
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,500
within this organization I don't

764
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,360
necessarily know so

765
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,640
just a disclaimer

766
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,559
and effectively what we're doing in this

767
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,240
demonstration in the role play the whole

768
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:38,460
purpose of the exercise is we're helping

769
00:26:38,460 --> 00:26:40,440
individuals to isolate their cognitions

770
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,779
and in doing so helping them to develop

771
00:26:42,779 --> 00:26:46,340
a script towards challenging

772
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:48,179
so

773
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:50,039
picture the scene

774
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:51,960
it's a Thursday morning and I've just

775
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,220
got into work

776
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:55,500
I've got an absolute ton of emails to

777
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:56,700
deal with that have come in overnight

778
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:58,080
and I've got loads of meetings that I

779
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,299
need to prepare for today my attention

780
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:02,279
is a finite resource

781
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:04,020
and right now all of it is on the task

782
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:06,500
at hand

783
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,740
could do is I could take advantage of

784
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:12,600
this couldn't I if I was on a test or an

785
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:14,880
assessment I would just fly right past

786
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,020
him he's not gonna pay me any attention

787
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,059
he's busy typing

788
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:20,520
okay that's fair enough but that's not

789
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,860
my aim what I want to do is draw his

790
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,779
attention so to do that I'm going to ask

791
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:26,100
him a question

792
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,140
a suspicious question

793
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,360
sorry mate excuse me

794
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,220
um I'm so sorry I'm having a just a

795
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:34,080
nightmare of a day my laptops died my

796
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,840
phone's died uh and I'm like I've got

797
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:38,700
like two minutes to a meeting could I

798
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,260
just um borrow your laptop for just a

799
00:27:40,260 --> 00:27:43,140
second to email my boss

800
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,840
okay now this is a little bit weird I

801
00:27:45,840 --> 00:27:47,159
don't think anyone's ever come up to me

802
00:27:47,159 --> 00:27:48,480
in the office before and asked me if

803
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,640
they can use my laptop while I'm set on

804
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:52,620
it right now I'm just trying to make

805
00:27:52,620 --> 00:27:54,240
sense of this situation and understand

806
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:56,220
what is happening I'm trying to build

807
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:59,039
all of those stimuli into a picture

808
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:01,140
I'm starting to perceive it as being a

809
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,179
little bit risky but right now I'm just

810
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:05,580
trying to understand the request I'm

811
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,200
taking the thing that he's just asked me

812
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,299
to do in comparing it to the Litany of

813
00:28:09,299 --> 00:28:11,340
social norms rules and expectations that

814
00:28:11,340 --> 00:28:13,260
we all adhere to in daily life to

815
00:28:13,260 --> 00:28:14,880
understand if it's acceptable or not

816
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:18,059
meanwhile I've established a game World

817
00:28:18,059 --> 00:28:21,299
very quickly uh normal bad guys don't

818
00:28:21,299 --> 00:28:23,640
typically tell you they're a bad guy

819
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,779
so

820
00:28:24,779 --> 00:28:29,159
uh what I'm going to do is uh use this

821
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:31,380
game world I'm gonna get his interest

822
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,080
and then I'm gonna get him to to

823
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,000
challenge me to get him to do something

824
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,539
with that these cues by the way are

825
00:28:39,539 --> 00:28:41,400
designed to gather his attention but it

826
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,779
might not happen instantly it might take

827
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:44,100
a little while for him to Cotton On

828
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,539
that's okay remember this is happening

829
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:47,640
very very quickly and I've also asked

830
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:48,539
him to do something he definitely

831
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:50,279
shouldn't do he has never met me before

832
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:52,620
there is no way he could know me which

833
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:53,880
means he definitely shouldn't be giving

834
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,460
me unfettered access to his laptop

835
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:58,559
hi hi I'm sorry what was it that you

836
00:28:58,559 --> 00:28:59,460
wanted

837
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,520
so right now again I'm still trying to

838
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:04,620
make sense of the situation I'm still

839
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:05,940
trying to put all of those different

840
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:07,860
stimuli together

841
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:10,919
but I know that it's not quite right I

842
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:12,120
know that I'm probably going to have to

843
00:29:12,120 --> 00:29:14,279
do something about it it's starting to

844
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:16,380
affect my cognition but I'm still not

845
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:19,080
quite there yet maybe it's okay

846
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:20,760
right now maybe I can get someone else

847
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,440
to deal with the problem make it someone

848
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,659
else's issue actually I think you need

849
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:28,740
to go and speak to it yeah okay not bad

850
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:31,500
right it's a partial challenge he won't

851
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:34,200
let me touch his laptop but right now I

852
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,520
could continue to exploit this person

853
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,279
they haven't stopped me just yet I could

854
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:40,380
push further or I could take advantage

855
00:29:40,380 --> 00:29:42,299
of this permissibility to get gone and

856
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:43,380
Escape

857
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:44,760
we're trying to get the challenge so

858
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:46,200
what do I do I'm going to push him a

859
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:47,580
little bit further

860
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:49,260
oh

861
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,960
yeah yeah of course of course I forgot I

862
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,340
forgot I tell you what I've got

863
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:54,360
something better

864
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:55,799
um is there any chance you could just

865
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:56,820
take this

866
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,520
it's a USB stick uh any chance you can

867
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,539
take that just just print off there's

868
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:02,399
only one file on there and if you do

869
00:30:02,399 --> 00:30:05,719
that I won't be late please

870
00:30:06,059 --> 00:30:09,240
okay now again this is starting to get

871
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:10,620
really weird

872
00:30:10,620 --> 00:30:12,840
I really don't think I can do this I

873
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,520
don't think I can take this and plug it

874
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:16,500
in but at the same time I really hate

875
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,380
saying no to people and actually it just

876
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:21,659
doesn't come that naturally to me

877
00:30:21,659 --> 00:30:23,220
I really don't think I can do it though

878
00:30:23,220 --> 00:30:25,080
I'm gonna have to Cobble together some

879
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,700
kind of Challenge from scratch

880
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:29,220
uh I'm really sorry but we actually

881
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:30,779
can't plug those in I think that's

882
00:30:30,779 --> 00:30:32,700
against policy um

883
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:36,059
sorry who are you I'm sorry I broke down

884
00:30:36,059 --> 00:30:37,620
the corridor with them

885
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,960
Jeff Jeff who

886
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,440
Smith

887
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:45,779
I I've worked here for quite a long time

888
00:30:45,779 --> 00:30:48,419
I know there is no Jeff Smith and this

889
00:30:48,419 --> 00:30:50,159
guy has just approached me asking me to

890
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:52,140
do really risky things and he's given me

891
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:54,059
this odd USB stick

892
00:30:54,059 --> 00:30:56,700
and actually it says hack on the side of

893
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,820
it

894
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:02,279
and what is that t-shirt all about why

895
00:31:02,279 --> 00:31:05,279
does it say I'm lying to you

896
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:07,500
I don't I think something's up I think

897
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:09,539
this might be an exercise well no Mr

898
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:11,760
cyber threat I will not plug that in oh

899
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:14,580
he's got me see that that's a complete

900
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:15,720
challenge there's nothing I could do

901
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:18,659
beyond that point to change the angle

902
00:31:18,659 --> 00:31:20,700
this person has put all of the cues

903
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,760
together the the silly USB stick my my

904
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:27,419
wonderful t-shirt and has leapt into the

905
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,159
game world with me they know what we're

906
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:31,140
talking about now so now they're right

907
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,820
there next to me all those tensions that

908
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:33,960
they experienced earlier on that

909
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:35,700
discomfort they felt that's immediately

910
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:38,340
resolved they feel great now they feel

911
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:42,360
quite good I want to capitalize on that

912
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:44,520
as they feel quite good they've now got

913
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,500
a framework for conducting challenge in

914
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:49,020
the future obviously I mean self-evident

915
00:31:49,020 --> 00:31:51,960
that it's not going to look like this

916
00:31:51,960 --> 00:31:53,760
because they've done it once because

917
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,380
they've gone through that psychological

918
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,240
process and they have engaged in a

919
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,159
challenge they now know that it's going

920
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:02,779
to work out okay that it's not strange

921
00:32:03,020 --> 00:32:05,039
it is a little bit strange I'll be

922
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:08,220
honest uh when

923
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,600
um they come to this in the future

924
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,980
they're building all that positive

925
00:32:10,980 --> 00:32:12,360
sentiment and what else have they done

926
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:14,880
they've beat a bad guy they have won

927
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:17,100
against an immediate threat Avatar

928
00:32:17,100 --> 00:32:18,779
that's quite powerful but I'm not going

929
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:19,860
to end it there it would be kind of

930
00:32:19,860 --> 00:32:22,260
suspicious if I went good job

931
00:32:22,260 --> 00:32:23,520
I'm going to give him a good quality

932
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,960
debrief

933
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,659
congratulations yes absolutely that is

934
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:29,340
an exercise I'm here with a cyber

935
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:32,039
confident team and this is my ID you can

936
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:33,480
verify if you like

937
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:34,799
uh we're here doing this exercise

938
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,419
because we want to reinforce how

939
00:32:36,419 --> 00:32:39,179
important constructive challenges and

940
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:40,980
you did great you did a really good job

941
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:43,320
so thank you so much for that it's a

942
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,940
really important thing you need to know

943
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:46,679
that this isn't a test it's not an

944
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:49,260
assessment we never do that uh I just

945
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:50,399
want to give you the opportunity to

946
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,200
practice and you did great so well done

947
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:54,480
uh and one last thing

948
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:57,380
um I'm going to leave you with

949
00:32:57,659 --> 00:32:59,460
this uh little card here it's green

950
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:01,080
stands out on your desk if you put it

951
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:03,240
there then my team know and we won't

952
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:04,380
come and get you again for a little

953
00:33:04,380 --> 00:33:05,640
while anyway

954
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,580
uh and next time you're not gonna be

955
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:10,380
wearing a t-shirts so watch out for that

956
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:12,419
uh what it does is lets you and others

957
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:14,100
around you know how important challenge

958
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:16,200
is so thank you so much for taking part

959
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:17,399
in the exercise

960
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:20,220
yeah no thank you that was really weird

961
00:33:20,220 --> 00:33:22,380
but there was no way I could say yes to

962
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:24,299
you there was just too many too many

963
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:26,519
things and I'll get the ID thing next

964
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:28,380
time as well yeah exactly it's weirder

965
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:29,700
on stage

966
00:33:29,700 --> 00:33:31,980
so a bit of an odd a different exercise

967
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:35,340
but for me that was really useful I had

968
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,779
to take all of those different things

969
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:38,640
those different bits of information that

970
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,320
might have suggested risk and build that

971
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,120
picture up for myself I had to

972
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,559
understand that something wasn't quite

973
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:45,120
right and then I had to challenge him

974
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:47,940
I've now got a script that next time I

975
00:33:47,940 --> 00:33:50,100
can use if I need to that helps me feel

976
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,860
confident and I know that mod expects me

977
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,539
to challenge this is something that we

978
00:33:54,539 --> 00:33:57,140
have to do now

979
00:33:57,179 --> 00:34:00,419
so that simple exercise repeated

980
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:03,179
multiple times is how we're starting to

981
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:05,880
change behaviors and we are

982
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:08,339
so far we've done this exercise 22 times

983
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:11,520
and engaged 850 people directly which

984
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,899
means we've engaged between two and

985
00:34:12,899 --> 00:34:15,960
three thousand people indirectly as well

986
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:18,000
we've done this on multiple sites in the

987
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,639
UK including the only site where they

988
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:22,080
don't have to issue a warning before

989
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:24,839
firing which adds a certain element of

990
00:34:24,839 --> 00:34:27,899
spice to the exercise for everyone

991
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,940
but when we followed up on this we can

992
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:31,619
see that it's starting to work

993
00:34:31,619 --> 00:34:34,500
77 of people report the exercise as

994
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,440
being engaging and useful while 62 of

995
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,239
people reported a positive sentiment

996
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:42,000
towards us towards challenge after the

997
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,820
exercise the remaining 38 reported a

998
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,679
neutral which meant that no one reported

999
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:48,659
any negative sentiment towards

1000
00:34:48,659 --> 00:34:51,359
challenging afterwards we're starting to

1001
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:52,918
change people's perceptions of that

1002
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:54,599
behavior

1003
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:56,399
but this is also starting to affect

1004
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:57,780
their cognitions

1005
00:34:57,780 --> 00:35:00,240
91 of people told us that they would now

1006
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:02,099
feel confident in raising a challenge if

1007
00:35:02,099 --> 00:35:04,080
they felt that they needed to

1008
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,940
but it's not just the stats and the

1009
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,500
numbers and as important as they are

1010
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,900
it's the stories that people tell about

1011
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,520
challenging and the things that they do

1012
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,320
as a result

1013
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:15,300
we've had security advisors come back

1014
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:17,099
and tell us that that people on their

1015
00:35:17,099 --> 00:35:18,900
site are starting to challenge more and

1016
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,700
they're doing it in the right ways and

1017
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:22,500
importantly in our environment they're

1018
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:25,200
also doing that up the chain of command

1019
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:27,839
the no Mr cyber threat cheesy line in

1020
00:35:27,839 --> 00:35:29,460
the role play well that was something

1021
00:35:29,460 --> 00:35:31,380
that was actually shouted at us in one

1022
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:32,760
of the engagements

1023
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,460
in the middle of a really really busy

1024
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:38,099
office someone stood up and shouted that

1025
00:35:38,099 --> 00:35:40,140
exact phrase at us

1026
00:35:40,140 --> 00:35:41,940
now whilst that makes us go a little bit

1027
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,740
red and we look a little bit silly

1028
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:46,200
actually it's an incredible outcome

1029
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,119
it's opened up that game World from

1030
00:35:48,119 --> 00:35:50,460
being a one-to-one relationship to a one

1031
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:52,680
to many everyone else on that floor

1032
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,839
plate has now had an experience of the

1033
00:35:54,839 --> 00:35:56,579
floor Walker and has joined in on the

1034
00:35:56,579 --> 00:35:58,740
exercise with us it's helping us to

1035
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:00,900
spread the effect to a much wider group

1036
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,400
in a much quicker in a quick and

1037
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,200
effective way

1038
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,359
we've been heckled out of seconds floor

1039
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:09,000
story windows and we've had people turn

1040
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,640
the challenge back on us as well go on

1041
00:36:11,640 --> 00:36:13,200
try and get me again I bet you won't be

1042
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,060
able to do it next time

1043
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:16,980
all of these things showed that the

1044
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:19,560
exercise is starting to work we can

1045
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,480
literally see it in people's reactions

1046
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:24,119
as they do that lining up of stimuli and

1047
00:36:24,119 --> 00:36:25,500
realize that they have to do something

1048
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,220
about it

1049
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:31,380
and obviously importantly everywhere

1050
00:36:31,380 --> 00:36:32,640
that we've been has asked us to return

1051
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,380
and do it again so we must be doing

1052
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,480
something right

1053
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,880
so he mentioned that we always want

1054
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,859
people to have a positive experience of

1055
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:42,000
challenging

1056
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,920
so just how do we do that well first we

1057
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,140
have to accept that there are risks in

1058
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:47,700
this kind of exercise

1059
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,380
not Everyone likes to be engaged

1060
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,900
directly and they may we may have

1061
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,339
colleagues who are not necessarily

1062
00:36:53,339 --> 00:36:56,940
neurotypical and so engaging them

1063
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:59,280
directly may actually impact people's

1064
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,020
feelings of psychological safety or

1065
00:37:01,020 --> 00:37:03,000
well-being

1066
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,460
likewise if people feel as though they

1067
00:37:05,460 --> 00:37:07,140
fail some kind of exercise without even

1068
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,880
having got up from their desk well again

1069
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,500
those feelings may just be adversely

1070
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,540
impacted

1071
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:14,339
because of the kinds of sites that we're

1072
00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:15,780
going to and the information that are

1073
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:17,760
held on them there is a genuine risk of

1074
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,200
us actually causing some kind of

1075
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,060
incident or being strong-armed off a

1076
00:37:21,060 --> 00:37:22,440
site

1077
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:24,060
but understanding and accepting these

1078
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,200
risks means that we're able to do

1079
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,520
something about them

1080
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,260
we constantly update the language that

1081
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:29,940
we use in the exercises to make sure

1082
00:37:29,940 --> 00:37:31,800
that we don't hit any soft spots for a

1083
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,240
particular site and upset anyone

1084
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,440
inadvertently

1085
00:37:34,440 --> 00:37:36,060
we've changed the t-shirts to make them

1086
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:37,740
even brighter and jazzier and stand out

1087
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:40,020
even more with stronger slogans so it's

1088
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,700
so obvious that we are not supposed to

1089
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,859
be there and we've built up our kit over

1090
00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:44,880
time

1091
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:47,579
the USB stick that PSY handed me is just

1092
00:37:47,579 --> 00:37:49,920
a 3D printed bit of plastic with either

1093
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:52,619
hack or virus written on the side of it

1094
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:54,480
and we always use a dummy phone as well

1095
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,040
when we go on site so that we don't

1096
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,680
break our own rules regarding Peds

1097
00:37:58,680 --> 00:37:59,640
but there are things that are

1098
00:37:59,640 --> 00:38:01,079
fundamentally built into the fabric of

1099
00:38:01,079 --> 00:38:02,520
the exercise as well that help to keep

1100
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:04,980
it safe we always have two observers on

1101
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,480
every exercise that can see the

1102
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,040
engagement and they're in constant

1103
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:09,660
Communications through a covert radio

1104
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:12,420
kit so they can see and hear and talk to

1105
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:14,520
the floor Walker the whole time so if

1106
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:15,900
someone does have a particularly strong

1107
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:17,880
response we're able to step in and

1108
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,320
intervene if we need to

1109
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:20,640
we always make sure that the right

1110
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,200
people know that we are supposed to be

1111
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,940
there we have the permission from the

1112
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,440
right people and they know exactly what

1113
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:26,940
is going to happen we keep that

1114
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,980
permission on as a printed version of it

1115
00:38:28,980 --> 00:38:30,839
so that again if someone does respond

1116
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:32,400
robustly we can show them that we're

1117
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,680
actually supposed to be there

1118
00:38:34,680 --> 00:38:37,440
in fact the final thing just as I did in

1119
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,079
the exercise we always do a debrief we

1120
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:41,640
don't just let the person flounder and

1121
00:38:41,640 --> 00:38:43,079
think what on Earth was that that's just

1122
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:45,359
happened we explain the principles of

1123
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:46,680
why we've done it and what we were

1124
00:38:46,680 --> 00:38:48,660
trying to achieve we let them know that

1125
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:50,700
they did a great job even if it takes a

1126
00:38:50,700 --> 00:38:52,200
little bit of nudging to get them there

1127
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:53,820
so that they feel confident in being

1128
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:56,040
able to do it

1129
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,619
all of these things help us to keep

1130
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:00,720
control of the exercise and make sure

1131
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:04,759
that we're doing it in a safe way

1132
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,040
and so that is how we are starting to

1133
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:09,300
tackle the fail to challenge

1134
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:11,640
vulnerability now I appreciate there was

1135
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,040
an awful lot of nuance to information in

1136
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,780
that but we just want to leave you with

1137
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:19,380
three key takeaways for today

1138
00:39:19,380 --> 00:39:20,880
so the first one

1139
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,000
gamification doesn't have to be hard

1140
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:25,980
it doesn't have to take a long time to

1141
00:39:25,980 --> 00:39:27,720
do and it doesn't have to cost the Earth

1142
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:30,240
either in our example the game world was

1143
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:32,400
set up in a matter of seconds and it

1144
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:34,380
cost as much as it did to print some 3D

1145
00:39:34,380 --> 00:39:37,980
USB sticks and make some T-shirts

1146
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,960
and it also draws on the same skills

1147
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:41,359
that a lot of us already have

1148
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,680
effectively we're socially engineering a

1149
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,480
response for someone but rather than

1150
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:47,820
doing it for mischievous purposes we're

1151
00:39:47,820 --> 00:39:51,000
doing it for a positive outcome

1152
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,220
training doesn't have to be 30 minutes

1153
00:39:53,220 --> 00:39:55,980
once a year micro doses like this the

1154
00:39:55,980 --> 00:39:57,300
fact that we're doing 30 seconds is

1155
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,099
going to have vastly more impact and

1156
00:39:59,099 --> 00:40:01,260
it's more memorable step outside of what

1157
00:40:01,260 --> 00:40:02,880
it is and think about what training and

1158
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,980
learning could be definitely position

1159
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:08,720
motivation right at the center of it

1160
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,520
we obviously want you to take the

1161
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,619
principles from today and go away and

1162
00:40:13,619 --> 00:40:15,359
try and apply them to your work

1163
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:17,160
cyan I genuinely believe that by

1164
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:18,480
applying Behavioral Science or

1165
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:21,060
psychology to the things that we do we

1166
00:40:21,060 --> 00:40:22,859
can help organizations to become more

1167
00:40:22,859 --> 00:40:24,119
cyber resilient

1168
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:26,040
but we can't break people in the process

1169
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:29,220
there's no point in making things worse

1170
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:31,680
we have to keep people safe

1171
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:34,020
so if we do this make sure that we have

1172
00:40:34,020 --> 00:40:36,359
the right controls in place make sure

1173
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:37,980
that we have the things there to ensure

1174
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,740
that exercises run safely and we don't

1175
00:40:40,740 --> 00:40:45,140
inadvertently cause more harm than good

1176
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,760
so the final thing to say is thank you

1177
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:49,560

1178

1179

00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:55,740
