1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:03,720
[Music]

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,720
foreign

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:11,099
you may or may not know it but you are

4
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:13,139
sitting in the largest lock note session

5
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:16,619
ever by far and we're all suitably

6
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:18,660
impressed that so many people turned out

7
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,460
for us so there's like no pressure here

8
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:25,199
[Laughter]

9
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,140
in our overseas events sort of as a

10
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:31,740
corollary to Keynote lock note and we

11
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:34,140
were really trying to create a nice kind

12
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:36,899
of anticlimactic way to wind down the

13
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:38,579
conference with some insights from the

14
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:39,600
people

15
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,340
who took all the time out of their

16
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:43,559
personal lives to actually review and

17
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:45,719
help select the content

18
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,420
and so it's a great way to say well this

19
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,800
is how you thought the sessions might

20
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,000
turn out or these are the trends you

21
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,340
thought were important now that you've

22
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:54,420
done it

23
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:56,280
how does it feel what what did you gain

24
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,620
as an inside you know what did you think

25
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:01,980
and the other idea is we're going to try

26
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:04,260
to run this like a conversation where

27
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:06,240
you're sitting there in the audience and

28
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,640
we're all friends and we're having a

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,020
conversation and you're sort of

30
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:11,220
listening in

31
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:14,460
and then further on in a session we'll

32
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,140
try to open it up we have a microphone

33
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:17,820
here in the middle and we'll take

34
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:19,619
questions from you and sometimes it's

35
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:20,939
interactive we'll ask people to raise

36
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:22,020
their hands if we're like trying to

37
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:25,320
argue over something one year was nobody

38
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,780
buys deception services

39
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,400
somebody else said no I think some

40
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,799
people so we asked the audience one

41
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:34,080
person bought deception services

42
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,880
don't invest in that

43
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,619
I think that's going to work out very

44
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:38,820
well

45
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,840
so I'm going to introduce our panel here

46
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,460
and then I want to kind of kick it off

47
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:47,280
with some questions and away we go ready

48
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,000
you bet okay on my right we have Chris

49
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,200
Eng from Vera code long time I'm looking

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,659
I think we switched so now we've now

51
00:01:57,659 --> 00:01:59,640
we've messed it all up I'm sorry I kind

52
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:00,899
of look the same but I give that

53
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:02,520
confused as well it was just a test if

54
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,000
you remember stage right Zoom for so

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,619
long

56
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:11,099
um from Vera code long time contributor

57
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:12,660
in security space

58
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,520
um and on the United States on the U.S

59
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:17,099
briefings review board

60
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:20,400
okay and then we have Natalie solvanovic

61
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,580
from Google also on the U.S briefings

62
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,959
review board

63
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,440
uh we've got Justine bone from medsec

64
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,920
and she's on the ciso review board and

65
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,860
the US briefings review board and then

66
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:36,180
on my

67
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,300
my right your left

68
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:42,000
Matt swish from magnet forensics and

69
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:43,440
he's on the United States review board

70
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,500
and also our European review board okay

71
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,260
so I'm just going to quickly start

72
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:51,840
with Chris and just say a little bit

73
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,120
about like maybe your area that you're

74
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,860
really interested in like what you pay

75
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:57,480
attention to because you can't all pay

76
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,980
attention to the submissions there are

77
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,660
what how many submissions how many

78
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,760
hundred thousand a thousand to a

79
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,040
thousand yeah over a thousand

80
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,319
submissions and you can't do that

81
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:09,540
without your eyes bleeding right so what

82
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:11,159
is your approach let's start off with

83
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:13,319
Chris well mine was uh application

84
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:16,319
security it's been my focus in my career

85
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,379
for the past 20 years and so I've had

86
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:21,420
the fortune to be the track lead for

87
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,640
application security this year it's been

88
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:25,980
called app stack it's been called sdlc a

89
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:28,319
few different things in the past but

90
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,300
um just amazing amazing submissions that

91
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:31,459
we get in application security

92
00:03:31,459 --> 00:03:34,860
everything which covers a pretty wide

93
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,560
gamut right everything from sdlc and CI

94
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,459
CD pipelines to web 3 and just standard

95
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:44,459
web attacks that's a big big category so

96
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:47,040
I spent most of my time during this show

97
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,860
almost going exclusively to apps track

98
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:52,379
abstract talks because uh you know

99
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:53,819
that's that's kind of what I want that's

100
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:55,379
your jam and I want to make sure we're

101
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:57,180
picking correctly and I think you know I

102
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,159
think how do you tell I mean is it based

103
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,019
on how many heads are in the room that

104
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:03,239
doesn't seem like a great metric or how

105
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,280
do you get a good feedback a feel if you

106
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,540
did right

107
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:10,140
yeah it's it's uh sometimes like title

108
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,420
selection is very hard yeah we find and

109
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,700
so you you know you can have the most

110
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,858
amazing technical content and then you

111
00:04:16,858 --> 00:04:18,540
don't have a great title you may not get

112
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,399
a lot of people in the room but you know

113
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:21,660
the good thing is you can always go back

114
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:23,940
and watch those later yeah and and find

115
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:26,040
out and you hear you know I like to go

116
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,600
to Twitter and just find out see what

117
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:30,060
people are chattering about and see oh I

118
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,280
missed that one looks like it was you

119
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:35,280
know better than the abstract made it

120
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,660
out to be so I'll go back and watch it

121
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:38,160
on YouTube or watch it on the website

122
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,440
I'm going to make an assumption and I

123
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,759
hope I'm improved wrong but my

124
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,479
assumption is Google Natalie app set

125
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:48,440
uh yes

126
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,639
or cloud or what is it what is it you

127
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:52,919
you like to yeah so I leave the hardware

128
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:54,720
track so

129
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,060
um at Black Cat I really love going to

130
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,060
the hardware talks these will range from

131
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,000
subtle and interesting CPU bugs to

132
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:07,199
hacking crazy wild targets like cars or

133
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,800
satellites by day I'm on Project zero at

134
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:14,100
Google so I'm also super interested in

135
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:16,680
exploit development and how to get code

136
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:19,320
execution on all sorts of targets

137
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,360
so it's at variety like you're looking

138
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,280
for some uniqueness there right not

139
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,979
necessarily the micro optimization in

140
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:27,539
some exploit chain you want to see

141
00:05:27,539 --> 00:05:30,419
something new and exciting yeah I always

142
00:05:30,419 --> 00:05:32,820
feel like I get the best ideas for new

143
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,220
bugs and new exploits from black hat I

144
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:38,220
love seeing uh yeah new stuff

145
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:43,440
all right let's talk uh over to Justine

146
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,780
tell us a little bit yes so gone to my

147
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:48,539
hardware and upset days Once Upon a Time

148
00:05:48,539 --> 00:05:52,500
sure but today I'm on the policy track

149
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,759
um and so when I look at this is that

150
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:56,639
another word for management wow story of

151
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,160
my life right here yeah um so it's it's

152
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:00,660
quite tricky though with the briefings

153
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,580
reviews because you know you've got a

154
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,960
very technical audience and you're

155
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,759
looking at policy submissions so you've

156
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,280
got to try to find that content that's

157
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,380
relevant to technical folks but is still

158
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,180
talking about policy so I try to look

159
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,840
for things that are disruptive ideas

160
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,000
um disruptive like I've got something

161
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,220
crazy here on fire and therefore or

162
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:23,759
disruptive but realistic but perhaps

163
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,300
slightly out there ideas not clickbaity

164
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:30,000
no I'll never yeah no no no you're never

165
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,340
going to get away with that and then but

166
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,539
um you know there were a couple for

167
00:06:33,539 --> 00:06:35,039
example that

168
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,139
um once again Revisited vulnerability

169
00:06:37,139 --> 00:06:39,360
disclosure but they were slightly

170
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,800
outside the box there was one

171
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,539
presentation about vulnerability

172
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:45,479
disclosure on the blockchain

173
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:48,900
yes yes so so things like that that

174
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,940
maybe bring together you know some level

175
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,100
of innovation and Technology along with

176
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,919
a policy idea but in addition of course

177
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,100
with the with the CSO Summit

178
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,580
um it's a lot easier to consider policy

179
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,100
or strategy or you know governance

180
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,560
issues because that's the audience so do

181
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,880
you find yourself

182
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,800
for the briefings focusing on sort of

183
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,199
like tactical policy and for the ciso

184
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,840
more like strategic exactly or a policy

185
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,460
that will impact

186
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,880
the you know in a in a tactical way a

187
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,860
more technical room you know so this is

188
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,960
a policy shift that might impact my my

189
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,120
role as a security analyst or as an

190
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,580
expert or as a security researcher as

191
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,560
opposed to a policy that might influence

192
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,740
a change in corporate governance or you

193
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,479
know regulation or something like that

194
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,720
right excellent okay I do miss those

195
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:43,340
Hardware on Epic days I'll get back

196
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:47,280
Matt uh with the word magnet forensics I

197
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,539
think I have a lead on what you're

198
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:50,699
interested in yeah I mean I've always

199
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:54,539
been involved with the dfil track uh but

200
00:07:54,539 --> 00:07:57,060
as you all know like we often happen to

201
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,680
be in multiple tracks to help other

202
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,479
people to review the submissions because

203
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,120
we get so many yeah uh I mean the

204
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,919
exploit development one is cool like the

205
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:07,440
platform security one is pretty cool uh

206
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,840
application security School although no

207
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,699
we don't know if production stuff is

208
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:13,979
maybe like web free security letter you

209
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:17,160
know you and I want to talk about web3 I

210
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,419
mean I think we should I think we should

211
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:20,039
have a new like track in the next few

212
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:22,159
years

213
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:24,240
you're saying all these things are cool

214
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,740
it's like is there anything not cool

215
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:30,180
can we do like a hands up on we're sure

216
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:32,099
and blockchain like who would like to

217
00:08:32,099 --> 00:08:34,140
see a blockchain trick

218
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,360
a web free security track I like the

219
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,240
name better okay

220
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:41,458
I think you have to Define what web3 is

221
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:44,940
yeah we'll do that besides unicorn

222
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:47,700
like 700 million dollars you know for it

223
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,200
you know it's bigger than the Central

224
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,459
Bank there are a lot of security

225
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:52,080
Consulting companies making a lot of

226
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:53,880
money from with three bucks right now

227
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,440
yeah

228
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,640
yeah

229
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,440
awesome awesome so I'm glad we sorted

230
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,779
that yeah okay so so that's your jam

231
00:09:00,779 --> 00:09:03,779
you're into as long as the technical

232
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:05,580
presentations like

233
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:07,500
um especially uh when you go to a

234
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,760
conference you like to select technical

235
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,019
content

236
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:11,940
if it can be a blog post you know that

237
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,140
should not be a presentation it's

238
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:14,820
usually like my decision tree you know

239
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:16,260
should that be a blog post and I can

240
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,580
just read it at home or is it really

241
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:20,160
worth attending the presentation right

242
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:21,480
for me it's one of the biggest like

243
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,760
decision maker but just like Chris you

244
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,500
know I like to watch like the slides and

245
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:26,940
the presentations like later because

246
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:28,560
it's impossible to see everything so

247
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,760
when you're doing your sort of mental

248
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,980
filtration it sounds like you've got one

249
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:34,140
of your first hurdles is can this be a

250
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,839
well-written blog post if yes 100 write

251
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:39,839
the blog post yeah and if not it has to

252
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,880
have something additional yeah one of

253
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,740
the things I like to think about too is

254
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:46,140
are you elevating the speaker by giving

255
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,560
them a stage right is this a person a

256
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,240
group a community you want to put on a

257
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,940
stage in front of other people

258
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:56,279
um basically be implicitly endorsing

259
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:57,959
them and it seems like this is a concern

260
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:00,180
that's newer before it was just purely

261
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,220
look at the technical yeah and now we're

262
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:04,440
having to look at more aspects right

263
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:05,580
yeah

264
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,779
um so I'm wondering does anybody else

265
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:09,360
have your sort of You Must Be This Tall

266
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,899
I I try to I try to you know address

267
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:16,080
bias right and I tried my my sort of

268
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,760
methodology is

269
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,620
you know obviously focus on the content

270
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,779
and I almost don't want to know who's

271
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:23,940
submitted this and you know where they

272
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:26,160
work and whether you know I've heard of

273
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,779
them before or anything like that and I

274
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:28,920
thought so I try to go through the

275
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,200
content first and then if I'm asking

276
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,580
myself more questions I'll go back and

277
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,380
say are they incredible okay let's read

278
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:36,660
through bio or you know but we shouldn't

279
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,700
be you know obviously stopping

280
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:40,560
opportunity for people who are new to

281
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,519
presenting right um so at Defcon we have

282
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:47,579
an ability to submit anonymously so if

283
00:10:47,579 --> 00:10:49,440
you don't want any of that to be

284
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,240
considered yeah

285
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:52,440
um that gives some people some

286
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,000
confidence to submit that normally might

287
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,519
not yeah yeah but it's hard because

288
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:58,680
there are also people with amazing track

289
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:00,600
records you're consistently producing

290
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,399
that always produce you know and we come

291
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:03,779
here to see these people present so

292
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:05,959
right the Dan Kaminsky track

293
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:08,700
yeah when Dan would submit basically you

294
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:10,800
knew you were accepting Dan yeah I look

295
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,620
for practicality a lot more than I think

296
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,779
that I used to

297
00:11:15,779 --> 00:11:17,519
um I mean what changed then well I think

298
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,720
you know if you go back to the early

299
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,120
days there was definitely a lot of uh

300
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,260
you know you have to get the headline

301
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,760
you have to get the coverage of this

302
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,680
really cool hack this really cool

303
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:27,660
exploit that's that's coming out at

304
00:11:27,660 --> 00:11:28,980
Black Cat and there's going to be this

305
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,260
this big media blitz around it and while

306
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,880
there you know there is still some of

307
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:34,260
that you know as the profession has

308
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:35,820
turned into something that's a little

309
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:37,860
bit more disciplined and it's you know

310
00:11:37,860 --> 00:11:40,560
so multi fasted

311
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:42,899
I feel like there has to be a takeaway

312
00:11:42,899 --> 00:11:45,600
there has to be something more than

313
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:47,880
like this person did this really cool

314
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:48,720
hack

315
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,279
that's great and more than the

316
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:53,279
celebration of the feet exactly yeah how

317
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:56,040
do I Advance the state of the art back

318
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:58,500
you know when I go back home to my to my

319
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,420
organization right what do I do and so

320
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:01,740
you know

321
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,660
that's that's accomplished by some of

322
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:06,420
these talks like you know James Kettle

323
00:12:06,420 --> 00:12:08,040
is always pushing the boundaries like

324
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,860
here's a here's another new way that

325
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,200
HTTP is broken

326
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:16,440
that that breaks all assumptions that

327
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,839
then every pen tester can go back and

328
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:21,779
use starting like probably tomorrow it

329
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:23,100
pushes the state of the art it lets you

330
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,240
find new things that you didn't know

331
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,339
about before right anything you know

332
00:12:26,339 --> 00:12:28,980
that's a tool even or a new practice or

333
00:12:28,980 --> 00:12:30,480
a new way of thinking about something

334
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,519
you can take back yeah there may be a

335
00:12:32,519 --> 00:12:34,920
cool hack along with that but if there's

336
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,899
a good technique that you can then go

337
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:38,579
add to your Arsenal I feel like there

338
00:12:38,579 --> 00:12:39,839
has to be some kind of practical

339
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:41,360
takeaway yeah

340
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,920
and every single every single thing that

341
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:46,079
I that I review yeah yeah I definitely

342
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,700
find that with the hardware track like

343
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,680
there definitely is like the call of the

344
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,560
cool like the wow you know they made

345
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,899
that cars windshield wipers flip back

346
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,180
and forth and certainly

347
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:58,860
um that that is part of the hardware

348
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:01,019
track and I kind of feel like maybe

349
00:13:01,019 --> 00:13:03,300
every year there's one talk we pick just

350
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,459
because the target is like so awesome

351
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:07,800
that um

352
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:09,240
maybe we're less concerned about

353
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:10,920
concerned about the technical stuff but

354
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,660
then there's so many other cool things

355
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,579
yeah for example there was lots of fault

356
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:17,519
injection this year lots of CPU bugs and

357
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:19,260
while those are also very cool they just

358
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:23,220
don't have the same same large appeal

359
00:13:23,220 --> 00:13:27,000
same almost spectacular and some of the

360
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,040
other submissions and your track is um

361
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,839
is it sort of like a when there used to

362
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:32,820
be sort of an iot track we there's be

363
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:34,800
like iot junk hacking we'd call it oh

364
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:36,240
another embedded system running another

365
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,279
ancient you know it's like it doesn't

366
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,480
matter what it's running it's the same

367
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:41,100
system that's you know so we'd call it

368
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,660
junk hacking it's the same sort of thing

369
00:13:42,660 --> 00:13:44,760
happening now it's sort of like somebody

370
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:46,500
learns a technique and now 30 people

371
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,500
submit on that technique so it's hard to

372
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,000
weed out the ones that actually are

373
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:53,100
doing the unique thing yeah that's

374
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,459
definitely

375
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,000
definitely kind of apply the same

376
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,620
two new targets and then there's the

377
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,600
ones that actually have new stuff in

378
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,300
them yeah

379
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,500
so

380
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,540
favorite talks things that wild you

381
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,459
things that didn't surprise you

382
00:14:11,459 --> 00:14:13,079
you know

383
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:14,880
so when I think about

384
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,720
um

385
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,540
it's not you know

386
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,519
the ciso summit operates under Chatham

387
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:22,320
House Rules so it's it's a very safe

388
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,240
space for csos to share their

389
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:25,980
insecurities and raise questions and

390
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,139
kind of think about existential issues

391
00:14:28,139 --> 00:14:30,480
you know you you're you're csos that

392
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,339
perhaps you work with might appear to be

393
00:14:32,339 --> 00:14:33,839
super confident and know how to solve

394
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,339
every problem but believe me when they

395
00:14:35,339 --> 00:14:36,779
get together in the ciso summit there's

396
00:14:36,779 --> 00:14:40,620
a lot of insecurity and questioning

397
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,600
um and we you know we ask ourselves

398
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:44,160
questions like where do we belong in an

399
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,720
organization and

400
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,820
um is you know we you know we understand

401
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,920
cyber security no longer just a

402
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,899
technical issue so one of the awesome

403
00:14:51,899 --> 00:14:53,459
Concepts that we talked about this time

404
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:55,740
actually was cyber security belonging to

405
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:58,500
the ESG initiative of a company the

406
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,000
environmental social governance

407
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,480
component of a company as opposed to

408
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:04,560
cyber security as a technical

409
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,540
responsibility which was

410
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,639
um rather an out there concept to be I I

411
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,220
don't know I want to think halvar but it

412
00:15:11,220 --> 00:15:13,079
wasn't halvar but somebody was did the

413
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:14,579
company the the

414
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:16,320
the I think it was the Specter or the

415
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:19,800
Meltdown CPU microcode patch

416
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:21,360
added something like one to two percent

417
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,760
extra CPU cycles and somebody calculated

418
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,120
the carbon load of how much more

419
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,820
pollution that's a very literal right

420
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:32,519
like Amazon is now putting out 69 000

421
00:15:32,519 --> 00:15:34,980
more tons like a bug and an ESG impact

422
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:36,779
right and so when I hear this I think

423
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:38,880
that's probably not far out there I bet

424
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:40,139
in the future when you're reading about

425
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,699
the impacts you're also going to see and

426
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:44,699
99 new tons of something or other on the

427
00:15:44,699 --> 00:15:48,660
Azure Cloud yeah real cost a lot of it

428
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:51,420
was about you know um sharing

429
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,339
responsibility and less sort of

430
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:56,459
centralized cyber security oversight so

431
00:15:56,459 --> 00:15:57,959
for example there's always that

432
00:15:57,959 --> 00:15:59,820
conversation about cyber security in the

433
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:02,040
boardroom and now we've got the SEC

434
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,199
saying that you know companies should

435
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:06,240
have cyber security expertise in the

436
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,160
boardroom but the interesting problem

437
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,560
that we've got to be cognizant of is if

438
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,360
we've got this sort of concentrated

439
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:15,360
cyber security expert you know one of us

440
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,560
we're sitting now on the board of

441
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,079
directors the risk with that is the rest

442
00:16:19,079 --> 00:16:20,940
of the board will kind of Point

443
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,920
responsibility for cyber security to

444
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:25,740
that person and not share that risk

445
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,300
across the board and across the whole

446
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,920
leadership of the company which is

447
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,839
really how things should be so a lot of

448
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:33,240
talk about sort of centralized ownership

449
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,100
and management of cyber security as

450
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,259
opposed to everything being shared plus

451
00:16:37,259 --> 00:16:38,699
they're probably really excited to see

452
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:42,500
each other after two years

453
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:45,779
also a very full room yeah yeah I just

454
00:16:45,779 --> 00:16:47,399
kind of show from hands how many people

455
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:49,920
by showbands did not expect so many

456
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:52,019
people to be be here

457
00:16:52,019 --> 00:16:54,660
I did not yeah I did not I mean I knew

458
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:56,100
people would be here but I was pretty

459
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,740
surprised like it came rowing back and

460
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:01,320
uh people are registering to conferences

461
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:03,600
later and later so it's very hard on the

462
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,419
organizers because it comes in the last

463
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:07,980
wave just like when you get your

464
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:09,839
submissions how many of your submissions

465
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:12,000
come in on the last couple days is that

466
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:13,939
just when you think you're done

467
00:17:13,939 --> 00:17:16,859
pretty much yeah no every year it's like

468
00:17:16,859 --> 00:17:19,199
wow 30 submissions I can handle that and

469
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:20,699
then like one hour before the deadline

470
00:17:20,699 --> 00:17:25,020
it's like well 250. yeah 250 in the last

471
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:27,419
hour take that in how much time do you

472
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:28,700
think she's going to put to those

473
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:31,799
considerations versus the people from

474
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:36,240
two weeks earlier oh yes beer please

475
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:39,020
thank you thank you

476
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:41,580
ah it doesn't matter I'll take an IPA

477
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,380
thank you

478
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:45,419
so it was supposed to be you observing

479
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:48,020
us having a casual conversation

480
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,700
we need to have the beer to have the

481
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,179
conversation

482
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:59,660
okay you go for the IPA okay the thing

483
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:03,000
250 submissions at the end is that you

484
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:04,740
know you kind of get review or burnout

485
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:06,600
thank you right and the last thing you

486
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,220
want to do is review a submission when

487
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:09,840
you're feeling exhausted and burned out

488
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,460
and all the words are just blurring on

489
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:13,140
the page and it's so tempting to click

490
00:18:13,140 --> 00:18:15,179
next next and it sounds like the other

491
00:18:15,179 --> 00:18:17,039
one yeah so you you know you've got to

492
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:18,179
sort of go away you got to manage your

493
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:19,679
time and come back and be refreshed and

494
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,360
give everybody a fair chance so when

495
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:23,100
people submit and they say I got it on

496
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:24,179
the deadline when are you going to tell

497
00:18:24,179 --> 00:18:25,500
me

498
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,059
it's like well you've got to wait weeks

499
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:30,179
now because they have to digest this

500
00:18:30,179 --> 00:18:32,820
huge meal that arrives you if you submit

501
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,580
like two weeks before like one week

502
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:39,179
before you'll get so much more like like

503
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:42,660
better quality review okay like I try to

504
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:45,059
keep up with it I try to you know I

505
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:46,980
don't know four weeks before I start to

506
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:49,440
you know start to review you know maybe

507
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,360
like 10 talks a day or something like

508
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,520
that and I I always try to keep up with

509
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,840
it and then of course that last day

510
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:58,260
comes and then a fully 50 to 75 percent

511
00:18:58,260 --> 00:19:00,179
of the total come in on that last day

512
00:19:00,179 --> 00:19:02,700
yeah and you know some people can plow

513
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,160
through them uh but I do think that you

514
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:06,419
know you give a little bit of short

515
00:19:06,419 --> 00:19:08,880
Thrift doing that so the ones that come

516
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,220
in early like I'm reading those like

517
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:13,020
well I'm putting a lot of attention on

518
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,280
those because it's the only thing I have

519
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,419
to do yeah I would say the ones that

520
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:16,500
come in earlier the ones that get

521
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,820
probably the most attention I mean

522
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,700
that's how I operate

523
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,799
reviewing I'm reviewing yeah I'm gonna

524
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,480
say there actually is an advantage to

525
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:25,919
submitting early in they don't

526
00:19:25,919 --> 00:19:27,600
necessarily do the best but we do pick

527
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,580
some talks early so if it's a very

528
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,980
strong solution exactly and I noticed

529
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,559
that you get feedback in the early when

530
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,179
it's late we don't have time to get your

531
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:38,760
q a right feedback and the and the other

532
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,460
no-brainer is if the review board asks a

533
00:19:41,460 --> 00:19:43,919
question like a follow-up question you

534
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,440
must respond you know eloquently and

535
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,360
yeah some people are going to make it

536
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,039
easy to review the presentations because

537
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:51,960
they don't have a good abstract you know

538
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,400
like it's like they put no effort in

539
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,960
submitting so those ones that are easy

540
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,260
to dismiss that's the good thing I'm

541
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,820
going to uh I'm gonna shift the topic a

542
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,020
little bit

543
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,160
um

544
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,900
Russia Ukraine

545
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:05,820
we saw it influence some of the

546
00:20:05,820 --> 00:20:07,440
submissions maybe around disinformation

547
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,780
or misinformation or maybe some Network

548
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:13,320
and attack or apt but um I'm curious

549
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:15,000
kind of more professionally bigger

550
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,740
picture

551
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:19,799
are we as an industry like

552
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:22,500
used to dealing with sort of Apt levels

553
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,020
and every other weird Cry of cyber War

554
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:28,080
now that it's actually here

555
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,880
is it what we expected

556
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,280
did it you know it's sort of like when I

557
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,320
talk to people involved and I'd say do

558
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:36,539
you think Russia's used all their

559
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:38,580
techniques or are they sitting on some

560
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:40,620
for some reason the general consensus

561
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,600
seems to be that we've seen it all kind

562
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,160
of seeing one of each of everything I

563
00:20:44,160 --> 00:20:46,020
would say very careful of taking that

564
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,000
position well they said why would you

565
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,559
wait why would you wait six months in

566
00:20:49,559 --> 00:20:52,799
but you know you know my father was in

567
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,320
was in Russian counter Espionage he'd

568
00:20:55,320 --> 00:20:56,760
probably kill me now for saying this on

569
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:59,400
a stage yeah but it's so long ago right

570
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,900
um and one thing that he will say is

571
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:03,000
these people who he has a lot of respect

572
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:06,900
for think long term and on those I'm

573
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,179
sure but if you looked at the attack the

574
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:11,400
first week was nothing but attack and

575
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:13,740
then a week of nothing as they tried to

576
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,000
figure out uh what are we going to do

577
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,740
next right and then another week of

578
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,960
little less attack and then a period of

579
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:20,760
you know and so

580
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,400
I'm just curious is what we've been

581
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,020
preaching or reading about for so long

582
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:26,760
is kind of happening in real time in

583
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:28,380
front of us

584
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,840
does it live up to the hype well I guess

585
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:33,120
it depends uh there is what we see and

586
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,159
what we don't see right yeah if like

587
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:36,840
what do we see is just like the numbers

588
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,340
we have seen for like the first six

589
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,620
months like wipers and stuff like that I

590
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,120
don't think those capabilities for sure

591
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,220
you know yeah like there's probably like

592
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,020
stuff that we're gonna see like later on

593
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,400
in a few years it's like all the stuff

594
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:49,140
that happened oh the shadow Brokers

595
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:50,640
thing happened yeah and all those

596
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,440
exploits got leaked like the data I got

597
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,640
leaked were like oh that happened like

598
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:55,860
five years ago you know so I think we're

599
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:57,419
probably gonna end up in a situation a

600
00:21:57,419 --> 00:21:58,980
long tail of other things coming out

601
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,140
yeah because we don't see you probably

602
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:02,520
see like I don't know less than 10

603
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:05,340
percent of like but it's not like a fast

604
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:06,720
and furious where there's the magic

605
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:09,000
button and shuts down the whole city and

606
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:12,780
it's the AI That's gonna it's not like

607
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:15,059
in the movies yeah we're not getting

608
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:16,860
into the mainframes turning down the

609
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:19,679
fires what are you saying oh my god I've

610
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,140
been deceived Jeff Moss is telling me

611
00:22:22,140 --> 00:22:24,000
hacking is not like in the movies oh my

612
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,880
God

613
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,320
let me hold my chair I need to recover

614
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:33,179
on this touche not like in the movies I

615
00:22:33,179 --> 00:22:35,640
quit yeah we're on that on that same

616
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,679
note you know what they're maybe not

617
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:40,380
being like a single magic button but

618
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:41,820
um you know when Kim zetter's keynote

619
00:22:41,820 --> 00:22:44,700
today was pretty you know talking about

620
00:22:44,700 --> 00:22:47,880
some of the the different groups that

621
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,100
have infiltrated you know operational

622
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:53,340
technology and and that some of the uh

623
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:55,140
almost like the workflows they had

624
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,360
around like okay well make sure that you

625
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,360
uh kill all these processes before you

626
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,340
again the ransomware like it's almost

627
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:04,380
like a magic button right it's almost

628
00:23:04,380 --> 00:23:06,059
like the switch that you flip the

629
00:23:06,059 --> 00:23:07,799
research has been done to kind of do

630
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:09,320
that and so

631
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:12,059
you know I think it is proving that to

632
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:14,280
be as chaotic

633
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,860
uh as as we thought it would be with the

634
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,360
citizen Army getting involved and then

635
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:19,860
the whole like that's government

636
00:23:19,860 --> 00:23:20,659
government

637
00:23:20,659 --> 00:23:23,460
yeah the part I'm kind of surprised is

638
00:23:23,460 --> 00:23:25,559
how uh aggressive Microsoft seems to be

639
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:27,299
in combating some of it I sort of

640
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:30,000
thought maybe some of the big mncs were

641
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,740
kind of sit on the sidelines a little

642
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:33,480
bit and try to provide update services

643
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:35,340
to everybody but I was pretty surprised

644
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:37,860
how some companies are just pulling out

645
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:40,980
yeah pulling out or taking a stand

646
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,980
um

647
00:23:42,980 --> 00:23:46,020
I've got a follow-up question

648
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:48,900
defense then in this super pervasive

649
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,740
offense environment

650
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:55,860
does defense stand a chance and one

651
00:23:55,860 --> 00:23:57,539
thing I was thinking of the companies

652
00:23:57,539 --> 00:23:58,980
that are really good at taking the tools

653
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,440
away from adversaries

654
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,960
probably can do really well in this

655
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,360
environment because the adversary might

656
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,740
not want to exercise something the only

657
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,240
thing I only have one real touch point

658
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,100
is when we ran Defcon for the first time

659
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:13,679
fully online on Discord the first year

660
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:15,600
people started targeting all the

661
00:24:15,600 --> 00:24:18,240
attendees with custom malware

662
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,919
trying to get him to click on videos or

663
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:21,120
links or whatever and it was I don't

664
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,260
know if there's a botnet but it was a

665
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:23,700
pretty concerted effort with a lot of

666
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:26,220
unique malware and so we scripted up a

667
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:28,500
bot that just took every attachment and

668
00:24:28,500 --> 00:24:30,539
sent it to virus total

669
00:24:30,539 --> 00:24:33,000
and the attack stopped in five minutes

670
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,260
they just don't want their stuff in

671
00:24:34,260 --> 00:24:37,200
virus total right and so it seems like

672
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,419
defense has some techniques that can

673
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:41,039
make life more miserable

674
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:43,320
I don't know many of them but I'm

675
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:44,940
curious this would be the time for

676
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:47,700
defense to shine right that's that's I

677
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,200
mean I didn't know that's a cool story

678
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,059
that's uh

679
00:24:51,059 --> 00:24:54,299
a great example I think of what Chris

680
00:24:54,299 --> 00:24:57,299
Krebs said the other day which was

681
00:24:57,299 --> 00:25:00,059
you know moving from I think it was from

682
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:01,799
the government perspective but moving

683
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:03,900
from these long-running investigations

684
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:06,600
to more disruptive action right in that

685
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,120
situation you saw something you

686
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,320
immediately

687
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:12,900
took an action on it that would you know

688
00:25:12,900 --> 00:25:15,299
create a situation that's harmful to the

689
00:25:15,299 --> 00:25:18,059
attacker and want to raise their costs

690
00:25:18,059 --> 00:25:19,919
right we can't do an investigation but I

691
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,260
want to take your tools away right so

692
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:24,059
that's that's a that's a great way to

693
00:25:24,059 --> 00:25:25,440
kind of tie that together and I think as

694
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,480
Defenders we do

695
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,740
chance

696
00:25:28,740 --> 00:25:31,440
um I mean I'm largely on the defensive

697
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,020
side of the house now so uh it behooves

698
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,779
me to say that but I think

699
00:25:36,779 --> 00:25:39,240
um the one I was going through my notes

700
00:25:39,240 --> 00:25:41,279
from all the all the briefings just

701
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:44,279
before this and the one Trend that I I

702
00:25:44,279 --> 00:25:47,820
kept seeing come up was changing our

703
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:50,940
threat models so like changing that like

704
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:53,760
the need to evolve our mental threat

705
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,440
models like they were too simplistic

706
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,779
before or too complicated or they're

707
00:25:57,779 --> 00:26:00,960
actually wrote These down because uh so

708
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,480
Krebs said you know uh you know anybody

709
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,820
that's running a technology that's

710
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,320
becoming a core fabric of the internet

711
00:26:07,320 --> 00:26:08,940
has to realize that they are now part of

712
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:10,500
the National Security apparatus right

713
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:12,360
mindset shift

714
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,220
um the CI CD talk

715
00:26:14,220 --> 00:26:15,480
um

716
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,120
you know the idea that

717
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,000
pipelines cicd pipelines control so much

718
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:23,039
and you can you have this like nice

719
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,779
streamlined way to push stuff out to

720
00:26:24,779 --> 00:26:26,880
production and infiltrate in a way that

721
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,260
you weren't able to do before it's a

722
00:26:28,260 --> 00:26:30,179
different threat model than you know 10

723
00:26:30,179 --> 00:26:31,919
years ago when all you had to be worried

724
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,380
about was being attacked directly and

725
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:37,020
you know or individually

726
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:40,860
um the the web 3 talk which and one

727
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:44,880
three was very polarizing uh

728
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,980
topic amongst the review board I will

729
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,659
tell you that I think North Korea yeah

730
00:26:48,659 --> 00:26:50,580
anything you need to know and it didn't

731
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:52,440
end up with it didn't end up with a trap

732
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:55,200
but it ended up with at least one talk

733
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:56,820
and you know we'll see where that goes

734
00:26:56,820 --> 00:26:57,960
but

735
00:26:57,960 --> 00:26:59,880
you know we're seeing all the same types

736
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:04,740
of attacks in web 3 that we saw in

737
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:06,900
traditional application security you see

738
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,640
the the uh

739
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,919
see now I forgot what the wallet hat was

740
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:14,039
but the one was basically leaking uh

741
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:16,500
private keys and mnemonics through

742
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:18,600
through overly verbose logging like

743
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,860
we're seeing these things play over and

744
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:22,200
over and over again but now with what

745
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,539
three uh the threat model is different

746
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:25,620
because these attacks can happen

747
00:27:25,620 --> 00:27:28,740
instantaneously and you know in the open

748
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:32,220
and anonymously so I think as Defenders

749
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:36,059
we have to be a little bit faster to

750
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:39,120
think about you know to modify

751
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:40,559
um how we're how we're thinking about

752
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,539
our threat model and adapting rather

753
00:27:42,539 --> 00:27:43,799
than kind of using what we've always

754
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:46,380
been using oh yeah yeah I think like I'm

755
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:48,240
so glad we have the defense track here

756
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:50,520
because I do think there's this problem

757
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,020
where you know you shared a really

758
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:55,140
clever idea for defense but not all the

759
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:57,360
ideas are super clever and a lot of

760
00:27:57,360 --> 00:27:58,919
things that are required in being like

761
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:01,080
purely defensive are things like code

762
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,179
review they're things like knowing what

763
00:28:03,179 --> 00:28:05,000
all your assets are

764
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:07,200
just thinking for the hardware track we

765
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,240
had quite a few talks on fault injection

766
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,740
and then there's just one talk on

767
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,200
techniques for preventing that and I

768
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:14,820
think that does kind of reflect on

769
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:16,380
security people's interests and I think

770
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:19,380
it's important that we understand the

771
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:22,500
value of defensive Solutions because it

772
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:24,539
is fun to break stuff but

773
00:28:24,539 --> 00:28:26,640
um well there's this concept you know in

774
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:29,100
offense which is use it or lose it so

775
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,779
you know you've got the tool you know

776
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:32,640
Microsoft's going to release a patch you

777
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:36,840
have to now decide use it or lose it and

778
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,480
so I was kept expecting like with that

779
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,700
Tempo accelerated we'd see a lot of use

780
00:28:41,700 --> 00:28:44,400
it because there's all this fomo of

781
00:28:44,400 --> 00:28:45,539
losing it

782
00:28:45,539 --> 00:28:46,799
but

783
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:47,900
I I I

784
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,220
haven't really actually seen that play

785
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,779
out so I'm now I'm questioning those

786
00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:53,580
assumptions yeah but the thing is like I

787
00:28:53,580 --> 00:28:55,559
think that is

788
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:57,360
ignoring the broader issue which is if

789
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:00,059
you had 10 fewer bugs or 20 fewer fewer

790
00:29:00,059 --> 00:29:01,260
bugs attackers wouldn't even find

791
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,900
themselves in that situation right right

792
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:06,659
maybe not

793
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:07,860
um that would obviously wouldn't get rid

794
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,900
of all of your bugs but it would

795
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,940
make it harder for attackers make it

796
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:14,039
more expensive and you know defense

797
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:15,480
isn't perfect and I think it's always

798
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,860
going to be a struggle with attackers

799
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:18,480
but I don't think we should ignore the

800
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:21,480
fact that there are things we can do to

801
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:22,919
make it less likely that they have toys

802
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:25,500
to play with in the first place

803
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:28,559
yeah or even like uh the the quality of

804
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:30,779
patches I was just talking with one of

805
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:32,820
the speaker before he was saying what

806
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,200
they have seen actually is the quality

807
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,419
of patches is decreasing and he sees a

808
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:39,240
lot of like Placebo like patches where

809
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:41,880
they just fix like the specific like use

810
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,380
case you are giving but not the actual

811
00:29:43,380 --> 00:29:46,020
Bird right and that's if strain equals

812
00:29:46,020 --> 00:29:49,020
EA exactly yeah or like CVS you know

813
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,580
being like merged like they would send

814
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:52,020
like multiple bugs and they would just

815
00:29:52,020 --> 00:29:54,899
get only like few CVS and the impact on

816
00:29:54,899 --> 00:29:58,380
on teams exactly yeah

817
00:29:58,380 --> 00:30:02,039
pages that do nothing yeah exactly so I

818
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:05,520
mean like products what's driving that

819
00:30:05,520 --> 00:30:07,500
I know like maybe the quality of like

820
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:10,080
software Engineers like uh even if you

821
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:11,159
look now I was talking with another

822
00:30:11,159 --> 00:30:13,440
speaker we're just saying that a lot of

823
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:15,919
the uh like offensive presentations

824
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,419
they're not coming from the same profile

825
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:19,679
of people you would see like 10 years

826
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:21,539
ago a lot of them come from like Google

827
00:30:21,539 --> 00:30:23,880
for instance like defense like oriented

828
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:26,700
like company uh like the whole profile

829
00:30:26,700 --> 00:30:28,620
of like offensive talks also like change

830
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,480
like the actual people doing like

831
00:30:30,480 --> 00:30:32,460
offense we don't see them yeah because

832
00:30:32,460 --> 00:30:34,010
we're not allowed to drop out anymore

833
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:35,520
[Music]

834
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:37,919
this is there less I mean I'm always

835
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,140
curious like when it gets harder to

836
00:30:40,140 --> 00:30:42,000
develop the zero day it becomes more

837
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:44,760
valuable so you're more likely to

838
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:47,760
monetize it that's supposedly right I

839
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:49,679
mean there was the the trend in the

840
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:51,179
early days of black cat were like well

841
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:52,919
I'm famous enough now my career's

842
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:54,480
developed enough

843
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,520
I don't have to release that stuff

844
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:59,340
anymore now I can sell it but because

845
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,779
some vendors are not paying like

846
00:31:00,779 --> 00:31:02,460
researchers on time and they're waiting

847
00:31:02,460 --> 00:31:03,840
for like one or two years I know I don't

848
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,600
want to drop any names but

849
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:09,360
so right like there's a name that came

850
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:10,799
up like few times you know like this

851
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:12,480
because oh interesting but that's true

852
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,799
because there's a source of Revenue now

853
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:15,539
for for security research isn't it well

854
00:31:15,539 --> 00:31:18,179
it wasn't an incentive to you know

855
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:20,820
present those results elsewhere right

856
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:21,960
yeah

857
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:25,919
that was never there before right

858
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,080
the numbers just keep going up

859
00:31:28,080 --> 00:31:29,940
you know do you guys ever pay attention

860
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:32,279
to the value of when uh zoronium would

861
00:31:32,279 --> 00:31:34,679
post I just get astounded every time I

862
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:35,580
see those that's what I was thinking

863
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:38,640
like the one or one or two million

864
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:42,000
dollars for like a iOS I think or Chrome

865
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,059
yeah yeah like this is actually for the

866
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:46,260
um projects you're over you guys

867
00:31:46,260 --> 00:31:47,760
probably pay attention a lot to it I'm

868
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,679
sorry Target sometimes that in other

869
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:51,059
price lists because it is a really good

870
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:52,860
indicator of how much attackers value

871
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:54,360
bugs I always get nervous when I see

872
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:55,919
software like we're not taking these

873
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,140
anymore we have too many of them I was

874
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,659
like no but I run that software yeah

875
00:32:00,659 --> 00:32:04,140
yeah that's going to be a problem but do

876
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:06,720
you but the the value going up of a

877
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,980
vulnerability

878
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:10,919
must reflect the increased level of

879
00:32:10,919 --> 00:32:12,240
effort that has had to go into

880
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,360
discovering that it must yeah right does

881
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,580
it well that's I mean it's that hard

882
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,320
right now right look at the uh you can't

883
00:32:19,320 --> 00:32:20,940
just put like apostrophe equals

884
00:32:20,940 --> 00:32:22,860
semicolon yeah but if you look at like

885
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:24,480
the bridges in web free like some of the

886
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,799
bounties are like 10 million dollars

887
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:27,360
it's more than the airport for like iOS

888
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,919
bugs and stuff which is great because

889
00:32:28,919 --> 00:32:30,600
that's real real money's moving yeah

890
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:32,460
it'd be like if the Swift Network said

891
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:34,559
we'll give you a tenth of a percent of

892
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:36,360
what you save us that's a billion

893
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,700
dollars or something yeah yeah

894
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,039
yeah it is hard to figure out for sure

895
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:42,659
what a price means it is a combination

896
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:44,880
of how much it's valued and how hard it

897
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,760
is to attack I'm always curious how much

898
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,679
of it is it tells you what attackers

899
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:50,520
want

900
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,899
like these are the targets not

901
00:32:51,899 --> 00:32:53,880
necessarily what people are producing

902
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:56,340
yeah and of course it's it's a balance

903
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:56,880
um

904
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,679
yeah up until web 3 it made a lot of

905
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:00,860
sense

906
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,460
was wanted

907
00:33:02,460 --> 00:33:03,779
you know maybe like maybe their

908
00:33:03,779 --> 00:33:06,120
countries wanted and the level of effort

909
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:08,159
but but yeah like what Matt just said

910
00:33:08,159 --> 00:33:09,899
you know the interesting thing with web3

911
00:33:09,899 --> 00:33:11,820
is that there is not a regulatory

912
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:15,000
requirement for these developers to

913
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,519
obtain

914
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:18,600
attestations of security but they're

915
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:20,940
doing it anyway they know it's coming

916
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:22,860
right these companies are going out

917
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:24,960
there and paying a lot of money and

918
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:26,760
waiting a long time for an independent

919
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,320
third party review of their code if

920
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:29,760
they're doing things right right there's

921
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,519
a number that are not but there are many

922
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:35,279
that are there's no regulatory body

923
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,080
requiring them to do this they're doing

924
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:38,640
it so that they are adopted as a

925
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,440
platform incredible because it's like

926
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,940
when trail of grits announces that we

927
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,440
did a year and a half review of some

928
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,260
technologies that was not cheap right

929
00:33:46,260 --> 00:33:49,559
yeah I don't know so that industry

930
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:50,880
whatever you want to call it web through

931
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,220
the web 3 Community have succeeded in

932
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:56,399
establishing a best practice that never

933
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,559
happened before it took a regulatory

934
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,360
pressure or some requirements some

935
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:03,000
compliance issue to require that

936
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,340
penetration test report right people

937
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,720
weren't doing it because

938
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,339
it was best practice they were doing it

939
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:09,359
because they had to

940
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:11,339
I've got one more topic

941
00:34:11,339 --> 00:34:13,139
and then we'll go to some questions and

942
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:15,719
this is around complexity

943
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,760
in all the reviews and we always say

944
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:19,020
that the systems are getting more and

945
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:21,418
more complex and complex systems are

946
00:34:21,418 --> 00:34:23,940
hard to secure and they fail in

947
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:26,159
unpredictable ways when you're reviewing

948
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:27,899
these talks how much of the underlying

949
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:29,879
bug or the newness or the the the

950
00:34:29,879 --> 00:34:31,859
they're there that made you want to

951
00:34:31,859 --> 00:34:34,020
select the talk do you think

952
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:37,260
is it is any of it related to complexity

953
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:39,418
like the libraries are so complicated

954
00:34:39,418 --> 00:34:40,859
the code passes so there's so many

955
00:34:40,859 --> 00:34:43,080
third-party dependencies like a lot of

956
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:45,179
these would not be issues but for this

957
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:47,760
complexity or is

958
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,379
yes there's more complexity but it's

959
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:51,659
kind of not relevant

960
00:34:51,659 --> 00:34:53,099
anything are you talking about the

961
00:34:53,099 --> 00:34:55,679
complexity of what the researcher did or

962
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,240
the complexity of the system they looked

963
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:59,460
at it could be either it's I'm always

964
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:01,380
curious that

965
00:35:01,380 --> 00:35:03,420
if complexity is always increasing does

966
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:04,740
that just mean it increases for infinity

967
00:35:04,740 --> 00:35:06,540
and we're here when we're 200 years old

968
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,820
and these systems look simple or is

969
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,380
there sort of like a natural level at

970
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:12,180
some point there's a maximum complexity

971
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:14,280
level we're just not there yet that

972
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,020
makes it so hard for researchers to

973
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:17,880
understand it or because they're so

974
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:19,740
complex they can only look at this teeny

975
00:35:19,740 --> 00:35:21,119
little leaf and they'll never understand

976
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:23,220
the big picture

977
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:25,380
and if that's the case that means we're

978
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:28,140
as a community losing the big picture

979
00:35:28,140 --> 00:35:31,500
and I don't know if that's true

980
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,380
I don't see the complexity I mean it's

981
00:35:34,380 --> 00:35:37,140
hard to imagine reaching a peak uh so

982
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:39,300
that means forever yeah well who here

983
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:42,420
show of hands thinks that we're on the

984
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:44,579
path of ever increasing complexity with

985
00:35:44,579 --> 00:35:47,839
no end in sight

986
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:50,599
no no

987
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:53,099
so think to yourself because I don't

988
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:54,780
know we don't know the answer what does

989
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,280
that mean

990
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:59,160
I don't think it means anything good

991
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:01,320
besides employment for life I've had

992
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,020
problems for our children yeah

993
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:06,960
I'm an optimist here I think unnecessary

994
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,700
complexity in systems makes them less

995
00:36:08,700 --> 00:36:10,920
secure and over time people are going to

996
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:12,900
learn this and hopefully reduce the

997
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,020
complexity to what's necessary

998
00:36:15,020 --> 00:36:17,760
programming and trust or yeah well

999
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:19,079
there's so many things well programming

1000
00:36:19,079 --> 00:36:21,300
in managed languages is one of them

1001
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,460
reducing attack surface and making sure

1002
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,079
that every feature is necessary is

1003
00:36:25,079 --> 00:36:26,820
another yeah there are course

1004
00:36:26,820 --> 00:36:28,920
corrections I mean you know entire frame

1005
00:36:28,920 --> 00:36:30,359
you know frame ritual languages that

1006
00:36:30,359 --> 00:36:32,460
make it harder to to make common

1007
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:34,560
mistakes that type of thing but you know

1008
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:36,960
meanwhile well these new languages are

1009
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,339
being developed for Frameworks being

1010
00:36:38,339 --> 00:36:41,099
developed you know you also have like

1011
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:43,140
entirely new ecosystems popping up and

1012
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,359
so like the pace of those things are at

1013
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:46,800
odds with one another right I think the

1014
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:49,619
complexity is just this when you ask the

1015
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:52,339
question it made me think of uh

1016
00:36:52,339 --> 00:36:55,500
there's there's this uh I guess it's

1017
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,320
basically a survey uh called the index

1018
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,380
of cyber security that Dan gear started

1019
00:37:01,380 --> 00:37:03,420
um probably 15 years ago and has since

1020
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,339
handed off but it started off with a

1021
00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:07,440
handful of individuals in the industry

1022
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,880
just you know answering questions about

1023
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,740
kind of how they felt the threat levels

1024
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:12,720
were and very pointed questions around

1025
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:15,119
their their uh kind of a temperature of

1026
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:16,440
the room yeah how do you how do you feel

1027
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,320
about the how are things going and then

1028
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,660
it would come up with like a number and

1029
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,300
anyway over time that num there's if you

1030
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,040
look at a chart that never that's never

1031
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:28,200
come down it's just increasing and

1032
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,400
increasing increasing I think you could

1033
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,980
probably look over 15 years and just the

1034
00:37:31,980 --> 00:37:35,640
perceived level of of of of of threat

1035
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,280
and risk is always going up and I think

1036
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,800
this is one of those things as well yeah

1037
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,780
hmm

1038
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:44,280
yeah well I think you can I think you

1039
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:46,680
can't ignore is the big increase in the

1040
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:48,599
number of people using Technologies over

1041
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:50,280
the years and just the sheer number of

1042
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,220
Technologies now you've got uh Wi-Fi in

1043
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:55,619
your fridge that sort of thing right

1044
00:37:55,619 --> 00:37:57,619
not mine

1045
00:37:57,619 --> 00:38:01,380
well you are missing out and also like

1046
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:02,660
there's a lot of people who like to

1047
00:38:02,660 --> 00:38:04,980
reinvent the wheel a lot you know

1048
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,440
because there is some research that was

1049
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,940
not necessarily like visible or

1050
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:10,079
something we see people are like

1051
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,060
Reinventing the wheel a lot you know

1052
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,099
that is a really good point it's

1053
00:38:14,099 --> 00:38:15,420
something I think as a board you

1054
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,820
probably all face too which is somebody

1055
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:20,099
submit something they make a claim that

1056
00:38:20,099 --> 00:38:22,320
it's new or novel yeah and it's very

1057
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,780
hard as a review board member to verify

1058
00:38:24,780 --> 00:38:26,820
that claim because you can't just go to

1059
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:29,160
academic references so unless you've

1060
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,660
been in the scene forever and you say no

1061
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:33,660
no FX published something 15 years ago

1062
00:38:33,660 --> 00:38:35,820
exactly yeah how do you know so I think

1063
00:38:35,820 --> 00:38:37,619
as an industry we don't do a very good

1064
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:40,140
job of archiving stuff for the years

1065
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:43,500
yeah or having a referenceable yeah

1066
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:45,780
yeah I didn't even go farther if it was

1067
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,820
15 years ago kind of doesn't matter or

1068
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:49,920
is this topic still exactly so bring it

1069
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:52,440
back nonetheless you know right it's not

1070
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,000
it can be like even more complex stuff

1071
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,140
like

1072
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:56,640
uh like programming languages you

1073
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,560
mentioned rest you know some friends who

1074
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:00,540
are talking about carbon versus rust you

1075
00:39:00,540 --> 00:39:02,760
know like uh so rust is known to have

1076
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,500
memory safety but like the way the

1077
00:39:04,500 --> 00:39:06,480
phrase it for carbon is like it's on an

1078
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,060
incremental path to memory safety it's

1079
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:10,500
like what does that even mean you know

1080
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:11,760
it means it's never going to happen you

1081
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,140
know so what would you try to do in your

1082
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:15,119
language to replace like C plus plus to

1083
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:17,760
like I think that's not as good as Russ

1084
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,440
you know it does not makes more sense

1085
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,599
and we see a lot of like side projects

1086
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:24,480
like this yeah and uh yeah I think it's

1087
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,460
also a problem and I also have a

1088
00:39:26,460 --> 00:39:27,660
personal opinion on the fact that

1089
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:29,520
insecurities is probably like

1090
00:39:29,520 --> 00:39:31,320
proportionally like the ratio of like

1091
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:33,240
software Engineers is product lower than

1092
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,339
in the past and you have more people who

1093
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:37,020
are used to like push buttons and use

1094
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,660
regex no I don't have the data on this

1095
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:42,119
it's my personal belief but I think it's

1096
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:44,220
also playing in the oh everything sounds

1097
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,440
like so complex and everything just

1098
00:39:46,440 --> 00:39:48,060
because there's no we don't have the

1099
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,099
right people to like summarize it

1100
00:39:50,099 --> 00:39:52,140
are the people being pulled away into

1101
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:55,260
Cloud Big Data something else

1102
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,780
lack of Interest no like overwhelmed

1103
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,640
also it's difficult I guess not to get

1104
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,200
into security party because there's so

1105
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:02,640
many things so the question is always

1106
00:40:02,640 --> 00:40:04,619
like where do you start so it's easy to

1107
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:06,359
be misled on focusing on the wrong

1108
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:08,640
topics uh

1109
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:11,040
what's your opinion on that we are still

1110
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,079
talking about

1111
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:15,359
the level of technical content that we

1112
00:40:15,359 --> 00:40:18,180
need to be addressing to be a cyber

1113
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:19,859
security expert we're still talking

1114
00:40:19,859 --> 00:40:22,440
about the fact that cyber security is

1115
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:24,420
not just a technical issue and we need

1116
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:27,420
to address the skills gaps and um the

1117
00:40:27,420 --> 00:40:30,300
the skills shortage and you know we

1118
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:32,280
should be looking at people from all

1119
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,960
backgrounds not just highly technical

1120
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,760
experts but at the same time at the ciso

1121
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:37,619
summit we had a whole presentation about

1122
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:40,099
how the schools are putting out

1123
00:40:40,099 --> 00:40:43,800
badly skilled cyber security people who

1124
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,240
don't have enough technical knowledge

1125
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,820
unfortunately to be helpful I have um

1126
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:49,920
this is a couple year old story but

1127
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:52,500
supports your claim I was in uh in

1128
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:54,300
Washington DC or out right outside and I

1129
00:40:54,300 --> 00:40:56,579
was uh supporting this conference and in

1130
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:57,900
the conference where

1131
00:40:57,900 --> 00:41:00,720
a lot of universities and there's one

1132
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:02,820
one guy from University in public said

1133
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,859
this out loud at this panel so kudos for

1134
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:06,780
him for you know courage

1135
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,960
he said we are University XYZ we want to

1136
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:12,839
be a leader in cyber security and we

1137
00:41:12,839 --> 00:41:14,220
want to be in the top ten we know we

1138
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,960
can't get to the top five that's you

1139
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,760
know but we want to be in the top ten

1140
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,560
within three years

1141
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:21,540
what advice do you have

1142
00:41:21,540 --> 00:41:24,660
for me I said that's great

1143
00:41:24,660 --> 00:41:25,260
um

1144
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:26,940
you probably want to get buy off that

1145
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:28,859
you can teach offensive information

1146
00:41:28,859 --> 00:41:31,680
security to the students because if you

1147
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:33,300
don't understand how offense works you

1148
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:37,220
can't really teach defense

1149
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,400
okay maybe not the top ten

1150
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:43,320
yeah

1151
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,880
and he just

1152
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,800
see him run through the politics that he

1153
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,060
would have to go through with his

1154
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:49,800
Provost and his board of directors to

1155
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,480
explain that he's teaching students

1156
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:54,839
offense and he was like nope wow and so

1157
00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:56,880
that's like a problem in a microcosm

1158
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:59,880
yeah is it almost seems like the bar

1159
00:41:59,880 --> 00:42:01,800
like that would definitely put you in

1160
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:03,960
the top top five or ten to have a good

1161
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:06,359
offensive but like what we heard at the

1162
00:42:06,359 --> 00:42:08,760
CSO Summit which I guess we're not

1163
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:11,280
supposed to say who is presenting but uh

1164
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:14,160
it was simpler than that it was that the

1165
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,400
cyber security programs that the

1166
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,660
undergraduate level cyber security

1167
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:20,579
programs are not even sending out

1168
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:22,800
students with the fundamentals of like

1169
00:42:22,800 --> 00:42:25,740
you know networking right like if you

1170
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:28,079
don't understand like the basics of like

1171
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,180
tcpip and just like networking and how

1172
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,800
that stuff works but you have an

1173
00:42:31,800 --> 00:42:33,720
understanding of like you know maybe

1174
00:42:33,720 --> 00:42:35,700
what's happening in the policy realm of

1175
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,800
cyber or you know all those things that

1176
00:42:37,800 --> 00:42:38,880
they're trying to put into the

1177
00:42:38,880 --> 00:42:40,800
curriculum you can't get very far you

1178
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:42,780
have it's not all technical but you have

1179
00:42:42,780 --> 00:42:44,820
to have a certain technical Foundation

1180
00:42:44,820 --> 00:42:46,619
you have to be able to write some code

1181
00:42:46,619 --> 00:42:48,420
it probably doesn't have to be great

1182
00:42:48,420 --> 00:42:50,880
code but like increasingly actually it

1183
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,920
probably does you know as there's this

1184
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,079
crossover between Security Professionals

1185
00:42:55,079 --> 00:42:59,400
and and you know uh software the bar is

1186
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,859
pretty low to be a great communicator to

1187
00:43:01,859 --> 00:43:03,720
you know teach security awareness

1188
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:06,300
training right which is it no but you

1189
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,339
need to probably understand the priority

1190
00:43:08,339 --> 00:43:10,020
when you're teaching it like this is why

1191
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,000
this is important or this is what so I

1192
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:12,900
guess that's the question we should ask

1193
00:43:12,900 --> 00:43:14,220
ourselves like how deep do these people

1194
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:17,400
need to go to be effective in a role

1195
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:18,300
like that

1196
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:20,280
so we're out of time and so I'm going to

1197
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:22,500
give it a one round to everybody for

1198
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:24,480
closing thoughts any any points you want

1199
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,920
to make anything you want to leave

1200
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,300
something going to be even bigger next

1201
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:28,339
year

1202
00:43:28,339 --> 00:43:31,500
I hope I mean generally we have a lot of

1203
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,359
people come from China in Asia and a lot

1204
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:34,920
of those people didn't travel because

1205
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,660
they couldn't so I don't see how it

1206
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:39,480
would get smaller amazing yeah

1207
00:43:39,480 --> 00:43:41,460
okay so let's start I'll start with

1208
00:43:41,460 --> 00:43:42,839
Chris any final thoughts you want to

1209
00:43:42,839 --> 00:43:43,800
leave

1210
00:43:43,800 --> 00:43:46,140
the holdouts the hardcore people that

1211
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:49,079
have waited it out here

1212
00:43:49,079 --> 00:43:51,839
uh you know we're still seeing a lot of

1213
00:43:51,839 --> 00:43:53,460
the same problems we're seeing it

1214
00:43:53,460 --> 00:43:56,460
manifest in different ways I think as it

1215
00:43:56,460 --> 00:43:58,980
applies to new technologies but we're

1216
00:43:58,980 --> 00:44:00,660
seeing a lot of the same problems and so

1217
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:02,579
I think that whole theme of we have to

1218
00:44:02,579 --> 00:44:06,660
be uh quicker at adapting the lessons

1219
00:44:06,660 --> 00:44:08,280
that we already know we already know

1220
00:44:08,280 --> 00:44:09,960
about vlogging we already know about

1221
00:44:09,960 --> 00:44:12,359
like basic secure coding issues we know

1222
00:44:12,359 --> 00:44:16,680
you know we know what things to do

1223
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:18,720
in a large part and they're just not

1224
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:22,640
getting done and so uh good job security

1225
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:25,339
but uh

1226
00:44:25,339 --> 00:44:27,359
you know

1227
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,760
it's kind of more of the same it's a

1228
00:44:29,760 --> 00:44:31,980
little bit discouraging uh on the sort

1229
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:34,619
of optimistic mentalism yeah I mean we

1230
00:44:34,619 --> 00:44:36,180
are seeing things getting better In

1231
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:38,280
Pockets I mean we're you know sitting

1232
00:44:38,280 --> 00:44:40,140
where I sit in application security we

1233
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:42,060
are seeing you know habits get better

1234
00:44:42,060 --> 00:44:43,980
around software security and integrating

1235
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:46,260
security into the you know devsec Ops

1236
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:48,359
and things like that but like too slowly

1237
00:44:48,359 --> 00:44:51,180
right way too slowly so we've got to get

1238
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:53,280
better

1239
00:44:53,280 --> 00:44:55,319
yeah I agree I feel like Chris has said

1240
00:44:55,319 --> 00:44:57,420
a lot of what I wanted to say already

1241
00:44:57,420 --> 00:45:00,599
but but is Hardware slower or easier or

1242
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:02,040
harder

1243
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,140
yeah well I mean there's there's kind of

1244
00:45:04,140 --> 00:45:07,440
complex challenges in Hardware in that

1245
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:09,780
um it is harder to fix things

1246
00:45:09,780 --> 00:45:11,880
um it's like more complex than software

1247
00:45:11,880 --> 00:45:14,700
but what I will say is also every year

1248
00:45:14,700 --> 00:45:17,160
doing the hardware track I am so

1249
00:45:17,160 --> 00:45:19,380
impressed by all the talks we get I

1250
00:45:19,380 --> 00:45:20,579
think it's one of the most competitive

1251
00:45:20,579 --> 00:45:24,000
tracks and yeah I am so amazed by the

1252
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:27,000
research we see every year so well I

1253
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:28,260
feel like there's a lot of problems I'm

1254
00:45:28,260 --> 00:45:30,420
also really inspired so I think everyone

1255
00:45:30,420 --> 00:45:32,880
should keep at it and

1256
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,339
I do feel like one day we are going to

1257
00:45:35,339 --> 00:45:37,440
solve these problems or at least make a

1258
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:40,520
lot of Headway

1259
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:42,359
um

1260
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:44,819
um I would just probably revisit the

1261
00:45:44,819 --> 00:45:46,380
application the ideas around the

1262
00:45:46,380 --> 00:45:48,060
application of our security research

1263
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:51,140
Community to Innovation that's impacting

1264
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:55,079
everyone so the great example of us

1265
00:45:55,079 --> 00:45:56,760
doing that is standing up the AI track

1266
00:45:56,760 --> 00:45:59,160
which is a couple of years ago a bad

1267
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:01,680
example of us not doing that is not

1268
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,420
looking at things like blockchain which

1269
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:05,700
is changing the world and has a ton of

1270
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:07,740
security issues and

1271
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:09,420
um I think that we we get so in the

1272
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:11,940
weeds sometimes with Bud classes and you

1273
00:46:11,940 --> 00:46:13,800
know really deep security researchers is

1274
00:46:13,800 --> 00:46:16,079
great but we should still try to map

1275
00:46:16,079 --> 00:46:18,800
that to what

1276
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,700
you know that sort of high level

1277
00:46:20,700 --> 00:46:23,220
technology trends that impact everyone

1278
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:25,260
in our communities and try to connect

1279
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:26,940
those dots a bit more be a bit more

1280
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:28,560
open-minded about how this actually

1281
00:46:28,560 --> 00:46:32,299
impacts people around us

1282
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:34,740
um yeah and I agree on the fact that uh

1283
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:36,480
like Chris said you know like it feels

1284
00:46:36,480 --> 00:46:37,800
like some of the things the problems are

1285
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:42,180
always the same so is it because like uh

1286
00:46:42,180 --> 00:46:43,800
things are moving slowly or because you

1287
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,480
are missing like new trends you know

1288
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:48,720
because like as a security as like the

1289
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,280
security industry were just like so

1290
00:46:50,280 --> 00:46:52,380
focused on the same problem that we are

1291
00:46:52,380 --> 00:46:54,599
missing right actual problems on like

1292
00:46:54,599 --> 00:46:57,000
looking the motives of the attackers you

1293
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,920
know like why they do something and then

1294
00:46:58,920 --> 00:47:00,300
maybe it's going to help us to

1295
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,040
understand okay like oh you know instead

1296
00:47:02,040 --> 00:47:03,720
of like looking from the out or like

1297
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:05,640
finding the why

1298
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:07,440
um I'm really proud that we got through

1299
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:09,900
this without using the word fake news or

1300
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:15,380
Ai No I said AI you did drink

1301
00:47:15,859 --> 00:47:19,400
and blockchain

1302
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:22,440
thank you

1303
00:47:22,440 --> 00:47:24,000
all right well that concludes our

1304
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,740
session everybody thank you for

1305
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:28,380
attending um the videos will all be

1306
00:47:28,380 --> 00:47:30,480
edited and put online eventually for

1307
00:47:30,480 --> 00:47:32,760
free share with your friends we'd love

1308
00:47:32,760 --> 00:47:34,800
your feedback we love getting your

1309
00:47:34,800 --> 00:47:36,240
comments so we'll see you on the

1310
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:37,920
twitters and if you're around later this

1311
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:41,839
week we'll see you at Defcon thank you
