00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:09,840
now it's my pleasure to welcome to Stage

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:12,920
Nathan Campbell

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,000
thank you everyone uh for joining me

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,279
this morning so uh

6
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,460
last night I was a very good boy I drank

7
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,500
plenty of water I came back to the room

8
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,439
very early did all the right things and

9
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:30,119
I still couldn't go to sleep so that

10
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:31,920
just shows you in Las Vegas that no good

11
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,960
deed goes unpunished I should have

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:35,219
stayed up all night

13
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:36,899
so thank you for joining me this morning

14
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:40,320
for uh from hackathon to hacked my name

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:42,540
is Nathan Hamel I am senior director of

16
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:44,640
research at kedelski security we are a

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,440
global security company I lead the

18
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:48,360
fundamental and applied research team as

19
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:51,719
well as the new product prototyping team

20
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:53,820
I've spoken at many conferences before

21
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,680
I've been a black hat Review Board

22
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,340
member for well over a decade and I'm

23
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:01,739
the current uh track lead for the AI

24
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:03,420
machine learning and data science track

25
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:06,420
so given that you might wonder how does

26
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,180
a nice boy like me end up talking about

27
00:01:09,180 --> 00:01:11,640
web 3. and that's a bit of an

28
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:14,159
interesting Journey so about four and a

29
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,659
half years ago I joined kadelski

30
00:01:15,659 --> 00:01:18,420
security and about half of my team was

31
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:19,799
cryptographers

32
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:22,320
and we were working on things Advanced

33
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,080
cryptography like threshold cryptography

34
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,299
and zero knowledge proofs and a lot of

35
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,340
this was being funded by blockchain

36
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,960
companies

37
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,119
so what we did was we stood up a

38
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,060
practice helping blockchain companies

39
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,640
secure their software and that's kind of

40
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,640
where I got involved with this topic

41
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,040
you might wonder what web3 even does

42
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:45,840
everybody in here know what web3 is or

43
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,360
were you coming here to uh learn how

44
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,579
many people know what web3 is

45
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:53,100
okay quite a few people so it's the

46
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:55,140
proposed next version of the internet if

47
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,740
you listen to Advocates and really for

48
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:01,439
the sake of this uh talk what we're

49
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,560
going to be discussing is that

50
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,299
um applications running on top of

51
00:02:06,299 --> 00:02:08,758
blockchain Technologies so that's really

52
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:11,038
the focus of this talk and you may

53
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,080
Wonder since this tends to be a

54
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:16,319
contentious topic you may wonder what my

55
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,879
perspective is before listening to

56
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:19,319
anything I have to say

57
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:21,840
and let me be clear that I am very

58
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,780
neutral anytime Technology's involved I

59
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:26,520
do not feel the world is a better place

60
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:29,220
with vulnerable technology out there so

61
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,140
I feel as Security Professionals it's

62
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,780
our job to help people innovate as

63
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:35,580
securely as possible

64
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:37,500
so I have a few goals for this

65
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,819
presentation

66
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:42,959
the first one is to kind of take the

67
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,580
previous four and a half years of

68
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:47,040
working with these projects and kind of

69
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,660
distill down into some points to help

70
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:50,340
you understand given all of the news

71
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:52,440
that you may see why these problems

72
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,819
persist

73
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:56,280
and anytime you hear a talk about like

74
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,140
this at a security conference it always

75
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,180
turns into smart contracts

76
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,860
but as you'll see as we move along

77
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:06,480
that's only one piece of a larger puzzle

78
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,580
I hope to cover some contributing

79
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:10,080
factors

80
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,360
and talk about and try to get security

81
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,700
people more involved because we've been

82
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,980
kind of sitting on the fence around this

83
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,000
topic

84
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,739
and I'll make a few recommendations

85
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:21,780
towards the end about how we can start

86
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,319
to make this area more robust

87
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:27,659
so anytime an emerging technology comes

88
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:28,379
along

89
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:30,900
it thinks it's the exception

90
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,280
doesn't matter what the emerging

91
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,900
technology is it claims to be

92
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:36,780
exceptional so we can't do that anymore

93
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,879
because this technology is so new that

94
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,920
we have to throw out the Playbook

95
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:42,599
and write a new one

96
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,940
and we know from history that that's

97
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,799
just not the case

98
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:48,060
so

99
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:50,879
emerging technology is usually involve a

100
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:52,220
bunch of traditional technology

101
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:54,720
experience combined with something new

102
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,360
and what we're really doing is trading a

103
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,000
set of known issues and complexities for

104
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,680
a set of unknown issues and complexities

105
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,720
and as we're figuring out those unknown

106
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,360
issues and complexities that's really

107
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,900
where things start to merge around

108
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,060
security

109
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:14,760
so hopefully you'll start to see this

110
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:17,279
kind of tied together

111
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,358
if you look at the news on this topic

112
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,360
you've probably noticed things like you

113
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:26,400
know billions of dollars in illicit

114
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,120
transactions for example or you know 2.2

115
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,979
billion dollars stolen from D5 and these

116
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:35,220
are 2021's numbers by the way it's still

117
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:40,580
very bad today uh will be worse in 2020.

118
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:43,199
if you notice this week that there was a

119
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,660
cryptocurrency mixer uh that got

120
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,160
sanctioned by the US government because

121
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,080
a lot of these illicit transactions

122
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:51,419
often end up going through a mixer for

123
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:53,160
anonymization

124
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,979
and the community is kind of upset about

125
00:04:55,979 --> 00:04:57,960
that

126
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,560
um for several reasons so I understand

127
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,180
the need for

128
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,220
a certain amount of anonymity in the

129
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:06,240
space

130
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,460
so I understand why three watermelons

131
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,919
guy wants to be three watermelons guy

132
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:13,680
and not a real name

133
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,139
everybody is acting as their own bank if

134
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:17,820
you know who three watermelons guy is

135
00:05:17,820 --> 00:05:19,860
then you can visit Three watermelon's

136
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:22,380
guy's house and if you know he has a

137
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:23,660
certain amount of

138
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:26,039
cryptocurrency you may be able to force

139
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:28,020
them to turn it over but what I don't

140
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:29,900
understand is why three watermelons guy

141
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:33,060
took money during The Nomad Bridge

142
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,060
exploit and that's really a problem that

143
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,139
the community is going to have to come

144
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:39,180
to grips with otherwise they're going to

145
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,360
see more and more regulation

146
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,639
this year we saw a top 10 cryptocurrency

147
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,860
tumble a project that many people

148
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:48,419
thought was going to be the next big

149
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:49,800
thing

150
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:51,960
we started seeing more traditional

151
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:54,900
attacks affecting the web 3 space

152
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:57,780
so maybe you've heard about projects

153
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,840
discords being hacked or there was an

154
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:04,440
issue with customer.io who you know was

155
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:06,840
compromised and

156
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,639
doctors were able to send notifications

157
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,759
to uh Project's customers

158
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:13,440
these things are going to become more

159
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,440
and more common as this space increases

160
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,699
in popularity

161
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:19,620
and I mean it's not like you don't know

162
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,020
where people who collect cryptocurrency

163
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:23,940
and nfts hang out

164
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:25,919
if somebody collects cryptocurrencies

165
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,199
and nfts they really want you to know

166
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:30,000
that they collect them

167
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,039
so they're kind of creating themselves

168
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:34,680
as their own targets

169
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,539
and here's another thing

170
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:40,199
everyone is acting as their own bank

171
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:42,300
that's not just people that's the

172
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,240
projects and that's what leads to such a

173
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,000
high impact when these things get hacked

174
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,819
if I had to summarize the entire

175
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:52,080
situation

176
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:53,940
you know we're seeing in a single

177
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,680
sentence

178
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,680
and why it's so bad I would say we have

179
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:01,080
inexperienced developers writing new

180
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,699
Financial products

181
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:05,520
on emerging Platforms in full public

182
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,660
View

183
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,520
where the cost of failure is incredibly

184
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,280
high and exploitation effort and time is

185
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,600
incredibly low

186
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:16,199
that is a perfect storm of factors all

187
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:18,240
coming together that means it's not just

188
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,639
an experience it's not just being

189
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:24,300
irresponsible it's something else if it

190
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,280
were just one of those we may not see

191
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:27,720
things so bad

192
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,960
but we have high value targets with

193
00:07:30,960 --> 00:07:33,960
public exposure and unexplored attack

194
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,660
surface so we haven't found all of the

195
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,819
issues in the space yet we're still

196
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:41,099
finding them and this means that simple

197
00:07:41,099 --> 00:07:42,479
mistakes

198
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:44,160
can have immediate and devastating

199
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:46,800
consequences and if you're a web 3

200
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:48,840
developer and you launch a successful

201
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,699
project one of the first lessons you

202
00:07:50,699 --> 00:07:53,520
learn is that Gone in 60 Seconds isn't

203
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,199
just a terrible Nicholas Cage movie it's

204
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,539
also what happens to all of your money

205
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:00,180
because the time to exploit this stuff

206
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:02,520
is incredibly fast and it's something

207
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,860
we're not used to seeing we're used to a

208
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,500
more traditional attacker approach where

209
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,660
there's you know some some

210
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,900
reconnaissance and there's some

211
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,160
exploration some exploitation and

212
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,500
pivoting and owning different systems

213
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:18,780
but some of these are so exposed you can

214
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:22,020
literally call a function and get money

215
00:08:22,020 --> 00:08:24,660
this means that web 3 projects don't

216
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:28,560
have the luxury of failing gracefully

217
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,000
if you're going to lose all of your

218
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,458
money then you're going to have a bad

219
00:08:32,458 --> 00:08:34,679
time I don't think anybody would have

220
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:37,320
any any uh argument there

221
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:38,940
so now I want to get to the point where

222
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:41,039
I'm trying to convince you know Security

223
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,779
Professionals about why they should care

224
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:44,520
about the space because you might say

225
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:46,140
well that's all well and good

226
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,940
you know crypto Bros are going to do

227
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,500
crypto bro stuff and I'm just going to

228
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:51,060
go over here

229
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,620
and do my thing

230
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,820
so

231
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,279
the world is not a better place when

232
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:57,779
vulnerable technology is out there

233
00:08:57,779 --> 00:08:59,880
because we tend to find that this

234
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,380
technology gets adopted in strange

235
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:03,120
places we didn't expect

236
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,060
and it puts us behind the curve

237
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:07,740
there's also some legitimately cool

238
00:09:07,740 --> 00:09:10,080
technology I mentioned threshold

239
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:11,760
cryptography and zero knowledge proofs

240
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,640
these are being funded in large part by

241
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,380
blockchain companies

242
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,860
and these have a useful impact on

243
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,760
regular business

244
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,860
if you're monetarily driven and you're

245
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,779
into bug bounties I can't think of a

246
00:09:27,779 --> 00:09:30,899
better space to be in because we had a

247
00:09:30,899 --> 00:09:32,519
10 million dollar bug Bounty paid out

248
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,620
followed by a nine million dollar or a

249
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,540
sorry six million dollar bug value

250
00:09:36,540 --> 00:09:38,339
I mean that's a pretty impressive amount

251
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:41,600
of money for finding a bug

252
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,220
and of course nation states are getting

253
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,200
into the game as well

254
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,839
so the Lazarus group was attributed to

255
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,080
the uh Ronan Ronin network attack which

256
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:56,040
was the largest crypto pack in history

257
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:58,140
and I have a little bit of a I'm going

258
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,640
to talk about that a little bit more but

259
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,899
that means that this vulnerable

260
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:04,019
technology could be fueling the nuclear

261
00:10:04,019 --> 00:10:07,200
Ambitions of a nation-state

262
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,600
and of course one of the number one

263
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,720
points is that this space cannot be

264
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,240
successful without security there is a

265
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,880
fundamental coupling between Safety and

266
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:19,080
Security

267
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,120
we haven't really seen that I mean if

268
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:23,459
you if you look at if you attended how

269
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:24,720
many people attended the first day

270
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,459
Keynote

271
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:28,260
okay quite a few

272
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,600
if you heard Chris Krebs say that

273
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,519
vulnerable software is more valuable

274
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,800
than secure software because the

275
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,540
developers don't feel an impact after

276
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,220
it's compromised

277
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:40,380
this space does

278
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:42,420
this is a use case where you cannot be

279
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,760
successful without security

280
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:46,200
and I know

281
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:50,040
I've been in this community for 20 years

282
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,260
and I know there's one thing we love and

283
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,880
that is to hate

284
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:56,880
we love to hate it's in our bones

285
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,740
I remember walking around conferences

286
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,660
there is no Cloud only someone else's

287
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:03,720
computer uh and I would wonder how many

288
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:05,220
of those people are now Cloud Security

289
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:07,079
Professionals

290
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:09,540
we tend to be behind the curve

291
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:12,420
and we also don't realize that this new

292
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:15,180
technology often forces us to come up

293
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,860
with new protection mechanisms that we

294
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:18,839
may not have came up with otherwise

295
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:21,120
so if you think of like iot and secure

296
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,279
elements you know all of these things

297
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,560
forced us to step up our game and it had

298
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,620
an effect far beyond the domain that it

299
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:29,640
was in

300
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,320
if you are a security professional

301
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,120
there's really only two things you

302
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,320
should hate

303
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,240
and that is people who hate specific

304
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,500
Technologies

305
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:40,320
and PHP everybody can hate PHP is

306
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,040
definitely okay

307
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:46,620
and I know what you're thinking

308
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:48,839
I had to mention nfts and you're like

309
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:51,720
yeah I got you but even nfts I think

310
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,180
people it's not people don't hate nfts

311
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,920
people hate people who collect nfts

312
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,959
which is like uh hate the player not the

313
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,720
game type of a thing

314
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,640
um but I would I would even have you

315
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,279
take a step back on nfts because what

316
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:07,019
we're really seeing in this space is

317
00:12:07,019 --> 00:12:08,940
something we're not used to we are

318
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,279
seeing technology experiments play out

319
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:12,899
in full public View

320
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,700
and this isn't something we're used to

321
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:17,040
you know we are used to Innovation

322
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,640
happening in stealth mode and private

323
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:23,339
test users and Decades of development

324
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:26,160
and marketing slicks with wild claims

325
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,320
and quantum teleportation and all the

326
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,420
other things that happen with

327
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,100
traditional innovation

328
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,320
so before we get into this before we

329
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,959
start diving into this keep an open mind

330
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:38,940
because this is something new it's

331
00:12:38,940 --> 00:12:41,579
challenging and it will really force

332
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:44,639
ourselves to move forward

333
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,800
as a security professional if you're

334
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,899
interested in getting into the space one

335
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:50,100
of the first things you have to do is

336
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:52,320
Define the Delta so what is the Delta

337
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,779
between all of the experience we know

338
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:56,820
and have as a community and what we need

339
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:59,100
to know for this space and hopefully as

340
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:01,620
we move along you will see quite a bit

341
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,540
of Delta filling with knowledge you

342
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,459
already have

343
00:13:05,459 --> 00:13:08,279
so web3 architecture

344
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:11,279
if you've ever tried to develop a web 3

345
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,800
application you may have went through a

346
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,600
hello world and you saw something

347
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:17,339
relatively straightforward

348
00:13:17,339 --> 00:13:19,800
you basically built an application you

349
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,839
deployed it on the Chain Utopia happened

350
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,000
World Peace followed and everybody was

351
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:25,680
fine

352
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,740
that only works if you don't need let's

353
00:13:28,740 --> 00:13:30,600
see what don't you need uh if you need

354
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,200
data that would be bad if you need scale

355
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,720
that would also be bad if you needed

356
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,760
speed that would also be bad you know

357
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,500
three things that developers often don't

358
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,240
care about

359
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,279
then you get into something that looks a

360
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:46,800
lot more complicated so you end up

361
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,940
having to use an API on a wallet and of

362
00:13:50,940 --> 00:13:53,100
course you know traditional storage is

363
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,920
for mere mortals so you have to use ipfs

364
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,440
or airweave or something like that and

365
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:00,060
of course if the chain is too slow then

366
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:01,620
you have to build another chain on top

367
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,240
of a chain so that you can chain

368
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,920
everything together

369
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:07,260
each of these components

370
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,660
creates a new attack surface

371
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:11,220
something else that you need to think

372
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,040
about and protect

373
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,600
and I'm not going to go through all of

374
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,940
these but one unique thing about the web

375
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,320
3 space that's a little different than

376
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:20,579
some of the other emerging technologies

377
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:22,800
that have come along like you know AI

378
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:25,079
for instance is this space is really

379
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:27,480
trying to recreate everything

380
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,880
and we didn't really see that with a I

381
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,639
we tried to solve new problems with AI

382
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:34,019
we try to solve partitional problems

383
00:14:34,019 --> 00:14:36,839
with AI but we really didn't tokenize it

384
00:14:36,839 --> 00:14:38,100
and try to throw it all over the world

385
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:40,680
and all this other stuff so they're

386
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:42,240
really trying to reinvent a lot of

387
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:45,180
things and some of these components

388
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,519
are and can be incredibly vulnerable and

389
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,980
Incredibly costly

390
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,100
so this is a massive and complex space

391
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,899
once again A lot of times when you hear

392
00:14:54,899 --> 00:14:57,300
talks on this subject it's about

393
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:59,220
ethereum there's more than one

394
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,779
blockchain

395
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:02,579
so we really have hundreds of

396
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:04,079
blockchains and if you think about the

397
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,240
attack surface and how it works

398
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,980
Every Chain you can kind of think about

399
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,440
as being its own operating system in

400
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:13,380
every smart contract language is its own

401
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,459
framework

402
00:15:14,459 --> 00:15:16,980
not all of the knowledge translates even

403
00:15:16,980 --> 00:15:19,139
across chains which can make it hard to

404
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:20,820
ramp up because you have to be hyper

405
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:23,279
focused the other thing to keep in mind

406
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:25,019
is that each of these smart contract

407
00:15:25,019 --> 00:15:27,720
languages and chains have quirks

408
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,339
well quarks is a bit of an

409
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:31,380
understatement because if you initialize

410
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:32,820
something with the wrong value it'll

411
00:15:32,820 --> 00:15:34,560
default to true and then everybody gets

412
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,180
money except for you

413
00:15:36,180 --> 00:15:37,740
so these are the things that you need to

414
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,420
account for when you're threat modeling

415
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:41,820
when you're testing

416
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:44,459
and of course blockchains are extremely

417
00:15:44,459 --> 00:15:45,540
Limited

418
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:47,820
they don't know about each other

419
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:49,440
so they don't know each other exists

420
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,880
they don't know the world exists either

421
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,240
which creates quite a few problems so

422
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:55,440
for example

423
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:58,320
ethereum doesn't know that Solana exists

424
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,500
and Bitcoin doesn't know that Terra

425
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,560
exists sorry it doesn't anymore too soon

426
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,600
okay sorry

427
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,940
um so all of these things

428
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,560
are things that developers want to get

429
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:11,579
around

430
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:13,440
so what these spaces have allowed is

431
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,839
loopholes right so developers create

432
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,639
workarounds for these things like

433
00:16:17,639 --> 00:16:21,180
oracles and cross chain Bridges and side

434
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:24,360
chains and uh so this is wrecked how

435
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:25,860
many people have ever been on wrecked

436
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,060
before

437
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:29,339
okay very good Rex maintains the

438
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:32,399
leaderboard of the top half basically

439
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:35,160
and what I've done oh yeah okay so that

440
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:37,980
was last week slot it in at number five

441
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:41,279
so these are cross-chain bridges and

442
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,019
side chains

443
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:45,899
ways of breaking out of one blockchain

444
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:47,339
to another

445
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,740
and it accounts for most of the value

446
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,440
lost during these hacks

447
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:54,180
if you think about core blockchain

448
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,860
Technologies it's pretty it's been

449
00:16:55,860 --> 00:16:57,600
pretty resilient you know we haven't had

450
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:59,820
a lot of you know core blockchain

451
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,639
problems with security it's always the

452
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,160
apps running on top and it's many times

453
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,619
involving apps that are trying to bridge

454
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:10,319
tokens from one to another

455
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,359
and for attackers

456
00:17:12,359 --> 00:17:15,419
it starts with the end

457
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:16,799
so

458
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:18,540
an attack needs to start at the end

459
00:17:18,540 --> 00:17:20,280
because you need to figure out your exit

460
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,020
strategy

461
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,119
because if you just hack something and

462
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:27,359
move it to a wallet and keep it there

463
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,919
and don't move it and then figure out

464
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:30,540
what to do with it later there's a

465
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,940
larger possibility that somebody's going

466
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:35,280
to be able to find out who that is and

467
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,160
possibly even recover some of the tokens

468
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,919
so what you see I mean and it's the

469
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:43,140
other thing that happens too is it's not

470
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:44,700
like you can just hack something and

471
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:46,620
then call call up Apple and say hey can

472
00:17:46,620 --> 00:17:48,539
I get 100 million in iTunes gift cards

473
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:51,299
that doesn't work either

474
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:53,820
so what what uh groups that are money

475
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:56,460
laundering do is they try to confuse

476
00:17:56,460 --> 00:17:59,039
analysis so a lot of times there'll be a

477
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,419
hack that happens it'll hit a cross

478
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:02,400
Chain Bridge it'll go to another chain

479
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:05,340
like ethereum then it will go to some D5

480
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,440
projects then they'll put some in a

481
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,419
mixer which anonymizes the transactions

482
00:18:09,419 --> 00:18:11,580
and then it's gone

483
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:15,780
so the exit strategy starts first

484
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:18,120
so let's look at a few attacks and I

485
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,679
chose a couple of these attacks to kind

486
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:21,120
of highlight

487
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,880
very simple to very complex

488
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:27,419
and another benefit is that all of these

489
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:29,820
attacks happened this year

490
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:33,240
and two of them last week so you can

491
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,280
tell how how late I was putting my

492
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:37,260
presentation together but a bonus to you

493
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,900
you get uh very new information

494
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:42,179
so let's look at Nomad bridge this was

495
00:18:42,179 --> 00:18:45,000
the one that I dropped in uh number five

496
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,940
on wrecked uh this is a cross Chain

497
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:49,559
Bridge so

498
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:52,020
like I said you know blockchains don't

499
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,520
talk with each other so you may have

500
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,380
value you may have tokens on one network

501
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,179
and want to use them to buy something on

502
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:59,400
another or invest in some protocol on

503
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,840
another chain

504
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,880
so cross chain Bridges allow that to

505
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,200
happen

506
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,380
and the issue here was that there was an

507
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,120
there was a value that was initialized

508
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:12,120
to zero which bypassed you know all of

509
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:14,640
the all of the messages or all of the

510
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,740
authorization of the messages and and

511
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:20,100
people were able to drain the tokens

512
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:23,100
basically what was interesting here is

513
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,360
that you didn't need to know anything

514
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,160
about the attack you didn't need to know

515
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,200
any solidity didn't need to know make

516
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,840
any calls all you had to do was capture

517
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:33,299
a successful transaction replace the

518
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:35,220
wallet address and broadcast it on the

519
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:37,620
network and you got money too

520
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:40,799
probably the the lowest bar for an

521
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:42,419
attack so there were people exploiting

522
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:43,919
this that didn't even know how the

523
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,340
attack works uh so another interesting

524
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,080
fact here is it means that it wasn't a

525
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:51,120
single person attacking it it was like a

526
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,360
bunch of I guess web3 piranhas that just

527
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,860
were taking little bites until there was

528
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:57,240
no money left

529
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,520
uh also if you remember our pal 3

530
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:02,039
watermelons guy he claimed to be a white

531
00:20:02,039 --> 00:20:05,100
hat after the fact and said FBI don't

532
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,480
chase me down I'm gonna give the money

533
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,039
back

534
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:11,640
um so maybe he did that from the first

535
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:13,860
part or maybe his team won and he

536
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,380
flipped over a cop car and uh you know

537
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:18,480
now he's regretting it regardless he

538
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,299
says he's given the money back

539
00:20:21,299 --> 00:20:22,980
this is probably going to be incredibly

540
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:26,100
hard to read but um

541
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,900
if you can read that

542
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:30,360
it says private key

543
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,160
in mnemonic

544
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,160
and you can see the values sitting there

545
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:37,799
so anybody here familiar with how

546
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:40,320
cryptocurrency wallets work

547
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,440
so you know what happens when you with

548
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,539
the mnemonic you can reinstantiate the

549
00:20:45,539 --> 00:20:48,720
wallet so last week there was a bunch of

550
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:49,919
people who were having their wallets

551
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:53,100
drained and they couldn't figure out why

552
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,160
it was slope wallet which is a

553
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,240
non-custodial cryptocurrency wallet

554
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,880
which means you're managing it yourself

555
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:02,340
what happened was there was uh the

556
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,380
mobile application had verbose logging

557
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,360
enabled the developer wanted to learn

558
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:08,400
more about the users and that's just

559
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,140
what you do you crank the logging up to

560
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:12,059
a thousand and collect every bit of

561
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:14,280
information and send it to a third-party

562
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:15,720
cloud service

563
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:18,840
well all of the private keys and all the

564
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:20,340
mnemonics were going to this cloud

565
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:22,679
service so that meant all of the wallets

566
00:21:22,679 --> 00:21:24,720
were vulnerable to compromise and reason

567
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,280
this was interesting is because it's

568
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:28,320
kind of like a web 2 issue affecting web

569
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,179
3 which shows that hey you need to get

570
00:21:30,179 --> 00:21:31,980
everything right it was a

571
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:35,880
misconfiguration and another interesting

572
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:38,400
theme that you'll see is that the team

573
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,659
didn't notice

574
00:21:39,659 --> 00:21:41,340
so you're collecting all of this verbose

575
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,020
information and you don't look at it

576
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,760
because anybody who looked at that would

577
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,620
know oh wow that's bad that probably

578
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,639
should never happen ever

579
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:52,860
uh the Ronin network is another good

580
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,780
example because I think this is where

581
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:56,400
attacks are headed

582
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:59,159
so the Ronin network uh used in ethereum

583
00:21:59,159 --> 00:22:02,700
so is anybody familiar with axi infinity

584
00:22:02,700 --> 00:22:06,179
okay so uh very high level axi Infinity

585
00:22:06,179 --> 00:22:08,820
is a video game it's a play to earn

586
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,860
video game and it's a place where people

587
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,840
who collect nfts can go to have their

588
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:14,220
nfts battle it out with each other

589
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:15,659
rather than battling people on the

590
00:22:15,659 --> 00:22:18,900
internet so basically you could play to

591
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,299
earn they had to use their own side

592
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:24,659
chain uh to for performance reasons

593
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:27,000
and what ended up happening was there

594
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:29,580
was nine validators

595
00:22:29,580 --> 00:22:31,200
if you can control a majority of the

596
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,539
validators then you can control the

597
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:35,880
transactions four of those validators

598
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:38,400
were run by Sky Mavis the the

599
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,900
organization that was building the video

600
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,280
game

601
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:44,039
in true uh if you're familiar with the

602
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:45,840
Lazarus group and their techniques in

603
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:48,120
true Lazarus group fashion started with

604
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:49,620
a phishing attack

605
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,860
so they identified a developer made him

606
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,419
a lucrative job offer he went through

607
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:57,299
job interviews and of course what do you

608
00:22:57,299 --> 00:23:00,120
do you send them an offer letter well

609
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,500
the offer letter had a nice little

610
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:03,000
surprise in it like the Lazarus group

611
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,140
likes to do

612
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:06,679
and next thing you know

613
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:09,840
624 million dollars was gone

614
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:10,980
from

615
00:23:10,980 --> 00:23:12,960
from the Ronin Network

616
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:15,659
I was attributed to a nation-state and

617
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:17,280
how would you how would you like to feel

618
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,100
to be that guy like uh completely

619
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:22,799
terrible uh the reason I say that this

620
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,600
is the I think this is the future where

621
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:25,860
some of this stuff is going is because

622
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:28,260
it's not like the Lazarus group didn't

623
00:23:28,260 --> 00:23:31,080
start with the smart contracts

624
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,120
they probably didn't find anything and

625
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,159
then they went back to their old tricks

626
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:36,900
and if you're familiar with the bank of

627
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,700
Bangladesh attack that they had which

628
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:40,260
before was the largest banking attack

629
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,179
against the Swift system took them a

630
00:23:42,179 --> 00:23:43,200
year

631
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,240
they had to plant things on the network

632
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,760
and hope that nobody updated things and

633
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:49,200
wiped out their attack

634
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:51,840
so this is combining multiple attacks

635
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,640
chaining multiple attacks together to

636
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:56,700
compromise one of these projects

637
00:23:56,700 --> 00:24:00,240
another one of these is Beanstalk I

638
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,760
think the Verge article kind of uh

639
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:05,159
summed it up well it says cryptocurrency

640
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:07,320
project robbed after hacked her votes to

641
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,320
send himself 182 million dollars

642
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,460
so one of the things that's being

643
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,840
experimented with in this space is this

644
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:18,539
concept of community governance so if

645
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:20,880
you've ever heard of a Dao but basically

646
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,280
it means that the project votes on what

647
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,140
to do with things and basically an

648
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:26,640
attacker was able to manipulate the

649
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,440
governance protocol through a flash loan

650
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,380
which is a you know a loan that you can

651
00:24:31,380 --> 00:24:32,640
take out that you have to pay by the

652
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,740
payback by the end of the transaction so

653
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,179
they were able to buy themselves a

654
00:24:36,179 --> 00:24:37,940
majority share

655
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:40,620
and vote to send himself all the money

656
00:24:40,620 --> 00:24:43,740
they used an emergency protocol

657
00:24:43,740 --> 00:24:45,720
made it had a 24-hour hold on it and

658
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,700
nobody noticed and he ended up getting

659
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:50,520
the money so interesting here use of a

660
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,260
flash loan which is

661
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,140
a legitimate thing for

662
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:57,419
collecting money from Arbitrage into

663
00:24:57,419 --> 00:24:59,640
attacks it's also interesting because

664
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:01,500
normally you know you hear of like 51

665
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,960
percent attack and but this is a way to

666
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:05,940
get billions of dollars

667
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:09,260
relatively easily

668
00:25:09,419 --> 00:25:12,600
so there are some themes here uh so

669
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:15,240
known security issues in code poor

670
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,980
architecture and Design

671
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:18,539
you know all of these things are common

672
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:22,100
with traditional software

673
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:25,740
and of course almost back to traditional

674
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:28,620
software is cultural organization and

675
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:31,380
experience and process and operations so

676
00:25:31,380 --> 00:25:33,059
you might wonder given all of these

677
00:25:33,059 --> 00:25:34,320
attacks and given the devastating

678
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:36,360
consequences why is this not being

679
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:37,740
addressed

680
00:25:37,740 --> 00:25:39,539
so let's start off with culture because

681
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:41,640
everything starts off with culture these

682
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,400
are not Enterprises many times they do

683
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,020
not look like Enterprises they don't

684
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,279
have security people they don't have

685
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:48,720
security staff

686
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:51,240
it really falls on a spectrum so it

687
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:53,220
could just be a project of two people or

688
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,440
it could be something like a centralized

689
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,539
exchange so a centralized exchange has

690
00:25:57,539 --> 00:25:59,640
governance they have to Regulatory

691
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:01,260
Compliance they look a lot more like a

692
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:03,840
traditional project regardless of size

693
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:07,200
you will be attacked by a nation-state

694
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,640
so it's important to keep in mind you

695
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:10,440
may not be dealing with a company it may

696
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,720
be a small project of a couple people

697
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,299
and they are experimenting with a lot of

698
00:26:15,299 --> 00:26:17,159
different Technologies and each of these

699
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:18,779
Technologies

700
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:21,419
has its own attack surface and its own

701
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:24,179
things to be accounted for

702
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:26,100
like flash loans for instance that's

703
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,179
something new

704
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:29,520
like there's no analog for that like

705
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:31,320
walking like taking on a loan from A

706
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:34,080
bank and saying walking up to the teller

707
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,659
she hands you ten thousand dollars you

708
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:38,820
take it you hand it back and you pay her

709
00:26:38,820 --> 00:26:40,919
ten thousand one hundred dollars like

710
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:43,799
that just doesn't exist in real life but

711
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:45,419
if you don't know what one is then you

712
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:47,039
don't know how to threat model it when

713
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,299
you're threat modeling a protocol

714
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,820
now it's time for the the dirty word so

715
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,559
you might want to plug your ears that's

716
00:26:55,559 --> 00:26:57,240
decentralization

717
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,820
so decentralization is one of the things

718
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,460
that may slightly frustrate you in the

719
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:03,419
space

720
00:27:03,419 --> 00:27:06,299
and that's because it's often referred

721
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:10,140
to as you know a lack of ownership which

722
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:15,480
is a it's a feature and a drawback

723
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,340
and if you think about it on one hand

724
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:19,260
it's nice because things are Community

725
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:21,900
owned you own your own stuff but on the

726
00:27:21,900 --> 00:27:24,059
flip side decentralization also means an

727
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:26,100
attack of accounting for problems it

728
00:27:26,100 --> 00:27:28,740
means nobody owns the issues either

729
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,779
so these projects are meant to be

730
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:32,580
Community owned many times

731
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,140
but what you find is when you start

732
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:36,659
doing a dow a decentralized autonomous

733
00:27:36,659 --> 00:27:39,059
organization and you start voting on

734
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:41,820
things you realize it's not necessarily

735
00:27:41,820 --> 00:27:43,559
as Fair as it seems so usually people

736
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:46,440
with more money have more say and

737
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:48,419
sometimes those people say things that

738
00:27:48,419 --> 00:27:50,220
you don't like like hey I vote to

739
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:51,779
liquidate this project and take all the

740
00:27:51,779 --> 00:27:54,539
money and that's a legitimate vote right

741
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:56,400
that's not even an attack that's like

742
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:58,320
part of the design

743
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:00,539
and so these dowels often control money

744
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:02,400
but I think the important thing to think

745
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,620
about here to to take away to talk about

746
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:06,000
some of these projects is you cannot

747
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:09,179
solve tactical problems with a Dao it

748
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:10,620
cannot be up to the community about

749
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,240
whether to patch a piece of vulnerable

750
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,720
software

751
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,039
so a good lesson learned that we learned

752
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,779
in the traditional space that applies

753
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:20,820
here is that the community will not

754
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:23,340
solve your Project's issues

755
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:24,900
we haven't seen it in any other

756
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,960
community it won't it won't do it here

757
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:31,320
some other cultural issues that plague

758
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:33,779
security here is

759
00:28:33,779 --> 00:28:35,940
um if you have never dealt with the web

760
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:38,279
3 project this will be surprising to you

761
00:28:38,279 --> 00:28:40,620
like the purposeful not wanting to make

762
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,539
code upgradable

763
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:45,240
deploy once never touch it

764
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,340
and that's meant to build trust right

765
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:49,860
with the community the the huge downside

766
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:51,840
here is that we haven't even found all

767
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:53,700
the security issues yet like this

768
00:28:53,700 --> 00:28:56,279
security is an active area of research

769
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:58,559
so if they have code that is not able to

770
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:01,980
be updated then there's no way to

771
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:04,980
protect the project the other things

772
00:29:04,980 --> 00:29:06,600
here are

773
00:29:06,600 --> 00:29:09,419
putting in um safeguards into the

774
00:29:09,419 --> 00:29:12,240
contract that will you know allow people

775
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,220
or allow yourself some protection like

776
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:15,779
not allowing people to drain all the

777
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:18,240
funds at once or putting rate limiting

778
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,100
in the contract

779
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:22,620
you also see things like radical

780
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:26,039
transparency so it's not uncommon to go

781
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:28,260
buy a Project's GitHub page and see

782
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:30,179
security issues in their public bug

783
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:32,700
tracker so I mean hey if somebody

784
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:33,960
reports an issue and you can never

785
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:37,200
update it uh that's bad or if somebody's

786
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:39,059
able to exploit the issue before you

787
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:42,840
have a chance to fix it that's also bad

788
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:44,279
um you know and there's also another

789
00:29:44,279 --> 00:29:45,840
mentality that people should be able to

790
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,460
write vulnerable code because that's

791
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:51,080
like some sort of web 3 Darwinism

792
00:29:51,899 --> 00:29:54,419
all of this makes your project less

793
00:29:54,419 --> 00:29:58,500
secure and to quote Dr Ian Malcolm

794
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:02,940
nature finds a way and so do attackers

795
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,860
it's not like nation states only have

796
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,720
one technique and if that technique

797
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:07,980
doesn't work they move on to somebody

798
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:09,960
else that's just not how it works

799
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,940
they're not called Advanced simplistic

800
00:30:11,940 --> 00:30:14,220
threats

801
00:30:14,220 --> 00:30:16,860
so we need to make sure that projects

802
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:18,720
understand they need to cover a lot of

803
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,940
ground otherwise they can just waive

804
00:30:20,940 --> 00:30:23,899
their money goodbye

805
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,640
inexperiences is probably the one that

806
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,860
you're the most familiar with

807
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:30,419
um the most noticeable attributes

808
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:32,580
inexperience and irresponsibility often

809
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,559
look very similar from the outside so

810
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,179
sometimes if somebody's inexperienced it

811
00:30:36,179 --> 00:30:37,020
often looks like they're acting

812
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,820
irresponsibly and what I've found is

813
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:40,740
that many project developers are very

814
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:43,320
new to to development in general they

815
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:45,539
just don't know certain things exist

816
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:47,100
but one of the things you'll never hear

817
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,860
after somebody wins a hackathon is yay

818
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:51,720
we got funded now it's time to look at

819
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:53,340
security

820
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:58,020
maturity has a direct impact on security

821
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:01,380
and privacy and safety

822
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:03,659
so these projects aren't doing the most

823
00:31:03,659 --> 00:31:06,419
basic things like asking what happens

824
00:31:06,419 --> 00:31:08,700
when something goes wrong

825
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,740
which is something we all ask I mean

826
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,480
it's even part of threat modeling you

827
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,799
know what happens when this stops

828
00:31:13,799 --> 00:31:16,080
working so they have no plan when

829
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,820
something they have no way of preventing

830
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:20,220
things going wrong they think they're

831
00:31:20,220 --> 00:31:22,919
including security

832
00:31:22,919 --> 00:31:25,260
but quite often you know they use a

833
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:26,760
security audit as some sort of proof

834
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,840
that they've done everything well

835
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,240
security it begins and ends at a

836
00:31:30,240 --> 00:31:32,460
security audit you know they may need an

837
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:34,380
audit for funding they may need an audit

838
00:31:34,380 --> 00:31:37,320
to prove to the community that is safe

839
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,779
but the problem here is that we've had

840
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:42,539
people and we've done audits for these

841
00:31:42,539 --> 00:31:45,059
projects and then they get they have a

842
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:46,980
security issue and then they say well

843
00:31:46,980 --> 00:31:48,120
that should have been founded but it

844
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:49,380
wasn't even in the code we were looking

845
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:51,299
at like it wasn't part of the code we

846
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:53,820
had one one project that we found a very

847
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:56,279
severe issue we reported it to them

848
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:57,659
they're like oh that's bad we're not

849
00:31:57,659 --> 00:31:59,039
using that code so we're going to remove

850
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,779
it everything's fine a month later

851
00:32:00,779 --> 00:32:02,220
they're like oh yeah we were using that

852
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:03,659
they put it back in

853
00:32:03,659 --> 00:32:05,880
and that happens so that shows you no

854
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,679
matter how many audits you do

855
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,440
you will not be safe and if you don't

856
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,620
have processes that follow along

857
00:32:13,620 --> 00:32:15,240
you have to get everything right the

858
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,640
first time there are no guard rails like

859
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,799
traditional developers may have

860
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:21,960
so that means all the on-chain code all

861
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,640
of your communication third-party

862
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:25,980
components the design of your protocols

863
00:32:25,980 --> 00:32:27,779
and logic so some of the quote unquote

864
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,880
hacks that you hear about aren't

865
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:32,640
exploits of the smart contract functions

866
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,460
per se it's a hack on the design of the

867
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:37,380
protocol that made it vulnerable and

868
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:38,700
that's something that's a little new in

869
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:41,100
our space

870
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:43,500
so you have to know what can go wrong

871
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,919
and how to protect it and of course as

872
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:48,899
we all know from the traditional space a

873
00:32:48,899 --> 00:32:50,399
lesson that hasn't been learned is that

874
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:52,020
an audit will not solve all of these

875
00:32:52,020 --> 00:32:55,740
issues security can't come at the end

876
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,600
so from a process and standards

877
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,159
perspective

878
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:01,200
there really are none

879
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:04,980
so we've had developers put equality

880
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:07,380
operators in the wrong direction

881
00:33:07,380 --> 00:33:09,299
I mean if you think about building a

882
00:33:09,299 --> 00:33:11,100
financial product you think that you'd

883
00:33:11,100 --> 00:33:13,080
want the equality operators in the right

884
00:33:13,080 --> 00:33:14,940
direction there's been projects that

885
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:16,860
have paid out way too much money to

886
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:18,240
participants and then had to beg them

887
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:19,740
for all the money back

888
00:33:19,740 --> 00:33:22,080
so it's not a good place to be in

889
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,299
if they had a simple QA process where

890
00:33:24,299 --> 00:33:25,559
more than one person looked at the code

891
00:33:25,559 --> 00:33:26,820
they may have at least found the simple

892
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,200
issues

893
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,419
there's no formal you know security bug

894
00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:32,519
reporting all of these other things are

895
00:33:32,519 --> 00:33:34,740
missing that we're used to seeing

896
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:37,140
in the space and that's because they're

897
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:38,700
just not learning from adjacent

898
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,500
Technologies they're not learning from

899
00:33:40,500 --> 00:33:41,880
Dev the things that we've done in

900
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,260
devsecops they're not learning from

901
00:33:43,260 --> 00:33:44,460
threat modeling they're not learning

902
00:33:44,460 --> 00:33:46,200
from any of this stuff

903
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,080
and I mentioned monitoring before so

904
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:51,120
another thing that's not happening this

905
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,039
is a public blockchain you can see all

906
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:54,600
of the transactions but none of these

907
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:56,279
projects are really monitoring anything

908
00:33:56,279 --> 00:33:57,960
that's happening with their project so

909
00:33:57,960 --> 00:33:59,820
the Ronin validators attack the largest

910
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:03,120
attack that happened that was six days

911
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,880
after that they noticed that all their

912
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,679
money was gone and it wasn't even them

913
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,659
it was a member of the community imagine

914
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:11,219
a member of your community walking up oh

915
00:34:11,219 --> 00:34:12,659
yeah you don't have any money left why

916
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:14,159
am I dealing with you that's just not a

917
00:34:14,159 --> 00:34:15,599
great place to be

918
00:34:15,599 --> 00:34:18,599
another thing that's super important in

919
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:20,399
this space is it is having some way of

920
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:22,260
collecting intelligence

921
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:24,899
we're in a new space with new exploits

922
00:34:24,899 --> 00:34:27,300
new attack techniques if you are not

923
00:34:27,300 --> 00:34:29,760
taking if you are not learning lessons

924
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,679
from adjacent projects if you run a

925
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,359
wallet and somebody else's wallet gets

926
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,460
compromised it's probably a good idea to

927
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:37,199
say hey could that happen to us what

928
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,359
happened there now one of the great

929
00:34:39,359 --> 00:34:41,520
things about being open is that a lot of

930
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,139
these projects even after they get

931
00:34:43,139 --> 00:34:45,179
hacked and lose everything they'll do a

932
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:46,918
write-up on it and say exactly what

933
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,300
happened and most of them are pretty

934
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,339
honest which is actually pretty

935
00:34:50,339 --> 00:34:53,280
refreshing so there is ways of learning

936
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:57,180
from other failures to work into your

937
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,920
space

938
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,980
because you know crying is not the best

939
00:35:01,980 --> 00:35:04,380
incident response strategy

940
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:07,260
but if you haven't uh built protections

941
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,060
into your system if you haven't allowed

942
00:35:09,060 --> 00:35:11,280
your code to be upgradable it may be the

943
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,920
only strategy you have

944
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,359
so

945
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:17,579
I'm pretty hopeful about this space I

946
00:35:17,579 --> 00:35:19,920
mean we know more now than we did a few

947
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:21,839
years ago there's much more information

948
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,820
out there so if you're interested in

949
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:24,900
learning and getting into the space

950
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:26,520
there's more and more resources than

951
00:35:26,520 --> 00:35:29,160
ever today so I feel like this is

952
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:32,040
starting to become more of an attainable

953
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,140
space

954
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:36,420
and one of the things I always try to

955
00:35:36,420 --> 00:35:38,940
tell projects is that security is a team

956
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:41,520
sport you know nobody goes out and hires

957
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,160
a security Savant and they come in and

958
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,740
you know fix all the problems

959
00:35:46,740 --> 00:35:48,599
you know you can't even count on the

960
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:50,640
best security firm on the planet

961
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,339
to protect you by doing an audit if

962
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:55,380
everybody else in the process isn't

963
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,240
doing the right things

964
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,320
so

965
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:00,359
I hope that we can start making it

966
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:02,040
harder for attackers rather than

967
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,020
incredibly easy and that should be the

968
00:36:04,020 --> 00:36:04,980
goal

969
00:36:04,980 --> 00:36:08,460
so as Security Professionals filling the

970
00:36:08,460 --> 00:36:10,500
Deltas first and foremost so I mentioned

971
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,300
not being able to upgrade code and all

972
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:13,680
this other stuff there are other

973
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,599
controls that you can use to get the

974
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:17,640
same amount of trust if you don't

975
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:21,060
understand how the project works and the

976
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:24,780
apis and chain specific protections that

977
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:26,940
you can use then you wouldn't know to

978
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:28,800
make those recommendations

979
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,020
there are plenty of vulnerability

980
00:36:31,020 --> 00:36:35,339
write-ups ctfs bug Bounty programs all

981
00:36:35,339 --> 00:36:37,320
of these are

982
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,940
well you know all of these are available

983
00:36:38,940 --> 00:36:41,160
to you that you can start learning more

984
00:36:41,160 --> 00:36:43,339
about

985
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:46,440
VCS and Foundations who usually fund

986
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:48,359
these projects

987
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:50,280
um need to step it up

988
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,560
because just asking for an audit is not

989
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,180
solving the problem

990
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:57,420
so asking for security specific guidance

991
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,579
some sort of response a monitoring

992
00:36:59,579 --> 00:37:02,640
strategy you know all of these things

993
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,160
need to be accounted for so if you win a

994
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:07,440
hackathon you should have to put a plan

995
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:08,640
in place about how you're going to

996
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:12,060
address these issues before it launches

997
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:15,480
core chains so that would be you know

998
00:37:15,480 --> 00:37:18,000
ethereum Solana algorand all these core

999
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,420
chains have some responsibility too

1000
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:23,880
providing security documentation and

1001
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:26,760
guidance is something first and foremost

1002
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,820
funding more research

1003
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,160
but if we think about how we solve some

1004
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:34,140
of the traditional or more traditional

1005
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,240
security problems with code

1006
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:37,740
they should be looking for ways to

1007
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:40,560
instrument protections at compile time

1008
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,680
so be that through a dedicated framework

1009
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,619
or be that through native code

1010
00:37:46,619 --> 00:37:48,660
to catch those things

1011
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:50,339
so you shouldn't be allowed to make

1012
00:37:50,339 --> 00:37:51,900
painfully

1013
00:37:51,900 --> 00:37:54,300
obvious security issues now that won't

1014
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:55,560
solve the problem a lot of these are

1015
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:58,440
protocol specific but it's a start it's

1016
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,420
something

1017
00:38:00,420 --> 00:38:03,180
they should invest in continued research

1018
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:06,300
and of course publish reference

1019
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,980
architecture so if you're building an

1020
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:09,599
amm or you're building a cross stream

1021
00:38:09,599 --> 00:38:11,579
Bridge they should publish what a

1022
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:13,440
reference architecture looks like

1023
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:16,440
and projects need to learn this lesson

1024
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,420
is that there's no magical Innovation

1025
00:38:18,420 --> 00:38:20,520
coming along that will save you

1026
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,320
if there is they should tell us about it

1027
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,119
because we've been waiting for decades

1028
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:25,920
for some magical Innovation to come

1029
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:27,119
along to solve all these security

1030
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:28,680
problems

1031
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,839
it's going to be hard work for projects

1032
00:38:30,839 --> 00:38:33,180
more than anything else more than any

1033
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:36,420
other group projects have at the worst

1034
00:38:36,420 --> 00:38:39,000
security can't wait until the end you

1035
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,859
know they need to hire some dedicated

1036
00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:42,960
security staff you can't count on

1037
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,579
security companies to solve all these

1038
00:38:44,579 --> 00:38:47,579
problems beg borrow steal hire somebody

1039
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:49,260
out of college

1040
00:38:49,260 --> 00:38:52,020
you know you've got nothing today right

1041
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:54,900
somebody who has passion and who's

1042
00:38:54,900 --> 00:38:56,940
willing to learn and who you're willing

1043
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:59,220
to sit with I think it's a great area

1044
00:38:59,220 --> 00:39:00,720
for people because you start to learn

1045
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,339
about application security you start to

1046
00:39:02,339 --> 00:39:03,780
learn about deployments you start to

1047
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:06,240
learn about all these things

1048
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,040
we need to have them learn from

1049
00:39:08,040 --> 00:39:11,339
devsecops you know there are ways to

1050
00:39:11,339 --> 00:39:14,579
scan code you know as you you know as

1051
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:17,460
you check it into your Repository

1052
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:19,079
threat modeling is probably the number

1053
00:39:19,079 --> 00:39:21,000
one thing that they need to do

1054
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:22,440
you can't design a protocol without

1055
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,780
threat modeling it and yet many projects

1056
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:26,940
do

1057
00:39:26,940 --> 00:39:28,920
static analysis is also something you

1058
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:30,300
can do not all of these projects are

1059
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:32,579
written in ethereum so um some of it's

1060
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:35,280
rust we have rust tools you can use

1061
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,020
things like semcraft at kadowski

1062
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:39,140
security we have a sem grep rule set

1063
00:39:39,140 --> 00:39:41,760
specifically for Solana that we can run

1064
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:44,700
on on these tools and these are these

1065
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:46,619
are things that can be developed either

1066
00:39:46,619 --> 00:39:49,920
by the security Community by the you

1067
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,079
know project communities

1068
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,119
and of course you know practice

1069
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:57,000
defensive coding

1070
00:39:57,000 --> 00:40:00,000
these protections built in to the

1071
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,820
project don't allow everybody to drain

1072
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:05,460
your wall or drain your wallet all your

1073
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,980
funds don't allow projects to be able to

1074
00:40:07,980 --> 00:40:10,079
do things very quickly if that's not

1075
00:40:10,079 --> 00:40:12,780
part of the use case

1076
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:15,420
for projects also have a QA process to

1077
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,040
make sure those equality operators are

1078
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,800
in the right spot things like functional

1079
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:22,079
testing you know that things that you

1080
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:24,960
can use and run at runtime

1081
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:27,599
or before deployment I should say

1082
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:29,880
another interesting thing is tagging

1083
00:40:29,880 --> 00:40:32,460
sensitive areas of code so that if a

1084
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:35,040
change happens in that area you know to

1085
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,320
give it way more scrutiny

1086
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:39,599
so that's something that can be done and

1087
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:42,060
managed through the source code and of

1088
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,740
course build a monitoring strategy with

1089
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:46,320
some sort of approach you know don't uh

1090
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,540
don't just cry

1091
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,099
um because that's not a great strategy

1092
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:51,780
so

1093
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,960
I have some extra information here that

1094
00:40:54,960 --> 00:40:57,180
will be available in the uh but be

1095
00:40:57,180 --> 00:40:58,859
available in the slide deck and I'm

1096
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:00,660
sorry for shotgunning like a ton of

1097
00:41:00,660 --> 00:41:02,880
information at you because I'm sure

1098
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:05,099
that's what it felt like it was way too

1099
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:08,339
much for 40 minutes I wish I had

1100
00:41:08,339 --> 00:41:10,980
um three more hours and a bunch of

1101
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:13,920
discussions that would be great but I am

1102
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:16,200
around if you have any questions and

1103
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:19,110
thank you for joining me today
