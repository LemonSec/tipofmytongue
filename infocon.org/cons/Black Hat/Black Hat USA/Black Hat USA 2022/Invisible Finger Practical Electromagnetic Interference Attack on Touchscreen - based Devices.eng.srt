[Music]

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,740
now it is my pleasure to Welcome to the

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,040
stage hashishan

4
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:21,000
all right thank you so much Ray for the

5
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,760
kind introduction so today uh we will

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,619
I'll be representing my colleagues which

7
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:27,359
is from the University of Florida and

8
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:29,340
University of New Hampshire to introduce

9
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:31,500
our recent research work invisible

10
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:33,540
finger a practical electromagnetic

11
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:35,820
mechanical interference attack on touch

12
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:39,059
screen based electronic devices so my

13
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:41,640
name is hodgison and my I actually

14
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,800
currently a PhD candidate in at

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,480
University of Florida

16
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,420
so today we will be going through a lot

17
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:49,980
of things and we want to give you a

18
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,360
little bit agenda and a little bit heads

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:53,100
up on what's going on and what we'll be

20
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:55,500
talking about okay so we will talk about

21
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,440
who we are apparently and we also give a

22
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:00,840
short you know by concrete trdr if you

23
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:02,820
too long you didn't read and just in

24
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:04,440
case that you want to know what we can

25
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:07,140
do and uh What is the characteristic of

26
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:09,780
our attack and just decide whether this

27
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,640
is interesting or fun enough that you

28
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,979
want to listen to and uh

29
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:15,720
considering that we think most of the

30
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:17,159
audience won't really have a background

31
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:19,439
knowledge on how touchscreen works and

32
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,799
how fundamentally our attack will be

33
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:24,600
functional so we will be spending quite

34
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,580
some time on introducing how touchscreen

35
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:29,040
is going to work and we also propose a

36
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:30,780
theoretical attack on touchscreen device

37
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,140
and from that once we have all this kind

38
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,400
of background knowledge we'll be

39
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,560
introducing how do we generate a precise

40
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,079
touch event using I am a signal from a

41
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,960
distance and we will also introduce from

42
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:45,720
how do we bridge the gap between precise

43
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:48,180
touch event generation and the Practical

44
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,159
touch event attacks and at the end of

45
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,780
the presentation we will have a q a

46
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:53,280
session where you can ask other

47
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,560
questions about it okay cool

48
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,759
so

49
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:59,640
who we are and we are actually a

50
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,619
research team which our name is a

51
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:03,299
security in Silicon lab from University

52
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,759
of Florida and we focus a lot on

53
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,140
security research so if you are looking

54
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:09,060
at it into our recent Publications we

55
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,459
focus on architecture security and the

56
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,379
side channel security IP core security

57
00:02:13,379 --> 00:02:16,200
AI secure iot security CPS Security

58
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:17,940
basically every kind of like a security

59
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:20,099
aspect that you want to cover uh you

60
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:21,720
know like we kind of do that and we're a

61
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,580
pretty much big lab and we have

62
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,220
published some works on SMP and DSs

63
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:28,860
triple AI this type of top tier academic

64
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:31,980
conference and a small advertisement

65
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:34,080
time for us we are still actively hiring

66
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:36,060
PhD students which works on cyber

67
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:38,280
security research so again if you are

68
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:40,200
interested feel free to shoot me a

69
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:42,120
message to send us an email and you know

70
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,860
we will talk about that off the line

71
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,560
okay and I will leave my emails and my

72
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,480
advisor email at the end of the slide so

73
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,980
if you're interested and you think okay

74
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,959
maybe this is my area and I want to

75
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:53,760
spend time on this just feel free to

76
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,160
send us an email or uh you know shoot us

77
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,739
a message so okay so enough uh without

78
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:00,540
further Ado we want to talk about what

79
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,760
is our attack we call our we named our

80
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:04,980
attack invisible finger but what it

81
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,140
actually is invisible finger

82
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:09,180
so in short you know in one sentence

83
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:11,760
this is the remote precise precise touch

84
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,040
event injection attack against a

85
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,440
capacitive touch screen using iemi

86
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:19,680
signal so if you want to you know learn

87
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,360
something about some characteristic

88
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,239
about our attack so beyond those the

89
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:27,420
sentence I just described our attack has

90
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:29,700
affected distance attack distance around

91
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,060
three or four centimeters and we our

92
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:35,580
attack can induce short tab long press

93
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,800
and the omnidirectional swipe gesture

94
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,379
onto a capacitive touch screen and we

95
00:03:40,379 --> 00:03:42,480
also our attack also works on different

96
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,239
types of screen devices regardless the

97
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:47,640
scanning or driving methods that have

98
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,019
been applied on the touchscreen

99
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:52,379
controller and also our attack the first

100
00:03:52,379 --> 00:03:54,780
practical attack with other side screen

101
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:57,720
locator and touch event director event

102
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:00,659
direct detector so if you want to find

103
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:02,879
something find some kind of remote touch

104
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,920
event injection attack that'll be us

105
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,780
that's actually the first thing that we

106
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:09,299
do and we also list every detail our

107
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:11,819
attack and also our published paper and

108
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:13,920
all the video demonstrations online so

109
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,540
if you are interested you can check out

110
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:17,940
our website which is the invisiblefinger

111
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:19,858
dot click online after this presentation

112
00:04:19,858 --> 00:04:21,418
and you will find every detail of

113
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:23,220
everything and then because there's

114
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,440
something we cannot recover today

115
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,160
okay so comparing with traditional cyber

116
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,780
security research right such as like

117
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:33,419
Android or iOS or some other like

118
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:35,340
software type of security research that

119
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:37,860
touchscreen security especially for

120
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,320
injection attack is on touch screen is

121
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,020
still relatively still new a type of

122
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:45,060
attack and even for the professional

123
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:47,280
like secure researchers is still kind of

124
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,020
a new area right so if you search this

125
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,660
type attack online so I guess you

126
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,880
probably can find one or two just a few

127
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:56,220
published papers online you know on top

128
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,320
tier cyber security conference like such

129
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,900
as SMP or use Nix this kind of thing and

130
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:02,340
that's why today we'll be spending some

131
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,320
time on introducing the background of

132
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,259
the touch screen so once you get the

133
00:05:07,259 --> 00:05:08,880
knowledge of this once you go through

134
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,380
all the details that we provided it

135
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:11,820
should be able to just reproduce that

136
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,460
whatever we are doing right now and and

137
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:16,800
apparently you will also find out why we

138
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,840
think touchscreen attack right now is

139
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:20,280
still kind of at a low hanging fruit

140
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:22,139
stage so which means once you understand

141
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:24,479
everything maybe you'll be able to come

142
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:27,120
up with a more powerful or much cooler

143
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,220
attack compared with ours

144
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:32,400
okay so again like touch screen everyone

145
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,080
use that or you're holding on a cell

146
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,400
phone and does that touch screen is

147
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:37,139
basically one where you give the command

148
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:39,600
to your screen and to your device and

149
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:41,160
you want to manipulate the content of

150
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:43,380
your device touchscreen will be your way

151
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:45,000
and right now you can see like the

152
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,380
touchscreen is pretty much involved in

153
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:48,419
everyone's everyone's daily life right

154
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:50,639
so among all the touch screens that has

155
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,740
been used on our smart device such as

156
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,840
tablets or just like a laptop so

157
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,780
capacity capacitive touch screen is

158
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:00,060
actually the most popular type that has

159
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:03,600
been used so the report a report in 2022

160
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,320
kind of just show roughly 46 of the

161
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,060
touchscreen that has been used right now

162
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:11,580
is capacitive touch screen and in your

163
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,380
work that's why we are choosing the

164
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:15,300
capacity touchscreen as our main target

165
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:17,400
because it's going to have more impact

166
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,500
once we realize all these type different

167
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:21,240
type of attack right

168
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,000
so meanwhile let's take a look at what

169
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,860
is advantage of the touchscreen and

170
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:27,660
capacitive touch screen and what is the

171
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,819
reason that it's being used by different

172
00:06:29,819 --> 00:06:32,880
vendors and what is the current research

173
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,340
state or status of the capacity touch

174
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:38,160
screen so capacitive touch screen really

175
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,840
there are certain advantages of them

176
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,120
right like so the touch event can be

177
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,220
done without with only your like a bare

178
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:46,080
finger you don't really need a pen to

179
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,780
operate that and I also support gesture

180
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,880
recognition and real-time feedback and

181
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,220
all sort of stuff and also for the

182
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,139
vendor side once the production is done

183
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:57,060
you the vendor only need to calibrate

184
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,620
the touchscreen or touch screen

185
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:00,539
controller once so you you don't like

186
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:03,120
the low cost and the wear resistance

187
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,220
just makes the capacitor touchscreen

188
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:07,319
it's kind of the right choice right now

189
00:07:07,319 --> 00:07:09,360
and what about the security research

190
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:12,120
right so it's a product and the secure

191
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:13,680
researchers like us we definitely want

192
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,720
to want to find out what's wrong with it

193
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,580
what can be wrong with it

194
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,880
so in as for the security research we

195
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,199
actually divided them into two

196
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:24,240
categories like content stealing and 40

197
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,160
injection so content stealing which

198
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,199
means you're going to use some kind of

199
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:30,620
sensor em or wave this type of like

200
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:33,060
techniques you try to read the content

201
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:34,740
that has been displayed on touchscreen

202
00:07:34,740 --> 00:07:36,660
from the distance and as for the touch

203
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:39,240
event injection I would say we are kind

204
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,460
of like a one of the three papers that

205
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:42,599
have been published on top two

206
00:07:42,599 --> 00:07:44,220
conference uh you know doing this type

207
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:46,380
of attack and if you are trying to

208
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,120
search this online you will find a tap

209
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:50,759
on ghost which is published on SMP and

210
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:52,740
there's also another goes to touch paper

211
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,819
published on usinx this year so as for

212
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:58,620
the touch capacitive touch screens there

213
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,120
are two main categories the self

214
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:01,800
capacitance based and the mutual

215
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:03,539
capacity space

216
00:08:03,539 --> 00:08:05,759
so the South cap has some basic touch

217
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,979
screen since the changes the capacity

218
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:09,599
between your finger I'm sorry like

219
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:11,220
between the electrodes and the ground

220
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,440
introduced by the finger touch which on

221
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,479
the contrary for the mutual capacitant

222
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:17,099
based touch screen there is a mutual

223
00:08:17,099 --> 00:08:18,960
capacitance CM between the top and

224
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,000
bottom of the electrons so where when

225
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,800
your finger touches screen a mutual

226
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,199
capacitance change Delta c will be

227
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,780
generated and that's where the touch the

228
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:30,419
capacitance was measured and that's why

229
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:32,039
the touchscreen controller will

230
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:34,200
recognize that as a touch screen that's

231
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,620
a touch event so once we decide this is

232
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:39,599
the proper Target that we want to attack

233
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:41,458
now let's take a look at how

234
00:08:41,458 --> 00:08:43,260
fundamentally a mutual capacitance

235
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,300
touchscreen works as we just mentioned

236
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,760
the mutual capacitance touchscreen often

237
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,860
consists with you know multiple pairs of

238
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,720
transmitting and receiving intellectuals

239
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:53,940
so you can just charge or discharge the

240
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,940
uh uh the the the distance between the

241
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:59,040
uh between the electrodes and beyond

242
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,260
that you also have in some kind of like

243
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:04,680
a excitation signal generator QT sensor

244
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,300
which is short for like a charge

245
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,640
transfer sensor and ADC which is sure

246
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,800
for analog to digital converter and a

247
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,240
microprocessor you should notice that

248
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,880
the micro processor isn't really the CPU

249
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:17,160
we talked about that on the our on our

250
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,839
cell phone it's actually something like

251
00:09:18,839 --> 00:09:21,060
a dedicated design to operate and

252
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:24,120
measure the touches from the touchscreen

253
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:26,820
so what a human finger is presented on

254
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:28,620
the touchscreen it actually Alters the

255
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:30,600
current capacitance of touchscreen and

256
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:32,160
this change can be either positive or

257
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,480
negative it really depends on human

258
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:35,399
impedance variation now we can see

259
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:38,040
fundamentally all since that the

260
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,540
capaciting touchscreen does it just

261
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,640
measure the capacitance and then

262
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,560
determine whether it's a finger touch if

263
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:44,880
the finger touch the capacitance is

264
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,680
going to be changed right so but

265
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,779
internally how this mechanism Works

266
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:51,180
housing capacitance is measured so as we

267
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,240
just said that to develop an effective

268
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,980
touch screen attack it's really better

269
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:58,320
to understand you know how a mutual

270
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:01,019
capacitance change is sensed in this

271
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:02,339
page I will talk a little bit slow

272
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:03,720
because you know there's a lot of

273
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:06,000
theoretical stuff getting involved and

274
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,100
just feel free to interrupt them you

275
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:09,360
know Give Me A Sign you think I'm

276
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:11,279
talking too fast or like if you want to

277
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,200
you know like hear a little bit more

278
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,540
clearly on this part okay

279
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:18,180
so this page will show how the mutual

280
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:20,640
capacity and change Delta C itself it

281
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:25,320
sends at T time so the switch S1 and S3

282
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,720
is going to be closed so the internal

283
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,180
voltage source VI is going to fully

284
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:33,060
charge cm and the Cs is going to be

285
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:36,600
fully discharged so the voltage of cm is

286
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:39,060
charged to VI and the voltage on CS is

287
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,399
going to be at zero as a result you can

288
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,740
see that the output voltage of VO is

289
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:46,620
zero as shown in this figure so

290
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:51,060
now at T1 moment the S3 is open and the

291
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:53,339
voltage on the Cs is still going to be 0

292
00:10:53,339 --> 00:10:56,100
and the vo is still going to be zero and

293
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:59,459
at T2 moment the S1 is going to open and

294
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:02,579
v i n is disconnected from the CM and

295
00:11:02,579 --> 00:11:05,040
the voltage on the CM holds on the on

296
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,740
the VIN and the total electric charge

297
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,620
stored in cm is basically equivalent to

298
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,120
CM times Vin

299
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:19,320
and a T3 moment the S2 is closed and the

300
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:23,040
charge CM times bin is stored in cm is

301
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,459
going to fully chart transfer to Cs and

302
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:28,140
this is why the reason this is the

303
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,760
reason why we call this a charge

304
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,640
transfer topology as a result the output

305
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,920
voltage vo is given by the equation that

306
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,740
is above which is list over here and

307
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,560
this is the way that capacitance is

308
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,140
measured by turning the capacitance into

309
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,820
the voltage which is made which is

310
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,100
measurable by a simple ADC right so if

311
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:49,980
the vo is smaller than certain threshold

312
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:52,620
voltage like I said vth then there will

313
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:54,420
be no touch event happens because

314
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:56,579
basically this is how you measure the

315
00:11:56,579 --> 00:11:58,920
capacitance right if the capacitance is

316
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,660
small enough which means there's no

317
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:03,420
touch event at tt4

318
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:06,240
the S2 is open the circuit is ready for

319
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,760
the Nexus sensing cycle so if they're

320
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,040
the finger touch you know introducing a

321
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:14,160
mutual capacitance Delta c as we can see

322
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,320
the total electric charge stored in

323
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:19,440
store on CMM plus Delta C is going to

324
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,380
mode it's going to time bin so this is

325
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:24,240
the this will be the final result right

326
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,120
so in the output voltage vo has a Delta

327
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:29,579
vo changes as shown in the figure the

328
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:32,040
given by the equation involved and if

329
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,160
the magnitude of the vo plus Delta vo is

330
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,079
higher than the threshold which means

331
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:39,300
the capacitance change beyond the

332
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:41,339
threshold and the touchscreen controller

333
00:12:41,339 --> 00:12:43,320
will recognize as at a finger touch

334
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,000
because as we mentioned before the

335
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,160
fundamental percentage if there is a

336
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,660
capacitive change there will be a touchy

337
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,700
band it's just going to be how large is

338
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,680
the capacitive change will be

339
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:54,660
right so

340
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,700
that's a little bit too Theory right

341
00:12:56,700 --> 00:12:58,019
like a lot of people if you don't really

342
00:12:58,019 --> 00:12:59,459
have a background knowledge on this you

343
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:01,139
might be won't be able to understand

344
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:02,940
that so we kind of made a little bit

345
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:04,800
animation over here you know just try to

346
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,660
uh kind of like tell what's going on

347
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:09,899
with it so as you can see the purple one

348
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:12,839
is going to be the value of the ADC

349
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:14,339
which is going to measure as you can see

350
00:13:14,339 --> 00:13:16,380
with the current capacitance we have the

351
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:19,680
value of around like a one uh vote and

352
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,560
once we have once we change the

353
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,120
capacitance over here this is another

354
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,980
one once we change the capacity here

355
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,060
just

356
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,220
pay attention to how the what is the

357
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:31,740
read of the ADC right now and once we

358
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,720
operate all this so and finish all the

359
00:13:33,720 --> 00:13:36,540
patterns and just and the sequence now

360
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,339
we're gonna have a different value so as

361
00:13:38,339 --> 00:13:40,920
you can see because of the capacity is

362
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,600
changing and then the voltage will

363
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,120
change as well and that's actually

364
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,079
fundamentally how most of the

365
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,000
touchscreen works and and well they're

366
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,500
probably going to have a little bit you

367
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,480
know complicated circuits to eliminate

368
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:53,700
noise or have fancy algorithm but

369
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,380
fundamentally that's actually gonna it's

370
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,019
gonna work right so now we have a basic

371
00:13:58,019 --> 00:13:59,519
understanding of touchscreen works you

372
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,079
know just try to read the capacitance

373
00:14:01,079 --> 00:14:03,180
and turn that into a voltage read and

374
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:05,220
then if the voltage rate is changing big

375
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:07,260
enough I think or the touchscreen

376
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:08,820
consider gonna think this is going to be

377
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,260
a touch event

378
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,680
so let's talk about how theoretically we

379
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,779
can introduce a touch event after we

380
00:14:15,779 --> 00:14:17,339
understand the working principle of the

381
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:19,380
touch touch screen attack mechanism can

382
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:22,320
be proposed over here by applying an

383
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,079
external e field or electric field e to

384
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:27,240
the touchscreen the vertical component

385
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:30,600
will introduce a voltage Delta VM across

386
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,579
two electrodes So based on the

387
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:34,860
superposition Theory the voltage will be

388
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,500
added to original VM

389
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,779
so the introduced the voltage

390
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:42,060
equivalently increases the increase like

391
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,100
electric charge is stored in the CM so

392
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:46,440
as a result the output voltage has a

393
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:49,320
Delta VOE changes so if it's big enough

394
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,480
the circuit will recognize this kind of

395
00:14:51,480 --> 00:14:55,139
external e field e as a touch event and

396
00:14:55,139 --> 00:14:56,880
that's all we want right so we want to

397
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,920
operate the touch band without actually

398
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,899
you know physically touching the touch

399
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:04,800
screen just using some kind of em signal

400
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,320
so in theory that should works right so

401
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:09,600
but we don't know yet so that's why we

402
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:11,100
want to see if the scenery actually

403
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:13,680
works so this page we should this slide

404
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:16,079
will show the how this the simulation of

405
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,000
applying electric field which is the E

406
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,920
field to the sunscreen by any of voltage

407
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,779
into a copper plate above the touch

408
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:23,820
screen so it actually field can be

409
00:15:23,820 --> 00:15:25,560
generated by using antenna is it going

410
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:28,139
to be like a finger sized fingertip

411
00:15:28,139 --> 00:15:29,880
sized copper plates or just a simple

412
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,699
needle and based on the simulation we

413
00:15:32,699 --> 00:15:35,220
set up a experimental environment which

414
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,620
allows us to generate a field with a

415
00:15:37,620 --> 00:15:39,959
signal generator RF amplifier some kind

416
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:41,940
of a corporate place as you can see that

417
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:44,160
right now using the copper plate once we

418
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,500
remove the copper plate we can generate

419
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:48,779
a bunch of touch event along the

420
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:50,820
directions vertical horizontal no

421
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:53,220
problem right but as you can see over

422
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:55,920
here the generated touch event are more

423
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:57,839
or less like a little bit random we want

424
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,519
if we actually want to use this in

425
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,019
Practical attack we want to be precise

426
00:16:01,019 --> 00:16:03,060
right we want to take fully control

427
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:05,579
where and when the touchdown is going to

428
00:16:05,579 --> 00:16:08,339
generate and that's where we that's why

429
00:16:08,339 --> 00:16:09,540
we are going to need some kind of

430
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:12,180
theoretical analysis at this point

431
00:16:12,180 --> 00:16:15,899
so in order to generate a successful uh

432
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:18,240
touch event or successful attack we are

433
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,800
going to need certain conditions on this

434
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,660
so there are several conditions for

435
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:23,220
successful attack first one will be

436
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,459
minimum e field strength ECM so if the

437
00:16:26,459 --> 00:16:28,800
field is not strong enough of course you

438
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,120
are not going to be able to generate any

439
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,519
kind of touch event right so

440
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:35,940
um so we listed the filter strengths em

441
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:38,519
given by equation over here where the D

442
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:40,199
is going to be distance between two

443
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:42,480
electrons or AF is going to be

444
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,519
equivalent area of the false touch so

445
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:47,399
which means using our using our equation

446
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:48,959
over here which by the way all the

447
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:50,940
equations are derived by us so if you're

448
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,380
going to find online they're not going

449
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,180
to be some kind of equation sitting over

450
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,800
there but you can you know use the

451
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,480
equation list in our slides on your

452
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,120
paper to reproduce our attack

453
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:03,180
so if the E field is not strong enough

454
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,439
you won't be able to generate anything

455
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:06,900
but what is the minimum if you list of

456
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,760
strength that's going to be need you can

457
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,040
simply use our equation to calculate the

458
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,459
correct value of it and what else so

459
00:17:14,459 --> 00:17:16,380
another condition would be the frequency

460
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:19,140
of the Fe for the applied AC electric

461
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:21,359
field so now we have found that the time

462
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,579
duration TS of the closing time switch

463
00:17:23,579 --> 00:17:26,099
so if the TS is going to be total number

464
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:27,900
of the period of the applied e field

465
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:29,700
which means it's not going to generate

466
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:32,280
anything at this moment because the sum

467
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,200
the summary the summary of this is going

468
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:35,940
to be zero right

469
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,520
so which means now we know if we want to

470
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,740
introduce a certain touch event this is

471
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:42,240
going to be a frequency that you don't

472
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:44,160
want to do at all because regardless of

473
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,080
the strength the minimum the if you feel

474
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,580
the strength is not going to generate

475
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,580
any type of touch event and on the other

476
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,640
hand on other frequency Fe Max a very

477
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:55,740
small e field strengths will achieve a

478
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,179
false touch so this is the frequency

479
00:17:57,179 --> 00:18:00,179
that we want to know using the uh using

480
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:02,400
the equation should uh list over here we

481
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,140
should be able to introduce a touch

482
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:07,080
event with least field strengths which

483
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,880
is means like our attack is going to be

484
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,679
more feasible right so we want to

485
00:18:10,679 --> 00:18:12,360
evaluate all those type of series they

486
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:14,640
want to derive the now we have derived

487
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,320
all the equations that we need to like

488
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,120
right but we need to validate whether

489
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,280
this type of model or equation is

490
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,780
actually true so we designed a series

491
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:24,120
validation experiment you know just use

492
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,640
our previous setup and then use all the

493
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,380
combinations of the word frequency what

494
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:30,539
if your strengths or what under word

495
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:32,820
condition the touch screen will

496
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:35,039
recognize a touch so and over here you

497
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,220
can see that the measured Fe Max and Fe

498
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,559
mean actually matches what we calculated

499
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,960
like a certain type of frequency when we

500
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:44,340
won't be able to generate anything like

501
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,260
regardless if your strength certain

502
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:48,900
frequency that we can easily generate

503
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,419
first first goes a touch event so which

504
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:53,520
kind of like proved that our previous

505
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,280
theoretical analysis is actually true

506
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:58,559
in addition the final condition of the

507
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,240
time is actually the time duration of

508
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,039
the attack since the touchscreen

509
00:19:02,039 --> 00:19:03,780
controller also having a calibration

510
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:05,760
function which means it's going to read

511
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,860
the environmental noise and try to make

512
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,380
sure like you are not really having too

513
00:19:10,380 --> 00:19:12,539
much strong environmental noise if there

514
00:19:12,539 --> 00:19:14,640
is it's going to dynamically adjust the

515
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:16,799
threshold which means if you are going

516
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,620
to apply this type of IMI signal on your

517
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:21,780
target really long enough that you won't

518
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,820
be able to see anything because the

519
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,980
threshold or like it's going to be

520
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,900
really easy to generate attachment even

521
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,480
though there is no e field because like

522
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,340
the threshold is dynamically changed

523
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:33,240
right

524
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,580
so this page will show that the measured

525
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,919
minimum e field for a goes to touch as a

526
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:40,320
function of the duration of IMS signal a

527
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,720
continuous e field attack will cause a

528
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,820
touch screen to enter ghost mode at this

529
00:19:44,820 --> 00:19:46,740
moment because you know which means the

530
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:49,039
ghost attack will happen even when your

531
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,679
external view if you is is removed so

532
00:19:52,679 --> 00:19:54,360
which means if you want to have a

533
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,220
successful attack you should avoid to

534
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,860
apply this type of attack IAM signal on

535
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,480
this long enough

536
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,460
so now combine all these type of

537
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:04,679
techniques okay sir let's to take a look

538
00:20:04,679 --> 00:20:06,419
at what we can do using the calculated

539
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:08,640
IM signal right so we want to open

540
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,580
applications with this we have the

541
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,340
signal pre-install our computer or our

542
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:16,260
cell phone and then we place this type

543
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:19,020
of thing on the East E field strengths

544
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,200
uh on our antenna and then we try to

545
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:25,020
align that with our Target and then once

546
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:27,179
we have the IEM signal turned on we

547
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:29,039
should be able to just see that the

548
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:32,340
application is open and also

549
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:34,140
we want to open a website with this

550
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,600
right so we have the shortcut of the uh

551
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:39,960
Chrome browser on the uh on the desktop

552
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:42,120
and now we have the IEM it turns on we

553
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:43,980
now enter the University of Florida

554
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,140
website so that's definitely you can do

555
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:47,580
but you may also notice there are

556
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,679
certain creature of that which means the

557
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:53,299
uh the touch events are not precise

558
00:20:53,299 --> 00:20:56,280
not as precise as we want so there is

559
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,320
still something we want to do right

560
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:01,080
so now we have all the theoretical

561
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,820
analysis right we know how to calculate

562
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,620
what is the frequency what is the E

563
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:06,240
field and what is the phase or whatever

564
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:09,059
you know in order to actually introduce

565
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:11,000
a precise touch event

566
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,460
introduce a touch event but as you also

567
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:16,440
see in the previous demo this is not

568
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:19,020
precise enough and also we kind of just

569
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:21,120
put the cell phone on the table and we

570
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,740
know how where to attack so this is not

571
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:24,360
a prac This is Not Practical right this

572
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,799
is not feasible we're still missing

573
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:28,440
something so here actually lies our

574
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,000
contribution one of our major

575
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,559
contributions compared with a previous

576
00:21:31,559 --> 00:21:33,120
approach that

577
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:36,840
was published on SMP and use Nixa so one

578
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:38,700
of our contribution is actually

579
00:21:38,700 --> 00:21:41,280
generating the precise touch event and

580
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,620
conductors or experiments

581
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,080
so if you want to generate precise touch

582
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,059
event what would be the challenge I mean

583
00:21:48,059 --> 00:21:49,740
like if you're not already familiar with

584
00:21:49,740 --> 00:21:51,780
this type of like attack so the

585
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,880
challenge is actually going to be the

586
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:55,919
challenge comes from the scanning or

587
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:57,480
driving method from different touch

588
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:59,039
screen control of course like we were

589
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:01,020
saying all the stuff we introduced to

590
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:02,520
before is more or less like a simplified

591
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,740
version of the touchscreen design right

592
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,440
so in real world of course the vendor

593
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,980
such as apple or Chrome or uh sorry like

594
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:13,679
apple or LG or Samsung they're going to

595
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,059
have different design of their

596
00:22:15,059 --> 00:22:17,520
touchscreen controller so they're going

597
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,860
to use different method to make sure the

598
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:21,780
touchscreen event is going to be

599
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:24,419
detected as precise as possible as

600
00:22:24,419 --> 00:22:26,820
sensitive as possible but we cannot we

601
00:22:26,820 --> 00:22:28,559
can already know that ahead

602
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:31,200
so in general there are two type of

603
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:33,720
methods of Performing the time scanning

604
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:36,780
on electric electrodes gray so either

605
00:22:36,780 --> 00:22:38,700
going to be sequential or user going to

606
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:40,980
be parallel so the sequential scanning

607
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:43,799
is going to be excites X or Y it

608
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:45,840
electrons one by one and then you're

609
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,880
gonna search the you're gonna sense the

610
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,700
each line on Y and X on electrodes

611
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:52,320
irrespectively

612
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,360
so what about the sequential I'm sorry

613
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,280
what about the parallel scanning so

614
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,260
whereas a parallel scanning is trying to

615
00:22:58,260 --> 00:23:01,320
encode the excitation signal and drives

616
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:03,960
X or Y electrodes at the same time and

617
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,640
it sends the capacitance change over

618
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:07,919
here so you may want actually going to

619
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,500
wonder why this is important

620
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:12,600
so on these slides as we can see over

621
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:15,179
here so like the driving signal actually

622
00:23:15,179 --> 00:23:17,340
looks on on iPhone we actually measure

623
00:23:17,340 --> 00:23:19,320
this actually our uh you know device

624
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:22,500
from iPhone 11 Pro and pixel 2 with

625
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,179
respect to different driving scan

626
00:23:24,179 --> 00:23:25,919
driving scanning so on the left side you

627
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:28,020
can see there's a parlo driving uh

628
00:23:28,020 --> 00:23:29,580
scanning and on the right side you can

629
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:31,440
see there are the scanner driving method

630
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,440
and when you are seeing the excitation

631
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:35,940
signal looks like that looks like

632
00:23:35,940 --> 00:23:37,740
totally different right so like on the

633
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:40,260
left side you have like an encoded

634
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:41,640
something like encoded right but it

635
00:23:41,640 --> 00:23:43,260
happens at the same time on the right

636
00:23:43,260 --> 00:23:45,000
side if you measure that at different

637
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:47,400
place you can see that all the different

638
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:50,940
place on the screen the shape and the

639
00:23:50,940 --> 00:23:53,280
um and the pattern of the sensing signal

640
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,960
is going to be it's going to be the same

641
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,400
all the things different is going to be

642
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,960
the timing so that's why it's actually

643
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:01,500
called timing sensing uh method

644
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:04,919
so that's why is this important because

645
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:07,740
the previous approach that was published

646
00:24:07,740 --> 00:24:09,360
on you know those top tier conferences

647
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,580
paper generally only works well on

648
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:13,080
sequence sequential driving type

649
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,760
touchscreen because the pattern is

650
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:16,200
really simple right you can either you

651
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,720
can literally see that and uh the

652
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,520
attacker can try to measure the driving

653
00:24:20,520 --> 00:24:22,980
signal and choose a correct timing to

654
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,140
inject the iemi signal just like this

655
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:27,840
right so I measure this and I know this

656
00:24:27,840 --> 00:24:29,940
line has been sensed I'm gonna apply

657
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:32,100
items as it's a precise moment and then

658
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:33,960
there will be attachment was you know

659
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:36,539
going to be sensed so our attack of

660
00:24:36,539 --> 00:24:38,280
course is going to work on sequential

661
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:39,720
but what about the parallel because

662
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,700
parallel is going to be encoded right so

663
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:43,440
our work is totally different we don't

664
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:45,059
require particular driving mechanism

665
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:47,340
instead of we use antenna design where

666
00:24:47,340 --> 00:24:49,799
you can generate focused uh Focus if you

667
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:51,480
apply the interference on a very

668
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,820
specific region on the touchscreen so we

669
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,760
apply appropriate Emi signal and we wait

670
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:58,620
for this place to be sensed just like

671
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:00,179
your finger works that's actually the

672
00:25:00,179 --> 00:25:02,280
reason we pick the name invisible finger

673
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,260
it's actually mimicking the way that

674
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,240
your finger works by using appropriate

675
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,179
Emi signal a proper antenna design

676
00:25:09,179 --> 00:25:12,059
right so another advantage that brought

677
00:25:12,059 --> 00:25:13,559
up our Tech is that we don't really need

678
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:15,419
to analyze how the driving signal on

679
00:25:15,419 --> 00:25:17,159
different touchscreen controller looks

680
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:18,600
like and what is the correct the timing

681
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,220
to do that because when you look at this

682
00:25:20,220 --> 00:25:21,720
this literally we measured from

683
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,520
different device and all the driving

684
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,320
signal looks totally different let's say

685
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:27,480
I want to attack a new device right so

686
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:29,279
if you want to do the sequential then

687
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:30,720
that's all you can do right you can

688
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,640
that's all you can do you need to

689
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:34,559
analyze this type of sensing signal one

690
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:37,080
by one and now we are going we want to

691
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,880
generate a field on specific region

692
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,799
right so in order to do this and we need

693
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,840
to make sure our general e field is

694
00:25:42,840 --> 00:25:45,240
really focused in your narrow and uh

695
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,220
position so a good design of the antenna

696
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,380
is really important in our case we use

697
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,640
two different type of antenna

698
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:52,679
spring-loaded copper needle and copper

699
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:54,779
plates they all have different pros and

700
00:25:54,779 --> 00:25:57,419
cons for example a copper needle is

701
00:25:57,419 --> 00:25:59,700
going to be like a have very Focus if

702
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,860
you're on the tip of it and then copper

703
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:03,960
plates which means you are going to have

704
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,419
a little bit more uh strong environment

705
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:08,880
e field because it's going to one of the

706
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,059
place is going to connect to the set

707
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:13,860
Source signal Source another one is

708
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:15,360
going to connect to the ground which is

709
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:16,799
going to make the E field A Little Bit

710
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:19,140
Stronger comparing with the copper

711
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:20,820
needle part copper needle antenna design

712
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:22,260
and

713
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:25,020
now we have two type of antenna design

714
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,640
right so both of them can generate the

715
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,380
focus a field but there's still

716
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,000
something affecting our attack one of

717
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,460
them is actually table material so for

718
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:35,100
the common materials for example mfmdf

719
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:37,799
solid wood acrylic marble or copper we

720
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:40,080
measure them one by one and we see what

721
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:41,159
is the difference between a table

722
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:42,659
material because we still want to make

723
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:43,980
this practical right so the only

724
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,279
difference is that the materials

725
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:48,299
dielectric constants are going to be

726
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:49,860
different but when you actually look at

727
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:52,140
the table or over here we will see that

728
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:54,000
as long as your table material is

729
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,919
non-metal you should be fine right so

730
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:58,620
acrylic or marble or you know like a

731
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,360
solid wood doesn't really change a lot

732
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,400
of our success rates and what about the

733
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:05,100
type of seeing things so we tried this

734
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,140
type of attack from distance from 10

735
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:09,419
millimeters from 50 millimeters from 20

736
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:11,940
millimeters and we try our attacker for

737
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,159
30 times and we keep track of how many

738
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:16,500
times we actually successfully uh

739
00:27:16,500 --> 00:27:19,679
generate touch event and in our case uh

740
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,740
as long as the touch event as the type

741
00:27:22,740 --> 00:27:24,659
of section is under 20 millimeters at

742
00:27:24,659 --> 00:27:26,159
this point using our antenna design

743
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:28,679
current antenna design we should be good

744
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:30,600
and that's for the real table top

745
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,760
sequence normally it's just the less

746
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,440
than one inch so like we should be good

747
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:37,260
at this moment so let's take a look at

748
00:27:37,260 --> 00:27:39,659
one have two centimeters Capital top

749
00:27:39,659 --> 00:27:41,520
thickness what we can do over here now

750
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,380
we are maneuvering the antenna we are

751
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:45,240
constantly applying IM signal so

752
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,799
basically as over here as you can see

753
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:49,679
that wherever we move the antenna to we

754
00:27:49,679 --> 00:27:51,360
are capable of generating on touch event

755
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,120
right under the antenna so it's super

756
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,520
accurate right but we still also want to

757
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,799
see that whether it's repeatable right

758
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,679
whether it's stable so that's why we put

759
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,960
over it here and then just try to make

760
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,360
our IM signal is generated every one

761
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,520
second and we keep track of like what is

762
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:09,960
the coordinate of the generator touch

763
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,880
event and over here if you're gonna you

764
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,440
know zoom in a little bit you will see

765
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,059
that every touch event is actually

766
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:17,520
precisely again at every moment and

767
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:19,200
every one second we have a touch event

768
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,039
generator over here

769
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,380
so with all this stuff together we try

770
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:26,760
to do something a little bit complicated

771
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,220
right rather than we totaling the uh

772
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,200
antenna move around we want to do a

773
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:32,820
little bit more practical so that's why

774
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:35,460
we have antenna array like sitting you

775
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:37,559
know like right on top of the right on

776
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:39,240
top of the target device and we try to

777
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:41,520
unlock the iPad with our simple clicks

778
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,860
right now and as you can see right now

779
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:45,900
it's just slowly typing the you know

780
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,480
slowly typing the number and then try to

781
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,360
unlock the device at this moment and as

782
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,340
this also tells us like we don't really

783
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:56,760
include like limit our uh antenna number

784
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,620
into one we can definitely use multiple

785
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,840
antennas right now

786
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,480
so in order to utilize this type of

787
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,279
attack so what we do over here because

788
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:07,200
you cannot remove your antenna right we

789
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:08,700
assume that you don't have a robotic arm

790
00:29:08,700 --> 00:29:11,220
or whatever so that's why we designed

791
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,900
different antenna arrays so we have a

792
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:14,880
sparse antenna array which are used

793
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,799
which later on we will talk about which

794
00:29:16,799 --> 00:29:18,299
are used to detect where's the phone

795
00:29:18,299 --> 00:29:20,279
located at and we also have a dense

796
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:22,440
antenna array so as long as your

797
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:24,299
distance between different antennas

798
00:29:24,299 --> 00:29:27,059
unders is more than six millimeter you

799
00:29:27,059 --> 00:29:28,140
we don't really see any kind of

800
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:29,760
interference between different antennas

801
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,580
and we also have a modularized antenna

802
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:34,980
array design which means you are capable

803
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:37,320
of designing your own PCB and assemble

804
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:38,880
everything and programmingly control

805
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,760
your antenna array on or from a distance

806
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:44,580
so with all this stuff together we test

807
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,740
how our attack is going to be effective

808
00:29:46,740 --> 00:29:49,620
on our on our device so we tried this on

809
00:29:49,620 --> 00:29:54,240
iPad Pro on OnePlus 7 Pro on Google or

810
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,100
all sort of like a different vendors and

811
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,899
this is all is going to be uh this is

812
00:29:57,899 --> 00:29:59,820
actually already so our attack works on

813
00:29:59,820 --> 00:30:02,340
all of the different uh devices which

814
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:05,220
comparing why this is important because

815
00:30:05,220 --> 00:30:07,260
comparing the previous approach where

816
00:30:07,260 --> 00:30:09,480
the only did the experiments on certain

817
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:12,659
one or two brand of the device which we

818
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:14,640
should our work is more generic right

819
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,620
more Universal we don't care how your

820
00:30:16,620 --> 00:30:18,539
touch screen computer is designed we're

821
00:30:18,539 --> 00:30:20,580
just trying to act like the way that

822
00:30:20,580 --> 00:30:23,039
your finger is going to work

823
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,720
and also

824
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,580
as there's something that you want you

825
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:28,740
might also notice that we list there is

826
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:30,539
a functionality which will cause fiber

827
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:32,399
right here and for the iPad Pro and for

828
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,740
the eye Surface Pro 7 we are capable of

829
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:37,200
generating um Omni interaction of swipe

830
00:30:37,200 --> 00:30:39,899
gesture on the touchscreen and uh which

831
00:30:39,899 --> 00:30:42,240
means which this is the part where like

832
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:44,159
our previous approach never done this

833
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:46,559
before and in general our work our work

834
00:30:46,559 --> 00:30:49,320
works better on iOS device on than on

835
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:50,940
Android device and we think you know

836
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:53,159
whatever noise elimination algorithm

837
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:55,860
employ on iOS device uh touchscreen

838
00:30:55,860 --> 00:30:58,020
controller actually makes our you know

839
00:30:58,020 --> 00:30:59,580
attack a little bit more a little bit

840
00:30:59,580 --> 00:31:01,980
better so let's take a look at how our

841
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:05,580
Omni directional uh swipe or uh attack

842
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,460
works okay so now we have antenna

843
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,740
setting right on top of our device and

844
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:12,899
we can inject a short tab we can inject

845
00:31:12,899 --> 00:31:15,179
a long press and we can turn this long

846
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:17,159
press into drawing mode which over here

847
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:19,679
you can see even you know like there's a

848
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,779
Critic sitting between we are

849
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:24,360
capable of you know just holding the

850
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:27,000
antenna and maneuver it and you can just

851
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,679
draw any kind of thing as you wish and

852
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:30,720
also you can see the duration of this

853
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,100
type of thing is really long enough

854
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:34,500
right you can totally use this to unlock

855
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:37,440
a gesture-based lock on a graph or graph

856
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,559
log base log and uh so if you want to

857
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:42,480
utilize this swipe also because the

858
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,520
budget would already in a problem we

859
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,020
didn't redo this but we think you can

860
00:31:46,020 --> 00:31:47,700
definitely use sometimes like a linear

861
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:50,580
Gantry miles or like a robot arm to hold

862
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:53,940
maneuver the uh the uh the antenna to

863
00:31:53,940 --> 00:31:56,580
achieve this type of uh to achieve this

864
00:31:56,580 --> 00:31:59,159
type of attack so now we have the

865
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:00,840
precise touch event right so let's just

866
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:02,760
recap a little bit right so using our

867
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,100
Emi signal parameter and our antenna

868
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,840
design now we can just generate a short

869
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:08,520
Tab and long press on an interactional

870
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,779
swipe but there's still something

871
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:11,820
missing right everything we done is

872
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,559
under our control we know where the

873
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:15,659
phone is located we maneuver the antenna

874
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:17,940
to the place that we want to attack and

875
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,679
of course we can already do that in real

876
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,779
life and we cannot claim that with a

877
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:24,299
practical iama attack if we are only

878
00:32:24,299 --> 00:32:26,460
only you know stop right over here and

879
00:32:26,460 --> 00:32:28,500
there's still some gap between practical

880
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:30,000
attack like a precise touch event

881
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,919
generation and practical touchscreen

882
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:32,940
attack

883
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:35,039
so here comes our third major

884
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:36,960
contribution we present a complete

885
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,840
practical attack vectors so now we have

886
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,399
established all the surgical background

887
00:32:41,399 --> 00:32:43,380
knowledge and actual setup right so

888
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:45,360
we're still missing something we are

889
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,220
missing something where the attacking

890
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,740
device is going to sitting right on the

891
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:51,840
table and the phone is going to be

892
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:53,580
randomly located like when the victim

893
00:32:53,580 --> 00:32:55,500
walks into a comfort zone that place the

894
00:32:55,500 --> 00:32:57,480
cell phone on the table you don't know

895
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,159
where it's going to be pressed at right

896
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:01,740
so we need some kind of phone locator to

897
00:33:01,740 --> 00:33:03,960
tell us this type of information and for

898
00:33:03,960 --> 00:33:06,299
the attack scenario a simple click is

899
00:33:06,299 --> 00:33:07,620
definitely not enough because we're

900
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,720
gonna involve multiple touches at

901
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,760
multiple locations and even sometimes

902
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,679
we're going to need the swipe right so

903
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:15,899
but if the multiple touch event is going

904
00:33:15,899 --> 00:33:17,039
to happen we don't know whether the

905
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,779
previous touch is going to be successful

906
00:33:18,779 --> 00:33:21,299
or not so we need to have a way to tell

907
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:24,000
us whether touch event is is um was

908
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,919
successful or not so it's that's where

909
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:27,360
we are going to need a touch event

910
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,600
detector so as a prone locator as a

911
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:32,039
phone locator remember we were talking

912
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:35,100
about we were having the uh they are we

913
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,480
are having like a different sensing

914
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:38,279
signal of the device and this type of

915
00:33:38,279 --> 00:33:40,260
sensing signal actually tells us what we

916
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,940
like where is the phone and how we can

917
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:43,440
actually use it

918
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,500
so using this type of signature and we

919
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,419
can have a quick very reliable currency

920
00:33:48,419 --> 00:33:50,880
can classifier which means we know the

921
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:53,700
location of the antenna array and we

922
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,340
also know how the when the using antenna

923
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,559
array to measure the emitted signal from

924
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:01,440
the device and we can combine this two

925
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,539
information together we are capable of

926
00:34:03,539 --> 00:34:06,659
having uh antenna allocation a screen

927
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:09,000
location transformation uh Matrix so

928
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,560
using this type of thing as you can see

929
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,560
using 12 antenna together we can fully

930
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,480
recover how where is the phone located

931
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,800
or where is the device is located

932
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,020
without even have to see that you know

933
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:20,399
because everything is under the table

934
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:23,099
right and we tested that on different

935
00:34:23,099 --> 00:34:25,199
devices everything works on like

936
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:26,879
everything it can totally recover the

937
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:30,418
position in within one second and then

938
00:34:30,418 --> 00:34:33,480
the error is within one centimeter so as

939
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:35,820
for the touch event detector we need so

940
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,379
that that's actually a pretty funny

941
00:34:37,379 --> 00:34:39,000
phenomena that we are preserving because

942
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,219
the scanning signal from the device is

943
00:34:41,219 --> 00:34:42,960
going to be different if there is a

944
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,960
failed or successful ayama attack so

945
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,239
over here that's where our ayama signal

946
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:50,520
is turned on turn off and as you can see

947
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:52,619
that if the successful IM attack was

948
00:34:52,619 --> 00:34:54,899
recognized so there will be actual

949
00:34:54,899 --> 00:34:57,540
active scanning uh signal animated from

950
00:34:57,540 --> 00:34:58,859
the touch screen so where you can just

951
00:34:58,859 --> 00:35:01,320
use this to detect that so now here is

952
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,180
our end-to-end attack

953
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:03,900
um

954
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,060
we want to combine everything and show

955
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,740
you how we can manage it to you know

956
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,780
like have everything together and then

957
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:12,300
try to generate a touch event on this so

958
00:35:12,300 --> 00:35:14,160
now we have everything you know like a

959
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,320
place under shoebox and we over here we

960
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,820
do this like a manually so we want to

961
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:20,099
tell you that that using this type of

962
00:35:20,099 --> 00:35:22,320
signal we can how do we actually recover

963
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:24,060
the device and how do we find this a

964
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:27,240
correct antenna to uh attack the um to

965
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,520
attack the uh the the touch screen and

966
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,400
once we have I said once we have the

967
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,440
correct location and we choose the

968
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,720
target like the nearest Target antenna

969
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,760
we just use like we just turn on that

970
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:40,020
one and then try to generate a touch

971
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:41,640
event at that position

972
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:44,099
okay so what about the attack scenario

973
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:46,800
so in order to do the attack scenario we

974
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,420
actually have different for example like

975
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,940
we have click based attack which going

976
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:52,740
to be able to install malicious

977
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:55,500
application on Android we also have we

978
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,480
also are capable of connecting monicious

979
00:35:57,480 --> 00:36:00,000
Bluetooth peripheral on iOS device and

980
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:02,040
as for the gesture best attack we can

981
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,380
send a bank fraud message we can send

982
00:36:04,380 --> 00:36:06,300
money by just using press and hold on

983
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,940
paper icon which you can show your QR

984
00:36:08,940 --> 00:36:10,500
code and then you can just scan that

985
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,420
afterwards and we can also just unlock

986
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:14,339
the phone even though the phone probably

987
00:36:14,339 --> 00:36:16,800
is protected by gesture uh unlocking

988
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:17,940
mechanism

989
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:20,579
so we did an attack setup with one of

990
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:22,380
the operating here from our lab and we

991
00:36:22,380 --> 00:36:24,060
asked him to sit in front of the desk

992
00:36:24,060 --> 00:36:26,579
and randomly press the cell phone over

993
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:28,800
here and there I want to see how we can

994
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:31,320
how well we can attack that and as for

995
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,780
the attacker evaluation uh we are

996
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:36,720
capable of uh we are a couple of like

997
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,839
our work our attack Works six hours ten

998
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:42,599
times on iPad our attack Works a nine

999
00:36:42,599 --> 00:36:46,020
hour times on iPhone 11 Pro and as for

1000
00:36:46,020 --> 00:36:47,700
installing malicious application Android

1001
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:51,240
device on with one plus pro 7 Pro well

1002
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:54,060
sadly our attack only works three times

1003
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:55,680
out of the ten times because you know

1004
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:58,380
like the yes and no button are really

1005
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,060
close to each other so like sometimes we

1006
00:37:00,060 --> 00:37:02,220
just close we just click on the no and

1007
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:04,680
we ruin the channel of the attack

1008
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:07,320
so that's the attack right so whatever

1009
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:09,839
the mitigation so mitigation side the

1010
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,119
vendor can actually try to use a

1011
00:37:12,119 --> 00:37:14,160
pressure or Force detection and because

1012
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:15,960
we are not really going to generate any

1013
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:18,480
kind of attack pressure or Force by just

1014
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,000
using IMS you know so like for example

1015
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,920
like a Samsung IC over here it actually

1016
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,540
tells you what is the force that has

1017
00:37:24,540 --> 00:37:26,460
been sensed at this moment on the

1018
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:27,599
touchscreen so you can use that to

1019
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:29,099
filter out of those kind of ghost touch

1020
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:31,020
that we just generated but what about

1021
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,880
the customer right so you can definitely

1022
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:36,540
just buy this car a third day back or

1023
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:37,920
you know is it something like an Amazon

1024
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:40,140
but it's going to also block out all

1025
00:37:40,140 --> 00:37:43,500
your like uh cellular or a Wi-Fi or AMC

1026
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:45,660
the type of thing thing which makes your

1027
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:47,880
cell phone totally unoperational so

1028
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:50,579
that's not cool and we actually think

1029
00:37:50,579 --> 00:37:52,740
there's a cheaper and better way to do

1030
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:55,020
that so like it's really simple you just

1031
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,760
have this kind of a case phone case with

1032
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,220
the cover and you can actually tape or

1033
00:37:59,220 --> 00:38:01,740
glue the third Friday fabric with inside

1034
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:03,480
so this kind of fabric is going to be a

1035
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:05,820
thing you can just kind of go use that

1036
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:08,339
right next to your uh cover that your

1037
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:09,720
phone right next to your touch screen

1038
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,660
and we test that so only like uh I think

1039
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:14,760
only in that 0.2 millimeters this type

1040
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,680
of thick uh fabric that should be able

1041
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:19,560
to block our attack like really uh

1042
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,560
really um effectively so

1043
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,200
again as you can see that this other

1044
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:26,880
type of attack is not really complicated

1045
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,680
at all right so it's really simple and

1046
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:30,900
that's why we think at this point it's

1047
00:38:30,900 --> 00:38:32,400
still low handful and we're still

1048
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:34,380
actively working on this type of this

1049
00:38:34,380 --> 00:38:36,540
area and try to make this attack more

1050
00:38:36,540 --> 00:38:38,760
like a little bit more perfect right so

1051
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:39,900
again

1052
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,960
um so uh that's all the presentation of

1053
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:44,520
