2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,320
good morning everybody it's it's really

3
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:12,780
nice to see you all in person the first

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,360
time in a while and welcome to harm

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,180
reduction a framework for passionate or

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,440
compassionate and effective security

7
00:00:19,440 --> 00:00:22,039
guidance

8
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:23,699
so if you let me I want to start off

9
00:00:23,699 --> 00:00:26,279
with a story and if you grew up in the

10
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:29,460
80s or 90s like I did this might sound

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:31,260
very familiar to you you might have

12
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:33,300
experienced this

13
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:35,940
when I was a freshman in high school me

14
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:38,399
and my whole school were dragged into

15
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,379
the auditorium and in the center was

16
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:42,960
this smashed up wrecked car

17
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,719
and we were told that our classmates had

18
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,300
died from drinking and driving

19
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,280
and this was a program that was designed

20
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:53,219
to use fear to curb a behavior underage

21
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,760
drinking

22
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:58,500
and there are actually many programs

23
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:00,899
like this uh that one was called every

24
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:03,840
15 minutes but there's also dare they're

25
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:05,700
scared straight you may have experienced

26
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:07,560
one of these when you were a kid and

27
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,140
largely these programs are ineffective

28
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:12,720
uh at the time for me I had many

29
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:14,460
classmates in that room who swore off

30
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,380
drinking I'm never gonna drink and of

31
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,260
course they did of course they did and

32
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:20,759
research has shown that these kind of

33
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:22,619
programs that are aimed at curbing

34
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:24,900
specific behaviors through fear can

35
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,520
actually make the behaviors they're

36
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:27,900
trying to curb

37
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:31,460
worse not better

38
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,060
so why am I telling you this

39
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,579
why is my experience as a teenager

40
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:42,979
relevant to you here at black hat

41
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:46,500
imagine that was your security program

42
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,960
uh fear is a common tactic in cyber

43
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,460
security I mean you just walk the vendor

44
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:51,600
Hall and you're going to see some sales

45
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,000
pitches that are based on fear there are

46
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,340
lots of risky behaviors that we as cyber

47
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,840
Security Professionals are looking to

48
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,740
curb

49
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,420
and sometimes we scare people we tell

50
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,280
them not to do things because look at

51
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,840
this bad thing that could happen to you

52
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,240
if you do it but what if we are actually

53
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,940
making the problem worse not better

54
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,520
so my goal today is very very simple I

55
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,260
want to help you give better security

56
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:19,020
guidance the best guidance you can

57
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:22,140
possibly give and this applies to anyone

58
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:24,060
whether you are giving guidance at a

59
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:26,580
Fortune 100 to thousands of people or

60
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,840
whether you're trying to teach your

61
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:29,580
grandmother how to use the internet more

62
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,879
safely

63
00:02:32,099 --> 00:02:36,180
so just a quick quick brief intro on me

64
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:38,160
um my name is Kyle tobiner I'm the head

65
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,840
of security at a small devops startup

66
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:41,760
and this session here actually means

67
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:44,760
quite a lot to me my first interaction

68
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,280
with harm reduction happened in

69
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,140
unfortunate circumstances I had a family

70
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,640
member who really struggled with

71
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,040
addiction and I was struggling to

72
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,379
understand why these abstinence-based

73
00:02:55,379 --> 00:02:57,540
programs that are supposed to help we're

74
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,980
not helping at all

75
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,540
and that's when I learned about harm

76
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:02,760
reduction and as I started to read more

77
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:05,340
and discover this whole strategy that

78
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,019
the medical community has for dealing

79
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:09,720
with risky behaviors my mind was blown I

80
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,760
was forever changed and harm reduction

81
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,560
is invaded not only how I approach

82
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:15,959
addiction behaviors but also how I

83
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:18,000
approach cyber security it's part of how

84
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,459
I operate now as a cyber security

85
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:22,319
executive

86
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,099
um

87
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:25,140
also another reason I'm just really

88
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:27,360
proud to be here I first tried to bring

89
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,720
this talk to black hat in 2020 and as I

90
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,280
was writing the proposal I was diagnosed

91
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:34,560
with cancer and for whatever stupid

92
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,959
reason I tried to submit during chemo

93
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:39,120
and that was a terrible submission for

94
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,580
for obvious reasons but I got really

95
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:42,780
good feedback that said when you're

96
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:45,360
healthy come back and so now I'm here

97
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:47,700
I'm cancer free I've got my I've got my

98
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,760
hair back I'm very proud thank you thank

99
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,940
you

100
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,900
and so I'm really excited to share with

101
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,180
you what I love about harm reduction

102
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:58,799
but suffice to say I've been thinking

103
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,700
about this for a really long time

104
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:04,920
so if you remember anything from this

105
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:06,900
session today I want you to remember

106
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:10,439
these three things number one

107
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:13,200
except that risk-taking behaviors are

108
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,180
here to stay

109
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,680
number two

110
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,139
prioritize the reduction of negative

111
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:21,120
consequences

112
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,479
and number three Embrace compassion when

113
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,040
you're giving guidance

114
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,020
this is the harm reduction framework I'm

115
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:29,639
going to walk you through and I'm going

116
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:31,139
to give you more details on each of

117
00:04:31,139 --> 00:04:34,400
these bullets as we go through the talk

118
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,419
first I think it would make sense to

119
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:38,100
review some really common security

120
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:40,680
situations where you might be compelled

121
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:44,120
to give security guidance

122
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,180
so if you watch the Super Bowl you might

123
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,419
recognize this coinbase ran an ad that

124
00:04:51,419 --> 00:04:53,580
was just a bouncing QR code

125
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,139
and immediately

126
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:56,820
you might have gone to Twitter or if you

127
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,320
were on Twitter you might have seen

128
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,199
hundreds of infosec professionals saying

129
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,259
do not use a QR code like this it is

130
00:05:04,259 --> 00:05:05,639
unsafe

131
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:07,979
uh and oftentimes our phishing guidance

132
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:10,139
can kind of follow the same lines as

133
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:14,540
this don't click the link it's unsafe

134
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:18,960
we give a lot of guidance on passwords

135
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,300
as well password complexity should you

136
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,460
reuse them don't reuse them make a

137
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:26,039
password a certain way we advise really

138
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:28,139
high complexity in these scenarios but

139
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:30,360
then when someone rightly struggles with

140
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,699
this High complexity and needs something

141
00:05:32,699 --> 00:05:34,080
like this book

142
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:36,180
some people might tend to mock them or

143
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,860
say no you should never use a book like

144
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:39,900
this the only way to use the password is

145
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,400
the most insanely complicated way

146
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,139
possible

147
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:44,460
foreign

148
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:47,580
ly I'm big into Tick Tock I love Tick

149
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:48,960
Tock if you haven't seen my Tick Tock

150
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:51,720
check it out but security people tell me

151
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,060
all the time you should not use tick

152
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:57,240
tock it is unsafe it is bad

153
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,800
has anyone here ever told their family

154
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,020
not to use tick tock

155
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:04,139
I see I see a few hands guilty do they

156
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:06,539
actually listen to you because I don't

157
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:08,220
listen to any of those people who tell

158
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:10,320
me that so that guidance is really

159
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,840
really ineffective

160
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:14,460
now all this guidance that I just

161
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:17,180
described this is called use reduction

162
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:20,100
you see a risky Behavior you tell

163
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,139
someone not to do it your goal is to get

164
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:25,979
them to not do it reduce the use

165
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:27,660
and this seems really straightforward

166
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:29,400
like if you see a bad thing don't do

167
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,080
that bad thing

168
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,639
what's the harm in giving that kind of

169
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,000
guidance

170
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,740
so first

171
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,319
use reduction does nothing about the

172
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,539
original incentives that drove someone

173
00:06:42,539 --> 00:06:44,160
to that behavior in the first place

174
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,500
people have reasons for doing things

175
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:49,560
even risky things they're forgetful so

176
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:52,139
they buy a password book Tick Tock is

177
00:06:52,139 --> 00:06:54,060
really fun it helped me get through

178
00:06:54,060 --> 00:06:58,759
cancer so I didn't care about the risks

179
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:04,440
use reduction also tends to add social

180
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:07,440
stigma to risky behaviors there's a term

181
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,180
and security that's really common name

182
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,979
and shame I don't know if you've ever

183
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:12,720
mentioned doing something name and shame

184
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,520
in your security program but this can

185
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,560
make people feel kind of less than their

186
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,620
peers uh and it's not really a fun thing

187
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,580
to be on the other end of that shaming

188
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:26,479
and now use reduction may also be

189
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,039
iatrogenic which is a medical term that

190
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:31,580
I learned recently that I really love

191
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:34,979
atrogenic means a treatment that

192
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:36,720
actually induces harm sometimes more

193
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:37,979
harm than the thing they're trying to

194
00:07:37,979 --> 00:07:38,940
treat

195
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,460
so if your guidance is making a problem

196
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,000
worse it's not very good guidance

197
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,560
and now all these scenarios that I just

198
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:49,620
described none of them sound very good

199
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:54,080
which brings me to harm reduction

200
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:56,639
so first let me just Define harm

201
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,620
reduction if you've never heard of it

202
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,539
harm reduction is a set of practical

203
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:02,940
strategies and ideas aimed at reducing

204
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,979
the negative consequences associated

205
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:08,039
with various human behaviors that's kind

206
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:09,360
of a dry explanation so what does that

207
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,319
actually mean

208
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,860
risky behaviors have negative outcomes

209
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:16,860
harm reduction focuses on the outcomes

210
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,720
not the initial Behavior

211
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,520
and it might help to learn a little bit

212
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,819
about the origins of harm reduction uh

213
00:08:26,819 --> 00:08:30,000
in the 80s intravenous drug use was

214
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:33,120
spreading HIV all over the world

215
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,000
and in Liverpool a team of healthcare

216
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,399
professionals found a better way to

217
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,559
tackle intravenous drug use and the

218
00:08:40,559 --> 00:08:42,659
spread of HIV they created something

219
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:45,000
called a needle exchange where if you

220
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:47,040
had used needles that you would use for

221
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:49,200
intravenous drug use you brought them to

222
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,060
the needle exchange and they gave you

223
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,380
clean needles

224
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,959
and now this might sound kind of radical

225
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,019
to a lot of people but what they did is

226
00:08:58,019 --> 00:09:00,600
they prevented an HIV outbreak in

227
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,120
Liverpool with this model it was really

228
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,279
really profound at the time

229
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,279
and now since then harm reduction has

230
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,899
been used successfully with drug

231
00:09:09,899 --> 00:09:12,240
treatment alcohol treatment sex

232
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:17,000
education and many many other programs

233
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,160
so I want to show you how we can take

234
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,620
lessons from health care and apply harm

235
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:25,019
reduction to cyber security Healthcare

236
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:26,640
has been gaining the benefits of harm

237
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,740
reduction for 40 years and I think it's

238
00:09:28,740 --> 00:09:31,880
time for us to join in

239
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,740
so jumping back to the framework except

240
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:36,660
that risk-taking behaviors are here to

241
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,860
stay

242
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,180
I'm going to dig into this in more

243
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:42,859
detail and explain what this means

244
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:46,140
I mentioned before humans are motivated

245
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,940
by incentives

246
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:50,640
we take risks for reasons

247
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,500
when you tell someone not to do

248
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:54,600
something you actually don't do anything

249
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,880
about the original incentive that drove

250
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,260
them to the behavior in the first place

251
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,019
and oftentimes for people the incentive

252
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:03,540
outweighs the risks we tell people not

253
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:05,760
to smoke but they enjoy smoking it makes

254
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,620
them feel less stressed so they smoke

255
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,839
because risk-taking behaviors are here

256
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:16,380
to stay investing 100 in use reduction

257
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,899
is really really inefficient use

258
00:10:18,899 --> 00:10:23,180
reduction has diminishing returns

259
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,640
so when you focus on use reduction there

260
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,019
are actually quite a few unintended

261
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:29,640
consequences

262
00:10:29,640 --> 00:10:30,959
and let me talk a little bit about those

263
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,760
unintended consequences

264
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:35,040
has anybody here ever heard of the iron

265
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,420
law of prohibition

266
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:43,200
nobody oh one nice two okay so most of

267
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,000
you haven't heard of this the iron law

268
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:47,160
of prohibition says that when you outlaw

269
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:49,380
something it will increase in potency

270
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:52,200
and become harder to detect so in

271
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,899
Prohibition in the U.S in the early

272
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:58,019
1900s we banned alcohol and suddenly

273
00:10:58,019 --> 00:11:01,200
alcohol became more potent and harder to

274
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,880
detect it became easier to Smuggler

275
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,860
since we started getting harder alcohols

276
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,120
instead of beer

277
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,880
right now the U.S is experiencing kind

278
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,279
of a an epidemic because of this with

279
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,959
synthetic fentanyl where synthetic

280
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:15,320
fentanyl is very very difficult to tact

281
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:17,579
extremely potent and it's killing a lot

282
00:11:17,579 --> 00:11:19,620
of people and this is seen in by the

283
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,079
medical community as a response to the

284
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,779
War on Drugs

285
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:26,220
there's also something called the

286
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,200
abstinence violation effect who knows

287
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,240
about this

288
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:32,339
I see a few a few more hands for this

289
00:11:32,339 --> 00:11:33,120
one

290
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,519
so the abstinence violation effect

291
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:37,680
happens when people are faced with

292
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,260
impractical use reduction goals

293
00:11:40,260 --> 00:11:42,779
uh they can actually increase their risk

294
00:11:42,779 --> 00:11:45,240
taking because they feel like they can't

295
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:47,880
meet your overly high expectations and

296
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,740
they might even lose their motivation to

297
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:52,560
even try so sometimes when you set these

298
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,720
really tough abstinence goals for people

299
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,660
they end up just experiencing more harm

300
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:02,880
now all this is it backed by extensive

301
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,260
medical research and I'm going to talk

302
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:05,700
you through some of the medical research

303
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,820
that I found really informative as I you

304
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:10,680
know learned about harm reduction

305
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,260
so turning my attention back to

306
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:16,380
Prohibition prohibition saw an initial

307
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:18,480
drop of 70 percent in alcohol

308
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:20,940
consumption which sounds pretty good but

309
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,040
over the life of prohibition that fell

310
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,779
to 30 percent

311
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:27,360
but the annual enforcement of

312
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,339
prohibition started out costing 6

313
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:32,100
million and ended up costing 13 million

314
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,200
so what you had is a program that was

315
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:36,060
becoming more and more less effective

316
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,519
over time and more and more expensive

317
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,500
over time

318
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:44,040
teenage pregnancy is an area where we do

319
00:12:44,040 --> 00:12:47,100
a lot of Youth reduction training title

320
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,720
five of the Social Security Act of the

321
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,700
United States guarantees 100 million

322
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,279
dollars annually for abstinence-based

323
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,440
pregnancy prevention programs and

324
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,660
Congressional Studies have shown that

325
00:12:57,660 --> 00:12:59,880
those programs have not had any impact

326
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,519
at all on delaying sex that is a lot of

327
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:06,120
money wasted on being very ineffective

328
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:09,180
War on Drugs we've spent a trillion

329
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:12,360
dollars on it roughly since the 70s and

330
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:14,700
obviously drugs have not been eradicated

331
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,380
and people actually think we have

332
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,420
increased the drug trade

333
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,399
through the War on Drugs

334
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:23,639
and finally dare is the drug abuse uh

335
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:26,279
resistance education program research

336
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:28,019
has shown that dare is entirely

337
00:13:28,019 --> 00:13:30,000
ineffective and actually increased

338
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,899
harmful behaviors in children many times

339
00:13:33,899 --> 00:13:38,000
so what can this teach us for security

340
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:43,019
100 use reduction does not work complete

341
00:13:43,019 --> 00:13:45,060
eradication of a risky Behavior should

342
00:13:45,060 --> 00:13:47,639
never be your goal you will waste your

343
00:13:47,639 --> 00:13:52,220
time and money pursuing The Impossible

344
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,620
use reduction is relevant it's still a

345
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,120
preferred outcome

346
00:13:57,120 --> 00:14:01,220
but it can't be your only treatment

347
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,380
use reduction needs support from other

348
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:06,720
managers like harm reduction

349
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,300
and effective guidance will acknowledge

350
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,599
that

351
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:16,320
use reduction doesn't work for everyone

352
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:18,720
once you acknowledge that it lets you

353
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,700
help the people

354
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,800
who would be left out of your use

355
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,720
reduction guidance rather than ignore

356
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,899
them

357
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:29,700
so for better for worse QR codes and

358
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:32,220
links that's how the internet works

359
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,279
the provided that pragmatic approach is

360
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,899
to accept that people will use these

361
00:14:36,899 --> 00:14:38,579
things and do something about the

362
00:14:38,579 --> 00:14:42,859
consequences not the behavior itself

363
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:46,079
Tick Tock is also the number one app in

364
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:48,899
the USA it is here to stay for a bit if

365
00:14:48,899 --> 00:14:50,820
you focus on the bad outcomes of tick

366
00:14:50,820 --> 00:14:53,279
tock and try to resolve those you're

367
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:54,480
going to be more effective than trying

368
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,040
to stop people from using something that

369
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,260
clearly many people in this country want

370
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,560
to use

371
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:02,940
now here's a good example of why you

372
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,920
can't eradicate risks from security

373
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:06,380
research

374
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:08,339
you see the research here it's from

375
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:11,699
soups 2016. people use reuse passwords

376
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:14,220
because they're too complex people reuse

377
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:16,260
passwords that they have to frequently

378
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,519
reuse

379
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,620
security Security Professionals give a

380
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,440
lot of password guidance but people make

381
00:15:22,440 --> 00:15:24,839
decisions because of the incentives so

382
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,279
with passwords they're making decisions

383
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:28,199
to reuse them because it saves them time

384
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:31,380
it saves them mental energy so humans

385
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,540
will always reuse passwords no matter

386
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:36,380
how hard we try

387
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:38,699
here's another interesting paper from

388
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:40,740
not too long ago is called phishing and

389
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,019
organizations finding from a large scale

390
00:15:43,019 --> 00:15:44,519
and long-term study

391
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:46,740
and what they found was that some widely

392
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,660
accepted forms of testing and training

393
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:50,699
for phishing actually increased

394
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:52,980
susceptibility to phishing so going back

395
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,260
to that medical word I used iatrogenic

396
00:15:55,260 --> 00:15:57,600
we could be in some circumstances

397
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,060
causing more harm with our treatments

398
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:03,018
than causing good

399
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:05,940
so hopefully I maybe convince you a

400
00:16:05,940 --> 00:16:07,380
little bit that risk-taking behaviors

401
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,360
are here to stay and you might be asking

402
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,579
well okay what do I do what do I do

403
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:16,440
this brings me to part two of my harm

404
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,600
reduction framework which is prioritize

405
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,339
the reduction of negative consequences

406
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,860
why why is this important

407
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:27,839
so as I said before we know that

408
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:30,480
eradication is not possible

409
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,040
there are always people in a population

410
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:36,079
who are going to make the risky choice

411
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:38,519
but we're Security Professionals we

412
00:16:38,519 --> 00:16:42,300
understand risk there are more risky and

413
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,220
less risky versions of high-risk

414
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,540
behaviors which sounds a little weird

415
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:49,939
but it's true risk exists on a spectrum

416
00:16:50,040 --> 00:16:52,079
now you may also hear this a lot

417
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:53,699
sometimes people feel like if someone

418
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:55,980
engages in a risky Behavior they deserve

419
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:57,300
it

420
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,380
but

421
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,660
risk is incurred not only for an

422
00:17:00,660 --> 00:17:02,339
individual but oftentimes for a

423
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:03,600
population

424
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:06,240
so if you just leave people who perform

425
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:07,740
these risky behaviors to their own

426
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:09,540
devices because they deserve it you

427
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:11,220
ignore the harms that the population

428
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:13,380
around them experiences and you're

429
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,939
missing a golden opportunity for

430
00:17:14,939 --> 00:17:18,439
reducing the risk to your organization

431
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:21,140
so harm resection calls for pragmatism

432
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,880
pragmatism is acknowledging that any

433
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,400
step towards lower harm is better than

434
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,419
nothing

435
00:17:27,419 --> 00:17:30,000
so that means you are accepting that a

436
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:32,160
risky behavior is taking place you are

437
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:34,140
looking at the harms that may be caused

438
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,940
when people perform that risky behavior

439
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:38,700
and you're trying to identify any ways

440
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,799
you can to reduce those negative

441
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,140
consequences no matter how small because

442
00:17:43,140 --> 00:17:46,380
in aggregate you will be doing more

443
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:48,780
effective security guidance on the whole

444
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,700
than you would be by just saying don't

445
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:53,120
do that

446
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:55,679
what I like about this approach is that

447
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:57,960
no individual is left out of your harm

448
00:17:57,960 --> 00:18:01,880
mitigation it is inclusive

449
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,480
so harm reduction focuses on feasible

450
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,840
pragmatic effective guidance

451
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:13,020
it is so so easy to Rattle on Impossible

452
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:16,140
goals you set an okr you set a kpi you

453
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:18,299
said you know we resolve this Behavior

454
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:20,220
we reduce this Behavior by 30 percent

455
00:18:20,220 --> 00:18:24,120
next year it's 40 next year it's 50 next

456
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,460
year it's 60 and you just continue down

457
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:27,840
this path that's going to end an

458
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,820
impossibility if that's all you're doing

459
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:32,340
you're doing your your company the

460
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:33,539
person you're serving the people you're

461
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:36,500
trying to help a disservice

462
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:39,480
pragmatism is how use reduction and harm

463
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:42,539
reduction work together

464
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:44,940
so you can teach use reduction but you

465
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:47,220
need to understand its limits and have a

466
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,960
plan to reduce the harm for

467
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,740
non-compliance

468
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:54,240
and again we have really extensive

469
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,799
research in the medical community that

470
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:58,080
supports everything that I'm saying one

471
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:59,580
of my favorite case studies on harm

472
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:02,460
reduction is on e-cigarettes comparing

473
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:04,020
how e-cigarettes were treated in the

474
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,120
United States versus how e-cigarettes

475
00:19:06,120 --> 00:19:09,120
were traded in the UK in the U.S we

476
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,400
initially banned e-cigarettes the UK

477
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:12,960
chose to regulate

478
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,440
in the U.S we predictably had higher

479
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,840
concentrations in our e-cigarettes we

480
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,580
were marketing to miners there was a

481
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,140
whole Black Market of e-cigarette

482
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:24,480
products and we had more than 50 deaths

483
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,460
related to Black Market e-cigarette

484
00:19:26,460 --> 00:19:27,660
products

485
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,940
compare this to the UK where they took

486
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:31,320
approach of Regulation and harm

487
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,520
reduction

488
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,880
e-cigarettes had lower concentration

489
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:37,740
youth usage was four times lower than in

490
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:40,679
the U.S they actually marketed uh

491
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:42,600
e-cigarettes as smoking cessation

492
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,000
products and saw reductions in cigarette

493
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,039
smoking which was a greater harm than

494
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:48,840
e-cigarette smoking and they had

495
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,580
absolutely no deaths related to

496
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:52,740
e-cigarettes

497
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,620
another great uh place to do this kind

498
00:19:55,620 --> 00:19:57,419
of comparison is in sex education

499
00:19:57,419 --> 00:19:58,980
there's something called virginity

500
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:01,020
pledges where people say I will not have

501
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:03,900
sex until X period in time

502
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,960
teens who pledge uh virginity rather

503
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,419
than get traditional sex education are

504
00:20:09,419 --> 00:20:11,760
equally as likely to have sex as people

505
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,820
who get traditional sex education but

506
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:16,980
people who gets traditional sex

507
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:19,020
education are more likely to use

508
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,020
contraception are more likely to get

509
00:20:22,020 --> 00:20:25,080
tested for STDs and have STDs on average

510
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:28,220
for less time

511
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:31,020
the War on Drugs is another classic

512
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,059
example of harm reduction the birthplace

513
00:20:33,059 --> 00:20:34,860
of harm reduction really

514
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,039
um I mentioned before needle exchanges

515
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,360
needle exchanges around the world have

516
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:42,299
reduced HIV infections by suspected 70

517
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:43,860
percent

518
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:46,140
and safe injection sites have decreased

519
00:20:46,140 --> 00:20:49,740
overdose deaths by 35 percent and access

520
00:20:49,740 --> 00:20:52,559
to naloxone which is a overdose

521
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,500
inhibitor has reduced overdoses by 11

522
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:57,840
percent

523
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,820
so what can we learn here for cyber

524
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:01,919
security

525
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,160
100 use reduction is not enough over and

526
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:07,620
over in research we're seeing that only

527
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,179
use reduction

528
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:12,480
increases harm to individuals

529
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,059
to be more effective you need to look at

530
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:16,740
the harmful outcomes of the risky

531
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:18,059
behaviors that you have in your

532
00:21:18,059 --> 00:21:20,280
environment and design treatments that

533
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,160
mitigate those risks and harmful

534
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,700
outcomes

535
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,900
now this might sound very similar to

536
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:30,240
defense in depth because it is no

537
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,400
individual control is enough but you can

538
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,700
layer controls and in the aggregate have

539
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,620
a very successful security program by

540
00:21:37,620 --> 00:21:40,500
adopting harm reduction

541
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:42,299
so let's take it back to my first

542
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:44,640
example of the QR code

543
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:45,960
now we're going to assume that people

544
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:47,340
are going to click this

545
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,659
so we have

546
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:50,460
an opportunity to educate with our

547
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:51,840
guidance rather than just tell people

548
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,900
what not to do and if we have you know

549
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,640
many people here probably work on some

550
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,320
of the platforms that facilitate the web

551
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:00,659
that we live on you have an opportunity

552
00:22:00,659 --> 00:22:02,159
to build warnings into the platform

553
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:03,720
build features into the platform that

554
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:06,120
make it safer for people that they're

555
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,039
less likely to experience the harmful

556
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:11,059
outcomes of their behavior

557
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,880
Tick Tock as an example if you have

558
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:16,320
people in your life that use tick tock

559
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,179
rather than tell them not to use it you

560
00:22:18,179 --> 00:22:19,860
might suggest you could use it in a

561
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,080
browser you could use it on a dedicated

562
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:23,580
device that doesn't have any of your

563
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,440
other personal information on it there

564
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,140
are ways to make a risky Behavior less

565
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,159
risky

566
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:31,919
and over time those you know that kind

567
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:35,299
of guidance will be more effective

568
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:38,760
so this is a study that I really really

569
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:39,720
love

570
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:42,840
it's about sexting and now I have a I

571
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:45,000
have a children there are you know my

572
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,100
oldest is five so I'm not here yet but I

573
00:22:47,100 --> 00:22:48,419
have a lot of friends who have children

574
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:50,159
who are at the age where this has become

575
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:52,320
a problem and one of the things that

576
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:53,880
people tend to do is just stick their

577
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:55,200
head in the sand we're not going to talk

578
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,940
about it don't ever do it don't ever do

579
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,700
it but it's just not pragmatic Sexting

580
00:22:59,700 --> 00:23:02,179
in our culture is a normative Behavior

581
00:23:02,179 --> 00:23:05,520
adolescents are going to do this once

582
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,960
you understand that they're going to use

583
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:09,299
the do this you have an opportunity to

584
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:11,760
provide them more effective guidance one

585
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,900
of the pieces of guidance from this

586
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,580
paper that I really like is don't

587
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,320
include your face if you're going to do

588
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,240
it take your face out of it so that that

589
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:20,460
image cannot be used against you in the

590
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:23,100
future that is a harm reduction approach

591
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,959
that is extremely effective

592
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:32,159
uh Eva galperin from the eff as is a big

593
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,260
proponent of harm reduction she writes

594
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,419
guidance that is harm reduction based so

595
00:23:36,419 --> 00:23:38,520
this here is an article she wrote about

596
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:41,760
telegram basically saying if you are in

597
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,039
Russia or the Ukraine you there may be

598
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:45,720
circumstances where you need to use

599
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:48,059
Telegram and it may not be safe for you

600
00:23:48,059 --> 00:23:50,039
so here are the ways that you can make

601
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:52,320
telegram a little bit safer in

602
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,480
circumstances where you need to use it

603
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,120
and I think this approach is really

604
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:59,100
really really important and I feel like

605
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,340
articles like this are way more

606
00:24:01,340 --> 00:24:04,080
successful and pragmatic than just

607
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,220
saying don't use Telegram

608
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,760
so the goal here is remove don't do that

609
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,039
from your vocabulary and instead try to

610
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:16,140
say something like try not to do that

611
00:24:16,140 --> 00:24:19,380
but if you do then here are some ways to

612
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,600
make that behavior more safe

613
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,460
you have an opportunity to educate

614
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,620
people with your expertise and you can

615
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,299
use that opportunity to give them better

616
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,059
guidance and over time when you build

617
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:32,280
trust with people

618
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:33,840
they're more likely to listen to your

619
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,199
guidance

620
00:24:37,620 --> 00:24:39,000
part three of my harm reduction

621
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:41,419
framework

622
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:43,080
now this one might be a little head

623
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:45,840
scratchy for people in the audience

624
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:48,120
um Embrace compassion while providing

625
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:50,520
guidance it's a little touchy-feely uh

626
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:52,679
but it's actually a very very important

627
00:24:52,679 --> 00:24:55,500
part of harm reduction

628
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,480
why

629
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:00,720
high risk behaviors often include stigma

630
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:03,419
stigma can break down willpower and

631
00:25:03,419 --> 00:25:07,039
increase susceptibility to harm

632
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:11,039
so you as a cyber security professional

633
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,919
should try and not add stigma to these

634
00:25:13,919 --> 00:25:16,860
high-risk behaviors instead by embracing

635
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:18,600
empathy by embracing kindness

636
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:21,299
encouraging positivity you can build a

637
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:22,799
more positive relationship with the

638
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:25,740
people you're trying to impact

639
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,419
in harm reduction there's actually a

640
00:25:27,419 --> 00:25:28,440
different term for this it's called

641
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:31,020
improved quality of life but it is

642
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:32,700
health care so you know the

643
00:25:32,700 --> 00:25:34,380
circumstances are kind of different but

644
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,640
this is a really great way of thinking

645
00:25:35,640 --> 00:25:38,279
about it is how can you when you're

646
00:25:38,279 --> 00:25:39,779
providing guidance people

647
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:41,700
also make their lives better make their

648
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:43,380
lives easier

649
00:25:43,380 --> 00:25:45,120
if you can't stop them

650
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,959
support them

651
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:53,220
compassion and empathy build trust

652
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:55,320
people make better choices for

653
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,440
themselves when they feel supported

654
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:00,840
if they trust the person who is giving

655
00:26:00,840 --> 00:26:03,120
them guidance they're going to trust the

656
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:05,039
guidance itself more

657
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,440
so by building a compassionate trusted

658
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,640
relationship with the people you're

659
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,220
trying to guide your guidance will be

660
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:13,880
more effective

661
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:17,880
and this is another really important

662
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:20,400
point that I discovered as I was doing

663
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,840
this research

664
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,059
I mean we know this intrinsically but

665
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:25,679
caring for people is more fun than

666
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,500
fighting with them it's better for you

667
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,120
and it also makes you a better

668
00:26:30,120 --> 00:26:32,700
practitioner and it makes you less

669
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,980
likely to burn out

670
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:36,659
and you might be like oh that's I don't

671
00:26:36,659 --> 00:26:38,580
know that sounds like it's not

672
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:39,900
the research in the medical community

673
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:42,659
actually shows this

674
00:26:42,659 --> 00:26:44,340
so when it comes to shaming and

675
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:47,640
stigmatizing this reduces your efficacy

676
00:26:47,640 --> 00:26:49,679
and it increases the harm that can be

677
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,539
caused by high-risk behaviors

678
00:26:51,539 --> 00:26:53,220
when we look at the Scared Straight

679
00:26:53,220 --> 00:26:56,520
program uh this actually increased crime

680
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,039
among participants by somewhere from

681
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,900
five to Twenty Eight percent they've

682
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,700
tried to measure

683
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,260
so everything that they were trying to

684
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:06,059
prevent these people from doing by

685
00:27:06,059 --> 00:27:08,640
adding stigma to these behaviors they

686
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,140
broke down some of their defenses and

687
00:27:10,140 --> 00:27:12,000
made them more likely to contribute or

688
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,620
perform the behaviors they were trying

689
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,179
to prevent

690
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:17,580
now hiv-related stigma has been a

691
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,679
problem for many many years and it

692
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,720
actually causes lower rates of testing

693
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,240
lower rates of treatment engagement and

694
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,700
lower rates of medication adherence

695
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,700
so if you are a doctor and you embrace

696
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:32,520
the stigma of HIV you are not an

697
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:35,179
effective doctor

698
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:38,100
obesity related stigma

699
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:40,860
reduces motivation and engagement in

700
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:43,500
treatment as well and increases weight

701
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:48,260
and obesity in health related problems

702
00:27:49,559 --> 00:27:52,140
so all this is to say that stigma makes

703
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:54,419
your guidance worse

704
00:27:54,419 --> 00:27:56,580
now the converse of this is that

705
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:59,460
Compassionate Care improves trust and

706
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:01,140
reduces harm

707
00:28:01,140 --> 00:28:03,299
so safe injection sites that I talked

708
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:04,500
about earlier

709
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,620
lower overdose mortality and an

710
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:09,900
opportunity for the people who are

711
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,000
coming to those safe injection sites to

712
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,980
get cared for for the the for the

713
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:16,140
doctors who are at those places to talk

714
00:28:16,140 --> 00:28:17,600
to the people make a human connection

715
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:20,039
suggest to them other ways that they

716
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:22,500
might seek treatment

717
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,320
diabetes patients who have compassionate

718
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:28,380
doctors showed increased adherence to

719
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:29,580
guidance

720
00:28:29,580 --> 00:28:31,860
there were 40 percent less likely to

721
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:34,500
have complications and they were 80 more

722
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:36,120
likely to have optimal blood sugar

723
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:39,059
control and that's just from liking your

724
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:40,799
doctor just feeling like you have a good

725
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,960
relationship with your doctor

726
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,760
and this one really blows my mind

727
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:47,580
patients who trust their Physicians show

728
00:28:47,580 --> 00:28:49,679
40 less brain activity in their pain

729
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:50,700
centers

730
00:28:50,700 --> 00:28:53,880
which just is incredible right like they

731
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,860
they put these little you know Taps on

732
00:28:55,860 --> 00:28:58,380
people's heads induce pain in them made

733
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,760
sure they had doctors they cared about

734
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,620
doctors they didn't care about you will

735
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,659
experience less pain if you care about

736
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:06,059
the person who is giving you guidance so

737
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:08,460
you as the person giving guidance should

738
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,840
focus on building that trusted

739
00:29:09,840 --> 00:29:12,539
relationship because there are many

740
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:14,400
factors that go into reducing the harm

741
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,900
for the individual that you're guiding

742
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,419
now compassion makes practitioners more

743
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:22,880
effective as well

744
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:26,100
non-adherence to health care costs uh

745
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:28,799
the USA around 100 to 300 billion

746
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,899
annually I can only imagine how much

747
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:32,940
that is for cyber security it's probably

748
00:29:32,940 --> 00:29:35,640
a very high number

749
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:37,260
compassionate communication between

750
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:40,140
doctors and patients leads to 62 percent

751
00:29:40,140 --> 00:29:41,940
higher odds of patient adherence to

752
00:29:41,940 --> 00:29:42,899
treatment

753
00:29:42,899 --> 00:29:45,240
so if you are a better Communicator you

754
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,100
are more compassionate you're going to

755
00:29:47,100 --> 00:29:49,260
save your security program money by

756
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:51,179
making it more effective in a very cheap

757
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:53,480
way

758
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:56,039
and doctors who have poor patient

759
00:29:56,039 --> 00:30:00,299
relationships are 22 or 22x more likely

760
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:02,100
to burn out

761
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,440
and it's estimated that burnout reduces

762
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,500
the effectiveness of doctors

763
00:30:06,500 --> 00:30:10,860
33 globally so that's 33 of all doctors

764
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,480
in the world are less effective because

765
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,919
of burnout

766
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:15,840
I'm guessing that we probably have a

767
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:17,340
pretty similar number in cyber security

768
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,879
as well

769
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:23,340
so if your goal is effective guidance

770
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:26,159
shame stigma and confrontation make you

771
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:28,880
less effective

772
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:32,159
if your goal is effective guidance

773
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,279
compassion makes you more effective more

774
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:37,020
people will listen to you more people

775
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,940
will adhere to your guidance and there

776
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:41,340
will be a lower cost to the guidance

777
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:44,120
that you provide

778
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:47,760
and when you stop fighting people all

779
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:50,159
the time you like your job more you feel

780
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:53,840
better and you burn out less

781
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:58,860
so going back to some of our examples

782
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:01,799
passwords suck everyone hates passwords

783
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:04,200
the guidance is super complex you should

784
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:06,299
find every way you can in your job to

785
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:08,700
make your the people you're guiding make

786
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:11,039
their lives easier this may even mean

787
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:12,899
buying your grandparents a password book

788
00:31:12,899 --> 00:31:16,459
make their lives a little easier

789
00:31:16,919 --> 00:31:18,539
and maybe you can understand why I might

790
00:31:18,539 --> 00:31:21,419
enjoy Tick Tock and so if you're nice to

791
00:31:21,419 --> 00:31:23,460
me if you try and guide me away from

792
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:25,919
Tick Tock in a nice way at some point if

793
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:27,600
I become concerned I'm more likely to

794
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:29,700
talk to you than anyone who was like

795
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,380
don't use it it's terrible it's horrible

796
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:32,940
why would you ever

797
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:35,220
I just I'm not going to take guidance

798
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:38,960
from people like that it's not effective

799
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:41,399
so there are also a lot of other people

800
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,960
in the cyber security Community who

801
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:44,640
think this way around compassion as well

802
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:47,520
uh my friend Asta has this great quote

803
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,320
about hitching Your Wagon to developer

804
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,299
productivity and she runs product

805
00:31:51,299 --> 00:31:54,360
security and Netflix and her whole whole

806
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:57,179
Mantra is by making developers more

807
00:31:57,179 --> 00:31:59,520
effective more productive improving

808
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:01,860
their quality of life it becomes easier

809
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:05,220
to insert your security goals into the

810
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:07,080
developer workflow

811
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,659
her security guidance is more likely to

812
00:32:09,659 --> 00:32:12,419
be listened to adhered to and come at a

813
00:32:12,419 --> 00:32:14,399
lower cost because she develops strong

814
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,899
relationships with her Developers

815
00:32:18,840 --> 00:32:20,880
and this was a talk from Regina at black

816
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:23,760
hat in EU in 2021 her talk was about

817
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,919
knowledge shaming making all of us less

818
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:27,000
secure

819
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:29,820
the idea here is when we castigate

820
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:32,159
people when we shame them for making

821
00:32:32,159 --> 00:32:33,659
mistakes in their security program

822
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:36,539
they're less likely to share the

823
00:32:36,539 --> 00:32:39,179
outcomes of what they've learned uh in

824
00:32:39,179 --> 00:32:41,580
their breach in their mistakes in you

825
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:44,460
know their response efforts and that

826
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:46,380
makes all of us less secure because we

827
00:32:46,380 --> 00:32:47,700
don't benefit from the knowledge they've

828
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,220
gained having empathy for companies that

829
00:32:50,220 --> 00:32:52,260
have experienced breaches encouraging

830
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,779
them to change having compassion will

831
00:32:54,779 --> 00:32:56,520
encourage them to share more of their

832
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:58,320
lessons learned and thus make us all

833
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,559
better

834
00:33:03,899 --> 00:33:05,460
so I'm going to run you through some of

835
00:33:05,460 --> 00:33:08,520
my concluding thoughts really quick

836
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,559
harm reduction is effective in health

837
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:13,260
care the research supports it and I

838
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,240
think there is a vast territory in cyber

839
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:17,159
security for us to explore and adopt

840
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:20,279
harm reduction principles

841
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:22,679
if you incorporate harm reduction

842
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:24,720
principles into your guidance you could

843
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:28,019
see improved efficacy reduce costs and

844
00:33:28,019 --> 00:33:31,640
maybe even feel a little less burnt out

845
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,539
just a reminder

846
00:33:33,539 --> 00:33:34,980
we're leaving this room and we're not

847
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:37,320
saying don't do that anymore we're going

848
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:40,080
to say try not to do that but if you do

849
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:43,760
here's some ways to be more safe

850
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:45,840
finally coming back to my framework

851
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:48,440
remember these three three things please

852
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,940
accept that risk-taking behaviors are

853
00:33:50,940 --> 00:33:52,260
here to stay

854
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:54,299
prioritize the reduction of negative

855
00:33:54,299 --> 00:33:55,860
consequences

856
00:33:55,860 --> 00:33:58,440
and embrace compassion while providing

857
00:33:58,440 --> 00:34:00,799
guidance

858
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,830
and that's it thank you
