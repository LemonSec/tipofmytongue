3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,240
good afternoon everyone we are security

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,540
research from Baidu security X team is a

5
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,180
great honor that our talk was selected

6
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:21,300
by blackhead USA Today supong enemy we

7
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,400
are present in this talk because the

8
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,900
coordinating we cannot share it

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,380
face-to-face with you in Vegas here is

10
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:30,599
the agenda first we are introduce the

11
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:33,360
background of advice of the advertising

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,120
industry and then we all select three

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,520
typical cases to deep analysis and

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,520
underground Industries we will summarize

15
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,860
the key technology and make a cloud

16
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,680
analysis of them then we'll introduce

17
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,500
the project Fitness to take about to

18
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,980
talk about how to solve those problems

19
00:00:51,980 --> 00:00:54,480
uh first of all let me introduce the

20
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,539
advertising industry in general

21
00:00:56,539 --> 00:00:59,699
according to the financial report of

22
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:01,920
global internet companies in the past

23
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,199
years the scale of the global

24
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:06,119
advertising industry has reached

25
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:08,760
hundreds of Finance dollars actually the

26
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:11,040
advertising is the main business model

27
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:13,760
for most of the internet companies

28
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,640
typical internet models including social

29
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:20,820
networks search engine app stores short

30
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,820
videos so when our internet platform

31
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:26,900
company grows up like

32
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:30,479
a large number of users and advertisers

33
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,240
the advertisers continuously to spend

34
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,460
money on the internet platform company

35
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:39,000
to promote the products then the

36
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:40,100
internet company

37
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,380
usually try to break Public's limitation

38
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:46,920
that display advertise just only on

39
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:50,939
their own media such as the websites the

40
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:54,180
apps they start to open the advertiser

41
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,240
library to the party

42
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:59,220
that is the form of so-called

43
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:02,040
advertising Alliance platform a large

44
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:03,899
number of advertisers displaying

45
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:05,939
advertisement on multiple third-party

46
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:08,479
Medias through the advertising allies

47
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,280
platform for example The Advertiser

48
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,220
investor a hundred dollars the

49
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,400
advertising Alliance platform a company

50
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,980
will get 30 and the third party apps

51
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:22,280
apps apps

52
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:27,060
applications get 70 from a three-wing a

53
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,819
three-way win-win situation

54
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:32,640
and there are also many building models

55
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,780
such as CPC is built by click CPM is

56
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:39,780
built by advice and uh show current

57
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:42,840
advertising show can't CPA and the CPI

58
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:45,840
is billion by install or activation uh

59
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,480
not fast but not just by a simple click

60
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,660
then I will explain explain where the ID

61
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,299
flat advertising fraud across

62
00:02:57,739 --> 00:03:00,959
the most common uh advertising fraud

63
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,120
occurs between the media and the

64
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,459
advertising platform the media wants to

65
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:08,220
receive the platforms of term improper

66
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:12,080
profit shares we have select two typical

67
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,659
advertising road cases I marked one and

68
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:18,659
zero marked one and two in this page

69
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:22,220
another typical uh another type of

70
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,840
advertising flow is between advertisers

71
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,239
generally speaking and advertisers

72
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,940
budget is limited if his budget is

73
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:32,340
consumed by malicious click his

74
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,459
competitors can use a low cost to obtain

75
00:03:35,459 --> 00:03:38,280
more customers we also selected some

76
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,860
typical cases in this similar I'm

77
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:44,040
accessed as three in in this page due to

78
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,980
the time limit the problems between the

79
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,920
advertiser platform and and other forms

80
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,440
of root cannot be talked in detail one

81
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:54,180
by one today

82
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,599
next my colleague suhong will talk about

83
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,879
some typical cases about the advertising

84
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:02,220
fruit

85
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:05,299
yeah hello everyone

86
00:04:05,299 --> 00:04:09,120
let's look at the first case generally

87
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,599
apps often integrate many sdks for

88
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:16,040
statistics around advertisement

89
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,220
generation message push and so on in the

90
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,160
process of security illnesses we found

91
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:26,460
some malicious behavior in one big data

92
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:30,419
on message SDK and this IDK was merged

93
00:04:30,419 --> 00:04:33,780
into many well-known apps as shown in

94
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:37,680
the figure this evening harmless SDK

95
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,419
correctly and the name police DX

96
00:04:41,419 --> 00:04:46,500
malicious fail so it is that simple

97
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,919
uh so we have announced a lot of mobile

98
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:53,759
phone malicious click cases but this one

99
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,419
is the most complex one we have met

100
00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:01,320
first malicious DX May request the

101
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:05,100
latest patch if so if the environment is

102
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,380
safe the Cloud Server will written

103
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:11,820
text.gr and after a series of complex

104
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:14,639
requests looking for information file

105
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:18,120
and automatic click fail are finally

106
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,460
obtained yes as shown in the finger the

107
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:26,280
SDK assesses several different source

108
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:30,600
and downloads a deex file uh faulty are

109
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:34,220
fails and adjust fail

110
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,940
so how does a malicious IDK relax

111
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:40,020
automatic click

112
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:43,080
when the Jr requests the class server

113
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,800
just now the target URL keywords click

114
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,900
create and other task for information

115
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:51,840
have been downloaded to the app

116
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,759
the malicious Jr starts invisible but

117
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:00,240
will load the target URL and after a few

118
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:03,720
seconds injects autoclick script to

119
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,639
operate the web page

120
00:06:05,639 --> 00:06:08,759
in order to accuse more Java functions

121
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:12,180
in just code here GS Bridge technology

122
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:13,259
is used

123
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:17,039
for example first we register a GS

124
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,400
Bridge named the base in the SDK then

125
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,220
when we call based the get device

126
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:26,580
information in JavaScript code the same

127
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:31,639
method will be executed in Java code

128
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:35,940
and how to start a invisible activity in

129
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,759
the background activity continuous

130
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:41,580
technology is used here we need to

131
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:44,699
implement our own window manager and the

132
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:48,360
real root MPL we also need to hook some

133
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:51,000
classes to let the activity run in our

134
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,039
own content environment

135
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,220
the Android system cannot find such a

136
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:58,919
window and defending let's heading

137
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:03,299
overview activity is released

138
00:07:03,979 --> 00:07:07,740
so after unleading the technology let's

139
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:10,020
take a look at the organizational

140
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:12,960
structure of this case the battle

141
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,139
development company followed by some

142
00:07:16,139 --> 00:07:19,259
Channel numbers from advert headers for

143
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:23,580
example ID channel equal ABCD in the URL

144
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:27,120
when users take when you girls click on

145
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,360
this advertisements the channels will

146
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,740
get a shell

147
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:35,160
uh then they integrate Factor code and

148
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:37,039
the channel name into

149
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,139
malicious.j are failed and sell them to

150
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:42,919
the big date another negative company

151
00:07:42,919 --> 00:07:46,560
and the NASA campaign Works them into

152
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,400
the SDK finally many well-known apps

153
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:54,300
integrated this monitorial SDK but the

154
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,860
developer didn't know it

155
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,740
uh so what about the pieces that

156
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,680
we need to download some software such

157
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:08,099
as office another IR we may go to some

158
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:10,860
software download websites on the

159
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,780
download page there are often local

160
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:15,360
download and has to be download buttons

161
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:19,139
and has to be downloaded is recommended

162
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:22,080
one has to be downloaded in strategy it

163
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,800
doesn't actually increase the speed

164
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,379
instead other software is bounded and

165
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:31,979
installed or even broader broader

166
00:08:31,979 --> 00:08:36,080
plugins are installed silently

167
00:08:36,839 --> 00:08:40,979
about downloading and the Italian that

168
00:08:40,979 --> 00:08:43,620
attack is somewhere the downloader will

169
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,560
charge whether there is the anti-virus

170
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,860
software and then report to the cloud to

171
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:52,920
obtain the task of silently installing

172
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:54,240
softwares

173
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,120
at the same time the downloader will

174
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,820
also charge which browser is used by the

175
00:08:59,820 --> 00:09:02,519
system and copy the corporate

176
00:09:02,519 --> 00:09:06,000
corresponding browser plug in CRX fail

177
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:10,019
to the corresponding path yes it only

178
00:09:10,019 --> 00:09:13,019
need to be copied and the user has no

179
00:09:13,019 --> 00:09:15,380
fee

180
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:21,199
that we have found so let's focus on it

181
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:24,000
let's browser plugin include the

182
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,580
function of intercepting request

183
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:31,500
modifying pages and acute MGS scripts it

184
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:34,080
can fully control the request and the

185
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,080
response page the background script will

186
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:40,140
check whether the request URL is a

187
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:43,500
target URL the content script is used to

188
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,920
inject code for different tasks

189
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:50,100
foreign so let's take a look at the

190
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,660
example

191
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:55,140
when a user visit the video asset the

192
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,959
script of the malicious browser plugin

193
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:01,200
will first detect whether it's a high

194
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,500
quality user then it will send a jsonp

195
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,779
request to follow the target account

196
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:10,200
like this or GitHub but the target

197
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,899
account and the account number of follow

198
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:16,260
are obtained from the Cloud Server so

199
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:19,500
there is no need to update Supply in and

200
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,839
only need to return different tasks

201
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,800
uh let's look at another way if the

202
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,620
plugin detects that the user is editing

203
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,500
information websites such as some rest

204
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,560
comparison access the plugin will

205
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:39,839
replace the channel number of the other

206
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,700
over tablets

207
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:44,940
so whether you to do this if the user

208
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:48,120
funny buy the products the replace the

209
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,300
channel will get a ship that is it can

210
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,779
make a profit through malicious plugins

211
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:56,880
they said well the software's website

212
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,740
prefer you to download with the

213
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:02,720
downloader rather than directly

214
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:05,420
foreign

215
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:13,980
language or we call the E language is

216
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,959
the programming language that's used in

217
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:19,140
Chinese and you Chinese as a

218
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,940
developmental code

219
00:11:20,940 --> 00:11:23,779
because all the low learning threshold

220
00:11:23,779 --> 00:11:26,459
e-language has become the preferred

221
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:28,200
programming language for many

222
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:31,500
underground industry groups as shown in

223
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:34,620
the finger the programming code is in

224
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,040
Chinese

225
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,640
the developmental Community or E

226
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:44,640
language is particularly but active

227
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,339
in addition to communicating technical

228
00:11:47,339 --> 00:11:50,820
issue it also supports the customization

229
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,279
of special functions through payment

230
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:58,140
such as automatic click web crawler

231
00:11:58,140 --> 00:12:01,079
so let me introduce some common tools of

232
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:03,440
underground industry

233
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,720
Timmy Bible browser library is a web

234
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,959
operation library included by default in

235
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:12,660
each language in addition to normal

236
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,240
functions it also supports further

237
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:18,240
parameter simulation functions such as

238
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,899
setting supplement start points and so

239
00:12:21,899 --> 00:12:24,120
on

240
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:27,899
this is a automatic dialogue tools we

241
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:30,600
obtained it's developed in each language

242
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:33,899
too you can see the corresponding Target

243
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:36,800
URL and the other parameters to

244
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,180
automatically talk with customer service

245
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:42,540
after clicking advertisements

246
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,360
why is there such Row 2

247
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:49,200
yes it's used to attack a competitors

248
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,680
that was speaking some high value

249
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:54,000
advertisements need to be displayed

250
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,360
click and converted

251
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,200
for example the payment the download and

252
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,500
entire app on all the dialogue with the

253
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:06,959
customer service can be charged as a

254
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:11,339
effective what happens and the tester

255
00:13:11,339 --> 00:13:13,380
will pay for the money

256
00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:15,899
let's say two is designed to simulate

257
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:20,660
this process and quickly it does the

258
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:23,760
and quickly is also the advertising

259
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:27,920
package of the company teachers

260
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:32,820
in addition to the build in library

261
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,100
Captain Mojo is the most popular

262
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:38,639
attention Library it uses the Chrome

263
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:39,720
kernel

264
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:42,899
so let's solve this module developers

265
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:45,720
can easily operate the browser to your

266
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,380
left automatically modified simulator

267
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,660
device

268
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:53,399
fingerprint injection software and other

269
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:54,600
operations

270
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,360
for example similarly Five Point touch

271
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:02,390
which looks like a mobile phone device

272
00:14:02,390 --> 00:14:03,779
[Music]

273
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:06,839
in addition to Eddy clock tools on the

274
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:09,779
PC side there are many similar tools on

275
00:14:09,779 --> 00:14:13,079
the mobile set for instance the flow but

276
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:16,200
we thought of in the figure is mainly

277
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,959
used to record input sliding clicking

278
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,779
and other behaviors and then please

279
00:14:21,779 --> 00:14:25,079
impact when necessary both can alsoever

280
00:14:25,079 --> 00:14:28,019
is mostly used to improve our work and

281
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:31,019
the level if efficiency similar to the

282
00:14:31,019 --> 00:14:34,139
shortcut function in iPhone but it's

283
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:37,079
used by the underground industry for

284
00:14:37,079 --> 00:14:38,940
example they use recorded such

285
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:41,940
attentions to click on those advert

286
00:14:41,940 --> 00:14:44,300
headlines

287
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:49,199
as we can see from the animation this

288
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:52,399
software completely replaced the call

289
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:56,279
recorded human sliding Behavior compared

290
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:58,980
with using JavaScript code to simulate

291
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:02,279
the sliding from from A to point B this

292
00:15:02,279 --> 00:15:04,680
sliding is more like a real person's

293
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,899
behavior and it's not easy to be

294
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:09,540
detected by the risk control management

295
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:12,079
system

296
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:15,899
okay now let's take a look look at the

297
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:20,420
call and okay turn on the analysis

298
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:24,480
uh let's summarize the high level

299
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,660
underground industrial characteristics

300
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:30,480
some of them have already a large number

301
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:33,120
of companies and they claim to be

302
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:36,720
advertising monetization platforms sap

303
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,480
platforms but in fact there are

304
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:42,000
companies engaged in the underground

305
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,399
industry

306
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:49,040
uh usually they have her profit scale

307
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:53,279
but the low level underground Industry

308
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:55,760
Group have the different characteristics

309
00:15:55,760 --> 00:16:00,060
most of them are in the individual or

310
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:03,240
small team small scale growth we have

311
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:06,300
low technical ability but very diligent

312
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,820
in order to make a profit

313
00:16:08,820 --> 00:16:11,579
although they don't know the although

314
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:14,339
they often don't make much profit they

315
00:16:14,339 --> 00:16:17,160
can also lead to massive damage and the

316
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:20,120
best social impact

317
00:16:21,139 --> 00:16:23,760
uh now let's take a look at the

318
00:16:23,760 --> 00:16:25,620
technical details

319
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:27,480
the high level underground Industry

320
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,060
Group can generally control the user

321
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:33,060
equipment remotely on a large scale

322
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,279
similar to the backdoor program

323
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:38,820
installed on thousand two devices for

324
00:16:38,820 --> 00:16:42,360
example embed automatically code in the

325
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,220
app

326
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:46,800
SDK was installed browser plugins with

327
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,579
malicious functions and at the same time

328
00:16:50,579 --> 00:16:54,240
a lot of simulation technology hiding

329
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,940
technology and anti-decution challenges

330
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,930
are used

331
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,380
[Music]

332
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,820
compared with the high level underground

333
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:06,380
Industry Group low level uses various

334
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:09,059
tools to relax the local simulation

335
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:12,119
clinical function because they may not

336
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,720
have high technology and channels to

337
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,599
integrate Malaysian code into approach

338
00:17:18,599 --> 00:17:20,459
and PC softwares

339
00:17:20,459 --> 00:17:23,400
we can use the broader Library data can

340
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:27,119
be secondary developed as usual agent

341
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:29,100
assimilation and Hardware information

342
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:32,640
simulation I'll use the handles browser

343
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,419
and some IP process it was typical and

344
00:17:36,419 --> 00:17:39,840
the touch we call a new platforms are

345
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,919
used to simulate clicking on this target

346
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:46,340
okay

347
00:17:50,580 --> 00:17:53,760
thanks supong let me talk about the new

348
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,740
detection method we have problems

349
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:59,280
follows typical advertising Broad

350
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:01,580
first let me introduce

351
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:05,460
project in recent years the technical

352
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:07,740
capability of the underground industry

353
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:10,160
has a significa has significant

354
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,980
significant improved warehousing a lot

355
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,500
of tech tax leader of the underground

356
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,620
industry company they are used to work

357
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,860
for a giant giant of internet companies

358
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:25,140
and even some of them have security

359
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,900
engineer backgrounds we need to

360
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,299
accurately separate the advertising

361
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:34,620
throughout clicks to reduce the loss and

362
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:37,280
we need to continuously to chase them

363
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,419
because they are a tough to

364
00:18:41,419 --> 00:18:44,520
because they are very tough to make a

365
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:47,340
great profit and because the technical

366
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:50,580
of the technical background of my team

367
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:53,760
are binary vulnerability research and

368
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,460
webcam testing this research work is

369
00:18:56,460 --> 00:18:59,820
useful for us because it's a operating

370
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:02,720
system browsers malware analysis

371
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:05,880
knowledge we are good at we are good at

372
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:08,460
it the refrigerator's project is

373
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:11,460
consists by RGS SDK and a male warehous

374
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:14,880
form with a certain scale

375
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:17,700
today we all talk about four detection

376
00:19:17,700 --> 00:19:21,720
solutions that include headless browsers

377
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,960
invisible web real in mobile apps and

378
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,780
the mobile key plus tools and mail web

379
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,760
browser extensions

380
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:32,760
uh the first Target Catalyst or

381
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:36,360
automatic browser most of them are based

382
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,700
on Chrome devtools Cloud course plot

383
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,980
codes typically headless browser Library

384
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:46,580
including public

385
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:49,620
and just like the logo of the party

386
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:51,900
there are students their students

387
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,240
connected to the public so we can

388
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,220
control the browser behavior from that

389
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:58,500
stream and those hardly Sprouts the

390
00:19:58,500 --> 00:20:00,660
library official support language and

391
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:03,419
node.js and python as Superman said

392
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:05,340
earlier most of the low level

393
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,380
underground underground Industries

394
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:10,740
application Level high school so they

395
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:14,340
cannot write say plus plus problem a

396
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:18,539
program and this scripted based such as

397
00:20:18,539 --> 00:20:20,900
Python and JavaScript

398
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:24,120
hacking tools is the favorite

399
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,340
uh there are some open source projects

400
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:29,820
to detect headless browsers as as it as

401
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:32,520
this table list is the features they

402
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:36,240
choose I use agent web driver and is the

403
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,299
console window opened or alert make our

404
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:43,020
left to test after test we find that

405
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:46,380
many detection methods are actually the

406
00:20:46,380 --> 00:20:49,080
difference between the Chrome and

407
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:52,799
chromium projects such as mimo types and

408
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,500
language and some of them can be hidden

409
00:20:55,500 --> 00:20:58,140
through startup parameters such as web

410
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:01,640
driver user agent it can easily overeat

411
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:04,860
and the left detection points since

412
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,780
world not work for me

413
00:21:06,780 --> 00:21:10,559
and to solve this problem from the wheel

414
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:15,480
of the security research first we need

415
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:17,700
to deeply understand the implementation

416
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:21,000
of heavily sprouts by debugging the

417
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,340
source code of the chromium we find that

418
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:25,860
happier start Chrome

419
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,559
the properties start from chrome through

420
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,400
the command parameter remote remote

421
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:35,700
debugging Port eq0 then he gets a port

422
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:38,760
of websocket service and then he can

423
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:40,740
transmit control commands through this

424
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:43,559
port to control the browser behavior and

425
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:45,780
receive callback information generated

426
00:21:45,780 --> 00:21:48,720
by the browser this is a chrome devtools

427
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,120
protocol and the address browser is

428
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:54,000
based on is built based on Chrome

429
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:57,299
Delta's protocol so we think this this

430
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:59,760
transmit channel is the key detection

431
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,100
point

432
00:22:02,100 --> 00:22:05,100
English English scenarios we are just

433
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,940
JavaScript and HTML that's running in

434
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,220
the browser so the permissions are

435
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:14,100
limited that means we can add too much

436
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:17,159
things but inspired by the conception of

437
00:22:17,159 --> 00:22:19,380
the site channel uh we can link

438
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,500
something by doing something uh to to

439
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:24,900
watch the time and energy and consumes

440
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:29,159
different let's look at uh let's look at

441
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:31,380
the second picture first so that's a

442
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:34,020
simple memory copy operation written in

443
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:37,799
C plus plus it Loops 10 times and copy a

444
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:41,940
long data into a variable it took 33

445
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,260
mile seconds

446
00:22:43,260 --> 00:22:46,860
in my desktop computer CPU if we can

447
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:49,080
force a memory copy operator operation

448
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:52,320
through JavaScript but this code is only

449
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,840
executed when the browser has down to

450
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:57,840
the instance Delta instance we can

451
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:00,840
detect whether we are entirely sprouted

452
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:04,200
by the time there yes we have found a

453
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:07,020
lot of detection entries such as cancel

454
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:09,960
profile and which will travel the

455
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:13,140
devtools instance convert the parameter

456
00:23:13,140 --> 00:23:15,690
we passed in and for the execution

457
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:16,980
[Music]

458
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:20,460
based on those ideas we write a few

459
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:22,559
lines of JavaScript code in the picture

460
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,980
on the left after test this code can

461
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:28,620
stable detector all headless browser

462
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:31,919
including mobile web wheel in apps and

463
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:35,039
its harness for user experience because

464
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,799
nothing is displayed on the Chrome UI

465
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:40,380
and if you learn this principle is easy

466
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:42,360
to adopt on this code to the latest

467
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:45,020
browsers

468
00:23:46,580 --> 00:23:51,120
is based on Chrome devtools protocol yes

469
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:55,679
yes we can also detect it by this method

470
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,799
the next uh headless browser is jingy

471
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,200
web browser which is based on Mini blink

472
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,200
actually the author of mini blinker is

473
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:07,620
one of my friends one day one day I

474
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:10,380
asked him why this library is widely

475
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,480
used by low level underground industry

476
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,880
do you have do you have any detection

477
00:24:14,880 --> 00:24:19,440
ideas yes he said yes she said yes you

478
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:21,240
can start from the advantage of many

479
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,940
blink because this wiring is small and

480
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,640
is developed by uh is developed based on

481
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:29,700
a certain from your source code so he

482
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:32,039
cut off a lot of functions such as

483
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:35,900
webrtc yes mini blink does not support

484
00:24:35,900 --> 00:24:40,320
webrtc so you can do detection from this

485
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,539
point

486
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:45,179
uh let's talk about the next detection

487
00:24:45,179 --> 00:24:47,220
Target invisible mobile Library

488
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:51,260
advertisement uh click we learned this

489
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:54,480
through methods through the report that

490
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,760
disclosed by the mobile anti-virus

491
00:24:56,760 --> 00:24:59,400
companies such as Chief who Kaspersky a

492
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:02,220
few years ago from the reports and

493
00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,500
communicate with an anti-virus engineer

494
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:07,020
we learned that the analysis method is

495
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:10,140
using static analysis static analysis

496
00:25:10,140 --> 00:25:14,039
and dynamical behaviors in the Box this

497
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:16,500
mobile uh those mobile antivirus

498
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,900
companies generally generally only

499
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:21,419
disclose those instances but they do not

500
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:23,539
disclose how to

501
00:25:23,539 --> 00:25:27,299
passive it and detect it so we just

502
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:29,820
wonder can we active perception such

503
00:25:29,820 --> 00:25:32,720
risk risks without the assistance of

504
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,860
antivirus companies

505
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,860
this kind of malware it is those

506
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,320
malicious code dynamically from cloud

507
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:43,860
and is use a highly customized where we

508
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:47,640
and use JavaScript JS Bridge inject the

509
00:25:47,640 --> 00:25:50,520
JavaScript script to webview because the

510
00:25:50,520 --> 00:25:52,260
container of the webview is invisible

511
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:54,539
the netizens do not know what is

512
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:56,460
happening but the mobile phone traffic

513
00:25:56,460 --> 00:25:59,640
is consumed fast and the battery of the

514
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:03,659
phone is drying fast

515
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:07,080
here is a video we can have a look how

516
00:26:07,080 --> 00:26:10,440
it's working the left the left is a is a

517
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:12,779
pixel phone and the right is the webview

518
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:15,360
instance open in the phone the middle is

519
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:17,100
HTML traffic

520
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:19,140
let's have a look

521
00:26:19,140 --> 00:26:23,460
we we open a malicious apps as you can

522
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:30,480
see the left the left the web wheel is

523
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:36,179
as you can see after opening the apps we

524
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:38,580
are doing nothing yes nothing is

525
00:26:38,580 --> 00:26:41,820
happened on the UI but there are many

526
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,980
hidden webview in the background doing

527
00:26:43,980 --> 00:26:46,320
bad things such as shoe and click

528
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,980
advertise

529
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:55,980
this kind of malware is skilled in

530
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:59,580
antivirus and debugging and anti-am use

531
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:01,940
and use strong

532
00:27:01,940 --> 00:27:06,120
encryption channel for CNC so far the

533
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,520
dynamic analysis static analysis and

534
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,580
network behavior analysis is not so easy

535
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:14,039
for us because it has has any

536
00:27:14,039 --> 00:27:16,679
anti-technologies

537
00:27:16,679 --> 00:27:19,260
and this type of malware display the

538
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:22,080
advertisement through uh customized

539
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,260
webview and use JavaScript JS bridge on

540
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:27,840
the JavaScript operation to cooperate

541
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,200
with the code on the JS side because

542
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:34,500
this JS code he knows the position of

543
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:37,620
the 80 slot where is the ad slot and

544
00:27:37,620 --> 00:27:39,900
then the Java code will use this

545
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:42,179
position to simulate the user behaviors

546
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:46,260
such as perform a click on the edit slot

547
00:27:46,260 --> 00:27:48,960
uh we have several detection method

548
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,960
method one we have a mobile actually we

549
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,779
have mobile app store product that means

550
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:56,539
we have a large number of

551
00:27:56,539 --> 00:28:00,539
app samples through a deeply customer

552
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:03,059
developer room and customer developer

553
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:05,720
volt plugins we have bypassed all

554
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:09,179
anti-analysis point and based on this we

555
00:28:09,179 --> 00:28:11,820
developed based on this we developed a

556
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:15,120
set of course Farm use a lot of phone to

557
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:18,779
Loop to run all apps we have

558
00:28:18,779 --> 00:28:21,779
to absorb the dynamic loading of code

559
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:25,080
analysis the behavior of the web we we

560
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,039
find

561
00:28:26,039 --> 00:28:29,100
yes we find some underground industry by

562
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:30,299
this Farm

563
00:28:30,299 --> 00:28:32,580
is very effective

564
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:35,039
the second detection method is through

565
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,159
JavaScript by summarizing the key

566
00:28:38,159 --> 00:28:41,039
technology of the malware the RDS Bridge

567
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:43,500
the funding the location of the

568
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:46,860
advertisement in the page and Simulator

569
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,740
the user behaviors we can use JavaScript

570
00:28:49,740 --> 00:28:54,299
hook to watch a lot from my mod and

571
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:55,520
other

572
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:59,340
JS Bridge communication variables and to

573
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:02,340
check the is the landing page that muted

574
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,159
by someone once the abnormal information

575
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:08,340
is fine we can find a way to trace back

576
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:10,919
to fund the sample to complete the

577
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:13,080
analysis

578
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,960
the next detection Target a mobile key

579
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:18,600
plus tools and cloudforms we have write

580
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:23,100
a click script Live Twice yes there is a

581
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,740
milliseconds time difference between

582
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:28,200
those two clicks so we can detect the

583
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,320
automatically click tools by coordinates

584
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,559
of the click and loading checks and on

585
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,539
Android we can also pay attention to

586
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:39,240
test event the motion event such as

587
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:42,179
touch pressure mobile phone touchscreen

588
00:29:42,179 --> 00:29:46,200
and it's the value and is the value is

589
00:29:46,200 --> 00:29:48,840
different with humans as for the cloud

590
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:51,480
form there are the software the software

591
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,000
and the system usually run by a fixed

592
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,120
hardware and room if you find that a lot

593
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:59,340
of sim device accessing your devices

594
00:29:59,340 --> 00:30:03,539
from the same time that scheme to detect

595
00:30:03,539 --> 00:30:06,899
the cloud from we should collect many as

596
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:09,360
many as web real features as possible no

597
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,880
matter how is your user agent changed

598
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:14,700
but the way we your future arguments

599
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,220
that remains stable because his

600
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:19,980
operation operating system is not

601
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,020
changed

602
00:30:22,020 --> 00:30:24,480
the last detection Target is malicious

603
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,600
extension on PC side let's take a look

604
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:30,600
let's take a look at some public

605
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,779
disclosed method for detection the

606
00:30:33,779 --> 00:30:36,960
extension in browsers they are detected

607
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:40,380
the resource used by the extensions and

608
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:42,779
the detector whether the room has been

609
00:30:42,779 --> 00:30:46,260
modified for example the picture on the

610
00:30:46,260 --> 00:30:48,899
right is a malicious extension after

611
00:30:48,899 --> 00:30:53,059
it's run it will create a mutex element

612
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:55,740
we can travel the Dome through

613
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:59,220
JavaScript to detect if it exists

614
00:30:59,220 --> 00:31:02,220
another detection measure is by sending

615
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:05,580
a message to extension to test if it

616
00:31:05,580 --> 00:31:08,539
exists but I have never seen a malicious

617
00:31:08,539 --> 00:31:11,460
browser extensions that support message

618
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:15,299
communication so those methods does not

619
00:31:15,299 --> 00:31:17,399
work for me

620
00:31:17,399 --> 00:31:21,240
uh the public disclosed methods are all

621
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:23,820
have limitations so let's get let's go

622
00:31:23,820 --> 00:31:25,919
back to the signature of the malicious

623
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,919
blouse extensions the key features are

624
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:31,440
leaking interception requests they can

625
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:35,419
redirect URL access and inject

626
00:31:35,419 --> 00:31:39,299
JavaScript to web pages as for URL

627
00:31:39,299 --> 00:31:41,820
redirection we can guide the browser to

628
00:31:41,820 --> 00:31:45,059
access the URL or the URL the URL we

629
00:31:45,059 --> 00:31:48,120
generated we add a signature in the URL

630
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,460
on the source side we can watch the

631
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:53,760
request if the if the URL parameters

632
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:56,399
have changed that means the browser has

633
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:59,640
malware extension or driver for the As

634
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:02,720
for the JavaScript injection inject code

635
00:32:02,720 --> 00:32:06,000
the way we percepta is to use the CSP

636
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,179
features first we made our web page

637
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:12,240
that's with wide restrict CSP strategy

638
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:15,539
strategy such as we refuse to load all

639
00:32:15,539 --> 00:32:18,120
closed domain scripted we when the

640
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,100
malware extension try to insert

641
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:22,980
JavaScript in the page our location will

642
00:32:22,980 --> 00:32:25,880
occurs and Report data to the server

643
00:32:25,880 --> 00:32:29,159
on some special about the browsers the

644
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:31,679
log report of this validation will even

645
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,200
include the name of browser extension

646
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,960
this is the key to chase the underground

647
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,659
industry because my company has a large

648
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:42,659
number of employees as long as I know

649
00:32:42,659 --> 00:32:45,120
the name of the browser extension I can

650
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:47,880
find employees computer infected with

651
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,940
the malicious browser extensions and

652
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:52,740
then we can find the example and

653
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:57,260
complete the analysis yes it works great

654
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:05,640
okay I get it and the last chapter is

655
00:33:05,640 --> 00:33:08,399
summary and the recommendations and now

656
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,620
let me summarize this talk first I

657
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:13,320
introduced the background of advertising

658
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:16,860
industry a house advertising Alliance is

659
00:33:16,860 --> 00:33:19,679
formed and where does the fluid occurs

660
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,440
then I select three typical cases and

661
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:24,799
Analysis the underground industration

662
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,899
structures summarize lucky technology

663
00:33:27,899 --> 00:33:31,799
and cloud cloud characters then we

664
00:33:31,799 --> 00:33:34,080
introduce how the project figures solve

665
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:37,080
those problems we provide we provide

666
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:40,140
four Solutions and because of project

667
00:33:40,140 --> 00:33:43,320
helpless hundreds of hundreds of

668
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:46,039
underground industry

669
00:33:46,039 --> 00:33:49,039
practice

670
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,320
has been arrested by the employees

671
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,500
police they are sentenced for Valentine

672
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,399
the climate our law is law

673
00:33:59,399 --> 00:34:03,120
and the applicable law contains fluid

674
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,220
illegal control of computer information

675
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:08,339
system and Destroy production and

676
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:10,159
operation

677
00:34:10,159 --> 00:34:14,219
