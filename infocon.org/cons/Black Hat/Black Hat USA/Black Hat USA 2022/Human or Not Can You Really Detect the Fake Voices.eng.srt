[Music]

2
00:00:06,859 --> 00:00:09,859
thank you

3
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,480
how's your greetings from China you're

4
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:16,800
covering me

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,920
I'm sorry to be very sleepy

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,039
uh it's my second virtual black hash and

7
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,160
it's a great painting for me not to be

8
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:27,480
in Las Vegas due to the travel

9
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,740
restriction

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:30,960
I hope you guys safe and sound during

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,360
this all for pandemic

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,540
uh my city is still under lockdown the

13
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,600
motivation of this briefing is pretty

14
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,320
simple at first we want to build a

15
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,579
detector for Focus for folk voices and

16
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:49,800
then research the paper some Google

17
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,500
Scholar the results are very

18
00:00:52,500 --> 00:00:55,739
disappointing uh very high is being many

19
00:00:55,739 --> 00:00:58,800
Publications on this topic and almost

20
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,079
all of them are reporting by Reformation

21
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:02,520
performance

22
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,280
the average actually says about 98

23
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:08,600
percent several of them even reached 100

24
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:11,939
it seems that there is nothing we need

25
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:13,500
to do anymore

26
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,080
of course the male Security Guys and

27
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,619
there is no absolutely secure the system

28
00:01:18,619 --> 00:01:21,780
uh then they decide to fund a method to

29
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:24,920
make folk these fake voices bypasses

30
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:29,040
this looks very strong detectors uh the

31
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,140
friendlies are pretty surprising

32
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,900
uh in short uh it looks like all

33
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,540
exciting detectors uh just yeah

34
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:38,460
 impossible for real world

35
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:41,400
environments uh this briefing has two

36
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,780
speakers

37
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:46,560
uh me and my partner Mr Tyrion uh he is

38
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,159
for start uh by the way he is still an

39
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,979
undergraduated students and it has first

40
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:56,759
time to speak as a top tier conference

41
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,200
like black hat

42
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:01,020
uh he's a little nervous and his

43
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:03,299
girlfriend is watching the live your

44
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,479
turn

45
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:12,959
I'm a undergraduate and uh and

46
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:15,959
university is my first time

47
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:19,739
to come here and give my speech

48
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,920
um

49
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,739
now I'm going to

50
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:38,180
give my presentation

51
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,420
um what about

52
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:48,420
foreigners after that we will introduce

53
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:51,599
our method to bypass detectors and so

54
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,819
two will try to save the previously

55
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:57,120
learn cancer evaluation part to prove

56
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,980
our findings

57
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,319
uh now we are going to discuss what is

58
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:03,980
fake wise

59
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:06,840
we have been passed with what is created

60
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:09,780
by machine for example Theory we can

61
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:12,599
tell from state with voice and it is it

62
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:15,000
is not human but now the people is

63
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:18,180
synthesized by AI is able to sound like

64
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:20,640
a real person

65
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,519
um we can see the waste club based crime

66
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:26,599
is already underway

67
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:30,120
before 20th century the early speech

68
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,940
synthesized system is primary and it is

69
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,300
very difficult to simulate human waste

70
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,480
the native method of speech socialize

71
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,900
before 2010 is easy to detain its

72
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,319
feature learn transfer age of AI the AI

73
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,959
centralized speech is a solution nature

74
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,440
it is difficult to detect

75
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,019
air centralized speech is generated by

76
00:03:55,019 --> 00:03:58,379
citizer and underwater the methods are

77
00:03:58,379 --> 00:04:01,319
quite well established human is the hard

78
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,540
to figure out where the speech is a big

79
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,900
order

80
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:08,580
human cannot do it but but maybe a

81
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,439
program can now we are going to

82
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:15,360
investigate the existing detainers

83
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:18,180
uh there are many approaches to the test

84
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,720
page wise uh or existing approaches are

85
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,419
reported were permission performance the

86
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:26,040
computer vision based opportunities

87
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,979
towards ways to convert ways to image

88
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:31,919
and do classification uh three

89
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,000
server-based methods have one year 100

90
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,240
accuracy rate

91
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:42,360
and the other projects also result in

92
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:46,199
compressing performance

93
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:49,919
um but during this mask as we already

94
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,139
watched in the real world without saying

95
00:04:52,139 --> 00:04:55,139
no uh there are problems with the way

96
00:04:55,139 --> 00:04:57,720
there's approaches and they use only on

97
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,060
this stage data sets and uh you don't

98
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:02,340
consider the speaker in relative

99
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,620
features

100
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:07,979
uh here we propose A New Concept called

101
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:10,740
spiritual Humanity features it is a

102
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,419
feature which should not be used to

103
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:16,039
determine human a lot

104
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:20,639
noise different languages they are not

105
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:23,940
related to the speaker

106
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:26,300
with this new concept of speaker

107
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:29,580
emailing features we propose always

108
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:33,900
colonizer called Safety twisting

109
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,860
safety who is in Westland close based on

110
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:40,320
deep learning and speaking Humanity

111
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,720
features we will use we will use this

112
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:45,300
tool to bypass existing detection

113
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,900
approaches

114
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:51,840
in this method uh when large speaker

115
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,199
United features with the existing AI

116
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:57,840
waste Runners uh web Builder 2 are

117
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,180
called speaking many features instructor

118
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:02,460
to get the features we want

119
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:05,460
so there's two will remove the specific

120
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:08,400
frequencies and adjust the value of the

121
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,639
sun then the extracted features will be

122
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:14,639
merged with the AI West corner

123
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,699
uh in West Strong section

124
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:20,400
on the encoder simulator and the watch

125
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,340
holder are already

126
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:25,740
existing methods on a small way and uh

127
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:28,919
Nintendo and to remove the noisy part of

128
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:32,400
the what is generated by the animal coda

129
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,240
in order to reduce features

130
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,180
uh we build a demo based on the

131
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:42,180
recording of Elon Musk using safety

132
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:42,960
position

133
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:45,300
uh now what we are when we will play the

134
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:47,940
original recording

135
00:06:47,940 --> 00:06:49,979
so I mean right now I think one of the

136
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:52,199
most uh Soul destroying things is

137
00:06:52,199 --> 00:06:53,639
traffic

138
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:55,380
um it affects people in every part of

139
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,860
the world uh it it takes away so much of

140
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,740
your life and your

141
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,720
um now I will play the big voice

142
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,380
I will give everyone 10 million dollars

143
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:12,960
in the very United States I think it can

144
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:15,479
follow me uh following me is not enough

145
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:19,800
no way is bypass the state about the

146
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,900
center

147
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:23,940
here's the thing with our sales people

148
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:26,819
you say we are able to perform a waste

149
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:27,900
color attention

150
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,080
and uh existing detectors accounted the

151
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,660
speaker eventually features and the part

152
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:36,840
of the picture later to determine always

153
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,599
affect a lot we can work this patients

154
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:42,240
but we always with special ways

155
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,660
I'm able to distance myself and the

156
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,580
offender targets for money from the

157
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:50,880
Target or reaching dangerous statements

158
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:55,219
is test and the celebrations

159
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,660
the most important step is instruct

160
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:01,199
speaker events for original ways of

161
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,580
human

162
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:05,759
use amplitude time strap and the

163
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,639
frequency to describe or specifics to

164
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,860
describe or specific Android file

165
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:15,300
um with construct a function to set the

166
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:20,280
aptitude to 0 and specific hamstring

167
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,660
uh without it we silence all the voices

168
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,979
below 4 kilohertz

169
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:28,080
understand the speaker in reality

170
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:31,139
features is exist in the west above four

171
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:33,659
kilohertz we are going to strategies as

172
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:36,299
part and the budget with the feet waste

173
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:39,299
to fake it to make it feel real

174
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:42,799
the part of our foreign

175
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,279
we generate images of the wires before

176
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,680
and after was processing we can

177
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,240
generally say the difference between

178
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,600
them uh final image of the words before

179
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,459
processing let's say most of the high

180
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:01,740
amplitudes of human waste are below

181
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,240
three kilohertz

182
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,600
after processing the apple juice below

183
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:12,260
four Channel heads uh become more known

184
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,120
so I'm going to play a recording which

185
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,060
is is distracted from previous demo of

186
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:20,760
Anna mask The Wonder of the recording

187
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,660
may be over low

188
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,500
foreign

189
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,760
this

190
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,240
is

191
00:09:35,899 --> 00:09:38,760
what happened when we remove what is

192
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:39,860
above

193
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,779
formulas well that's what happened when

194
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:45,899
we move voice below 40 headstone on

195
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:48,240
recordings and it's just sounds like

196
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,860
hello is

197
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,740
um well while it equals speaker

198
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:54,839
evaluation so we can merge it with

199
00:09:54,839 --> 00:09:57,420
Statewide without detergent animate and

200
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,120
making it feel real

201
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,220
uh it's very easy to talk about like

202
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,339
complex ways for speaker Humanity

203
00:10:05,339 --> 00:10:07,640
feature instructor and the Western

204
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,680
magnitudes are now available to do to do

205
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,019
this job

206
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:15,240
uh these are the images of the current

207
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,420
voice before and after months no there

208
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:20,580
is a slight difference between them but

209
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:22,740
you see there's no difference makes a

210
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,760
web page was real

211
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,360
um what is the steps above where it's

212
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,480
successfully make an a mask really speak

213
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:35,640
so I will give everyone 10 million

214
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,540
dollars

215
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:40,019
uh under the state of art it has Market

216
00:10:40,019 --> 00:10:42,440
will

217
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,540
uh that's all for something where you

218
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:48,480
say combining speaker Iran his features

219
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,600
and the existing a advice with this

220
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:53,700
orange dog recording so I mean right now

221
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:55,860
I think one of the most uh Soul

222
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:58,200
destroying things is traffic

223
00:10:58,200 --> 00:10:59,940
um it affects people in every part of

224
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:03,420
the world uh it it takes away so much of

225
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,279
your life and your

226
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:09,380
and the way it starts is special

227
00:11:20,459 --> 00:11:23,040
and the way merge it with the turn the

228
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,279
voice the output voice I will give

229
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:29,279
everyone 10 million dollars bypass by

230
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:31,740
twice 10 Hertz

231
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:34,019
uh my school speaker will always pay

232
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:37,940
evaluation part thank you

233
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:42,959
the screenshot

234
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,819
screen sharing we need creations

235
00:11:49,140 --> 00:11:51,980
okay okay okay

236
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:55,500
ah hi guys

237
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,959
uh I will introduced the evaluation part

238
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:01,019
of this briefing uh this briefing is not

239
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:03,200
just a proper

240
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:06,959
so-called novel uh voice column attacker

241
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,300
framework it's also

242
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:12,019
used to rubbish existing existing

243
00:12:12,019 --> 00:12:14,940
detectors they propose four connections

244
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,800
to evaluate this work

245
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,720
uh

246
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,540
rq1 other high creating detection

247
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:23,399
approaches are pretty cool in reward

248
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:27,540
environment rq2 uh the speaker in

249
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:30,000
relative features really affect exciting

250
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,440
approaches

251
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,959
in a word the first two questions are

252
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:37,680
about the effectiveness of uh the

253
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,260
speaker in reality features of a purpose

254
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:44,100
and the other two are for our safe our

255
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,380
safety deep VC

256
00:12:46,380 --> 00:12:49,860
uh just to make clear the Based on data

257
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:51,060
sets

258
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,880
open source open source data sets these

259
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:56,880
are other Works include the English

260
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,940
version The Machine learning and none of

261
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:03,060
them used I included in the publications

262
00:13:03,060 --> 00:13:06,680
of the executing directors

263
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:11,940
first uh I will introduce the

264
00:13:11,940 --> 00:13:14,760
exciting director detectors are

265
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,399
reselected the fourth DeForest last

266
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:20,339
night is the latest specific based

267
00:13:20,339 --> 00:13:24,240
approach we use the the implementation

268
00:13:24,240 --> 00:13:26,040
open sourced by the

269
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:29,519
orange and horses but you know too an

270
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:32,160
angel to end the base approach as the

271
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,160
Baseline for ASV Sports

272
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:39,360
the second the third one is the first

273
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,100
civil base approach on the top

274
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,519
conference in fact I remember is in the

275
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:46,500
cvpr

276
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:49,019
we also we use the implementation open

277
00:13:49,019 --> 00:13:53,100
sources in blackhead USA to own one none

278
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:55,560
the last one is uh

279
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:58,620
it's called The Deep solar we know we

280
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:01,620
cannot find the open source code of this

281
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:03,720
and we tried our best to contact the

282
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:06,360
authors but there's nothing response

283
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,480
here

284
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,240
the first one the first one is the real

285
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,459
world fpr

286
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:16,740
two in the real world environment we

287
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:19,320
know the symbols are unbalanced uh

288
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,600
mostly speech most of the symbols are

289
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,480
the negatives negative

290
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:27,899
therefore the human speeches are much

291
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:31,440
more than a fixed beaches with the spr

292
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,360
is very important for real world

293
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:35,160
development

294
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:38,399
the results of this experiment indicates

295
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:40,740
none of the FPS

296
00:14:40,740 --> 00:14:44,279
are acceptable for real world we can see

297
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:46,939
from the table

298
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:50,220
when we change the data set doesn't

299
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:52,800
change his business

300
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,880
the FDR is extremely high

301
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:59,820
it's more than 19 percentage is

302
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:02,839
impossible for reward

303
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,699
the second answer is accurate too

304
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:13,199
uh we need this experiment to know do

305
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,620
the do the features really really affect

306
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:19,980
executing the detection approaches there

307
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:21,899
are four there are two parts in this

308
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:24,959
experiment uh we come back noise

309
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:27,899
reduction and the focus frequency

310
00:15:27,899 --> 00:15:30,959
removal for targeted voices

311
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:32,880
hey Siri

312
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:37,800
HV will not affect whether it's a fake

313
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:38,699
voice

314
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:41,519
the detection results should not be

315
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:45,120
changed if if these features do not

316
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:48,839
affect the detection

317
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:50,820
but

318
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:54,180
uh in the result after the noising the

319
00:15:54,180 --> 00:15:56,100
detection results are changing and all

320
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:58,620
exist existing approaches are

321
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:01,920
significantly affected by background

322
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,699
noise we can see

323
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:09,899
most of the detectors are performance

324
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:13,380
better perform better than before after

325
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:16,560
the background noise removal it

326
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:18,899
indicates that the noise may have speak

327
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:21,720
voice detection bypassing the detection

328
00:16:21,720 --> 00:16:25,279
of exciting approaches

329
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:33,120
next we need to we try to remove the

330
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:36,000
silence silence the silence before and

331
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,210
after the human voices just the

332
00:16:40,210 --> 00:16:41,100
[Music]

333
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,100
um

334
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:47,220
after the removal of the silences the

335
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:50,279
detection results are also changed so

336
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:53,160
there so they can we can see the silence

337
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:57,680
part also affect the detectors

338
00:16:59,060 --> 00:17:02,940
uh the three all three detectors

339
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:06,119
are infected by the by the silences and

340
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:08,760
they perform better

341
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:11,040
no matter if you perform better or

342
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,160
worser or Worse we can see it will in

343
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:17,220
fact it will affect the results of

344
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,640
detection

345
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:22,079
any indicate

346
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,660
it indicated the speaker being relative

347
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,480
features are indeed accounted by

348
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,520
detection systems as a part of the free

349
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:33,419
director to deter to determine whether a

350
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:36,900
specific symbol is human speech or not

351
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,799
so we can use we can bypass this

352
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:43,620
detection system through the speaker

353
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:46,320
interactive features therefore the

354
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,860
answer to rq2 We Believe is yes

355
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:53,840
we can use them as useful

356
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:59,460
in this in the third evaluation we we

357
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:05,460
use we use a self-builder safe safety PC

358
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,700
to conduct this experiment

359
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,059
Kansas can our system clone The Voice by

360
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:13,919
passing existing the detection

361
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,440
approaches is the key to this

362
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,660
experiment in this experiment we've

363
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:24,960
removed the symbols firstly reported as

364
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,799
positive in the Baseline data set

365
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,220
then for each human recording I'll be

366
00:18:32,220 --> 00:18:34,860
generated four new recordings as a fake

367
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:37,260
recordings of course the first of all we

368
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,539
are not I'm not kidding you the fake The

369
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:41,580
Voice this voice is fake the second one

370
00:18:41,580 --> 00:18:44,280
the weather is very nice today it's the

371
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,840
third one

372
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:47,940
I have sinjios and there's a number of

373
00:18:47,940 --> 00:18:51,059
every Church which had is famous I am in

374
00:18:51,059 --> 00:18:52,860
China

375
00:18:52,860 --> 00:18:56,340
and can you please lend me some money uh

376
00:18:56,340 --> 00:18:58,100
often used

377
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,260
for fragiles

378
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,419
the final one

379
00:19:03,419 --> 00:19:06,080
you need to come to the office tomorrow

380
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,580
just for social engineering of course

381
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,679
the results shows that despicable

382
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,320
recordings generated by hour from work

383
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,860
have much higher negative reach

384
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,760
it means

385
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:26,640
the Sif if we see kind of effectively

386
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:29,460
to save exiting approaches

387
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,220
this

388
00:19:31,220 --> 00:19:35,220
recordings are more human than human

389
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:38,160
we can see from the table that the

390
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,799
differ has reached the more than 100

391
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:44,220
persons we are much better than the

392
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:48,720
Baseline our our negative reach uh it's

393
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,900
a Marshland is much more for much harder

394
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,960
than the Baseline negative release

395
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:55,919
therefore we believe the answer to

396
00:19:55,919 --> 00:19:59,059
question three is yes

397
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:00,919
the first one

398
00:20:00,919 --> 00:20:04,559
we have to answer the question for can

399
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,440
people understand the speeches generated

400
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:12,000
by our framework a victim random or

401
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,100
random sides then the single blend

402
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:15,960
experiment to verify both of the

403
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:20,100
recordings are clear and understandable

404
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,799
in fact we use

405
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:26,280
300 recordings just you can see from my

406
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:28,700
slides

407
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,320
as a result is clear

408
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:38,039
all of them are pretty good I think you

409
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:41,580
have you guys have listened to the demo

410
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:44,580
yeah the exposure the experimenting

411
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:47,940
indicates that there is no almost no

412
00:20:47,940 --> 00:20:50,039
difference between the voice generated

413
00:20:50,039 --> 00:20:54,059
by ourselves and the human voices maybe

414
00:20:54,059 --> 00:20:56,220
believe people can understand how to put

415
00:20:56,220 --> 00:20:58,679
voices of safety policy very well

416
00:20:58,679 --> 00:21:01,200
therefore the answer to question four is

417
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,500
yes

418
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,419
so

419
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:09,539
through the four Corrections uh we have

420
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:14,340
verified the speaker inventing features

421
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,640
um used for in the detection bypassing

422
00:21:17,640 --> 00:21:20,640
and

423
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:24,780
here are some the takeaways from this at

424
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:26,100
first

425
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,980
the species generation and the detection

426
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:32,760
uh we introduce how to generate it and

427
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:35,340
anify the exiting detection approaches

428
00:21:35,340 --> 00:21:38,880
and their problems and the purpose a

429
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,340
normal attack from work which can bypass

430
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:43,020
existing factors

431
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:46,980
the second the difficulties of Defending

432
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:49,500
against these fake voices

433
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,960
this type of framework the colonial

434
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,840
voice can be more human than human

435
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:56,880
and there's also the risk warning for

436
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,580
the blue side exiting Solutions are far

437
00:21:59,580 --> 00:22:03,059
from useful do not put them into your

438
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:04,860
production

439
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:06,840
the fellow

440
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,480
we also published some new data sets for

441
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:12,360
future researches with users and open

442
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:15,539
source some new data sets with high

443
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:17,960
quality

444
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,059
May deeply understand the importance of

445
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:23,880
reproductive reproductibility and all

446
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:26,400
code of these projects of this briefing

447
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,919
are available on GitHub some code

448
00:22:28,919 --> 00:22:33,360
including our respiracy uh from the 14

449
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:36,600
projects you can download them and build

450
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:39,480
by yourself and test this and our data

451
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,880
cells used in this project are also

452
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:45,539
available to the public we have provided

453
00:22:45,539 --> 00:22:48,659
the downloads you can get the gas

454
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,700
therapy because they are P from the

455
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:53,159
Google Drive please know this is a sales

456
00:22:53,159 --> 00:22:56,039
office there'll be a failures about 7.8

457
00:22:56,039 --> 00:23:00,860
gigabits it's it it's pretty big

458
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:04,620
uh here is a dispersion for the data

459
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:05,880
sets

460
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,720
um we have if that is um into the four

461
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,460
Corrections

462
00:23:11,460 --> 00:23:14,039
uh including the

463
00:23:14,039 --> 00:23:17,520
real validation data set from the for

464
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,840
data set and the Chinese version

465
00:23:20,840 --> 00:23:24,419
data set from the magic data so if you

466
00:23:24,419 --> 00:23:26,340
may also

467
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:28,380
give the

468
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:31,440
prostate the pricing day the data sets

469
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,500
uh for example the denoised and the

470
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:36,080
silence removed

471
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,580
and the

472
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:43,760
the second as a third one uh we used

473
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:46,500
a very provided voices generated by

474
00:23:46,500 --> 00:23:50,100
ourselves and the voices should test

475
00:23:50,100 --> 00:23:52,380
exiting detectors

476
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:54,840
that's working for you can just listen

477
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:58,140
to the symbols in this data sites

478
00:23:58,140 --> 00:24:01,320
uh therefore through this setup reviewer

479
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:04,799
can reproduct reproduce my other

480
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:09,780
research and reproduce our experiments

481
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,659
sadly we cannot really detect the fake

482
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:14,820
voice now but maybe we can do it in

483
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:18,120
future in our latest research we have

484
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:22,380
built of fast a fasting based approach

485
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,539
with the speaker in relative features

486
00:24:24,539 --> 00:24:28,860
making the symbols come 100 percent past

487
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:32,280
the existing detectors yes 100 just that

488
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,919
they need to have some time about 10

489
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:39,360
minutes to generate the fuzzy the

490
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,299
fighting symbols

491
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:45,240
uh we will also publish the printed

492
00:24:45,240 --> 00:24:47,460
version very soon besides we hope that

493
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:51,480
in future there will be more new no more

494
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,520
detectors and we are also working on

495
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,240
this to a function away to detect the

496
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:59,940
field work field voice for production

497
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:01,559
environment

498
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:03,659
for the real work

499
00:25:03,659 --> 00:25:06,179
thank you all for listening to this we

500
00:25:06,179 --> 00:25:08,580
are here for questions now uh you all

501
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:10,799
you can also send me an email to discuss

502
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:15,240
with me on this project uh here is my
