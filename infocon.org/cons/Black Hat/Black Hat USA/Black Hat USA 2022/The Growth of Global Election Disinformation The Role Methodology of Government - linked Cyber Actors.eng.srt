2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,720
foreign

3
00:00:10,219 --> 00:00:13,139
I also go by Dr Q because my last name

4
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,360
is a little complicated to pronounce and

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:17,880
I'm here today to discuss with you a

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:20,760
case study that we looked into where we

7
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:22,439
Unmasked A very influential Twitter

8
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,660
account trying to influence elections in

9
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:27,840
another country and how the actor the

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,460
digital actor behind that particular

11
00:00:29,460 --> 00:00:32,159
account was linked to another government

12
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,440
so

13
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:37,140
just a little bit about myself in brief

14
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:39,000
I have about 10 years open source

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,180
intelligence experience so ocent I'm

16
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:43,559
also a professor at Florida

17
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:45,540
International University I teach in

18
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,860
their intelligence fellowship program

19
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:50,180
and I have a PHD in social psychology

20
00:00:50,180 --> 00:00:53,219
I have a public and private sector

21
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:55,860
experience doing ocean work and it all

22
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,079
started as a I started my career as a

23
00:00:58,079 --> 00:00:59,640
social media intelligence analyst in

24
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:02,699
2014 and back then

25
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,420
the problem set was Isis accounts on

26
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,960
social media so I would look at thread

27
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:12,900
actors online and you know that was one

28
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:14,460
of the most

29
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:16,560
influential High impactful digital

30
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,600
campaigns and it caught Everybody by

31
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:20,520
surprise but of course actors learn from

32
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:22,200
each other so it's evolved a lot since

33
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,320
then but that was the first time that we

34
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:27,600
really saw the impact of how important

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:30,960
of the impact was social media activism

36
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:33,240
and information operations

37
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,460
so today's presentation just in brief

38
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,040
I'm going to quickly Define

39
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,360
disinformation it's relevant to our case

40
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:43,020
study the geopolitical setting I'm going

41
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:46,020
to take you all the way to South America

42
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,180
and it's a region that's often

43
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:50,159
overlooked in the news and global news

44
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,860
so it's particularly important for our

45
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,680
case study because this digital actor

46
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,540
was able to operate for long periods of

47
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:58,680
time because

48
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,259
and really there are very few eyes on

49
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:03,899
that area of the world uh how we

50
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:06,360
discovered this account a constant

51
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,479
analysis so the behavior and how we

52
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:12,060
attributed it and yeah and the motive it

53
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,220
revealed motivation obviously and the

54
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:17,160
impact and our our report was published

55
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:21,239
in March 2022 and the digital actors did

56
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:23,340
alter their behavior as well as a result

57
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:25,980
of that so I'll walk you through our

58
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:28,519
story now

59
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:31,500
Okay so disinformation

60
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:33,120
a lot of people confuse it with

61
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:35,400
misinformation and what's important to

62
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:37,440
note about this information is that it

63
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,800
is purposefully put out to mislead the

64
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,019
public it's super disrespectful I hate

65
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:45,540
it I'm sure a lot of people hate it and

66
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:47,519
misinformation is basically the same

67
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,319
thing without the intent just people

68
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:51,420
spreading information that can be

69
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,879
perceived incorrectly or just false

70
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:55,260
information just spreading it without

71
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,060
knowing and then there's Mal information

72
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,280
which is a separate thing but for the

73
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,319
sake of this case study we're going to

74
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:04,140
look at disinformation and I highlighted

75
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:08,879
deliberate and intentional because

76
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,980
you don't know the purpose or intention

77
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:12,840
without knowing the source of your

78
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:15,239
information so

79
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:17,159
um that is super important we often look

80
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:18,900
at this information through the content

81
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,000
that's put out a Content analysis but

82
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,319
that's always

83
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,120
in response to something that's already

84
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,040
occurred so if you really want to come

85
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:28,140
in front of something of an information

86
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:29,819
operation it's important to know your

87
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:33,420
source and it's worth noting for this

88
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:34,980
presentation in particular that

89
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:37,500
disinformation thrives during political

90
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:40,620
unrest I'm sure many of you already know

91
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:42,420
that but it's worth pointing out because

92
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:46,140
Society is vulnerable during these times

93
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:49,019
um and yeah so without so intention once

94
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:50,700
we know the who it's easier to

95
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,200
understand the why

96
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,420
and come in front of something so this

97
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:56,400
is

98
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,000
shaky so this is

99
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,319
a digital

100
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:03,060
um account this is a Twitter account

101
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:05,459
that we came across it's I'm gonna refer

102
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:08,159
to it as to Legos from here on Ford

103
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,280
um it is suspended now from Twitter but

104
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,739
at the time it was able to operate from

105
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:17,820
December 2018 until March 2022 it's a

106
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,339
Spanish-speaking account and you could

107
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,160
see several interesting little

108
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,540
characteristics here uh clovers for

109
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:27,479
Assange is one of the hashtags it uses

110
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:29,580
in its bio so automatically one can

111
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:30,660
assume it's not going to be very

112
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,300
friendly towards us or its allies in

113
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,720
terms of content and it also Associates

114
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,280
itself with the yellow vest movement

115
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,759
that's what chaletos means in Spanish so

116
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,000
it used a movement from Europe basically

117
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:48,600
and tried to Rebrand in around rebranded

118
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:52,800
around their own interests and yeah so

119
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,660
we're gonna talk about this account just

120
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:56,340
that it was worth an introduction up

121
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:58,320
front so really quickly and if you want

122
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,300
more details about the geopolitical

123
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:02,340
situation in Latin America please feel

124
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:04,560
free to ping me after this brief

125
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,580
um but

126
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,460
white Columbia basically is the question

127
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,440
here it is this closest South American

128
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,080
Ally to the United States

129
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,639
um I don't know if many of you have seen

130
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,979
narcos on Netflix but we have a lot of

131
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:19,979
security cooperation with them and to

132
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:21,600
tackle drug

133
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,780
related issues Colombia is one of the

134
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:27,060
main producers of the producer really of

135
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,280
cocaine in the world so it's a very

136
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,979
important issue that we have

137
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:34,020
Partnerships I mean we the United States

138
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:36,120
have Partnerships with Colombia

139
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,680
um and this picture by the way is just

140
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,020
an example of the military both the U.S

141
00:05:40,020 --> 00:05:41,759
and Colombian military doing different

142
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,440
exercises together

143
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,020
and one other thing the United States

144
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:49,020
and Colombia have done besides cooperate

145
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,660
with and security issues is Colombia's

146
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:53,639
basically been on the U.S side when it

147
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:54,800
comes to

148
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,919
political lineage so if the U.S

149
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:01,860
expresses concern about Regional

150
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,919
adversaries like Cuba Venezuela or

151
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:08,400
Nicaragua usually Colombia would Echo

152
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,300
that

153
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:11,520
and I'm going to put in bold every time

154
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,560
Venezuela comes up right when we're

155
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,060
looking at the geopolitical situation

156
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:16,560
because this is what led us to the

157
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,240
hypothesis about who might be behind

158
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,740
this account

159
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,240
so

160
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,039
what of what about this account really

161
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,460
stood out to us well it was tweeting a

162
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:28,500
lot about uh opposition political

163
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:30,840
candidate the leftist candidate for the

164
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,460
Colombian elections that took place this

165
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:34,800
year in May 2022

166
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,720
um and it was in favor of a gentleman

167
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,919
named Gustavo Pedro and he is uh the

168
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:42,120
president electable now he was

169
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,580
inaugurated this week actually and he is

170
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,560
the first leftist president in Colombia

171
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,440
and he has a lot of views about what has

172
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,060
traditionally been foreign policy with

173
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,500
the United States he has his own views

174
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,539
that would alter what has traditionally

175
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,100
been

176
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:58,259
um he's also former Senator former

177
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:00,419
militant with m19 it was a militant

178
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:01,680
group that's no longer active in

179
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,360
Colombia he's friends with the farc

180
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:07,199
another um a regional militant group in

181
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,120
Colombia and that is now a political

182
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,539
party and one key thing to note too is

183
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:15,720
that back in the day he was friends with

184
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:18,000
the late Fidel Castro of Cuba and Hugo

185
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,020
Chavez

186
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,080
Venezuela there we go again

187
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,979
and that is him with Hugo Chavez

188
00:07:25,979 --> 00:07:28,139
so Petro stands towards the US I

189
00:07:28,139 --> 00:07:29,400
mentioned some challenges that would

190
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:32,699
come up from this uh new Administration

191
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:35,400
um challenges meaning that you know we

192
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:37,639
had the United States had a consistent

193
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:40,979
policy with Colombia and now this might

194
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:43,380
alter it a bit so he's critical of U.S

195
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,479
economic sanctions that's been the

196
00:07:45,479 --> 00:07:47,099
foreign policy

197
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,620
Direction in the region he does not

198
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:52,740
favor anti-narcotics agenda a little DEA

199
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:54,660
sorry about that

200
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,220
um that might be a challenge critical of

201
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:00,060
extradition of criminals and

202
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:02,340
key he promotes the rebuilding of

203
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,539
diplomatic relations between the U.S and

204
00:08:05,539 --> 00:08:08,460
Venezuela there are crippling economic

205
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,560
sanctions on Venezuela right now

206
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,919
so who else wins if Petro wins

207
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,419
Venezuela

208
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:19,259
this is just a quick recap of the region

209
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:21,720
right now in terms of its leadership so

210
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,060
the majority of the region is leftist

211
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,780
leaning which is you know fine but Latin

212
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,520
America does have this funny thing it

213
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,560
does that it's like a windshield wiper

214
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,059
it goes really really left and then next

215
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:34,679
time it goes really really sap uh right

216
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,599
and then it just keeps doing this well

217
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,279
Colombia hasn't really been victim to

218
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:40,799
that windshield wiper situation and

219
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:43,200
either have the air the states

220
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,700
um that think tanks consider to be

221
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:46,860
leftist dictatorships so this is the

222
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,360
first time we really see Colombia be

223
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:51,540
involved in this phenomenon

224
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:53,399
so really quick I'm not going to go into

225
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:55,140
details is basically what I'm going to

226
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,519
walk you through

227
00:08:56,519 --> 00:09:00,120
um we were working on a project looking

228
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,279
at human rights violations on a global

229
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:05,700
scale I'm a Spanish speaker so uh we my

230
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,820
team was looking at Latin America and we

231
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:11,820
you know saw that there was a lot of uh

232
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:14,040
a lot of social media activity around

233
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:17,760
Columbia protests in May 2021 and this

234
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,220
mysterious account with no identifiable

235
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:21,440
information

236
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:24,660
was really influential in the

237
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:26,160
discussions but it didn't say whether it

238
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,560
was in Colombia where it was who it is

239
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,040
it was just inauthentic Behavior to the

240
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:32,720
max

241
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,180
it echoed also U.S adversaries so I mean

242
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:38,820
of Clover's first sonj one would it's

243
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,399
not surprising so and these include Uh

244
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:43,380
Russian state-sponsored media Iranian

245
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,380
state-sponsored media um Cuban and

246
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:48,000
Venezuela

247
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,019
so

248
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:51,300
our hypothesis was that the Venezuelan

249
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,399
government is attempting to influence

250
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,860
Perceptions in Colombia with the goal of

251
00:09:55,860 --> 00:09:57,839
achieving political change in getting

252
00:09:57,839 --> 00:09:59,820
Petro elected

253
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:02,220
and the result of our research was that

254
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:05,459
the Venezuelan government likely used a

255
00:10:05,459 --> 00:10:07,080
third-party firm

256
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,540
to conduct and engage in IO to include

257
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:13,040
disinformation to help get Petro elected

258
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,800
why we believe is because it helps

259
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,700
soften U.S foreign policy towards it

260
00:10:20,700 --> 00:10:22,920
so this is the network that we're going

261
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,839
to look at today

262
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:26,580
um I'm going to walk you through this

263
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,380
and this is a very simplified there are

264
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:30,120
a lot more actors here but pretend this

265
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:31,800
is like a mall directory and you are

266
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,899
here so we already covered chaleko

267
00:10:33,899 --> 00:10:37,019
samaru and his little sub networks and

268
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:38,880
yeah let's go

269
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,040
on with the show here

270
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,380
um Discovery so we were looking at these

271
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:45,300
human rights violations and all of a

272
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,459
sudden we see this this account we did a

273
00:10:47,459 --> 00:10:49,560
Content analysis on this account and we

274
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,560
saw how many other Twitter accounts were

275
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:55,260
retweeting telecos and found that it

276
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:59,760
reached at least 8 000 retweets within

277
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,880
two days during anti-government protests

278
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:05,760
in Colombia and these are just Twitter

279
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,079
accounts that actually have a

280
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:09,480
geolocation or some sort of

281
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,160
geo-reference to it which is not the

282
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,079
majority of Twitter users so one can

283
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:16,620
imagine the true numbers of this right

284
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:18,480
um and here's an example of how it was

285
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,760
actually utilizing trending hashtags

286
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,680
related to the protests

287
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,380
to influence the narrative it called the

288
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,940
administration at the time a narco

289
00:11:26,940 --> 00:11:30,720
dictatorship and it used SOS uh Colombia

290
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,940
they're killing us that was very common

291
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:37,620
among protesters and digital activists

292
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:40,740
so again just going over quickly this

293
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,839
account up front we see

294
00:11:42,839 --> 00:11:45,660
it's uh labels itself as a community it

295
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,820
has a high follower following

296
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,940
um created in December 2018 that's a

297
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:54,720
long time ago in social media world so

298
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:56,579
there was no identifiable information

299
00:11:56,579 --> 00:11:58,800
large following interacted with the

300
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,959
community so it was not a bot which

301
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,060
means there was true effort behind it

302
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:05,279
okay because it takes a lot more for a

303
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,959
person and operator to be behind an

304
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:08,940
account than to automate posts and just

305
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:11,760
retweet it went out of its way to

306
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,200
interact with the community and it

307
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,240
echoed Venezuelan I didn't put it in

308
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,660
bold my bad but Venezuelan and Allied

309
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,459
state-sponsored news and it interacted

310
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:22,079
with suspicious accounts which I'll walk

311
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:24,540
you through active 22 hours a day on

312
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:25,860
average and we believe that's because

313
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:27,660
there were several operators behind this

314
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,880
account because that's not humanly

315
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,320
possible unless

316
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,600
it's really not and then one interesting

317
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:36,720
thing is that it posted true half true

318
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:40,140
and false information and that's super

319
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:42,240
important to point out because if you

320
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,399
post even a small percentage of false

321
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:45,959
information but the majority is true

322
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:48,000
that means you gain trust from your

323
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,740
audience and when you put out that false

324
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,940
information they will believe you

325
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,500
because you've established that

326
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:55,200
relationship and that trust

327
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,000
um and then another key thing was that

328
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:59,880
it adopted domestic domestic hashtags in

329
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,519
Target countries in Colombia one thing I

330
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:03,899
did not mention earlier that is worth

331
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:05,940
noting I'm using Columbia as a case

332
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,620
study but this account

333
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,600
basically Whenever there was political

334
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:11,399
unrest in the region it would focus on

335
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:14,660
that and try to get the um leftist

336
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,220
politician elected when and there were a

337
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:19,019
lot of since 2018 there have been

338
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:20,940
several political um presidential

339
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:22,920
elections in the region and we all saw

340
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:26,040
how that looked a few slides ago so it's

341
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:28,980
it's been very influential in framing

342
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,860
narratives so to the fun stuff

343
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:33,839
disinformation here quickly is an

344
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:38,399
example of a fake post so it actually

345
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,380
said there was that okay so there was a

346
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:41,579
car bomb that occurred on a military

347
00:13:41,579 --> 00:13:43,380
base in the border of Colombia and

348
00:13:43,380 --> 00:13:46,860
Venezuela and this car bomb did occur

349
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:49,620
but this account said that it did not

350
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:52,139
occur and it also if you see right there

351
00:13:52,139 --> 00:13:54,779
it mentioned Russia's Spanish language

352
00:13:54,779 --> 00:13:56,360
news outlet

353
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,760
and Gustavo Petro in order to get that

354
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:02,639
narrative out another example of fake

355
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,740
information is that during the

356
00:14:04,740 --> 00:14:08,160
anti-government protests the anti-riot

357
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,260
police in Colombia took out their tank

358
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:12,959
it said it ran over protesters

359
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:14,820
um Associated Press looked into this and

360
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,279
so did other and others and found that

361
00:14:17,279 --> 00:14:18,839
that what did not occur that was not

362
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:20,220
true

363
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:23,339
okay and now that was an example of the

364
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:24,360
fake

365
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,940
stuff now now it's meddling in the

366
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:28,980
actual elections and the political

367
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,560
process in Colombia

368
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:36,000
so Gustavo Petro had wanted uh he asked

369
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,000
supporters to spread information about 5

370
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,980
million votes in order to get Congress

371
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:43,980
to be in favor of of his political

372
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:46,980
you know policies just like Congress

373
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:49,980
here you want the majority

374
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:52,560
so to Legos of course it's like yes

375
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:56,220
Petra we got you and they just they made

376
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,199
a hashtag or they participated in the

377
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:00,959
hashtag 5 million votes and then at

378
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,959
mentioned several Twitter accounts that

379
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:06,899
had characteristics that were basically

380
00:15:06,899 --> 00:15:09,300
the same

381
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:12,060
um and including the creation date it

382
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:14,339
and certain names like out here you'll

383
00:15:14,339 --> 00:15:16,380
see one that says Ortega Ortega's the

384
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:17,660
last name of the Nicaraguan president

385
00:15:17,660 --> 00:15:20,519
who is considered a dictator

386
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,639
and uh the Ortega team so there you go

387
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:26,639
and we looked at this in November 2021

388
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:27,839
we're like oh that's interesting it's

389
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:29,639
using the domestic hashtags in Colombia

390
00:15:29,639 --> 00:15:31,019
in order to get Congress to change

391
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:33,120
that's important but then we looked

392
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,160
again in February 2022 and all these

393
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:37,800
accounts were suspended for inauthentic

394
00:15:37,800 --> 00:15:41,100
Behavior so it knowingly asked its

395
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,959
audience its followers to follow these

396
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,260
inauthentic accounts which again

397
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,779
not not nice not nice for your audience

398
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:50,000
to fool them

399
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:51,779
and I mentioned different

400
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:52,980
characteristics one of those

401
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:55,079
characteristics where so true Petro

402
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,120
supporters use so Petro put out

403
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:59,040
something about the economy of a tweet

404
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,100
and he mentioned avocado and bees so

405
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,260
supporters started using those emojis in

406
00:16:04,260 --> 00:16:06,540
their profiles and so did the

407
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:09,000
inauthentic accounts so here is the

408
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,940
example of that and here are true

409
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,600
supporters

410
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,860
also using

411
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,860
the avocado and the Emojis so they were

412
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:22,440
trying to look authentic but they were

413
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,480
not and there were other characteristics

414
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,839
that I can elaborate on that

415
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,760
led us to believe these were inauthentic

416
00:16:29,760 --> 00:16:32,160
as well so now this other part of the

417
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,420
network this

418
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:36,660
this account engaged with retweeted at

419
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:39,000
mentioned again Venezuelan State News

420
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,100
Russian State News Iranian state news

421
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,500
and Cuba state news and here are some

422
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,199
examples of of that so all the way on

423
00:16:46,199 --> 00:16:48,899
the left you'll see redfish and RT

424
00:16:48,899 --> 00:16:51,480
mentioned and then even as recent as

425
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:54,000
June the president of Venezuela Nicholas

426
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,240
Maduro went to Iran and went to his band

427
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,860
TV facilities that's your Spanish

428
00:16:58,860 --> 00:17:01,019
language news Outlet

429
00:17:01,019 --> 00:17:05,040
um and on top of all that RT in

430
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,020
Venezuela do have partnership media

431
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:08,760
Partnerships so it makes sense that they

432
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,559
would Echo this their perspective on the

433
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,559
mat on matters of global issues

434
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:16,079
so now to the really fun part and this

435
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,240
was our favorite part was finding out

436
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,020
who was behind this account okay

437
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:23,819
rule number one follow the clues so we

438
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:28,140
did we looked at chaleko's telegram

439
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:30,860
channel that it links right in its bio

440
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:33,660
and it led us to the telegram channel so

441
00:17:33,660 --> 00:17:36,179
we were looking around and saw that an

442
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:41,640
entity named digital was the admin

443
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:44,580
and ralito digital also mentioned

444
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:47,520
somebody or reposts somebody's whose

445
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,460
screen name was raid Noor so we love

446
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,520
names so we went with it and

447
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:56,340
um turns out was suspended from Twitter

448
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,679
twice and

449
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:01,260
there's also Venezuela listed so check

450
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:03,360
mark number one now we can say that this

451
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,580
account is likely linked to an entity in

452
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:09,179
Venezuela and it said this is archive

453
00:18:09,179 --> 00:18:11,360
Wayback machine gave us this information

454
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,799
political marketing so political

455
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:16,080
marketing is using commercial marketing

456
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,820
techniques to

457
00:18:17,820 --> 00:18:20,880
promote a candidate or an idea is and

458
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:24,299
gain the trust of the audience or it's

459
00:18:24,299 --> 00:18:27,600
its target audience and you know if

460
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,919
you're doing political marketing I would

461
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:30,539
assume the news you're spreading might

462
00:18:30,539 --> 00:18:33,059
not be quite objective

463
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:34,860
um so there you go and it also

464
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:36,080
references

465
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:39,179
in the bio so there we go check mark

466
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:41,460
number two it made a reference to our to

467
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,320
our account of Interest

468
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:46,200

469
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,460

471
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:58,879

504
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:26,700
um

505
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:29,820
digital communication ve its CEO is

506
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:31,620
Jason Russell

507
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,679
who is Jason

508
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,080
the CEO and digital uh communication

509
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:39,720
digital VA the Strategic and intelligent

510
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:42,600
digital marketing again marketing

511
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,700
um and he's also interestingly the

512
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,799
former director of social media for

513
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:49,500
Venezuela's Ministry of communications

514
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:52,740
and information so the mincy and he

515
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:56,880
retired in 2016 but through clever oh

516
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,760
sent work and third-party tools we found

517
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,620
that he still he has an active

518
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,179
government email with the National

519
00:21:03,179 --> 00:21:04,860
Institute for socialist training and

520
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,179
education

521
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:08,640
still that is Jason

522
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,559
so Jason also has bad opsec

523
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:15,419
and he has several social media accounts

524
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:17,700
this is his personal Twitter account and

525
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,740
you'll see that its followers are really

526
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:21,539
high level officials in the Venezuelan

527
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:23,780
government

528
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,480
they they've been around since Hugo

529
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,760
Chavez time so

530
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:31,919
very interesting to see them being

531
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:34,500
actual followers because just some

532
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,900
random business owner that was a

533
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,640
government worker but I guess that could

534
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,460
be so again that necessarily wasn't a it

535
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,020
was a strong connection but we wanted

536
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:45,600
more and we got that

537
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,720
and our report didn't cover this

538
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:51,659
but when I went back to prepare for this

539
00:21:51,659 --> 00:21:55,860
presentation I saw that um

540
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:59,280
there you know the Facebook page that

541
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,260
thank you Facebook for the page

542
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,120
transparency it's super important for

543
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,080
people to understand where they're

544
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:05,580
getting their information from but it

545
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,740
also helps us ocean analysts find more

546
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,679
information and follow Clues so this

547
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:12,539
page was actually created this is a

548
00:22:12,539 --> 00:22:16,140
company that Jason is CEO of in 2009

549
00:22:16,140 --> 00:22:18,840
that was a very long time ago even

550
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:21,240
though it doesn't feel like it

551
00:22:21,240 --> 00:22:23,820
um and it's the name of the page at the

552
00:22:23,820 --> 00:22:27,299
time was periodico patriagrande which

553
00:22:27,299 --> 00:22:30,960
translates to Great Homeland newspaper

554
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:33,780
and it did have a

555
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:37,500
an address uh I'm sorry a URL and its

556
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:40,500
URL was registered by the mincy

557
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:44,159
so it paid for that for it's its website

558
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:46,580
so we already know that

559
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49,860
now its website is linked to the mincy

560
00:22:49,860 --> 00:22:53,039
and when you do open source research on

561
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:57,000
the newspaper itself it's actually

562
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,860
according to

563
00:22:58,860 --> 00:23:01,380
you know different news sources uh it

564
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:04,860
was a university-led media effort to

565
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:07,080
counter U.S narratives on global issues

566
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,020
and it even included contributors with

567
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,400
this again thank you way back machine

568
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:14,220
for this because the website

569
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,500
um wasn't working well

570
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:18,720
um this contributors were Fidel Castro

571
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,260
and Hugo Chavez when you have presidents

572
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:24,720
contributing to a university effort like

573
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,059
a media effort that's really weird so

574
00:23:27,059 --> 00:23:28,440
here we find the connection to the

575
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,980
actual government

576
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:34,760
there we go that's Nicolas

577
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,600
so what happens

578
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,000
Petro was elected as Colombia's next

579
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,580
president and I'm not saying chalecos is

580
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:46,559
should take all the credit for that but

581
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:48,600
chalekos was certainly a factor in

582
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,220
framing the narrative in the country we

583
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:53,059
already saw that it did infiltrate

584
00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:56,159
discussions coming out of Colombia on

585
00:23:56,159 --> 00:24:00,120
politically sensitive topics so uh

586
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,320
yeah congratulations

587
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:06,720
and then two weeks later

588
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:08,400
so two weeks later I don't I don't know

589
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,260
if many of you know this but after he

590
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:13,140
won this was announced um that there was

591
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:14,520
going to be war games in the Western

592
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,159
Hemisphere hosted in Venezuela with

593
00:24:17,159 --> 00:24:21,120
Iranian Chinese and Russian military

594
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:24,780
presence so normally because Venezuela

595
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:26,159
and Colombia do share a border their

596
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,620
neighbors a Colombian Administration

597
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:32,159
that is more on the you know on the same

598
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,900
level ideologically as a United States

599
00:24:33,900 --> 00:24:36,600
which show con would Express concern

600
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,700
over this it's less likely with Petro as

601
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:40,980
president now and this is the first time

602
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:42,299
these war games are hosted in the

603
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:44,340
Western Hemisphere it's normally

604
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,620
um in Eastern Europe

605
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,299
there we are

606
00:24:48,299 --> 00:24:50,640
oh and this is a

607
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:54,260
Cuban president in the bottom left

608
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,240
so post-report behaviors our publication

609
00:24:57,240 --> 00:25:01,620
published in March 2022 at this account

610
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:04,500
was suspended in March 2022 but two

611
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,840
weeks before our account

612
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,299
um our report went out it wasn't our

613
00:25:09,299 --> 00:25:12,840
doing by the way so Twitter finally uh

614
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:15,059
took it down suspended the account after

615
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:17,280
it started posting

616
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,679
disinformation about Ukraine and echoing

617
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,720
Russia's perspective on the matter

618
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:24,120
so

619
00:25:24,120 --> 00:25:27,480
at least it was taken down but again it

620
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:31,799
was able to operate since 2018. so

621
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:33,000
um okay

622
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,980
oops

623
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:37,440
one moment so some characteristics we

624
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:40,200
noticed it was less active way less

625
00:25:40,200 --> 00:25:41,880
active it also pinned the telegram

626
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:44,400
Channel up to the top of its profile so

627
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,620
where it's more it more freely able to

628
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:52,020
share news that is inaccurate and and so

629
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,659
yeah I mean just the Isis did this too

630
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:56,820
by the way once uh social media platform

631
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:58,200
started taking down their accounts

632
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,179
they're like hey find us on this

633
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:02,460
encrypted platform instead here you go

634
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,740
um follow the follow the

635
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:05,940
um path

636
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:09,419
and now though it's labeled as media

637
00:26:09,419 --> 00:26:11,520
this is a new account it kept the brand

638
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:13,380
by the way challenge Amar dropped a

639
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:14,700
couple letters but people could still

640
00:26:14,700 --> 00:26:17,340
find it easy if they followed it before

641
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,840
um it conducts

642
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:22,200
Media news but its operators do

643
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:24,419
political marketing

644
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:26,700
it's it's not medium at least it's it

645
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,500
could be but it's not objective but

646
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,360
people again it will gain the trust of

647
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:32,220
the people and perceive it as authentic

648
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,779
Media news

649
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:37,140
so in the telegram channel uh the actors

650
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:40,260
did acknowledge our research twice

651
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:43,559
um so on Twitter uh it posted it said um

652
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:46,200
this is you know they talk about us even

653
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,700
when they suspend us they were laughing

654
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:50,039
about it and then in May again they

655
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:51,600
actually posted our report to their

656
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:52,980
telegram Channel

657
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:56,220
which is great exposure and

658
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:56,940
um

659
00:26:56,940 --> 00:26:59,400
they uh they think we were responsible

660
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,039
or ralito and his team thinks we're

661
00:27:02,039 --> 00:27:04,260
responsible for their suspension when in

662
00:27:04,260 --> 00:27:05,640
fact they dug their own hole once they

663
00:27:05,640 --> 00:27:08,600
said the word Ukraine

664
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,260
and uh cyberscoop did cover our story

665
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,400
back

666
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,740
um around that time and thankfully it

667
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,179
did make its rounds with investigative

668
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:20,100
journalists in the region so we did get

669
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,860
exposure but down in South America so

670
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:24,120
it's really important for people to

671
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,500
understand what they're reading and who

672
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:27,059
why they're you know the source of their

673
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:29,520
information so at least we appreciate

674
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:30,419
that

675
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:32,940
so some general key takeaways do not

676
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,360
trust sources you do not know

677
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,919
sources of information reveal motives

678
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,140
and it'll help you come in front of

679
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:42,299
information operations instead of being

680
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:44,120
responsive once it's already occurred

681
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:48,120
digital actors engaged in IO adapt again

682
00:27:48,120 --> 00:27:50,340
you saw a Twitter suspended it but now

683
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,200
it pinned its telegram channel to the

684
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,059
top so people can just follow it and

685
00:27:54,059 --> 00:27:56,100
read all the craziness that happens in

686
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:58,140
that telegram Channel

687
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,580
um and next time it could be different

688
00:27:59,580 --> 00:28:01,679
too and

689
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:04,020
we kept seeing the word marketing and

690
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,419
this is political marketing okay so

691
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:08,520
there is a request that comes in from an

692
00:28:08,520 --> 00:28:10,520
entity Venezuelan government We Believe

693
00:28:10,520 --> 00:28:13,380
research is conducted

694
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,700
um the planning takes place the

695
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:18,360
operation review and then a new request

696
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,539
um and again content is important but it

697
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:23,520
should not be the only thing you look at

698
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:25,380
when looking at disinformation because

699
00:28:25,380 --> 00:28:28,080
guess what academics are

700
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,059
studying how people fact check their

701
00:28:30,059 --> 00:28:32,340
information and that can get into the

702
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,960
wrong hands and further manipulate

703
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:35,159
everything

704
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:37,620
what do I mean here's an example of that

705
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:41,340
so this uh this is a Russian study on

706
00:28:41,340 --> 00:28:43,320
how people check information this is on

707
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,000
a Russian population

708
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:46,740
um but they do recommend that people who

709
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,240
research this further

710
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:50,460
again not necessarily malicious but it

711
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:52,620
could be used for malicious reasons in

712
00:28:52,620 --> 00:28:54,539
the future the information the findings

713
00:28:54,539 --> 00:28:56,159
that come from this

714
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,100
so oh sync key takeaways be suspicious

715
00:28:59,100 --> 00:29:01,020
of accounts with no identifiable info

716
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:05,100
follow the clues and historic data often

717
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:07,020
provides really good leads but most

718
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,760
importantly the last two points which

719
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:11,820
are not often discussed we have complete

720
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,919
political neutrality no matter what our

721
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,740
beliefs was because otherwise our biases

722
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:18,120
would probably influence the direction

723
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:20,279
our investigation would take so we just

724
00:29:20,279 --> 00:29:22,380
let the research guide the research and

725
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:24,000
it's important to do that as an ocean

726
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:26,460
analyst as well in general and then be

727
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:29,640
supportive of your team as an analyst we

728
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:32,279
come across a lot of disturbing content

729
00:29:32,279 --> 00:29:34,140
and it's important for teammates to be

730
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:36,299
there for one another be and get the

731
00:29:36,299 --> 00:29:38,880
help if they might need it so with that

732
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,860
I'll finish my brief and thank you so

733
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,730
much for your time and for coming today

734
