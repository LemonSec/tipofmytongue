[Music]

2
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,660
before we get into a little bit about

3
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,820
ourselves we'd like to First note that

4
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:14,780
what we talk about here today is uh not

5
00:00:14,780 --> 00:00:16,980
affiliated with all of our Affiliated

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:19,740
organizations and all the content today

7
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:22,800
is just from me and Tara

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,779
all right

9
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:27,840
so a little introduction about me I

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:29,699
graduated from Johns Hopkins University

11
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:31,439
in Baltimore

12
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,680
in 2020 right into the pandemic with a

13
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:36,300
bachelors in East Asian studies

14
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:39,000
economics and international studies in a

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:40,860
minor in history

16
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,660
um when I graduated I thought I really

17
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,219
thought I was going to go into foreign

18
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:45,660
policy and I spent a year brought in

19
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:48,239
China so China was my focus

20
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:49,980
um in the pandemic I started my Master's

21
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,660
in public policy at the Harvard Kennedy

22
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:52,559
School

23
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,340
and I got I had some requirements to

24
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,260
take care of my first year and I took a

25
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,899
class with someone you might know Bruce

26
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:01,940
Dyer

27
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:04,099
foreign

28
00:01:04,099 --> 00:01:07,860
his talents are not as well in Virtual

29
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:10,260
for the virtual space so I went back and

30
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:12,240
T8 for him the following year and had

31
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:14,760
the joy of being with him in person he

32
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:16,439
brought toys to teach everyone about the

33
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,960
dangers of bluetooth enabled devices I

34
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,900
would love to tell that story later

35
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:24,000
and that summer I needed an internship

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,920
and I happened to apply for the Belfort

37
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,360
Center research assistantship which is

38
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,000
where I met Rob kanaki who is uh heading

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,960
the project and the lovely Tara

40
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:35,880
um I am passionate about Dunkin Donuts

41
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,700
but I'm not here to say it's good coffee

42
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:40,920
no one says that Dunkin Donuts is a

43
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:43,799
lifestyle and I will die on this hill

44
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:46,020
uh in my free time I love knitting and I

45
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:48,780
love to travel very cool I would like

46
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,579
before I introduce myself to tell you

47
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:52,799
all that this is not just Victoria's

48
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,320
first black hat talk it's not just her

49
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,840
first cyber security talk it's her first

50
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,520
talk ever

51
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,640
so you can't go anywhere but down from

52
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,860
here honestly this is amazing so

53
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,320
congratulations to Victoria for one hell

54
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:09,720
of a debut already hello my name is Tara

55
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:11,160
wheeler it's a pleasure to be here with

56
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:12,840
you all this afternoon

57
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:15,480
um I am CEO of Red Queen Dynamics say

58
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,860
compliance orchestration and security

59
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:18,660
education firm

60
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:20,760
um I'm a Fulbright scholar for the US

61
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,940
and UK in cyber security and that is of

62
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:25,560
course at Harvard Belfort Center where I

63
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,720
met Victoria and began working on the

64
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,580
aviation Lessons Learned project with

65
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,060
Rob kanaki and Adam showstack so I had a

66
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,800
great chance to get to uh to know

67
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,680
Victoria work on this project and I

68
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,360
guess the reason I'm here and the reason

69
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,400
I love all of this especially risk

70
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:43,440
management is I'm both a poker player

71
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,319
and a pilot so this really hits home for

72
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:47,940
me this this question this concept of

73
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:51,239
how we manage risk in in organizations

74
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:53,819
and I love knowing this I'm a giant risk

75
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:55,680
nerd I guess for some reason or another

76
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,920
so um what does really bring us kind of

77
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,080
all together here here today well the

78
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:02,940
question really is why are cyber

79
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:05,580
incidents like plane crashes what I'd

80
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,739
love to do is tell you a little bit

81
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:09,300
about the history of this project and

82
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,580
turn it over to Victoria to explain more

83
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:13,260
about what we're doing today

84
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,860
so for the last 30 or 40 years we've

85
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:20,159
been using the analogy of the NTSB as a

86
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:22,379
great way to describe how an

87
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,360
investigation should yield a shared

88
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,159
history of an incident a shared

89
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,560
Narrative of it right one of the

90
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,940
challenges that we face in cyber

91
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,440
security is that we don't share history

92
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,959
we don't produce sort of an

93
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:35,519
industry-wide description of what

94
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,860
happened during an incident and use that

95
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:40,560
for future Lessons Learned and for

96
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,720
future prevention so

97
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,440
when Rob and Adam came together to uh to

98
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,120
create this project they interviewed and

99
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:49,980
then we interviewed over a hundred

100
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,319
different experts in the area of how to

101
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,080
take Aviation lessons and the process of

102
00:03:55,080 --> 00:03:57,599
doing an investigation at the NTSB and

103
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,980
began asking what that would look like

104
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,920
in cyber security in November of last

105
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,019
year we released the learning from cyber

106
00:04:04,019 --> 00:04:07,620
incidents report which is over 100 Pages

107
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,540
we definitely encourage you to not read

108
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,180
it this second but certainly soon

109
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:13,920
uh and learn a little bit more about

110
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,840
what people think about how we can build

111
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,820
a shared narrative in cyber security

112
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:20,040
that takes those lessons from an

113
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:21,720
industry that does it really really well

114
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:24,120
when there's a plane crash we all pretty

115
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,800
much understand why pretty quickly and

116
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,240
then the next year some new regulations

117
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,100
come out that all Pilots have to deal

118
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:30,720
with well

119
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,940
over the course of doing this project we

120
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,340
realized it wasn't just that we were

121
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,220
constantly facing Perpetual threats and

122
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:39,900
attacks that people hadn't really

123
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:42,240
figured out how to repeat and improve

124
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,699
processes for prevention for we started

125
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:47,400
to realize that

126
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:48,840
well

127
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,660
in cyber security this challenge of

128
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,520
trying to keep information secret of

129
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,699
trying to keep it close uh meant that we

130
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:58,620
were perpetually fighting this uphill

131
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:01,080
battle to get information disseminated

132
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,820
to the industry into the community about

133
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,160
how something happened and what we could

134
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,800
do in future that wasn't just limited to

135
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,840
some contractor failed to update the

136
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,759
struts box and that's how Equifax

137
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,860
happened right or somebody didn't push

138
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:15,840
the SMB updates and that's how wannacry

139
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,060
happened and so we wanted to ask

140
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:21,600
ourselves why is cyber investigation and

141
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,060
the production of those reports not like

142
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,560
plane crashes

143
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,900
well we don't maintain that shared

144
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:30,600
history but also I think it's really

145
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,880
important to look at how the aviation

146
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,000
industry investigates and understands

147
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,160
incidents and what they do to prevent

148
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,900
things in future now one of the reasons

149
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:42,720
I like Victoria is

150
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,880
she has read

151
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,460
every single document on the Max on the

152
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,400
737 Max crashes and every single

153
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,900
investigative report that was produced

154
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:54,600
by the NTSB and the FAA

155
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,199
so report nerd would you like to tell us

156
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:01,500
a little bit more about why and how the

157
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:03,660
F the NTSB creates these kinds of

158
00:06:03,660 --> 00:06:04,919
reports and what we could learn from

159
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:07,680
them sure I'll take mercy on you all and

160
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,080
not drag you through the black hole I

161
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:12,360
went into researching this but I did

162
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:13,979
really enjoy myself

163
00:06:13,979 --> 00:06:16,020
um so happy to chat more if anyone is

164
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,600
also interested in these kinds of things

165
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,360
um but so a really great way to look at

166
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,800
the difference that we have right now

167
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,240
for the streamlined approach that the

168
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,419
NTSB takes to Aviation incidents and the

169
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:28,919
kind of haphazard approach we still

170
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:31,080
haven't developed for cyber security is

171
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,300
to look at the Boeing 737 Max and how

172
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:37,440
the NTSB handled that so in 2018 The

173
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,840
Lion Air flight first crashed into the

174
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,380
uh Java sea after departing from Jakarta

175
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:46,259
the recordings of the data tell us that

176
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:49,500
over the course of the short flight the

177
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:51,419
angle of attack sensors on the left and

178
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:53,100
the right side of the plane were

179
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,319
reporting different measurements and

180
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:57,419
that forced the nose of the plane it

181
00:06:57,419 --> 00:06:59,039
triggered the MCAT system which forced

182
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,419
the nose of the plane to go down and

183
00:07:00,419 --> 00:07:02,460
force the plane into a dive the pilots

184
00:07:02,460 --> 00:07:05,039
repeatedly counteracted the MCAT system

185
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,660
to take control of the plane and bring

186
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:08,819
the nose back up but we're after doing

187
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:10,680
it successfully multiple times failed

188
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:12,660
and the plane crashed the same thing

189
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,000
happened in the Ethiopia flight where

190
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,220
after takeoff the nodes of the plane dip

191
00:07:17,220 --> 00:07:20,060
too far down after the miscommunic

192
00:07:20,060 --> 00:07:22,259
miscalculation of the angle of attack

193
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:24,240
from the left and right sensors the

194
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,800
pallets tried to counteract it multiple

195
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,900
times and finally failed and the plane

196
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,199
crashed the FAA grounded the flight and

197
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,680
the Indonesian and Ethiopian

198
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,199
uh Transportation agencies connect their

199
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,940
own reports because it was done in these

200
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:40,440
incidents happen internationally and the

201
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,539
NTSU was in a supporting role but the

202
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:45,000
ntsb's final investigative report is

203
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,580
really important here because it went

204
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:49,319
into not only the details of the

205
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:51,120
incidents themselves but Boeing's

206
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,460
failure to account for how the MCAS

207
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:55,680
system would interact with other alerts

208
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,479
going on in the cockpit and have those

209
00:07:57,479 --> 00:07:59,400
alerts would distract pilots and keep

210
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,080
them from responding as building had

211
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:04,319
expected them to and fall to the FAA for

212
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,539
failing to note The Faults and Boeing's

213
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:08,220
initial assumptions in those in those

214
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:09,660
safety procedures

215
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,580
trying and failing to do the exact same

216
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,840
thing again and again during the middle

217
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,099
of an incident it's starting to sound

218
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:15,599
very familiar but there's a difference

219
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,300
here between how we handled those

220
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,039
incidents in cyber security and how they

221
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:22,440
began to handle it at the uh at NTSB and

222
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,780
FAA so

223
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,479
we've been handling cyber incidents well

224
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:29,160
by generating a whole lot of reports

225
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:31,199
basically one of the challenges we have

226
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,880
is that we've gone from having

227
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,219
government governmental reports to

228
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:36,899
having Private Industry having think

229
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:38,219
tanks generate this kind of information

230
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:40,679
as well Sentinel one

231
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,659
um the it's it's a laundry list of the

232
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:43,620
folks that are here at this conference

233
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:45,240
right these are people providing good

234
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,339
information to the industry but there's

235
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:49,080
a lack of coordination over all

236
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:51,300
agreement all the time about what caused

237
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:54,060
and creates these kinds of incidents so

238
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:55,560
then we start getting additional

239
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,660
committees involved with it how select

240
00:08:57,660 --> 00:08:59,459
uh or Senate select intelligence

241
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:01,740
committee house oversight and reform

242
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,720
science space and Technology

243
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,600
I'm not sure how we fix this except

244
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,399
by coming together and recognizing that

245
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:09,839
there's a way to conduct an

246
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,640
investigation and we don't mean incident

247
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,380
response this isn't the moment where

248
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,060
we're yanking cables out of the wall and

249
00:09:15,060 --> 00:09:16,380
everybody's trying to get a network back

250
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,140
up right this is about after everyone's

251
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,420
taken a breath we've gotten three four

252
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,880
hours of sleep and had a chance to ask

253
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,580
the question what happened and how do we

254
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:28,200
prevent this again in future this is

255
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:30,180
about investigating what happened and

256
00:09:30,180 --> 00:09:32,640
generating an understanding of why and

257
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,760
how this kind of work needs to happen so

258
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,519
what Victoria and Adam and I did over

259
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:40,560
the course of the last six months is

260
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,680
create a Playbook that lets city and

261
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,500
state and National governments uh

262
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:49,740
conduct an incident investigations

263
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,720
um uh create an in-state investigations

264
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,399
board and then conduct their own

265
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,800
investigations now you might be asking

266
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,779
the question don't we already have one

267
00:09:57,779 --> 00:09:59,940
of those don't we have a csrb and the

268
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:02,640
answer is that at the same time that

269
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,080
this report was getting generated the

270
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:07,500
csrb at DHS was being created those the

271
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,899
kinds of recommendations we made it

272
00:10:09,899 --> 00:10:12,060
looks an awful lot like the csrb was

273
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:13,440
designed to serve a different function

274
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:15,720
at DHS so we've retooled a little bit

275
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:18,060
here to say instead there's a way for

276
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:21,360
city state county tribal governments to

277
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,459
run incident investigations that will

278
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:26,100
start to create a massive information in

279
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,959
the industry and how we need to start

280
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:30,600
creating these kinds of boards

281
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,880
is

282
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,800
three phases of Investigation just like

283
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,680
the NTSB does and who is this for I want

284
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,600
you to imagine to Envision

285
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:40,860
that

286
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,560
a deputy city manager gets called into a

287
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:46,560
mayor's office and told we just had a

288
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,500
ransomware incident at the hospital

289
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,540
we've got the patients back we've got

290
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,579
the network back up again but you have a

291
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:55,440
month to tell me what happened

292
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,660
go conduct an investigation give me some

293
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:58,740
kind of understanding about how we

294
00:10:58,740 --> 00:11:00,240
prevent this again in future

295
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,940
that person in government is very

296
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,560
unlikely to have ever had experience

297
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:06,839
standing up a major cyber investigation

298
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:09,420
this is the Playbook that shows them how

299
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,399
to do it so Victoria is going to tell

300
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:12,899
you a little bit more about what this

301
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:14,579
looks like if only because she is the

302
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:16,920
person who has read every NTSB report

303
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:19,620
over the last 20 years and would like to

304
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,880
tell you how to take some of those

305
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,860
Lessons Learned and get them implemented

306
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:25,380
into this Playbook so three phases of

307
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:27,360
Investigation The Playbook itself is

308
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,160
modeled after the ntsb's aviation

309
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,380
investigations manual and I read it so

310
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,760
you all don't have to

311
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:36,120
the opening of the investigation is when

312
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:39,180
the incidents happened and that's when

313
00:11:39,180 --> 00:11:41,459
the board convenes they decide on an

314
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:43,620
initial an investigator in charge who's

315
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:45,120
going to lead the technical team of the

316
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,980
investigation and kind of serve as a

317
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,940
guidepost throughout the entire

318
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:50,519
investigation and they set the goals for

319
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:52,260
the investigation and potentially invite

320
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,579
other parties

321
00:11:53,579 --> 00:11:55,260
um other companies to contribute

322
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,940
technical team members and act as

323
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,860
parties to the investigation then we

324
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,260
move into the technical investigation we

325
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:02,820
separated the technical investigation

326
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,100
from the review portion to create two

327
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,360
separate teams so the technical

328
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:08,640
investigation is taxed by is taught

329
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:11,040
staffed by the technical team who are

330
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,839
professionals who do this every single

331
00:12:12,839 --> 00:12:15,540
day who are some of the kinds of people

332
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:17,640
who would respond to an initial incident

333
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,579
and do the whole initial incident

334
00:12:20,579 --> 00:12:23,100
response and they are going to analyze

335
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:24,720
reports that are coming out of the

336
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,180
mitigation process and hopefully get

337
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:29,579
their hands on Hardware also

338
00:12:29,579 --> 00:12:32,880
then those team members are now done and

339
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,980
the phase moves into the Board review

340
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,019
that's when the board members convene

341
00:12:37,019 --> 00:12:38,519
and they look at the report generated by

342
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,320
the technical team and they make

343
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,240
decisions on okay what are the facts

344
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,160
that we all agree upon on this incident

345
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,860
and what recommendations are we as a

346
00:12:46,860 --> 00:12:48,600
board going to come up with and propose

347
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,639
to the community so that in the future

348
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:53,220
events like this can be mitigated or at

349
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:56,459
least the harm reduced by following

350
00:12:56,459 --> 00:12:58,440
these kinds of recommendations so who

351
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:00,420
are these board members we broke this

352
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:02,399
down into four kinds of people that you

353
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,639
would want on a board the first being

354
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,079
individuals these are cyber Security

355
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:09,300
Experts who are well respected in the

356
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,600
field and they have credibility

357
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,399
separate from their Affiliated

358
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,839
organizations

359
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:17,279
a good way to think about it is if

360
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:18,600
you're sitting in here you're subject to

361
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,639
being drafted for this in future sorry

362
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:23,579
sorry

363
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:26,700
corporations that's because industry has

364
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:28,500
immense power in the cyber security

365
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:31,200
industry however we want to note that

366
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:32,940
corporations who have a vested interest

367
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:35,339
in the outcome of an investigation for

368
00:13:35,339 --> 00:13:38,519
example a corporation with softwares was

369
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:41,459
used uh in the course of an attack those

370
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:42,899
kinds of Corporations should not be

371
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:44,880
served on the board and you should

372
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,260
recuse themselves if they're already on

373
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,740
the board of a review board sorry and

374
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,899
we'll note too that there's a moment for

375
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:53,220
parties who are interested in the

376
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,420
investigation to submit information

377
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:56,880
later just if you are the corporation or

378
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,860
the industry that is or the the body

379
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,300
that has contributed at least some of

380
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,800
the technology that's being investigated

381
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:03,779
there's a question of interest in that

382
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:05,760
situation it's best to maintain it as as

383
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:08,279
a disinterested aboard as possible

384
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:10,079
all right next we have government

385
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:12,839
agencies regulars how also play a big

386
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:14,760
role in the cyber security community so

387
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,920
they have a seat at the table

388
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:18,839
um and they have important perspective

389
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:20,579
to add but they shouldn't be the entire

390
00:14:20,579 --> 00:14:22,940
board they're just one piece of it

391
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:26,220
and lastly academic organizations these

392
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:27,860
kinds of organizations have credibility

393
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:30,779
and will help the report after the fact

394
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:32,579
become widespread

395
00:14:32,579 --> 00:14:34,920
so they'd be really useful

396
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,620
who is a technical team like I said

397
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:39,600
these are professionals who

398
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,060
have the skill set to do the hardcore

399
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:44,820
analogy analogy analysis of the incident

400
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,160
they come up with a findings report that

401
00:14:47,160 --> 00:14:48,839
is then read by the board members who

402
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:51,060
may not have a technical background and

403
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:52,320
yet analogies are probably going to be

404
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:53,519
one of the more powerful things they

405
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,019
wield in the process of creating that

406
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:56,459
report as I think we all know at this

407
00:14:56,459 --> 00:14:58,560
point so what we want to note here too

408
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,199
is that that as we were writing this we

409
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,300
realized something pretty fundamental I

410
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,980
think the analogy I gave you earlier of

411
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:06,720
the Deputy city manager being asked to

412
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,540
produce a report is pretty you know

413
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,399
exemplary of the situation most people

414
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:14,639
find themselves in we I think as a as an

415
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,199
industry as a community know at this

416
00:15:16,199 --> 00:15:17,760
point that people aren't going to do

417
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,320
 about cyber security until they

418
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,639
have to there's going to be a

419
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,920
precipitating incident that causes a

420
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:24,839
local or state government to set up a

421
00:15:24,839 --> 00:15:26,399
major cyber incident investigations

422
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:28,620
board right at least the first one

423
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:30,120
someone is going to have something

424
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,500
dropped in their lap and they're not

425
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:33,959
going to know what to do about it so the

426
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:35,399
reason we have crisis mode in this

427
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:36,779
Playbook and you'll see it in the

428
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:38,699
Harvard Belfor report will be set out

429
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:40,380
and it'll be in high highlighted text

430
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:41,940
and in the markdown you'll see a little

431
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:43,800
bit later on it's highlighted as well

432
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,120
which you can all get a chance to

433
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,980
eyeball edit and critique

434
00:15:46,980 --> 00:15:49,380
my markdown could use some improvement

435
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:52,320
so crisis mode is small insets that

436
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,880
tells you if you are someone who's never

437
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:56,160
done this before with the absolute key

438
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,740
takeaways are for instance when we talk

439
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,839
about who's going to get put on a board

440
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:04,199
and what the the qualities and the

441
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:05,699
traits of a person who would get put on

442
00:16:05,699 --> 00:16:07,920
an investigations board are I give a

443
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:09,959
quick shortcut in crisis mode and the

444
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:12,240
quick shortcut is if you don't know who

445
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,100
to put on a board make sure there are

446
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:14,940
four people

447
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,620
you're probably the government person

448
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:19,920
already right for an individual go look

449
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,320
at your local isaka chapters ISC

450
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,120
chapters or b-sides because you're

451
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,139
probably going to have one within 100

452
00:16:25,139 --> 00:16:28,260
miles of you for academic organizations

453
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,720
go to your local reasonably reputable

454
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,540
college or university and ask the chair

455
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:35,760
of the computer science department to

456
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,320
either help or recommend someone inside

457
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,899
the university this gives you that quick

458
00:16:39,899 --> 00:16:41,699
shortcut to find someone who can help

459
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:43,860
you right for most people who've never

460
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:46,500
done this it seems

461
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:48,360
it seems a little bit

462
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,740
um

463
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:51,899
facile to just tell people you need to

464
00:16:51,899 --> 00:16:53,339
pick a couple people that aren't in

465
00:16:53,339 --> 00:16:54,899
government but the truth is many people

466
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:56,699
who do this kind of Investigation inside

467
00:16:56,699 --> 00:16:58,800
a government it's never occurred to them

468
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:01,740
to ask anyone outside the body that

469
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:02,820
they're working in

470
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,140
it wouldn't occur to them to go to

471
00:17:04,140 --> 00:17:06,119
anyone other than the I.T Department of

472
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:07,079
the city that they're doing this

473
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:08,939
investigation in it's incredibly

474
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:11,099
important to make the recommendation to

475
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:13,679
reach to outside expertise not only to

476
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:15,299
connect with industry and provide that

477
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:17,819
credibility via Academia but also make

478
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:19,500
sure that industry can help with both

479
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,900
resources and the kind of expertise

480
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:24,179
that's usually found inside some of the

481
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:25,619
most respected corporations in

482
00:17:25,619 --> 00:17:27,599
technology and information security so

483
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,040
that's what crisis mode is and you'll

484
00:17:29,040 --> 00:17:31,440
see quick actions like do this here's

485
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:32,880
your 10 actions to take here's the 10

486
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,340
questions to answer you need to ask five

487
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:37,980
why's go backwards in time why why to

488
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,020
avoid the single points of failure and

489
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:42,419
the uh the the the root cause analysis

490
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:44,220
mode of thinking people get into right

491
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,840
that's what crisis mode is and that's

492
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,240
part of the Playbook so

493
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,280
what does this look like in action

494
00:17:50,280 --> 00:17:52,080
all right

495
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,900
so take your example a big box retail

496
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:57,360
store has recently been the victim of a

497
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,160
point of sale attack we're not going to

498
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,780
name names you can visualize for

499
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,299
yourself what that big box retail store

500
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:04,919
would be my husband's here and I'm just

501
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:06,240
remembering about this Home Improvement

502
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,160
project we have to do at home right now

503
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:11,539
okay continue

504
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:15,360
so the district manager is freaking out

505
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,120
that there has been an attack he

506
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,340
contacts a bunch of people the police

507
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:22,620
finally someone routes him to the

508
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,320
governor the governor turns the person

509
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,059
next to them and says okay who should

510
00:18:27,059 --> 00:18:28,799
handle this Chief nerd Chief Information

511
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:31,740
officer that's your job figure it out

512
00:18:31,740 --> 00:18:34,200
Chief Information officer crisis mode

513
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,820
they have the Playbook and they start

514
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,679
turning to the Chrysler sections of the

515
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:39,960
Playbook we've drafted so the step one

516
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,539
is they start to form a board they find

517
00:18:42,539 --> 00:18:45,059
the cyber security professional who will

518
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:46,919
serve as the individual they find

519
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:49,080
someone from industry who can serve on

520
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,640
the board and they find someone from an

521
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,919
academic organization

522
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:55,260
next so the board is together they go

523
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:56,940
and find the technical team

524
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,820
after going to the it the all of the

525
00:18:59,820 --> 00:19:01,260
people on the board at this time go

526
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:03,960
through their networks and they find

527
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,880
respected technical professionals who

528
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,799
can serve on the technical team

529
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:09,660
and then we start the actual

530
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,760
investigation in the review process the

531
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:13,799
technical team does their analysis and

532
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:14,940
they come up with the findings report

533
00:19:14,940 --> 00:19:18,120
the findings report is it handed over to

534
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,280
the board for their review

535
00:19:20,280 --> 00:19:21,900
after a short time so the board members

536
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:23,400
have had a time to review the findings

537
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:25,620
report they convene and they come up

538
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,960
with recommendations and they vote on

539
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,520
the findings to include in their final

540
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,559
report there's one thing to note right

541
00:19:31,559 --> 00:19:33,000
here it's incredibly important to find

542
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:34,980
people for this technical team who can

543
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:37,440
speak not nerd the the not nerd

544
00:19:37,440 --> 00:19:39,179
translation process that translation

545
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:41,820
Matrix is amazingly important we almost

546
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,260
misspoke a little earlier and use the

547
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:45,120
word analogy a great deal but somebody

548
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:47,700
on the technical team who can explain to

549
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:50,160
State and local officials why and how

550
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,200
something happened Beyond everybody's

551
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,840
screens went red at the hospital or

552
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:57,360
someone didn't patch a box because it's

553
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,460
very easy in that moment for someone who

554
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:00,900
doesn't understand a lot of the process

555
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:03,840
to uh to say something and we'll see

556
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,220
this reaction in government's a lot like

557
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:08,460
well just mandate that they patch faster

558
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,200
buddy if we could mandate that everybody

559
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,760
patched faster nobody would be here

560
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:13,919
right now we'd all be drinking right so

561
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:16,260
the problem we have is that people don't

562
00:20:16,260 --> 00:20:18,059
necessarily understand how to translate

563
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:20,100
in a way that will cause the correct

564
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,620
action we've seen people who don't

565
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:25,559
understand Aviation will uh declare that

566
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:27,240
what needs to happen is immediately the

567
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:29,460
737 Max need to have the MCAS system

568
00:20:29,460 --> 00:20:32,580
ripped out well the the level of process

569
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,679
failure and process adaptation that that

570
00:20:34,679 --> 00:20:37,140
causes as opposed to truly understanding

571
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:40,559
how and a flawed MCAS system worked for

572
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,140
737 Max is

573
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:45,840
it's facile again it's it's simplistic

574
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:47,460
and we need people who don't think

575
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:50,700
simplistically but can explain simply to

576
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,500
people what's going on and how they can

577
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,200
work on this this process if if your

578
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:58,320
answer to why it happened is pointing a

579
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,419
finger instead of the two magic words

580
00:21:00,419 --> 00:21:01,860
that tell you that you're talking to an

581
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,900
expert it depends

582
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:06,299
then you've got a situation where the

583
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:07,500
technical findings are going to get

584
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:09,059
buried under whatever politics are

585
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,919
happening in that moment this is why

586
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:12,660
this is so important to maintain a

587
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:14,700
disinterested capable technical team and

588
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:18,000
a board to provide a coherent response

589
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,220
to what's happening and what has

590
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,020
happened so the recommendations and

591
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:24,240
findings need to be written in plain

592
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:26,460
clear English or whatever language is

593
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,380
local at that point to make sure people

594
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,480
understand what happened why and most

595
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:33,120
importantly how they can prevent it and

596
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:35,159
that all needs to go into

597
00:21:35,159 --> 00:21:38,780
the final report and this final report

598
00:21:38,780 --> 00:21:40,740
should be readable for the public

599
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,840
because we want it to be as public and

600
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,299
widely accessible as possible we

601
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:47,159
recommend hosting it or the dream

602
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:49,020
scenario is at a toasted on a public

603
00:21:49,020 --> 00:21:50,700
library website like the Boston Public

604
00:21:50,700 --> 00:21:52,740
Library would host it so that everyone

605
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,840
can access it it's not hidden on some

606
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,600
company's website and desperately

607
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,400
desperately desperately hope no link Rod

608
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:02,940
happens and it's a stable document we do

609
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,620
we love libraries for this for a lot of

610
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,940
different reasons first of all libraries

611
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,440
serve a whole lot more functions than

612
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:08,820
simply checking out books as I think

613
00:22:08,820 --> 00:22:10,799
those of us who have seen the services

614
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,419
being provided at libraries in our

615
00:22:12,419 --> 00:22:13,559
communities over the last couple of

616
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:15,840
years can can recall at this point but

617
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:18,860
also there's a neutrality to libraries

618
00:22:18,860 --> 00:22:21,419
that that is really important in this

619
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:22,559
moment

620
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,080
um the the kind of final report we're

621
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,539
looking for has to focus in on the idea

622
00:22:27,539 --> 00:22:29,220
that there are multiple reasons why

623
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:31,260
there are process failures and multiple

624
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,000
places that you can fix that process

625
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,640
failure for the future imagine for

626
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:38,340
instance that instead of having us all

627
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,740
recognize that solarwinds had a failure

628
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,960
and again after more than a year and a

629
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:44,220
half we don't have a coherent

630
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,960
governmental report about what happened

631
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:50,039
where why and how imagine that every

632
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:52,919
report every kind of of cause and

633
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:55,020
Analysis of a cyber security incident

634
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:57,539
all boiled down to and in turn set the

635
00:22:57,539 --> 00:22:58,940
production server's password to

636
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:01,980
solarwinds123 right the thing we're

637
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,919
trying to to avoid is that that is a

638
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:06,299
single answer and the thing we're trying

639
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:09,120
to cause is for people to ask five why's

640
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,120
behind that the first why is

641
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,700
who let the intern have access to the

642
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:16,140
production server

643
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:18,059
the second question is

644
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:20,820
what rules and compensating controls

645
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:23,700
weren't in place that had that

646
00:23:23,700 --> 00:23:27,140
outcome right the why before that is

647
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:31,320
what were the budgetary processes the

648
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:34,260
the compliance processes and the lack of

649
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:36,720
expertise or training that let those

650
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,179
compensating controls or technical

651
00:23:39,179 --> 00:23:40,980
processes get put into place without

652
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:43,020
someone catching it is there a lack of

653
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,760
diverse thought among the people who

654
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,799
were looking at these processes because

655
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,500
if we boil every single incident down to

656
00:23:49,500 --> 00:23:52,440
well the intern did it or the contractor

657
00:23:52,440 --> 00:23:55,740
didn't hatch the struts box or any other

658
00:23:55,740 --> 00:23:59,039
form of single point of failure of root

659
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:01,260
cause analysis we lose all the richness

660
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:03,419
of what actually happened I think

661
00:24:03,419 --> 00:24:05,159
everyone here knows that every one of

662
00:24:05,159 --> 00:24:07,340
these incidents is complex is

663
00:24:07,340 --> 00:24:09,539
interesting is fascinating for those of

664
00:24:09,539 --> 00:24:11,159
us who who love looking into this stuff

665
00:24:11,159 --> 00:24:14,520
and understanding it I am

666
00:24:14,520 --> 00:24:17,700
I I love this field and as a student

667
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:20,280
pilot I get to see every single year

668
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,919
with updated regulations

669
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,480
um in the far aims this is the Federal

670
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,340
Aviation regulations in the airman's

671
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:29,340
instruction manuals I get to see why and

672
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,559
how regulations every single year get

673
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:33,539
ticked up a little bit better and then I

674
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:34,919
become personally responsible for

675
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:37,200
knowing those every single year

676
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,720
we've been talking about how this kind

677
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:43,080
of work is

678
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,500
it seems grinding but there's such a joy

679
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:47,820
in it when you see people finally

680
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:50,159
understanding what's happened and I

681
00:24:50,159 --> 00:24:52,080
recall that six months after wannacry

682
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:54,780
happened the ncsc in the UK put out a

683
00:24:54,780 --> 00:24:56,820
really great report on wannacry what

684
00:24:56,820 --> 00:24:58,860
happened how it happened budgetary and

685
00:24:58,860 --> 00:25:00,900
process failures Geographic locations

686
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,700
the names of the technologies that were

687
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,520
used what was and wasn't updated the

688
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,380
lack of skills and the lack of

689
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,360
upskilling that caused it in specific

690
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,159
locations it's a beautiful document if

691
00:25:11,159 --> 00:25:12,960
you ever get a chance to read it it is

692
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:14,820
absolutely the kind of thing that we

693
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,020
want to see come out of this process

694
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:17,700
that's the kind of final report we want

695
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,120
to see happen

696
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:21,840
so

697
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:23,760
so what does this mean for organizations

698
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:25,500
responding to cyber incidents in the

699
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:26,279
future

700
00:25:26,279 --> 00:25:28,919
what we hope happens is that

701
00:25:28,919 --> 00:25:30,960
organizations State local governments

702
00:25:30,960 --> 00:25:32,760
take this Playbook and set up their own

703
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,400
mciib across the country so it'd be

704
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:37,500
multiple boards investigating incidents

705
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:39,179
that happen near them or importance to

706
00:25:39,179 --> 00:25:41,940
them and we developed this shared

707
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:44,340
Lessons Learned narrative not just on

708
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,860
like the big cyber security events but

709
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:48,659
on the small ones and then we take those

710
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:50,400
and we draw the lessons and we build on

711
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,779
them and they spread throughout the

712
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:54,360
community and we mitigate the Damage

713
00:25:54,360 --> 00:25:55,679
Done from these events we prevent them

714
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,720
from happening in the future hopefully

715
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,820
we've seen it's not just important to

716
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,740
have those those incident investigation

717
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,779
boards set up early although with crisis

718
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:05,520
mode we understand at least the first

719
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,799
one almost everywhere is going to be in

720
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:09,299
crisis mode it's going to be it's going

721
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:10,799
to be a precipitating incident instead

722
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,179
of a thoughtfully planned out process

723
00:26:12,179 --> 00:26:14,460
but what we also really hope is going to

724
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,659
happen is

725
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:18,299
we hope that when we go back and

726
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:21,179
research what caused What in in a

727
00:26:21,179 --> 00:26:23,039
historic incident in some of the more

728
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,080
famous breaches that have occurred over

729
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,760
time like for instance the OMB breach

730
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,140
right

731
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:31,980
um uh the the thing we're hoping is that

732
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,360
when you go back and look for what

733
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,559
happened and how you can prevent that

734
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,059
particular kind of incident and future

735
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:38,400
that there is a shared understanding of

736
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,440
what happened right now it would be very

737
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:42,179
difficult to get everybody in this room

738
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:44,520
to agree on some of the most basic facts

739
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:46,200
of the most famous cyber attacks that

740
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:48,179
exist in the world and and that's the

741
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:49,740
challenge that I think we're looking to

742
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:51,600
address I've bumped up against this

743
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:53,279
personally when trying to find out what

744
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,260
happened when and where and some of the

745
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,000
most major incidents in the world not

746
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,000
Petra Wanna Cry stuxnet I've bumped into

747
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:01,740
people who

748
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:03,480
think it's okay to just have an opinion

749
00:27:03,480 --> 00:27:04,679
about what happened instead of going

750
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:06,720
back and looking at it and then you go

751
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,279
back and find that there's no

752
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:10,559
information left anymore that the

753
00:27:10,559 --> 00:27:13,620
information that was hosted is gone that

754
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:15,779
it got pulled behind a paywall a pretty

755
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:18,059
famous one was the the broadcom Takeover

756
00:27:18,059 --> 00:27:20,039
of symantec's white papers it happened

757
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:21,720
really quickly and it was put back up

758
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,120
again but everyone was relying on a lot

759
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,440
of those white papers from the awesome

760
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:27,059
people that Symantec who'd done a lot of

761
00:27:27,059 --> 00:27:28,620
that white paper a lot of that serious

762
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:30,779
research and it was just thought of as

763
00:27:30,779 --> 00:27:32,580
marketing materials the problem we're

764
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:34,740
looking at is right now so much of our

765
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:36,779
shared history in this industry is

766
00:27:36,779 --> 00:27:39,059
marketing materials that can go away at

767
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:41,039
any time that's why libraries are

768
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:42,419
awesome and that's why we want to see

769
00:27:42,419 --> 00:27:45,419
this kind of information available

770
00:27:45,419 --> 00:27:47,279
around the world and certainly at least

771
00:27:47,279 --> 00:27:49,860
in the United States

772
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:52,320
all right so what we would love to do

773
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:56,279
now is we would love to present not only

774
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:58,140
the Belfor Center's write-up of this

775
00:27:58,140 --> 00:28:00,179
it's very pretty I am not a visual

776
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:01,980
person but I hear that the visual layout

777
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:04,080
on this is really great go for it uh

778
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,240
take a look on not only um our site so

779
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,919
you can also see it in a couple of the

780
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:09,419
tweets we've shared today

781
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:10,980
um and it's it's right there on

782
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:14,100
Harvard's website but we would also

783
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,900
love to share that for the next two

784
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:19,200
years I Victoria and Adam showstack will

785
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,320
be benevolently dictating over a GitHub

786
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,360
project that exists out there for anyone

787
00:28:24,360 --> 00:28:26,700
to use this right here is the markdown

788
00:28:26,700 --> 00:28:28,440
version of that Playbook

789
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,559
please submit pull requests Victoria

790
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:33,000
will wield an iron Hammer we're

791
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:34,320
considering having one forged it's going

792
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:36,840
to be great and we'll find out what we

793
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:38,520
can learn from the community about what

794
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,320
doesn't doesn't work in setting up a

795
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,240
board in a Playbook like this do you

796
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,340
have any thoughts on that too

797
00:28:44,340 --> 00:28:47,520
please do it that's my thought I spent

798
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:51,080
so long writing this I hope it lives on

799
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:54,000
it's pretty awesome so yeah

800
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,380
um none of this is ever going to be

801
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:57,000
perfect right like we're never going to

802
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:59,640
be able to to make this all the way

803
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,140
perfect there's always going to be

804
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:03,360
something going on right

805
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,760
um the problem we see now is that there

806
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:08,360
are still organizations as of last year

807
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,919
26 of the organizations that were

808
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:13,919
vulnerable to wannacry in 2017

809
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,919
still are and I'm exhausted by that and

810
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:18,059
I think a lot of people in this room

811
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:20,399
probably are as well so we're never

812
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:21,899
going to make this all the way perfect

813
00:29:21,899 --> 00:29:23,820
and I think for those of us who are

814
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:25,799
currently in organizations anecdotally

815
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:28,860
in the Fortune 500 companies or publicly

816
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:30,779
listed companies I've been part of

817
00:29:30,779 --> 00:29:33,059
without naming names

818
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:35,100
I would say anecdotally on average there

819
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:36,539
are four separate

820
00:29:36,539 --> 00:29:38,580
reasonably important like medium level

821
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:41,100
or above uh incident investigations

822
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:44,580
occurring like ongoing incident response

823
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:46,559
it happens all the time so you're not

824
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:48,419
alone a lot of this stuff is perpetually

825
00:29:48,419 --> 00:29:50,520
happening and yet once we clean up the

826
00:29:50,520 --> 00:29:52,080
mess it's like we throw the trash out

827
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,360
and forget that it ever happened we keep

828
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,039
making the same messes again and again

829
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:57,299
and I want people to be able to learn

830
00:29:57,299 --> 00:30:00,000
from that this isn't going to get any

831
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,919
better too we're now seeing even more

832
00:30:01,919 --> 00:30:03,600
sophisticated attacks

833
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,279
um forgive me because I'm going to say

834
00:30:05,279 --> 00:30:08,279
AI enabled credential stuffing which has

835
00:30:08,279 --> 00:30:09,600
a technical meaning I swear I'm not

836
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:10,740
using it in a way that's going to be

837
00:30:10,740 --> 00:30:13,740
marketing but when I talk about uh this

838
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:15,240
right here I use it in its technical

839
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:17,640
term we're using the statistical

840
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:20,100
um analysis of publicly available data

841
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,620
to more effectively target phishing

842
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:24,899
attacks it's automated spear phishing at

843
00:30:24,899 --> 00:30:26,340
scale and that's really frightening to

844
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:28,020
me this is the kind of stuff we have to

845
00:30:28,020 --> 00:30:30,539
learn lessons about in advance otherwise

846
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:31,980
I mean we're going to end up with the

847
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,240
same kinds of situations we found

848
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,980
ourselves in before if you do what you

849
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:37,500
did you get what you got right

850
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:40,679
so anybody can be ready for a major

851
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:43,200
cyber incident investigation everybody

852
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,179
should be ready for it and your

853
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:46,980
community is going to need this sooner

854
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:49,559
or later I think in the last two hours

855
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:52,020
I've gotten three different emails just

856
00:30:52,020 --> 00:30:53,640
out of the middle of nowhere of people

857
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,559
who need help with incident response a

858
00:30:55,559 --> 00:30:57,480
ransomware investigation like your

859
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,039
LinkedIn inboxes are all filling up with

860
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:01,500
the same thing too right there needs to

861
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,419
be more people who know how to go and

862
00:31:03,419 --> 00:31:05,399
and serve themselves from this body of

863
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:07,500
knowledge that we can create and if it

864
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,679
exists in public on Library websites we

865
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:11,640
don't have to worry about it

866
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:14,220
disappearing behind paywalls this is why

867
00:31:14,220 --> 00:31:16,260
we care this much about it because it's

868
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:19,919
not going to get less complicated but at

869
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,600
least we can start to predict what the

870
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,179
future is going to look like so

871
00:31:24,179 --> 00:31:26,159
um thank you so very much it's been

872
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:28,200
incredibly wonderful to be here before
