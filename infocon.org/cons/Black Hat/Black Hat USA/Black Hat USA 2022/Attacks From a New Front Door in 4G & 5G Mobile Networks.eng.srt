2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,720
foreign

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,340
welcome everyone for the last Talk of

4
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:16,440
the day I hope you are not exhausted I

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,960
will try my best to excite you with 5G

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,439
and what's this new front door so I am

7
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,060
altaf and then I'm a senior researcher

8
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,279
at the TU Berlin and I've been in

9
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:28,260
cellular security for over like 11 years

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:30,920
now and it's quite fascinating to see

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:33,300
how Generation by generation like

12
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,800
security improves and then a lot of

13
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,200
changes in every generation and are we

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,239
able to make something better in 5G or

15
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:40,920
are we going down or something like we

16
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:43,200
will I will definitely like give you a

17
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,540
better Insight by the end of the talk

18
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,440
um

19
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,980
okay maybe by now maybe you have some

20
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,840
understanding of what are attacks in

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,640
mobile networks so you might have seen

22
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,680
MC catchers or you might have seen fake

23
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,559
base stations attacks over ss7 diameter

24
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,680
networks which tried to exploit the lack

25
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:04,739
of authentication in ss7 networks uh

26
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,560
maybe you saw SMS malware or SMS

27
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,840
phishing you saw back doors that I mean

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:11,960
nobody knows but yeah they are there

29
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:14,460
unless someone finds it then there are

30
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,340
API leaks or specifically Sim type of

31
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:20,100
attacks that exploit some browser issues

32
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:22,920
in the Sim so we have seen like so many

33
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,680
attacks over the past maybe 15 years and

34
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,140
calling these like classic attacks these

35
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:30,060
are basically user targeted which means

36
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:32,640
the they try to Target a specific user

37
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,619
or a bunch of users and they try to

38
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:37,320
extract information or maybe try to

39
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:40,259
intercept the call or SMS or even track

40
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:41,360
their location

41
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,340
maybe do some type of billing fraud or

42
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:46,259
any other type of fraud Ott Bypass or

43
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:47,659
something they like that

44
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:50,040
so these are like basically user

45
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:53,040
targeted but 5G is something that is not

46
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:54,899
for well I won't say it's not meant for

47
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:57,540
user but it's more meant for things so

48
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,640
it's more meant for Industries like

49
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,939
agriculture or Automotive

50
00:02:01,939 --> 00:02:04,320
manufacturing Or the critical

51
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,840
Communications so there is increased

52
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,500
threat when it comes to 5G and the

53
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,660
impact is also quite bigger because here

54
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:14,940
the attacker gets to Target the industry

55
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:16,920
and not just a simple user I mean of

56
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:19,440
course users can also be targeted but I

57
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,580
see like there has been a lot of

58
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:22,980
improvement with respect to user privacy

59
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:25,800
or like user Security in 5G mobile

60
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,319
networks compared to this new door that

61
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:30,780
has come up in 5G or you can also say

62
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:33,599
the advanced 4G networks as well

63
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:36,480
uh before I go into the what is this

64
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,700
main uh the new front door I just want

65
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,500
to give a little bit a little idea about

66
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:42,720
like how a mobile network looks like so

67
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,340
a simplified mobile network that has a

68
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:46,080
radio network as you see which has base

69
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,680
stations and uh it has devices handsets

70
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,080
or laptops or whatever like and they are

71
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,180
connected to the core Network and code

72
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:57,120
network has multiple interfaces I think

73
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,400
some of the key ones are ss7 or damage

74
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,099
interface that you see which uh connects

75
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:03,900
with neighboring operators from

76
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,360
different countries which allows for

77
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:08,459
roaming then there is a data network

78
00:03:08,459 --> 00:03:11,700
interface which allows us to communicate

79
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:14,819
all our apps with the with the internet

80
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:15,420
um

81
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:18,060
so this is a simple network but now

82
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:21,120
um with the for the first time 4G and 5G

83
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,800
networks are trying to bring this

84
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,700
network exposure which opens another

85
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,860
interface that is particularly for

86
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,140
Industries or let's call like external

87
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,180
entities like vertical Industries third

88
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,940
parties or application Developers

89
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:36,599
um

90
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:39,060
and I think mobile networks are like

91
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,400
widely known renowned for being closed

92
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,680
doors so their proprietary interfaces

93
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,280
are now changing and slowly moving to

94
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,720
generalized or commoditized Technologies

95
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,120
like apis for example so let's go a bit

96
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:53,220
deeper into what exactly this front door

97
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,319
is so just expanded the picture a little

98
00:03:55,319 --> 00:03:57,239
bit and you see here that on the left

99
00:03:57,239 --> 00:03:59,819
hand side you see a smart Factory or

100
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:01,739
devices from Smart factories or Smart

101
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:05,220
Homes or hospitals which are all

102
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:07,200
connected to the radio Access Network to

103
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,599
the base stations and then the mno the

104
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:11,519
operator has now control over these

105
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:13,739
devices and now you see that the network

106
00:04:13,739 --> 00:04:16,798
exposure provides not bound apis to

107
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,139
another provider and this provider can

108
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:21,600
be a virtual operator or another

109
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,600
operator in themselves or it could be a

110
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,880
platform provider or iot service

111
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:28,800
provider I mean if you just want to have

112
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,660
more information about who are these iot

113
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:31,979
service providers I mean it's easy to

114
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:34,139
Google like there are tons of them who

115
00:04:34,139 --> 00:04:37,680
provide iot platforms

116
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,560
um so now what this provider does is

117
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,320
like he takes this Northbound apis and

118
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:45,660
then generates called service apis and

119
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:47,759
then exposes them to Vertical Industries

120
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,740
or to the applications the Mind where

121
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,960
Industries can actually host some of

122
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:54,840
their uh not some but like their iot

123
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,180
devices on the field or infrastructure

124
00:04:57,180 --> 00:05:00,000
and Achieve connectivity through the

125
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,400
mobile network operator so now

126
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,800
any external entity can actually control

127
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,100
their smart devices by using the service

128
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,520
apis and going through the 4G or 5G core

129
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:12,900
Network so this is a general

130
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:15,840
architecture like how it looks like

131
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,699
um to give an example I took drone

132
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:19,740
because I think everybody is interested

133
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:22,259
in drones kind of stuff so this is an

134
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:24,300
example from vodafone's Telco as a

135
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,620
service model they were testing in

136
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,020
Germany uh in their 5G Mobility lab so

137
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:31,500
basically the drones control center is

138
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:33,240
connected to the network exposure layer

139
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:35,639
provided by Vodafone so this exposure

140
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:37,740
layer provides apis and shares

141
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:40,320
information to the Drone control center

142
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,780
such as Network intelligence for example

143
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,060
like that that actually helps the

144
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:47,880
control center to get the coverage maps

145
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,919
or even sometimes they might also

146
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:51,720
receive anonymized mobile user

147
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,960
information so that if there are heavy

148
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,759
crowds in a specific area they can

149
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:58,620
actually maneuver the Drone away from

150
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,419
that I mean fly it in a different area

151
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:03,360
so by connecting the by having the Drone

152
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,940
connected to the mobile network the

153
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:07,500
control center I mean cannot lose the

154
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:10,020
contact even though if it's not having a

155
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,820
line of sight so there are like plenty

156
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,199
of advantages when it comes to this

157
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,479
network exposure

158
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:18,720
and just to sum it up I think apis will

159
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,060
be one of the key technologies that will

160
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:22,860
be seen in Telecom in the next let's say

161
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:25,139
10 10 years I would say

162
00:06:25,139 --> 00:06:28,380
it's changing to clouds Dockers uh

163
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:31,560
virtual virtual machines so which all

164
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:34,259
require like apis and then this is just

165
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:36,900
a beginning of apis in let's say in the

166
00:06:36,900 --> 00:06:39,300
Telco world

167
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:41,520
if you are like confusing the apis that

168
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,380
I'm talking about with some API attacks

169
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:45,780
that happen in the past there's a big

170
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,580
difference here because the API attacks

171
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:50,100
that happened in the past are those apis

172
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,720
that shouldn't be exposed to the end

173
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:54,600
user and should be hidden from them but

174
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,039
these apis that I'm that I will be

175
00:06:56,039 --> 00:06:58,139
talking about they are something that

176
00:06:58,139 --> 00:07:00,240
are particularly created for end users

177
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,699
or Industries and they will be open in a

178
00:07:02,699 --> 00:07:04,199
secure manner so there's a huge

179
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:06,360
difference there previous ones where a

180
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,520
configuration is mistake but this one is

181
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:11,220
a standardized way of exposing core

182
00:07:11,220 --> 00:07:13,740
Network special facilities and data so

183
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,440
that end users can actually benefit

184
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:18,240
the talk goes like this so I will

185
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:20,400
explain like how do we get commercial

186
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:23,099
access to these iot platforms or let's

187
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:24,780
say in general to this network exposure

188
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,460
and what are the features configurations

189
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,500
then what investigations have we done

190
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,720
and some of the design risks that are

191
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,819
really harmful uh for the networks to

192
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,680
come or like for the years to come then

193
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:36,660
some of the key findings and uh

194
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:38,639
disclosure stories and I will end with

195
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,740
some takeaways here

196
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:43,919
okay I expanded the picture before even

197
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:45,900
more like a little bit more like much

198
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,259
more uh a bit more granular information

199
00:07:49,259 --> 00:07:51,960
so you see that there is now an iot SIM

200
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,759
card which is added to the to all these

201
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:56,580
devices so this iot Sim is something

202
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,380
that is available from the iot service

203
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,440
provider you call it like an mno or MV

204
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,060
and more virtual operator so whoever it

205
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,979
is and

206
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:07,020
take a look at this iot service platform

207
00:08:07,020 --> 00:08:09,060
which is nothing I mean just to put it

208
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,979
easier like it's an API server which

209
00:08:10,979 --> 00:08:12,780
hosts different entities such as like it

210
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:16,259
host service apis it hosts uh something

211
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:17,699
called iot connectivity management

212
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:20,280
platform and then all this is

213
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,520
controllable by apis from the Industries

214
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,780
or third parties or application

215
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,220
developers I mean there can be any

216
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,860
company for example and most of the time

217
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,840
all this this entire architecture is

218
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:33,539
usually found in clouds these days it's

219
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:35,640
it's getting a common practice which was

220
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:38,159
not at all some years ago

221
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,919
okay now how do we get access to one of

222
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,599
these iot service platform that we saw

223
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:45,180
because that's the one that you need to

224
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:46,860
actually control your devices remotely

225
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:48,779
through the mobile network so first of

226
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:50,459
all you have to be a business entity you

227
00:08:50,459 --> 00:08:52,440
cannot be an individual like unlike uh I

228
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,839
I mean for now like a SIM card that I

229
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:56,760
have I can buy as an individual but to

230
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,680
buy iot SIM cards like you should be you

231
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:00,300
should be running a business and you

232
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,820
need a tax ID so you go to the iot

233
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,620
service provider you give him the tax ID

234
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,839
your email address or like let's say

235
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:08,880
Office business email address and then

236
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:11,459
office location and then they will

237
00:09:11,459 --> 00:09:13,560
directly ship you the SIM cards that you

238
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:15,720
want usually you buy them in bulk maybe

239
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,080
thousand or like two thousand it depends

240
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:20,399
and they come with a different kind of

241
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,420
tariff unlike what we use uh because we

242
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,220
we want it for like telephony or like

243
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,320
other data stuff but these are iot SIM

244
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,420
cards they have less data and then maybe

245
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,640
just a long lifetime like 10 year

246
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:34,260
Lifetime and they're pretty cheap as

247
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,880
well maybe one dollar if you're buying

248
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,320
in bulk

249
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,959
um some of the SIM cards that we bought

250
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:41,760
are something that connect to the

251
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:43,980
narrowband iot networks like and you uh

252
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,140
I would be like low power low power

253
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:47,580
networks

254
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,959
um so

255
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,899
the provider like once he identifies or

256
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:53,399
checks your tax ID and everything like

257
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:54,720
he will ship the SIM cards to your

258
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,580
particular given location and then you

259
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:58,920
can host them in the iot devices you

260
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,480
connect them to the mobile network and

261
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,240
yeah you can have them remotely

262
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:06,120
controllable for example so once you get

263
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:07,500
the SIM cards you also get something

264
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:09,060
called iot connectivity management

265
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:10,860
platform it's nothing but a web

266
00:10:10,860 --> 00:10:13,019
interface where you can actually see all

267
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:15,420
your sim cards you see here like a bunch

268
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,180
of SIM cards with MC and how much data

269
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:19,980
is available for that how much is it

270
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,300
consumed

271
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:23,160
um the APN so you can basically control

272
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,019
all the settings for the SIM cards

273
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:27,120
directly from this web interface which

274
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,980
is unlike like not really available for

275
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:31,019
a general SIM cards like we use for

276
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:32,940
common day

277
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:36,000
and with this web application I mean you

278
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,300
can also create API users developers or

279
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:41,160
you can also create an API admin then

280
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,720
you can activate SIM cards deactivate

281
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:45,180
SIM cards buy extra data volume SMS

282
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,160
volume so you can do plenty of stuff

283
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:50,040
through this web interface then second

284
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,779
there is something called iot service

285
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:55,040
platform itself

286
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,980
something like this like a Swagger

287
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,540
interface

288
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:03,120
where you have a list of apis and they

289
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,160
do a lot of functions first of all like

290
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:06,899
I think they should authenticate and

291
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:08,820
authorize whenever you want to use the

292
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:11,040
API because you're using the API and

293
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,180
then this is going to the service

294
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:13,920
platform and from there it's going to

295
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,200
the code Network so there should be a

296
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,079
proper secure access to use them and the

297
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,000
second once you have access to this API

298
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:23,660
so let's say secure access to these apis

299
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:26,100
you can for example like go for a

300
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,500
trigger for location based Services you

301
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:30,720
can always query the GPS location of

302
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,820
your devices you can integrate your

303
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:35,160
payment systems voice capabilities video

304
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,660
capabilities like you could do plenty of

305
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:39,060
stuff with these apis

306
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:41,399
um just to be a bit more specific

307
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,720
for example like you have so many

308
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,100
devices and then you would like to

309
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:46,260
manage their IP addresses you could also

310
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,820
control that you could control the

311
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,860
roaming policies of the SIM card you

312
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,779
could increase or decrease the data rate

313
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:54,660
bandwidth set sleep mode for your low

314
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:57,060
power devices whatever like you can do

315
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,040
plenty of stuff available through these

316
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,680
apis and being an admin I think you can

317
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,399
also do a bit more where you can control

318
00:12:05,399 --> 00:12:08,519
even read sometimes so imagine like with

319
00:12:08,519 --> 00:12:10,019
this I go to SIM cards like you could do

320
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:11,700
plenty of stuff provided like you have

321
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:15,240
access to these apis so this is just an

322
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:17,279
example of one of the platforms that we

323
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,500
worked with uh you see like you could

324
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:21,540
add a Sim delete the same update a Sim

325
00:12:21,540 --> 00:12:24,360
you could do plenty of stuff

326
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:26,279
and just to summarize

327
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:29,220
um so we have the iot devices that host

328
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,019
these iot SIM cards and connect it to

329
00:12:31,019 --> 00:12:33,240
the core Network now the core Network

330
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,060
knows exactly where are these devices

331
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:38,160
located and then it can actually access

332
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:42,180
them and as an industry you use the iot

333
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,880
service platform and then you query the

334
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:46,680
core network with the service apis and

335
00:12:46,680 --> 00:12:48,120
then extract information about your

336
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:49,680
devices you can talk to it you can talk

337
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:51,779
to your devices you can control them on

338
00:12:51,779 --> 00:12:54,779
them of them basically exchange data

339
00:12:54,779 --> 00:12:58,680
video uh like take the case of drone the

340
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,240
smart Factory could be a drone as well

341
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,000
like that that's just fitting in this

342
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,320
whole network exposure area

343
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,600
okay without security I think it's

344
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,480
pretty uh scary because through the

345
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,920
platform you see that there is access to

346
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,260
the core Network so the 3gpp standard

347
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,600
body has actually recommended to use

348
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,540
um oauth and then TLS for authentication

349
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:23,700
and then confidentiality this is I think

350
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:26,339
the standard uh recommended measure uh

351
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:28,260
besides that I think apis do generally

352
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:31,380
have rate limiting and logging

353
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:33,120
monitoring on firewalls I think these

354
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:34,500
are like additional features that come

355
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:36,120
with apis and maybe when you when you

356
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,480
purchase them and uh just for uh to

357
00:13:39,480 --> 00:13:40,500
mention like there are also like

358
00:13:40,500 --> 00:13:42,600
guidelines from gsma if you are someone

359
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,880
who is hosting an iot service platform

360
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:47,100
or you should know some of the things

361
00:13:47,100 --> 00:13:49,500
that that a provider should actually

362
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:51,300
care about while offering a service

363
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,720
platform like this to an industry

364
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,040
um I want to explain a little bit more

365
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,079
how this whole thing is working so like

366
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,420
I said once you get access to these apis

367
00:14:00,420 --> 00:14:02,760
you create API users and then you have

368
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,680
an API server where the queries can be

369
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:07,620
sent so the API server sorry the API

370
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,560
user uh first of all establishes a TLS

371
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,380
connection followed by sending the user

372
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,420
credentials like I think it's pretty big

373
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,459
HTTP basic authentication send the

374
00:14:17,459 --> 00:14:19,380
username and password and then get back

375
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:21,540
a token it's pretty much straightforward

376
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:24,000
like how you see apis in the normal it

377
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:27,240
world so let's say in this case you're

378
00:14:27,240 --> 00:14:28,800
particularly trying to extract the

379
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,959
location of your iot device so you send

380
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:32,540
an API request

381
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,399
asking indicating which in C of the SIM

382
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:37,139
card or like which SIM card you want to

383
00:14:37,139 --> 00:14:39,180
get information so you send the emcee

384
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,160
and then telling that I want the

385
00:14:41,160 --> 00:14:42,839
connectivity and its location status so

386
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:45,000
the response would be that it you would

387
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,920
you will receive the exact location of

388
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:49,500
this SIM card or in general like iot

389
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:51,839
device and to which network it's

390
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,579
connected what are the internal nodes

391
00:14:53,579 --> 00:14:55,860
that it's connected because you see that

392
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,540
this request is now going to the service

393
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,100
platform and from there to the core

394
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:01,220
Network so the amount of information

395
00:15:01,220 --> 00:15:04,680
that is sent by the core Network to the

396
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:07,199
outside world depends on the kind of

397
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:08,820
service agreement between the platform

398
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,180
provider and the mno so

399
00:15:11,180 --> 00:15:13,639
sometimes like information might be over

400
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:16,260
Overexposed so it depends on how the API

401
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,480
is implemented

402
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:21,680
this is some of the screenshots

403
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:36,300
put in a batch like if you have like 200

404
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,399
devices just send give me the location

405
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,380
of all my 200 devices and then it would

406
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,720
get back I mean same way you could do

407
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,820
pretty much so many other stuff for

408
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:48,480
example send downlink messages like we

409
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:50,220
can call it like IP messages directly to

410
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,620
the device you indicate the IP address

411
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:56,160
of the device or indicate the MC and you

412
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,079
can send a message directly to the

413
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:07,440
I suppose you can create a file and then

414
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,959
add your own master key of the SIM card

415
00:16:09,959 --> 00:16:12,360
and then push it to the operator and the

416
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,800
operator will actually take care of

417
00:16:13,800 --> 00:16:16,019
updating the key in the SIM card and

418
00:16:16,019 --> 00:16:18,000
also updating in the authentication

419
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,459
Center or the main database where all

420
00:16:20,459 --> 00:16:22,680
the SIM card keys are stored so imagine

421
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:24,420
like something like this going wrong

422
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:26,940
it's basically somebody has an

423
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:29,399
authorization bypass would be able to

424
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:32,160
upload whatever nonsense keys can be

425
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,680
possible to the authentication Center or

426
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,440
the main place of the database which I

427
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:39,779
think is is the key of or the heart of

428
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:42,660
the whole Telecom systems

429
00:16:42,660 --> 00:16:45,540
okay the attack model for this kind of

430
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,639
exposure looks like this so it's I think

431
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:50,160
first of all attackers should be on the

432
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,720
platform like should have access to the

433
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:53,579
platform so he has to have a business

434
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:55,920
relationship with the provider so

435
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:58,380
basically he can if he has a company

436
00:16:58,380 --> 00:17:00,839
like he tried to use the text ID and

437
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:03,240
then register obtain the SIM cards so

438
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:05,459
from there you also get API access

439
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:07,799
credentials to access the platform then

440
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:09,419
you have access to the apis and then you

441
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:10,799
can pretty much interact with the

442
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,119
platform

443
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:14,160
um I mean in such a case

444
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,380
um I think in an ideal situation the

445
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,720
or the API user should be able to use

446
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:23,459
only or should be able to talk to only

447
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:25,859
the devices that that belong to them

448
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:27,240
should not be able to talk to other

449
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:30,299
devices not even know if there are other

450
00:17:30,299 --> 00:17:33,059
devices but the goal of the attacker

451
00:17:33,059 --> 00:17:34,799
here would be to obtain data of

452
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:36,780
arbitrary users that are hosted on the

453
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,400
same platform let's say you and I hosted

454
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,320
on the same using the same platform

455
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,299
provider and then as an attacker like I

456
00:17:42,299 --> 00:17:44,039
could just get a contract with the

457
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:46,440
platform and then start probing the the

458
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:49,140
API server and see what can I basically

459
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,120
get out of it like depending on the type

460
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,700
of vulnerabilities that are there

461
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,919
um if possible to compromise the

462
00:17:55,919 --> 00:17:58,020
application server the API server let's

463
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:59,880
say it's also possible to penetrate from

464
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,020
there into the mobile code Network

465
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:03,480
because they are connected and nobody

466
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,160
knows like how they are exactly

467
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,780
connected because this is something

468
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:09,600
still hidden because uh it's something

469
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,700
between the provider and the operator

470
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,919
you don't know if there is a proper

471
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:16,440
access check before somebody can access

472
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,179
a code Network

473
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:18,900
um

474
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,820
regarding the skills or privileges that

475
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,140
an attacker should have because this is

476
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:24,840
all dealing with apis so standard web

477
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:27,720
knowledge and don't mention about the

478
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,340
number of tools that are available on

479
00:18:29,340 --> 00:18:31,200
the internet there's pretty of them to

480
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,200
actually do this kind of attacks so

481
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,059
because apis are quite new in the Telco

482
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:37,980
industry so some of the questions that

483
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,559
pop up in my mind is like okay are the

484
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,480
standard security mechanisms like what

485
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:44,280
we have seen before authentication

486
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:45,900
authorization confidentiality are they

487
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:46,799
sufficient

488
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:48,960
uh what about like business logic flaws

489
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,720
that don't uh show up unless like you

490
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:53,940
completely test the platform like but

491
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:55,260
it's manually intensive like I

492
00:18:55,260 --> 00:18:57,720
understand that but uh what about then

493
00:18:57,720 --> 00:18:59,340
firewalls like are they sufficient

494
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,299
enough

495
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:02,640
um to detect attacks specific to iot

496
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,380
Applications because this is quite a new

497
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:06,660
field and I don't think none of the API

498
00:19:06,660 --> 00:19:08,760
scanners or the automated testing tools

499
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,820
have custom specific attacks towards uh

500
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,760
Telco domain because I haven't seen them

501
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:16,559
um and overall like there is limited

502
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,360
knowledge on what kind of attacks can

503
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:20,520
happen on these platforms so there is

504
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,820
still like a lot of things missing and

505
00:19:23,820 --> 00:19:25,559
imagine like in such a situation if

506
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:27,179
there is an insecure API so it's

507
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:29,160
possible to compromise the aps server

508
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:31,740
and then get access to the industry or

509
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:34,080
the customer data and from there access

510
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,360
to the iot devices

511
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:36,960
um

512
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:41,280
or even core Network as well

513
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,799
okay so we wanted to get our hands dirty

514
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:45,419
and like get get into the like doing

515
00:19:45,419 --> 00:19:47,760
real stuff so we bought we contacted

516
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,340
like a bunch of uh platform providers or

517
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,799
operators and then I got the SIM cards

518
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,299
this happened during the covet times I

519
00:19:54,299 --> 00:19:57,059
was really big hassle because they have

520
00:19:57,059 --> 00:19:59,039
to ship the SIM cards to our location so

521
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,280
that took a while and then we have now

522
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,419
once we have the SIM cards we have

523
00:20:03,419 --> 00:20:05,100
access to the API portal we have access

524
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,960
to the platform whatever like we have

525
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,600
credentials to connect authorize plus we

526
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,580
have service apis to talk to the

527
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:14,340
platform just a summary of what kind of

528
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,720
security configurations are actually

529
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,640
available from the platform so most of

530
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,980
them use HTTP basic authentication for

531
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,880
API then some of them have follow oauth

532
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:26,880
further authorization or in general like

533
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,380
the whole procedure but some of them

534
00:20:28,380 --> 00:20:31,440
just use a shared token or a static

535
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,539
token for each API user you create so

536
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:35,820
you create I mean the point of using

537
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,460
static tokens is is not really a

538
00:20:38,460 --> 00:20:40,080
recommended way

539
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:42,059
um but there are like different choices

540
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:43,799
I understand maybe the platforms are

541
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:45,419
quite in a beginning stage it's

542
00:20:45,419 --> 00:20:48,720
understandable but most of them seems to

543
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,640
host them on clouds and use TLS for sure

544
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:56,400
to allow someone to actually connect

545
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:59,220
okay so in our analysis like what are we

546
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:01,679
trying to look here like because apis in

547
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:03,299
Telecom is quite new and then like we

548
00:21:03,299 --> 00:21:04,620
also have to have a different mindset

549
00:21:04,620 --> 00:21:08,760
when we uh look at uh these apis so we

550
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:11,640
want to find uh vulnerabilities in the

551
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,740
API configuration what about like input

552
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:15,299
validation then business flow

553
00:21:15,299 --> 00:21:17,580
authentication access control so all

554
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:19,020
these things we try to consider and then

555
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,340
like take a look

556
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:23,400
um can we find vulnerabilities in them

557
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,660
um but we see that there are like

558
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:26,580
hundreds of apis available for each

559
00:21:26,580 --> 00:21:28,380
platform like here there are like nine

560
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:30,840
platforms that we try to assess

561
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,760
um but they're like hundreds of apis and

562
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,260
multiplied by nine they're like

563
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,659
thousands of apis and and all of them

564
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:39,179
provide diff uh functionalities like you

565
00:21:39,179 --> 00:21:41,820
can send SMS or IP data to the devices

566
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:44,039
you can get the real-time location you

567
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:46,500
can update config so by sending an API

568
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:48,600
request you can update a configuration

569
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,580
in the core Network you can also like

570
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,500
control or track billing charging

571
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:55,020
operations you can upload master keys to

572
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:56,880
the to the operator Network so you can

573
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,400
do plenty of things and manually testing

574
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:01,740
them is like really like it's impossible

575
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:03,900
for us and then we wanted to have a bit

576
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,059
of systematic approach like can we do

577
00:22:06,059 --> 00:22:07,980
something useful and then

578
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:10,080
um see so basically what we did was like

579
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,360
we tried to select those apis that have

580
00:22:12,360 --> 00:22:14,520
a high impact on the business or like

581
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,320
the operation and the reputation aspects

582
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:19,500
of the platform so in that way we try to

583
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,299
see if we could do core injection

584
00:22:21,299 --> 00:22:24,059
execution or see if we can hijack one of

585
00:22:24,059 --> 00:22:26,640
these iot devices that are connected on

586
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,679
these platforms or see if we are able to

587
00:22:28,679 --> 00:22:31,260
bypass authorization and send SMS to

588
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,539
random iot devices

589
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:35,580
see billing fraud the possibility of a

590
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:37,559
billing fraud because like I said on the

591
00:22:37,559 --> 00:22:39,179
on the connectivity management platform

592
00:22:39,179 --> 00:22:41,640
you can actually track how much data is

593
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:44,880
actually consumed how much number of SMS

594
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:47,760
is consumed so can we Tinker with these

595
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:50,220
counters and then erase all the call

596
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,840
data records that are that are present

597
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:55,080
there or maybe can we set up APN

598
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:57,480
manipulation can we do like custom IP

599
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:59,340
addresses can we inject malware in this

600
00:22:59,340 --> 00:23:00,960
one so these are some of the ideas that

601
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:04,080
came up and then we tried to investigate

602
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:05,880
um I think we have to thank all of us

603
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:09,659
because OS API top 10 was quite helpful

604
00:23:09,659 --> 00:23:12,320
for us to to take a look at

605
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,360
these apis and then understand them but

606
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,220
most of the tools that are commonly

607
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:19,380
available for API research or testing I

608
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,760
think they don't really fit Telecom

609
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,340
applications for example like apis are

610
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,500
nothing but like parameters inside so

611
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:27,539
when we look at the parameters that are

612
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:30,140
generally used in fantastic or whatever

613
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:33,000
they don't really fit or match the I

614
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,679
mean the languages inside Telco is quite

615
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,960
different from outside so you need like

616
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,059
different parameters so we started to

617
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:41,220
dig out more in the 3gpp specifications

618
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,919
or the API design files next track like

619
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,780
some of the the essential parameters

620
00:23:45,780 --> 00:23:48,600
that we could definitely use and hope

621
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,340
hoping that you know we might find a

622
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,980
vulnerability in them

623
00:23:52,980 --> 00:23:54,480
well of course we didn't forget the

624
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:59,100
ethical sides of this because we did

625
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,960
we were like really careful while doing

626
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,640
this so we didn't do anything automatic

627
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,500
or like stuff like this we just try to

628
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,659
be more manual and then like have a good

629
00:24:06,659 --> 00:24:09,480
strategy while doing uh some for example

630
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,539
like take the posts post API request

631
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:14,640
like we don't post unnecessary or like

632
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,260
random stuff to the API server because

633
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:18,000
it really create it could create a mess

634
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,700
but I think what we heard from the

635
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,140
providers was that like none of our

636
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,820
efforts are like whatever analysis we

637
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:24,919
did

638
00:24:24,919 --> 00:24:27,240
they were not aware of it first of all

639
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:29,340
and then it really didn't disturb any of

640
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:31,140
the platform operation so we are okay

641
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,059
with that

642
00:24:33,059 --> 00:24:36,960
okay now I go a bit more into the design

643
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:38,460
risks

644
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,500
um that we saw with regards to this iot

645
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:42,179
service platforms

646
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:44,039
um probably in terms of Access Control

647
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:46,320
authentication and the amount of data

648
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:48,840
exposure that that they are

649
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,760
um that how they are designed actually

650
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,559
okay the first one is the platform

651
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,840
design and um

652
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:04,380
because like I said most of these apis

653
00:25:04,380 --> 00:25:07,380
like do provide a lot of features and

654
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,679
facilities for operators to like for

655
00:25:09,679 --> 00:25:13,799
Industries to do a lot of operations my

656
00:25:13,799 --> 00:25:15,900
question here is like why do Platform

657
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:17,640
providers like open sensitive functions

658
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:20,340
to even simple demo users because there

659
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:22,440
is no point in somebody like who is just

660
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:24,840
want to test the platform has access to

661
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:26,779
this key upload functionality

662
00:25:26,779 --> 00:25:29,760
and we also found that like you just

663
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,679
basically need simple information like a

664
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,200
tax ID or email address to register and

665
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,299
get access to this platform that makes

666
00:25:36,299 --> 00:25:38,340
it more easier for an attacker to just

667
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:39,840
get access because first of all having

668
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:42,539
an access is the key to attack these

669
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:45,900
platforms and what we saw was like there

670
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,360
was very relaxed customer verification

671
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:50,279
with many providers and when we try to

672
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:52,559
argue this with the with the providers

673
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,659
like we really didn't have a good

674
00:25:54,659 --> 00:25:56,820
response but I think I understand that

675
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,039
it's in the beginning of the of the you

676
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,299
know deployment phase and they would

677
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:02,159
really like to Market their platform and

678
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:03,779
attract as many customers as possible

679
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:05,520
and they want to showcase their platform

680
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:08,940
as well so that's something actually

681
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:12,419
bothered us then second one was having

682
00:26:12,419 --> 00:26:14,279
not enough username and password

683
00:26:14,279 --> 00:26:16,620
policies for AP authentication we see a

684
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:18,120
lot of dictionary passwords being

685
00:26:18,120 --> 00:26:21,299
accepted and some of them accept don't

686
00:26:21,299 --> 00:26:23,940
accept during the account creation but

687
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,500
also X but actually actually accept

688
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:28,740
during a password update so which is not

689
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:29,940
a good practice but I think it's

690
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,320
important to comply with the best

691
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:33,779
practices in this case then token

692
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:35,279
management like I showed not all of them

693
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:37,620
follow the oauth but some of them have

694
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,480
this um

695
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:42,419
static API tokens which are valid from

696
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:44,340
24 hours to one week which doesn't

697
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,380
really make sense because there could be

698
00:26:46,380 --> 00:26:48,419
some security sensitive applications or

699
00:26:48,419 --> 00:26:50,520
use cases that that require token

700
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,020
refreshment like every one hour or even

701
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:53,880
less so there should be more

702
00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,980
customizable to different use cases and

703
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,440
not just very generic

704
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:00,120
then we couldn't really find rate

705
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:02,100
limiting issues and only two of them

706
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:05,220
actually had rate limits in place and

707
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:06,600
some of them even though they described

708
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,520
in their documentation it's not really

709
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,919
implemented in their practice

710
00:27:10,919 --> 00:27:13,080
I'm a bit rushing because I see the time

711
00:27:13,080 --> 00:27:14,640
is running but anyway

712
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:16,799
um we see that private identifiers are

713
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:20,220
actually used in apps domain

714
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,600
because

715
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,940
these are the identifiers that 3gpp

716
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:25,740
always try to hide from the air

717
00:27:25,740 --> 00:27:27,900
interface uh over over the mobile

718
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:30,120
networks but what now what happens now

719
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,820
is like in apis these identifiers are

720
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:35,520
commonly used and it's basically like

721
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,140
exposing these permanent identities in

722
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:38,880
the applications domain and nobody knows

723
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,140
like how secure these applications

724
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,700
domains can be

725
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:44,159
so what we recommend is like to use a

726
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,500
general purpose identifier which doesn't

727
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,659
really

728
00:27:47,659 --> 00:27:51,960
link to permanent identifiers but the

729
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:54,000
the the problem here is like because if

730
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,620
imagine like you and I host on the same

731
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:58,020
platform it's easy for me to guess your

732
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:01,200
MC or iccid and enumerate you know based

733
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,320
on these identifiers it having a random

734
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,900
identifier like it makes the task for

735
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:08,700
the attacker like quite difficult then

736
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:11,700
having something that's easily guessable

737
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,679
um so this is an example for that

738
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:15,179
because what we see like when we are

739
00:28:15,179 --> 00:28:16,799
enumerating we see that some of the

740
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,320
error messages particularly show that we

741
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:21,659
don't find a particular subscriber for

742
00:28:21,659 --> 00:28:24,179
the given MC but on the other side we

743
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:26,279
see that there is a wrong customer ID

744
00:28:26,279 --> 00:28:29,940
given for a particular EMC it means that

745
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,919
this MC actually exists in our platform

746
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:36,260
but you are not authorized to access it

747
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,700
um I think another important thing that

748
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:40,740
with design was like whether using

749
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:43,020
firewall or is it by having a secure API

750
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,059
by Design because

751
00:28:45,059 --> 00:28:46,440
um I think in error messages like we

752
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,120
could really see what are the firewalls

753
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,919
and some of their versions being used so

754
00:28:49,919 --> 00:28:51,900
what we see that like when using a

755
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,799
firewall approach some of the parameters

756
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:58,260
suffer injection and some of them don't

757
00:28:58,260 --> 00:29:00,480
um but while having a secure API by

758
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:02,039
Design I think most of the parameters

759
00:29:02,039 --> 00:29:03,600
when we do injection or like inject a

760
00:29:03,600 --> 00:29:06,000
script they detect and then just avoid

761
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,760
or like prevent that that script from

762
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:10,919
being considered or like accepted by the

763
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:12,539
server

764
00:29:12,539 --> 00:29:14,760
um we also see a different inconsistent

765
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:16,919
security settings in the whole platform

766
00:29:16,919 --> 00:29:18,480
because like I said there are two things

767
00:29:18,480 --> 00:29:20,940
one you have service apis which are pure

768
00:29:20,940 --> 00:29:23,159
apis then you have another customer

769
00:29:23,159 --> 00:29:25,020
management portal which is a web

770
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:27,419
interface so if you and both of them

771
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:31,080
share some of the API parameters and if

772
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:32,820
you let's say if you fail to inject

773
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:36,779
using apis you can actually succeed by

774
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:38,399
injecting over the web interface because

775
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:40,440
both of them share the parameters and

776
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,659
some operators like forgot to have a

777
00:29:42,659 --> 00:29:44,700
holistic view complete view on their

778
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,559
different applications hosted on the

779
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:49,980
same Cloud so that that brings so that

780
00:29:49,980 --> 00:29:51,120
there are inconsistent security

781
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,658
practices

782
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:57,960
um malware SMS yes I mean SMS malware is

783
00:29:57,960 --> 00:30:00,179
quite a huge Topic in Telco but what we

784
00:30:00,179 --> 00:30:02,039
tried was like is it possible to send

785
00:30:02,039 --> 00:30:05,039
malware inside SMS to our own iot

786
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,799
devices and see if the platform provider

787
00:30:07,799 --> 00:30:10,980
or the mobile network operator detect

788
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:13,380
um those malware or like popular ones

789
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:14,659
that are usually

790
00:30:14,659 --> 00:30:17,880
shown on the operator websites like

791
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,880
but none of them actually prevents

792
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,919
um spreading this malware I mean imagine

793
00:30:22,919 --> 00:30:24,720
if there is an authorization bypass so

794
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,460
someone who has an access to the

795
00:30:26,460 --> 00:30:28,500
platform can just spread malware across

796
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,799
the whole iot infrastructure that is

797
00:30:31,799 --> 00:30:35,360
connected to that particular platform

798
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:38,580
um not uh not just because like I said

799
00:30:38,580 --> 00:30:40,320
there is also data over exposure so we

800
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:43,140
see that some of their SSH ports were

801
00:30:43,140 --> 00:30:45,419
actually kept open and was quite easy

802
00:30:45,419 --> 00:30:47,399
for us to access them

803
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:49,380
um and I mean I understand that these

804
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:51,179
are quite in the beginning stages but I

805
00:30:51,179 --> 00:30:52,799
don't see that this is going in a good

806
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,799
start so reducing exposure I think it's

807
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:59,340
quite an important thing uh to consider

808
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,659
um now moving on to some of the

809
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:04,140
vulnerabilities that we figured out were

810
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:05,760
like while sending a downlink message

811
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,460
like while actually trying to reach like

812
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,620
I said in an idle case I should be as a

813
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:13,140
platform like as an industry like I

814
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,880
should be able to talk to only my iot

815
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,559
devices but here what happens is like

816
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:19,799
the the parameter IP addresses uh I

817
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:22,260
think lacked any kind of validation so

818
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:24,299
which allows an attacker to inject any

819
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:26,940
any random IP address on the platform or

820
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:28,980
maybe attack or enumerated them and then

821
00:31:28,980 --> 00:31:29,880
just

822
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:31,799
ping all the devices that are present on

823
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:33,539
the platform so I think in this way we

824
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:35,220
could actually ping up to 200 devices

825
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:36,960
that are connected to the platform I

826
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:38,880
mean there are even more devices but

827
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:40,380
it's just that you need to change your

828
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,700
IP address range and you could still

829
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:43,919
reach other devices what happens in this

830
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:45,980
case is that or the impact here is that

831
00:31:45,980 --> 00:31:48,960
because like we saw in the beginning the

832
00:31:48,960 --> 00:31:51,539
data amount is quite limited for these

833
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:54,360
iot applications so you can attacker can

834
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,820
easily consume all those resources and

835
00:31:56,820 --> 00:31:58,799
then drain if it's a low power device

836
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:00,899
also drain the battery for them so he

837
00:32:00,899 --> 00:32:02,820
can basically disable all the sleep

838
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:05,700
modes and then just create a develop

839
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:06,840
service kind of situation so

840
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,000
authorization I think it's quite a huge

841
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,100
thing when it comes to these apis

842
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:13,559
another quite interesting funny thing

843
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:16,140
was I think most of you are aware of

844
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,880
something called Web hook so when you

845
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:20,340
create an API you can also or like in

846
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,140
the in the in the platform like you you

847
00:32:22,140 --> 00:32:24,960
have a facility to provide a web hook

848
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,840
URL and whenever there's an API action

849
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,820
request going on you get a response

850
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:31,740
bonds also being sent to that particular

851
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:33,779
web hook so

852
00:32:33,779 --> 00:32:35,820
take the case where we were sending an

853
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,980
SMS and then as a response we want to

854
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:41,460
see that SMS is delivered or SMS is

855
00:32:41,460 --> 00:32:43,200
rejected or whatever so this is the

856
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,940
amount of information as an API user I

857
00:32:44,940 --> 00:32:47,460
expect but what we saw was apart from

858
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:51,240
the SMS delivered information we also

859
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:54,299
saw the SIM card credentials like pins

860
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:56,580
books all the operator codes then the

861
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,380
current location of the SIM card the hlr

862
00:32:58,380 --> 00:33:00,059
ID the billing information whatever like

863
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:01,559
you just name it it's basically there

864
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:04,919
and it was sent as an SMS response which

865
00:33:04,919 --> 00:33:06,720
to me is quite surprising because that

866
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:08,640
is not an SMS response for me but when

867
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,620
we try to convey this to the providers

868
00:33:10,620 --> 00:33:12,659
they said some of the customers like

869
00:33:12,659 --> 00:33:14,279
actually needed this kind of feature

870
00:33:14,279 --> 00:33:17,700
well I understand but it's it has been

871
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:19,320
made generic to all the all the

872
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:21,539
customers so which which is not the

873
00:33:21,539 --> 00:33:23,519
right approach you should maybe have a

874
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:25,260
customized approach for each of them and

875
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:27,120
then tune your apis in such a way that

876
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,980
once

877
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,480
um like somebody's fancy doesn't

878
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:32,940
compromise somebody's security so it's

879
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:34,919
uh something that was overlooked I would

880
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:36,240
say

881
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,700
like yeah this is an example of the uh

882
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,620
the response of the API I mean I tried

883
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:42,480
my best to hide information but I really

884
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:46,320
felt bored of uh just putting yep the

885
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,120
blocks

886
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:49,799
um there is also access control

887
00:33:49,799 --> 00:33:51,659
misconfiguration that we saw because

888
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:54,240
there are admin only functions

889
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,980
um such as like sending binary messages

890
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:58,559
to the devices or updating APN

891
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:00,539
information billing information but we

892
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:02,039
saw that there were discrepancies in

893
00:34:02,039 --> 00:34:04,380
what the manual says and what is seen in

894
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,360
in practice

895
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,940
um like normal API users like let's say

896
00:34:08,940 --> 00:34:10,560
if there's a malicious Insider who is

897
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,960
not an admin can really exploit the the

898
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,219
functionality

899
00:34:14,219 --> 00:34:16,739
um that's provided over apis

900
00:34:16,739 --> 00:34:19,859
then of course we have to do apis means

901
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:22,619
like script injection as well to me it

902
00:34:22,619 --> 00:34:24,418
came as a surprise because most of at

903
00:34:24,418 --> 00:34:26,219
least six of them don't really have

904
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:28,379
protection against core injection so we

905
00:34:28,379 --> 00:34:31,020
try to inject and I think when it comes

906
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:32,639
to code injection like you actually need

907
00:34:32,639 --> 00:34:34,379
something to trigger that particular

908
00:34:34,379 --> 00:34:37,080
code so

909
00:34:37,080 --> 00:34:37,918
um

910
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:39,659
like I said in the beginning like there

911
00:34:39,659 --> 00:34:42,239
were different applications like the

912
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:43,800
customer management portal and then then

913
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:45,960
the service apis both of them share

914
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,060
common parameters so what happens is

915
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:50,520
like if you inject over the apis like

916
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,520
you can actually invoke that on the web

917
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:56,699
interface like you need uh to to execute

918
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:58,020
and access a payload you need a web

919
00:34:58,020 --> 00:35:01,260
interface so imagine there is an

920
00:35:01,260 --> 00:35:03,119
authorization bypass available in the

921
00:35:03,119 --> 00:35:04,859
platform so attacker can basically

922
00:35:04,859 --> 00:35:06,839
inject into

923
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:09,240
um parameters of arbitrary users and

924
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:11,520
then let them get them triggered over

925
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,400
their customer management portal

926
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,380
so having different applications and

927
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,720
then not testing them integratedly I

928
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,579
think it's it's it's it's really a bad

929
00:35:20,579 --> 00:35:22,920
practice and we could really expose that

930
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,440
one so in summary

931
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:26,430
um

932
00:35:26,430 --> 00:35:28,079
[Applause]

933
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,480
I think oauth and TLs are those standard

934
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:32,040
recommended like are not widely

935
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:34,200
practiced among most providers and only

936
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:35,940
two of them are actually not affected

937
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,500
with the vulnerabilities or the design

938
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,839
risk that we saw now

939
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:43,020
um and I think attacker can easily

940
00:35:43,020 --> 00:35:45,599
compromise uh I go to the platforms like

941
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,339
provided he has given the access because

942
00:35:47,339 --> 00:35:49,500
getting the access is the first key of

943
00:35:49,500 --> 00:35:51,599
doing an attack and that has been made

944
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:54,780
easy and lack of rate limits and strong

945
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:56,640
password policies are also like an issue

946
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:59,700
here and another surprise is like

947
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:00,900
script and core injection

948
00:36:00,900 --> 00:36:02,700
vulnerabilities though many providers

949
00:36:02,700 --> 00:36:04,320
did their own testing internal

950
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,880
penetration testing like how could they

951
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:10,099
actually miss this key vulnerability

952
00:36:10,099 --> 00:36:13,260
SMS and IP content inspection like I

953
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:15,780
said spreading malware through these

954
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:18,119
means it's quite common

955
00:36:18,119 --> 00:36:20,280
um though this is some providers like

956
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,660
said well

957
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,280
some our customers like don't like

958
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,160
looking into the SMS and IP data also

959
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:29,220
some countries don't allow by law but I

960
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,440
see like many providers are do have this

961
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:34,020
facility of looking into SMS or like

962
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,880
filtering them if there is malware

963
00:36:35,880 --> 00:36:38,040
spreading in them but in practice I

964
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,780
really haven't seen that even in 10

965
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:41,640
providers

966
00:36:41,640 --> 00:36:43,800
um but I think I missed that so in the

967
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,599
providers like some of them were from

968
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:47,520
Europe and maybe a couple of them from

969
00:36:47,520 --> 00:36:51,440
the states and one from Asia

970
00:36:51,780 --> 00:36:54,780
so we did uh of course like uh inform

971
00:36:54,780 --> 00:36:56,700
all the affected vendors one of them

972
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:59,760
really didn't turn back I don't know why

973
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:00,720
um

974
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,420
but I think the good point was like none

975
00:37:03,420 --> 00:37:05,339
of our methods like whatever we tested

976
00:37:05,339 --> 00:37:06,660
like didn't really create any

977
00:37:06,660 --> 00:37:08,280
disturbance and none of them are

978
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:10,320
actually got aware before we actually

979
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:13,800
disclose them so

980
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,680
um maybe a One-Stop shop security for if

981
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,480
you are someone who is in DUI body

982
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,280
security private service platforms or

983
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:22,079
something there is I think enough

984
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:24,720
documentation from gsma with regards to

985
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,160
security guidelines and how to follow

986
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:28,020
but I don't think this is the end of it

987
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:30,900
there is more to be done uh with respect

988
00:37:30,900 --> 00:37:32,820
to API security I mean there are like

989
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:35,460
plenty of API security practices and

990
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,140
testing

991
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,700
um

992
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:40,859
that has to be done I think to to secure

993
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:42,300
all the apis

994
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:45,960
okay some key takeaways so definitely 5G

995
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,540
is more secure than uh previous networks

996
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:50,220
but one thing we have to keep in mind is

997
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:51,020
that

998
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:54,540
from closed Gardens like the Telecom

999
00:37:54,540 --> 00:37:56,820
industry shifting to more generalized

1000
00:37:56,820 --> 00:37:59,040
and commodized Technology such as using

1001
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:02,880
clouds apis and VMS and Dockers so there

1002
00:38:02,880 --> 00:38:05,339
is more increased threat with 5G and

1003
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:07,440
it's not just targeting individuals it's

1004
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,420
more targeting like companies Industries

1005
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,859
it's like targeting critical

1006
00:38:10,859 --> 00:38:12,900
infrastructure

1007
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,460
um not always the Standard Security

1008
00:38:14,460 --> 00:38:16,680
mechanisms won't help of course they are

1009
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,540
a plus it's always good to follow the

1010
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:19,920
standard procedures but on top it's

1011
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,780
important to have additional security

1012
00:38:21,780 --> 00:38:23,940
practices that are commonly recommended

1013
00:38:23,940 --> 00:38:25,800
in the industry

1014
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,960
um one single API can actually take over

1015
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,940
the whole iot infrastructure that is

1016
00:38:29,940 --> 00:38:32,220
deployed and firewalls are always not

1017
00:38:32,220 --> 00:38:35,339
the best all right yes they do help in

1018
00:38:35,339 --> 00:38:37,619
certain ways but you never know like

1019
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:40,079
from where it's the API vulnerability is

1020
00:38:40,079 --> 00:38:42,740
popping out so

1021
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:45,960
I think similar to ovas top 10 API top

1022
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,780
10 it's maybe quite nice to have Telecom

1023
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:51,960
API top 10 probably it will frame out in

1024
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,339
in some years and then that will

1025
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:55,440
definitely help providers or platform

1026
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:57,960
providers like to have

1027
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,720
um definitely consider like while

1028
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:03,359
developing these apis because apis are

1029
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:04,800
this is just the beginning like it's

1030
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:06,480
like the network exposure so this is

1031
00:39:06,480 --> 00:39:09,000
something that was designed in the end

1032
00:39:09,000 --> 00:39:12,119
of 4G but with 5G it's or like open run

1033
00:39:12,119 --> 00:39:13,560
if you take

1034
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,460
um

1035
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:17,099
it's full of apis and this kind of

1036
00:39:17,099 --> 00:39:19,700
secured attacks will be commonly seen

1037
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:22,380
and I think it's important that take

1038
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:24,420
this research seriously and I think

1039
00:39:24,420 --> 00:39:26,880
definitely providers or like MMOs can

1040
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,859
definitely recording stuff

1041
00:39:28,859 --> 00:39:31,980
these mistakes and just have security by

1042
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:34,320
Design as a main principle and I know

1043
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,480
it's difficult but it's the only

1044
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,180
approach if you tend if you care to

1045
00:39:39,180 --> 00:39:41,220
install like connect critical

1046
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:43,079
infrastructure with 5G networks I think

1047
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:45,720
security by Design and proper like

1048
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:49,020
rigorous testing is the only approach I

1049
00:39:49,020 --> 00:39:51,660
recommended I would say

1050
00:39:51,660 --> 00:39:53,880
uh yep that's it with the talk and then

1051
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:56,099
if you have some questions comments

1052
00:39:56,099 --> 00:39:58,730
um yeah feel free

1053
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:05,650

1054
