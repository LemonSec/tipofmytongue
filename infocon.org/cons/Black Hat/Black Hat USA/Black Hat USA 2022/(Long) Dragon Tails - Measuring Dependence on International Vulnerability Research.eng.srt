foreign

3
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:13,740
hey everybody oh that is loud I'm Stuart

4
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,660
Scott I work with the Cyber statecraft

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:17,699
initiative at the Atlanta Council and we

6
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:19,020
work at the kind of intersection of

7
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:21,600
cyber security and Technology policy get

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:22,560
through a lot of cool cross

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,900
collaboration and the past couple of

10
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,000
years we've had the privilege to be

11
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,439
working on a lot of software supply

12
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,320
chain security topics and so we started

13
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:32,460
trying to think in kind of a risk

14
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:34,920
management framework looking for sources

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,960
of risk and sources of security and one

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,600
that's caught our attention recently has

17
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,040
been kind of the ecosystem of

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,960
vulnerability research contributing kind

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:45,360
of disclosures to companies and and

20
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:47,579
libraries and and all those code bases

21
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:50,039
from outside of the projects I'm sure

22
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:51,899
many of you all familiar with the kind

23
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:53,579
of the growing market share bug Bounty

24
00:00:53,579 --> 00:00:55,140
platforms kind of representing the

25
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:57,480
growing acceptance and uh kind of

26
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,280
investment in those programs and

27
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,320
Frameworks and it's it's a pretty direct

28
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,120
manifestation of the the many eyes

29
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,619
theory of security right more people

30
00:01:04,619 --> 00:01:06,479
looking at a better chance of finding

31
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:08,520
issues with it and they get paid in the

32
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,040
process and we've also seen more kind of

33
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:12,540
government initiatives working to to

34
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,880
open up their kind of intakes for the

35
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,640
same kind of information and all that is

36
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,200
governed by what's generally called the

37
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,820
coordinated vulnerability disclosure

38
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:23,159
process process it's you know unique to

39
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:24,420
different organizations and we'll just

40
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,240
go with CBD for now

41
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,619
but what really got us interested was

42
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:30,240
some data that came out of congressional

43
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,299
testimony in February in the wake of the

44
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:36,840
log 4ja hearings in in Congress there is

45
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,540
some anonymized breakdowns of where

46
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:43,079
funds went from bug Bounty platforms and

47
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:44,880
what we were starting to think about was

48
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,040
was where did those kind of reserves of

49
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,220
expertise and research localize and

50
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,720
where are their kind of bottlenecks and

51
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:54,060
the the big question we arrived at was

52
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,220
you know can bad policy or a lack of

53
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:57,540
good policy end up breaking that

54
00:01:57,540 --> 00:01:59,460
ecosystem interrupting vulnerability

55
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:01,860
contributions and significantly degraded

56
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,479
security as a result and can we detect

57
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:06,000
that happening in public available data

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,160
ideally

59
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,739
and the kind of perfect case study we

60
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:12,480
found for this was looking at the

61
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,239
process of disclosure behind log4j so

62
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:16,440
I'm sure many of you all are familiar

63
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,360
with Carnegie Mellon they have a pretty

64
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:21,840
comprehensive guide to CBD and this is a

65
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,819
little exhibit of how they describe it

66
00:02:23,819 --> 00:02:25,860
as pathfinding between telling everybody

67
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:27,180
immediately when you find a

68
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:28,800
vulnerability and never telling anyone

69
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,200
anywhere anything at any point and

70
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,760
trying to find that optimal path is very

71
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,160
context dependent but this was a great

72
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,080
example of you know a researcher at

73
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:39,720
Alibaba Cloud figured out the

74
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,580
vulnerability and reported it directly

75
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,319
and privately to Apache pretty promptly

76
00:02:43,319 --> 00:02:45,260
and they began patching

77
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:48,000
and pretty soon after he followed up

78
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,580
communicating that either on the 8th or

79
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:51,959
9th of December he'd started noticing

80
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:53,879
that the vulnerability was making its

81
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:56,400
way into more public forum which in turn

82
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,920
spurred on their patching process and

83
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,959
this is a pretty good breakdown of how

84
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,580
the kind of withholding of information

85
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:04,440
should work right you find the

86
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,580
vulnerability you don't want to tell

87
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:07,500
everybody just those who can best fix it

88
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,420
until it becomes more public and then

89
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:10,860
the utility of holding on to it

90
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,780
decreases and you need to get people in

91
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:13,980
the position to at least patch or

92
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,840
mitigate as best as they can and as

93
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:17,700
quickly as they can but what really

94
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:20,700
caught our attention was soon after all

95
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:22,319
of that started playing out there was

96
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,420
some reporting that Alibaba had been

97
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:25,680
sanctioned for how it handled the

98
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,900
vulnerability by China's Ministry of

99
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,599
industry and information technology they

100
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:31,379
were

101
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:33,180
suspended for about six months I believe

102
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:35,580
from a an information sharing for with

103
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:37,440
the government and it's not quite clear

104
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,360
from reporting publicly available what

105
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,120
the actual mechanism pulled was to pull

106
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,819
them off of that that Forum it was

107
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:47,099
either in the contract to be there they

108
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:48,659
had to share information and failed to

109
00:03:48,659 --> 00:03:53,400
do so promptly or a law passed in July

110
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,819
2021 and taking effect in September 2021

111
00:03:56,819 --> 00:03:59,280
requiring that Network providers in

112
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,659
China when they find a vulnerability

113
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:02,700
among other things I have to tell the

114
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,760
miit within a couple of days so we've

115
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:07,620
seen reporting claiming both of those

116
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:08,940
were the kind of legal mechanisms

117
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,700
involved but the actual specifics aside

118
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,519
the letter of the law the regulations on

119
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:15,360
the management of security

120
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,918
vulnerabilities and that's a translation

121
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:18,358
so there are a bunch of different

122
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:20,639
phrasings was kind of clearly violated

123
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:22,019
right Alibaba the network product

124
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,419
provider had the vulnerability and

125
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:26,940
didn't tell the miit within two days and

126
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:28,380
that's you know from the general

127
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:30,120
perspective of CBD how you should

128
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,380
proceed with that kind of information

129
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,120
right only tell those who need to know

130
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,979
until the information is more publicly

131
00:04:34,979 --> 00:04:36,300
available and then tell those who need

132
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:38,120
to mitigate

133
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:41,220
so the majority of the reporting on the

134
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,979
rmsb is very focused on what happens to

135
00:04:43,979 --> 00:04:45,300
vulnerabilities passed to government

136
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:49,080
early but our focus is on using it as a

137
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,580
really convenient case study to look at

138
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,040
this supply side question right can

139
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,900
something come up in either a legal

140
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,120
context or otherwise that will disrupt

141
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,060
that flow of vulnerabilities to those

142
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,919
who can patch it's very convenient

143
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:04,080
because as the the second slide showed

144
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,120
China is a huge producer of this kind of

145
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,460
research and work it also provides a

146
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:10,020
really clear timeline for us there are

147
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:11,759
only a few key dates we have to check to

148
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,100
see if anything happened and it provides

149
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:15,360
a nice kind of control group right the

150
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,020
law only applies to entities in China

151
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:20,340
although there's some some blurriness

152
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:22,979
around that but it gives us you know a

153
00:05:22,979 --> 00:05:24,240
view into what happens in one location

154
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,460
and what doesn't happen in others and

155
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:28,139
the pathway for a chilling mechanism on

156
00:05:28,139 --> 00:05:29,699
that research is pretty clear either

157
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:31,560
companies receiving information have to

158
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,960
rework their internal processes or the

159
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,240
researchers and research entities have

160
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:38,940
to kind of negotiate what the risk is of

161
00:05:38,940 --> 00:05:41,400
following proper CBD what the risk is of

162
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,259
following the law or at least wait until

163
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:46,460
there's some more legal clarity

164
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,139
and to be clear this isn't focused

165
00:05:49,139 --> 00:05:50,759
purely on China we've seen the same kind

166
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:52,199
of Dynamics at play all over the world

167
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:54,539
so for example in in Germany a

168
00:05:54,539 --> 00:05:56,220
researcher found a vulnerability within

169
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:58,919
an election polling app reported it and

170
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:00,380
was threatened with legal action

171
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,240
similarly in Missouri a researcher found

172
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,759
in the HTML and I think it was of the

173
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,759
State Department of education's website

174
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:09,960
that they could pull Social Security

175
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:11,880
numbers for employees and they didn't do

176
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:12,900
that but they were also kind of

177
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,759
threatened for basically reading the web

178
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:16,500
page and there have been some good

179
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,820
developments as well with the doj

180
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,380
declining to prosecute good faith

181
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:20,880
research whatever they kind of consider

182
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,120
that to be Anisa in Europe is pushing

183
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:26,460
member states to develop as governments

184
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:29,280
their own CBD processes and sizza itself

185
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,259
has also put out a binding directive and

186
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:33,600
I think the the deadline for compliance

187
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,160
is expired at this point but for

188
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:36,539
government agencies to set up their own

189
00:06:36,539 --> 00:06:38,039
processes

190
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:39,900
but that brings us back to what the the

191
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,880
question we wanted to take a look at

192
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,620
some data and try to answer is which is

193
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:45,900
did the rmsv create some kind of Supply

194
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,300
Shock by disincentivizing participation

195
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:50,819
in that pipeline of vulnerabilities and

196
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:53,400
vulnerability research and if so what

197
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,199
did it look like can we detect it are

198
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,539
there other weird things going on in the

199
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:00,000
data that we should take a look at and

200
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,160
does that Supply shock if it exists

201
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,080
trickle into the overall ecosystem or is

202
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,639
there some resilience built into the

203
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:07,460
system

204
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:09,600
and you know along the way too we get to

205
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,759
see a pretty cool insight into how those

206
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,500
vulnerabilities are reported by

207
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:15,660
companies and how that record making and

208
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:18,900
record keeping is done so to to answer

209
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,460
this question we started looking at

210
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,340
acknowledgment data in cve logs and

211
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:25,020
security updates from companies and we

212
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:28,860
focused in on Microsoft Apple F5 VMware

213
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,599
and red hat we wanted to get a nice

214
00:07:30,599 --> 00:07:32,580
breadth of proprietary products and open

215
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:35,520
source ones and to kind of really span

216
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,039
between consumer-facing products very

217
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:40,319
kind of in the stack and on the racks

218
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,240
software Suites and everything in

219
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:43,680
between and there's lots of differences

220
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,180
in how those companies manage that

221
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,860
information internally so getting that

222
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,000
kind of diversity in there is very

223
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,160
useful for us

224
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,660
and to set up that kind of nominal

225
00:07:51,660 --> 00:07:54,479
timeline of events to check against we

226
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,460
started with July 2020 which is the

227
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:58,080
earliest kind of public discussion

228
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,819
acknowledging that reporting requirement

229
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:01,620
in the rmsb

230
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,900
July 2021 when the law was passed

231
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,360
September 2021 when the law takes effect

232
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,520
and then possibly if we can get recent

233
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,800
enough data December 2021 where there is

234
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:13,139
a maybe incident of enforcement which

235
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:14,639
again we don't really know what happened

236
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:16,259
but the letter of the law seems to have

237
00:08:16,259 --> 00:08:18,680
been broken

238
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,639
of course those events don't exist in a

239
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,460
vacuum right so Summers of 2020 and 2021

240
00:08:23,460 --> 00:08:26,220
were also full of uh sanctions from U.S

241
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:27,419
government against Chinese companies

242
00:08:27,419 --> 00:08:29,039
that may have done something to that

243
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,259
kind of Pipeline and there's also a lot

244
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:33,240
of cyber security regulation going on in

245
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,860
China at the same time so even if we

246
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,479
find something and it lines up nicely

247
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,520
it's really hard to tell what causal

248
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,899
mechanisms there are without talking to

249
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:42,059
actual people on the ground

250
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:44,459
but this is our basic process we either

251
00:08:44,459 --> 00:08:46,080
downloaded things directly where they

252
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,399
were made available or used some simple

253
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:50,880
scraping scripts to pull those data sets

254
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,860
out and then the key things we were

255
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:55,459
looking at were cves the public

256
00:08:55,459 --> 00:08:58,440
acknowledgment date and the publicly

257
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:01,019
credited entity and from there we just

258
00:09:01,019 --> 00:09:03,180
tagged the entities to the country as a

259
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,740
proxy for their kind of operating legal

260
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,240
environment there was a lot of

261
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,440
information too about individual

262
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,360
researchers but we didn't apply that

263
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:11,160
same analysis to that part of the data

264
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,779
in part because it's a lot harder to get

265
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:15,300
location data and in part because the

266
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:17,160
law doesn't clearly apply itself to

267
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,899
individual researchers so much as large

268
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:21,240
companies but then we just batch them by

269
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:23,760
month and ran some civil tests to see if

270
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,100
anything happened on those key dates and

271
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:27,360
these are just the the inputted

272
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,440
countries to that process

273
00:09:30,660 --> 00:09:33,360
the data set I cannot tell you how messy

274
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,399
it was but it was very bad um lots of

275
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:37,019
these things are hand entered there's

276
00:09:37,019 --> 00:09:38,760
lots of typos lots of irregularities

277
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:41,040
there's really interesting things going

278
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,779
on with the dates so sometimes security

279
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:45,240
updates will include a cve that is

280
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:47,100
publicly knowledged afterwards but

281
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:49,380
somehow retroactively added but

282
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,300
sometimes they won't so there's lots of

283
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,620
fuzziness there and there's not any

284
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,140
Clarity really on the actual process

285
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,720
where you have a private reporting date

286
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:59,459
public acknowledgment date and whatever

287
00:09:59,459 --> 00:10:01,320
kind of backtrack data filling is going

288
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,660
on it's also hard to compare between

289
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:04,860
these different five different

290
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,080
ecosystems we've set up partly because

291
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:09,180
of how they organize the data so some

292
00:10:09,180 --> 00:10:11,220
are organized by pure cve numbers some

293
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,839
organized by effective products some

294
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:15,240
were organized by security updates and

295
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:16,500
that leads to a lot of overlap even

296
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:18,120
within the data sets so for example

297
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:19,980
Apple might update two separate product

298
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:21,600
lines to address one underlying

299
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,160
vulnerability and that would lead to a

300
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,019
double count

301
00:10:25,019 --> 00:10:26,580
um and last of course having to batch

302
00:10:26,580 --> 00:10:28,440
everything by month to keep things you

303
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,300
know manageably smooth makes it a little

304
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:32,519
fuzzier on the back end

305
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:34,019
but these are the data sets we came away

306
00:10:34,019 --> 00:10:35,580
with um and we're going to run through

307
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,200
Microsoft and red hat today those are

308
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,060
where we had some interesting results uh

309
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,100
apple and VMware had a null finding

310
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:42,420
there was no Supply shock that we could

311
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:44,640
see and F5 didn't even have any Chinese

312
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,040
tagged entities in its data set though

313
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,120
it was kind of an order of magnitude

314
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:51,500
smaller than the other ones

315
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:55,920
so this here is a easy graph orange is

316
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:59,640
China tag contributions and blue are us

317
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:02,220
tag contributions as a Baseline and this

318
00:11:02,220 --> 00:11:04,380
is representing on the y-axis their

319
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:07,320
proportion of that month's contributions

320
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,480
um and so over time you can see what's a

321
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,040
pretty typical story for all of our data

322
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,779
sets is early on the US kind of

323
00:11:12,779 --> 00:11:14,519
dominates the ecosystem and then as

324
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:16,920
other it sectors develop and as the kind

325
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,540
of receiving entities become more open

326
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:20,820
to International contribution you see

327
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,380
China but other countries as well

328
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,019
contributing more and more and obviously

329
00:11:25,019 --> 00:11:26,880
here we can take a quick look at the

330
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,720
quick

331
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,640
uh cliff dive that seems to happen

332
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,160
around one of our key dates July 2020.

333
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,200
so

334
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:36,240
these are some basic trend lines and we

335
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,279
see increasing Chinese participation in

336
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:40,100
this the Microsoft ecosystem

337
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:42,660
but a pretty noticeable and steep

338
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,120
decline there so we looked not just at

339
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,740
the proportions but also the raw counts

340
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,720
to get a bit more context and what was

341
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:50,760
interesting here with the Microsoft data

342
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:54,320
was that it was really the

343
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,940
continued like productivity of the

344
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:59,040
ecosystem despite what you could

345
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,600
consider to be the Chinese contributions

346
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,300
returning to some kind of meme that set

347
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,700
off that proportional drop

348
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:09,060
so this is not a no to our question of

349
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:11,160
is there a supply shot going on but it

350
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,540
doesn't seem to trickle out into the

351
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,100
larger ecosystem which is a little bit

352
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:15,240
reassuring

353
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,920
and then for the red hat data you'll

354
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:18,839
have to forgive some very spiky graphs

355
00:12:18,839 --> 00:12:21,000
early on there's almost only U.S

356
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,980
participation because the timeline goes

357
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,240
much farther back than the Microsoft

358
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,700
data but we see again a similar kind of

359
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,760
increase in Chinese and other countries

360
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,959
participating in that kind of reporting

361
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:31,980
pipeline

362
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,899
and then again we have a drop off but

363
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:37,680
here if you can't see it is between 2017

364
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,140
uh February to April which is a date we

365
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:43,380
have no explanation for and then again

366
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,300
that kind of continued drop-off resumes

367
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:47,220
an uproad Trend but stays pretty

368
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,620
suppressed throughout

369
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:51,180
uh so here's looking just at the

370
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:52,860
contribution counts right the raw

371
00:12:52,860 --> 00:12:54,660
numbers rather than the proportions and

372
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,940
this context is also helpful it seems

373
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,579
that that drop-off was sustained a

374
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:00,660
little more thoroughly than the

375
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,220
proportional data would lead you to

376
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,740
believe there was also just a following

377
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:06,660
drop off in overall contributions to the

378
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:08,760
ecosystem and what's notable here too is

379
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:10,380
that given that this is an open source

380
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:13,800
set of data points there's a lot more

381
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:16,320
credit given to individual researchers

382
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,240
that we didn't tag to any country so

383
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,740
there's a greater gap between the total

384
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,180
contributions and the by country

385
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:23,639
contributions

386
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:25,860
um and then finally for a bit of context

387
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:27,540
where you thought we'd throw in the

388
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,040
Apple data as well given it was our

389
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,160
largest data set and the one with the

390
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,200
strongest lack of anything you know

391
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,180
related to the rmsv possibly happening

392
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:38,399
so again early on we have that same

393
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,980
story of a lot of U.S participation and

394
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:42,540
we suspect too that a big part of what

395
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,579
leads other countries to contribute more

396
00:13:44,579 --> 00:13:46,560
down the line is just the market

397
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:48,839
penetration of the actual products in

398
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:51,000
those countries and as you can see over

399
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,800
time China becomes a greater and greater

400
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,360
participant as well as the other

401
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,620
countries which are just not shown here

402
00:13:55,620 --> 00:13:57,720
for a bit of clarity and here are the

403
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,639
raw contribution counts and you can also

404
00:13:59,639 --> 00:14:00,839
see what's interesting about the Apple

405
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,540
data seasonality and you know every

406
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:05,399
other month and then every four months

407
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:07,500
there's a spike in the number of cves

408
00:14:07,500 --> 00:14:09,300
addressed which might reflect some kind

409
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,040
of security patching scheduling going on

410
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,500
there but it's a nonetheless a really

411
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,420
interesting data point to find no no

412
00:14:15,420 --> 00:14:17,100
affected product particularly given that

413
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:18,240
we've seen

414
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:20,279
products focused on at hacking

415
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:23,040
competitions like the tianfu cup but

416
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,600
that's another consideration to give

417
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,980
this data is because we're capturing

418
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:27,480
pretty much anything counted as a

419
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,700
vulnerability we're potentially blurring

420
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,779
those kind of high impact

421
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:32,519
vulnerabilities that are more likely to

422
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:35,540
be tailored towards offensive use

423
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:38,040
so our kind of key takeaways from this

424
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:39,779
where on the one hand there doesn't seem

425
00:14:39,779 --> 00:14:41,639
to be what we expected to find which is

426
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:44,519
a clear drop off in any or all of these

427
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:45,959
ecosystems that affected total

428
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:48,060
contributions but we did find something

429
00:14:48,060 --> 00:14:51,540
pretty clear in the Microsoft data just

430
00:14:51,540 --> 00:14:53,220
not so clear what actually caused it so

431
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:55,440
that July 2020 date I mentioned on the

432
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,000
one hand it's kind of our strongest case

433
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,680
for for a drop-off because

434
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:15,120
um and we also have no idea what

435
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,620
happened with the red hat data I would

436
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,060
really love to know if anyone has any

437
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,620
insight but it's definitely something

438
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,540
worth looking into because our other key

439
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:24,000
takeaway is that the kind of reliability

440
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,920
of this ecosystem can't be taken for

441
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:28,560
granted you know I think generally it's

442
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:32,160
not thought of about as a supply but

443
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,959
we're finding that to be a pretty useful

444
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:35,519
way to frame how to build resilience

445
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,560
into it you know you can almost buy

446
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,120
security in that sense or you know

447
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,820
something close to it and we finish up

448
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:43,079
with a couple of recommendations for how

449
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:45,000
governments and companies without kind

450
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,339
of mirroring China's type of law can

451
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:49,620
invest in that ecosystem and and kind of

452
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,720
maintain its resilience to any localized

453
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,920
legal context shifts

454
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:58,019
so the first thing on those lines in

455
00:15:58,019 --> 00:16:00,180
that kind of preservation front would be

456
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:03,300
to harmonize not super rigorously but at

457
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:05,459
least in spirit CBD processes between

458
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:06,660
governments

459
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:08,940
um and private sector entities so that

460
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,320
there's not so much ambiguity for a

461
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:11,519
researcher who finds something and

462
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:13,019
doesn't know kind of what the rules of

463
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:14,820
the road are for reporting in the

464
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,160
ecosystem that they're working in we

465
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,899
also figure that particularly with the

466
00:16:18,899 --> 00:16:20,519
open source ecosystem investing in

467
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,560
vulnerability Discovery tools can take a

468
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,120
lot of that workload off of researchers

469
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:26,399
and can still be a way of investing

470
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:28,260
directly into security particularly

471
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,060
given that there isn't so much of a

472
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:32,459
officially set up bug bounty system for

473
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:34,680
the open source ecosystem although I

474
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:35,699
think there are a few initiatives just

475
00:16:35,699 --> 00:16:37,199
starting up actually that are doing just

476
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:39,720
that and then the third point that we

477
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,339
wanted to recommend was

478
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:43,440
by keeping track of where kind of the

479
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,060
flow of disclosures and vulnerability

480
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:48,060
research is directed you can get a sense

481
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:50,160
of if things fall off where it might be

482
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:53,220
worth investing in more research so for

483
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,079
example if an ecosystem starts to kind

484
00:16:55,079 --> 00:16:56,339
of dry up and they're not as many

485
00:16:56,339 --> 00:16:57,839
vulnerabilities found there each

486
00:16:57,839 --> 00:16:59,940
vulnerability found in that product or

487
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,620
code base is going to be more valuable

488
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:04,260
from a security perspective and you know

489
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:05,880
ensuring that the the kind of incentives

490
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:08,220
built around that line up and and funnel

491
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:09,900
researchers there before they have to

492
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:11,099
worry about how much they're going to

493
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:12,240
get paid for something they turn over

494
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,040
which is not necessarily clear up front

495
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:16,199
you can kind of build in not just

496
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:19,559
resilience to the supply but to how that

497
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:22,319
research Community is able to interact

498
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:23,880
with different companies and different

499
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,160
code bases

500
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:27,599
so that's kind of the you know the the

501
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:30,059
short story is though we're trying to

502
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:31,380
consider vulnerability research really

503
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,780
large as a Supply right a community that

504
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,580
has to be kind of invested in and given

505
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:38,039
some legal guardrails and protections um

506
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:40,620
and wanted to ask is it possible for bad

507
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:43,620
policy to shock that system uh to cut

508
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,780
off a large proportion of it from the

509
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:48,660
rest of the the community the answer we

510
00:17:48,660 --> 00:17:49,980
don't really know but maybe it's

511
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:51,780
definitely a not no and there are

512
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,980
definitely a couple of concerning drops

513
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:54,799
that we would want to look into further

514
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:58,140
and you know given that those drops

515
00:17:58,140 --> 00:17:59,400
didn't trickle into the broader

516
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:01,080
ecosystem it seems there is some innate

517
00:18:01,080 --> 00:18:02,940
resilience built in and I can talk more

518
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,620
about the kind of specifics behind that

519
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,059
drop-off there's some really cool data

520
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:10,200
points about an increase in unattributed

521
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,960
um contributions in the same time frame

522
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:14,820
but finally there are also like

523
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:16,440
proactive ways to invest in this right

524
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,580
we don't have to kind of wait for

525
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:19,440
someone to make a copycat law of the

526
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,179
rmsb and then start worrying about a

527
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:23,039
fractured ecosystem and a lot of those

528
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,679
initiatives don't only protect against

529
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:27,419
those types of laws but they build up a

530
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:30,240
stronger research community

531
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:32,700
so we've got a draft report up we're

532
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:33,960
really hoping to kind of incorporate

533
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,299
input from a lot of experts in technical

534
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:38,220
Fields a lot of people on the ground I'm

535
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:39,720
hoping to talk to some researchers as

536
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,520
well so feel free to take a quick read

537
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,620
and get in touch with us if you have any

538
00:18:43,620 --> 00:18:46,200
kind of notes or questions I think we've

539
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:47,520
got about 10 minutes left here where we

540
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,020
can do some q a which would be really

541
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:50,220
helpful from our friend but thanks so

542
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:51,179
much

543
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:52,930
really appreciate y'all coming

544
00:18:52,930 --> 00:18:55,200
