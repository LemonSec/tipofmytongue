1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
we asked our business customers for

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,600
their most dramatic security stories

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,819
they don't have any now when you're

4
00:00:05,819 --> 00:00:07,919
talking about a good story isn't the

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:09,900
best story none at all

6
00:00:09,900 --> 00:00:12,179
hey remember that one time the whole

7
00:00:12,179 --> 00:00:13,740
network went down because we got hit

8
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:16,139
with ransomware nope

9
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:18,539
see we've been using malwarebytes for

10
00:00:18,539 --> 00:00:20,340
eight years or more so we don't have any

11
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:23,520
scary exciting stories sorry no drama

12
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:24,539

thank you I'm on like my third coffee I

30
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,700
talked so much yesterday I thought I was

31
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,799
getting like every cold you could get in

32
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,500
Vegas I was croaking no it's just just

33
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,299

many friends

35
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:01,020
um in one place it feels like forever

36
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,079
and so yeah it's awesome awesome to see

37
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,240
everybody here so I'm glad you all came

38
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,818
back for the second day

39
00:02:08,818 --> 00:02:11,580
hey uh before I introduce our day two

40
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:15,060
keynote Kim zetter I just

41
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,060
it's our 25th anniversary and we were

42
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:21,180
trying to think of uh Keynotes that we

43
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:24,720
would find interesting that um maybe

44
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:27,780
explored some side angles that you don't

45
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:30,000
traditionally hear at a keynote uh for

46
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,879
black hat or Defcon and one is around

47
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,860
the media around the Press

48
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:37,739
and uh

49
00:02:37,739 --> 00:02:39,180
if you've been in this space for a while

50
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:40,260
you know there's sort of been a

51
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:43,440
love-hate relationship with the media if

52
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,599
um if you have a good interaction with

53
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,680
the media

54
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:49,019
or you and your company it could make

55
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:51,060
you it could make a big difference in

56
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:53,040
your career and what you're doing

57
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,440
but if you have a bad experience in the

58
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,060
media right especially today with

59
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,680
Twitter and social media it can really

60
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:00,180
break you

61
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:03,300
and so figuring out who the people in

62
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,340
the media are the reporters that you can

63
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,480
trust

64
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,480
uh is could be a really big deal and for

65
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:10,980
me starting out

66
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:13,260
to decades and decades ago

67
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:16,019
um it was fascinating to see that

68
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:19,140
reporters even cared what US hackers

69
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:21,420
were doing right so that was a big ego

70
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,659
boat ego boost wow somebody cares they

71
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:26,879
want to write about us and then we would

72
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,300
start reading what they were writing

73
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:32,459
they're like they seem to fixate on the

74
00:03:32,459 --> 00:03:34,040
color of our hair

75
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:36,300
it seems to be really important like

76
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:38,280
what energy drinks we're drinking you

77
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,959
know are you know all the color around

78
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:43,440
it and the actual there there

79
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,299
um was kind of lacking

80
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:46,980
and so

81
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,799
as we shared notes with each other like

82
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:52,739
who did you talk to how was the coverage

83
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:55,260
we started realizing there's a lot of

84
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:57,720
people that want to cover uh hacking and

85
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,760
technology and there's a few people who

86
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,739
actually can

87
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:05,280
and um and so we would share notes on

88
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,840
who those people were and there was

89
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,879
actually um some mailing lists back then

90
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,980
I think attrition.org had a list of sort

91
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:12,659
of known good reporters you could talk

92
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:14,879
to known bad reporters you would stay

93
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:16,978
away from that could you know weren't

94
00:04:16,978 --> 00:04:18,720
too interested in the facts

95
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,238
and uh and so we had some Adventures

96
00:04:21,238 --> 00:04:22,680
over the years

97
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,080
we ended up banning all of Las Vegas

98
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,300
local television from covering any of

99
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:28,620
our events

100
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,300
because they would do this thing where

101
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,639
yes we're so interested

102
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,320
and then there'd be like a blue-haired

103
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,300
person like here at the computer

104
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:39,240
and that camera would come in

105
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,759
and swirl around the blue hair swing

106
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,560
past all the lock picking and out the

107
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:45,600
door and it'd be like cyber criminals in

108
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,720
Vegas this weekend what you need to know

109
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,040
and uh

110
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:51,660
you can only have that happen so many

111
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:53,340
times and you're just like no thank you

112
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:55,560
television and so we focused on print

113
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:57,780
reporters and the print reporters are

114
00:04:57,780 --> 00:04:59,639
the ones those are your friends right

115
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:01,020
they're used to interviewing people

116
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:03,120
they're used to looking at multiple

117
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,280
sources their deadline is not quite the

118
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,100
same as the television guy

119
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:12,060
and uh and so we quickly pivoted toward

120
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,800
those are the people that we want to

121
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,139
spend our time introducing our friends

122
00:05:16,139 --> 00:05:18,240
to also

123
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,800
um it's not the only time that we've

124
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,060
been infiltrated uh by kind of ill

125
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:25,740
meaning uh media there's a Michelle

126
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:28,440
Madigan uh scenario where to catch a

127
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:31,380
predator if you remember that show sent

128
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:33,780
a reporter in undercover to Defcon with

129
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:35,280
a little hidden camera

130
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:36,479
and they're going to try to get

131
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:38,580
essentially underage kids to admit to

132
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:41,400
doing computer crimes

133
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:43,139
and uh

134
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:46,020
and so they didn't get a media pass

135
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:46,919
um

136
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:49,320
we knew this was happening ahead of time

137
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:51,240
a little bit we had a sort of a heads up

138
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,460
something weird's going on and so we had

139
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:56,039
like all these goons following her

140
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:58,740
and intercepting anybody before she

141
00:05:58,740 --> 00:06:00,240
could try to get them to do something

142
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,800
incriminating

143
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,479
and then

144
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:06,539
um and then I outed her on stage which

145
00:06:06,539 --> 00:06:09,560
was kind of a risky move to make

146
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,300
but I tried to give her a chance to

147
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,280
correct her mistake and identify his

148
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,720
media and she sat there in the front row

149
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,100
with her little hidden camera pointed

150
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,979
right at me like not not gonna outer

151
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:21,240
self

152
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,120
and so this is a long way of saying that

153
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,979
um

154
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:28,199
the history between both sides is pretty

155
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:31,020
fraught kind of like hackers and spies

156
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,060
hackers and government right there's

157
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:36,360
this love-hate relationship and so uh

158
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,740
when we're thinking of who do we want

159
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:40,259
that has a long history in this space

160
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:42,479
that understands the nuances of both

161
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,940
sides and has been there

162
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:47,100
um Kim zetter's name came right to the

163
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:49,800
Top If you don't know Kim she's been

164
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:53,460
what was it 13 years at wired she's

165
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,620
experienced Politico New York Times

166
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:58,259
Washington Post motherboard Vice you

167
00:06:58,259 --> 00:07:01,919
know she's been around and over time

168
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:04,080
she's evolved to reporting covering

169
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:07,380
election covering uh digital Espionage

170
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,180
covering

171
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,759
um traditional cyber crime

172
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:13,620
and um

173
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:15,180
so I've been interviewed by her a few

174
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:18,120
times and what I can tell you is

175
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,319
um it's never 100 comfortable feeling

176
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:27,900
because she is like has what I consider

177
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,639
um

178
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:33,020
knowledge Insight she has the Integrity

179
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:35,280
she's not going to shy away from a hard

180
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,380
question right it's not there's not a

181
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:39,539
softball situation

182
00:07:39,539 --> 00:07:42,360
but it feels real like you get done with

183
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,940
an interview from Kim and you feel like

184
00:07:44,940 --> 00:07:48,960
I survived I can do this

185
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,120
um and so because of that her reporting

186
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,240
I think is uh is very insightful

187
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:57,360
um and so I'm really curious to see

188
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,639
um how she has been thinking about the

189
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:03,120
last 10 years post Snowden

190
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,479
around well what have we learned

191
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:08,880
what have we not learned right what has

192
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,800
changed what is not changing and

193
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:11,880
especially with their long time

194
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,979
perspective looking back and looking

195
00:08:13,979 --> 00:08:15,419
forward sort of the theme this year

196
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:18,000
right where do we come from

197
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,819
but also where are we going

198
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:23,039
um and so it's really my pleasure uh to

199
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,430
introduce Kim zetter

200
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:27,550
[Applause]

201
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:37,320
[Music]

202
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,120
good morning everyone

203
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,919
it's great to see everyone after two

204
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,599
years of being apart

205
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:45,240
I wanted to thank Black Cat and

206
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,500
especially Jeff for that great

207
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,540
introduction really appreciate it but I

208
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:49,860
wanted to thank black hat for bringing

209
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,240
me to speak with you this morning I

210
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:53,100
think it is the first time that they

211
00:08:53,100 --> 00:08:54,959
have brought a journalist to do a

212
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,880
keynote

213
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:58,980
um they told me that there are two

214
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:00,480
Keynotes and one the first one is

215
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,040
generally done by someone from industry

216
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,200
in the government and the second one is

217
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,180
done by someone in the community

218
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:08,640
as a journalist of course I have to

219
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:11,519
strive to be independent and impartial

220
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,860
but I do consider myself broadly

221
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:15,420
speaking a member of this community

222
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,880
because I've known so many of you for so

223
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,779
long

224
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:22,140
and I feel honored that the infoset

225
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,240
community considers me a member of it as

226
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,320
well

227
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:28,620
so I want to start this morning by

228
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:31,920
telling you a story about a source that

229
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,360
approached me

230
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,600
uh this was a while ago back in 2006

231
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:39,720
when I was writing for Wired uh he came

232
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,800
to me with what seemed like an

233
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:43,620
implausible story

234
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:44,459
um

235
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,200
this was after a series of massive

236
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,580
breaches of bank card numbers that

237
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,380
occurred and the source told me that he

238
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,300
had a front row seat all the action that

239
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:52,560
he knew the real names of all the

240
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:54,540
players and that he was right in the

241
00:09:54,540 --> 00:09:56,820
thick of things he claimed he'd been

242
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:58,680
working for the FBI undercover for 18

243
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:00,899
months running an underground karting

244
00:10:00,899 --> 00:10:01,940
Forum

245
00:10:01,940 --> 00:10:05,880
so that he could see how the Cyber

246
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,500
criminals planned their conspiracies

247
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,740
sold access to hacked systems trafficked

248
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,839
and hacking tools stolen identities and

249
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:14,519
bank card numbers and even wrote

250
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:17,519
customer reviews like on Yelp grading

251
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:19,980
the goods and customer service of their

252
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:23,060
criminal colleagues

253
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:23,640
[Music]

254
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:24,620
um

255
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:27,120
he uh

256
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,160
he was talking about how the hackers

257
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:31,800
would uh also launder money through

258
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:33,480
digital currency in this case it was

259
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,300
e-gold the precursor to bitcoin before

260
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,640
it was launched in 2009. the source

261
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,279
claimed that he had been

262
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,320
um

263
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:48,120
that he had been flipped by the FBI and

264
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:50,040
it was a great tale that he was telling

265
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:52,560
but there was one problem he was a

266
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:54,480
professional liar he had started his

267
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,459
career writing bad checks and then he

268
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:59,000
eventually ended up as a mule

269
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,399
for Russian and Ukrainian hackers he

270
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,019
would receive high-end electronic Goods

271
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:05,160
that they would buy with stolen bank

272
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,000
cards then he would fence the goods and

273
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,160
then he would send the money to them in

274
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:13,980
Ukraine or Belarus or Russia using

275
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,839
e-gold

276
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,160
um so the sources claimed that he had

277
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,600
gotten flipped by the FBI after he got

278
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:21,839
arrested one day and uh during doing one

279
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:23,640
of his new operations and the FBI

280
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,200
installed him in an apartment in Seattle

281
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,140
where he ran this underground Forum now

282
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:30,600
there was no way that the FBI was going

283
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,220
to confirm this tale no way that they

284
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,899
were going to confirm that the source

285
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:35,760
had worked undercover for them

286
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,820
The Source had receipts as they say he

287
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,700
gave me the name of the public defender

288
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,200
who had witnessed the jailhouse

289
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,820
interview where the FBI had flipped him

290
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:47,519
and he had hundreds of chat logs private

291
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,079
chat logs from The Forum that he ran

292
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:51,300
showing the hackers planning their

293
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,100
criminal operations bickering over

294
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,720
botched deals and double crossing

295
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:57,000
partners and laughing about how no one

296
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,860
would ever catch them because U.S law

297
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,740
enforcement was too ignorant and too

298
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:03,839
unskilled so techno too technically

299
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:05,700
challenged to understand what was going

300
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:06,899
on

301
00:12:06,899 --> 00:12:09,240
so for the next six months I had to try

302
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,920
and work to confirm everything he was

303
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,540
telling me I tracked down victims of the

304
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,459
criminal schemes that were plotted in

305
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:16,800
the chat logs I got the public defender

306
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,360
who had witnessed the jailhouse

307
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,620
interview and he reluctantly

308
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:21,300
acknowledged that the FBI did indeed

309
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,339
flip him and I tracked down the former

310
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:25,019
manager of the apartment complex in

311
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:28,260
Seattle who told me that the FBI did pay

312
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:30,240
the rent on the apartment and also gave

313
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,339
him a phone number to call in case the

314
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:34,620
source ever got out of line

315
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:37,920
so I'm telling you this tale because it

316
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,779
could easily be a tale from last year or

317
00:12:39,779 --> 00:12:42,360
even last month not 2006. there's

318
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,680
nothing substantially different today

319
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,120
about how hackers run their criminal

320
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,220
Enterprises they still organize in

321
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:49,440
underground forums they still operate as

322
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,899
businesses in hierarchical structure and

323
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:54,000
they still make money lots of it which

324
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,500
they launder through digital currency

325
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:57,720
the main difference is they've had more

326
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,980
than a decade to perfect their

327
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,519
operations and become more professional

328
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,399
and now they offer salaried employment

329
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:07,760
to their workers and even paid vacations

330
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,079
but they still bicker they still double

331
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,120
cross one another and they still think

332
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:14,279
law enforcement won't catch them and

333
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:16,139
sometimes they're right about that

334
00:13:16,139 --> 00:13:18,060
so there's very little that's new Under

335
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,420
the Sun

336
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,420
um

337
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,639
as they say the details May differ but

338
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:25,139
the same thing's happening two decades

339
00:13:25,139 --> 00:13:27,360
two decades ago still occur today so

340
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,720
here's a ransomware story from 2008 with

341
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,160
all the same elements as ransomware

342
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:34,200
attacks today digital currency to

343
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:36,540
collect the ransom a victim caught off

344
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:38,779
guard

345
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,000
and

346
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,740
a Russian government that's not willing

347
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,620
to cooperate with the U.S authorities

348
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,660
what's new today of course is the size

349
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:51,120
of the ransoms 500 was large back then

350
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,940
today they run into five million dollars

351
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:56,279
or more and also the targeting of

352
00:13:56,279 --> 00:13:58,019
critical infrastructure hospitals food

353
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:00,300
manufacturing plants and a pipeline as

354
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,519
opposed to targeting individuals one of

355
00:14:02,519 --> 00:14:04,500
the big cases of course of ransomware

356
00:14:04,500 --> 00:14:06,300
was the colonial pipeline hack last year

357
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:07,980
which reached national security

358
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,540
proportions and prompted the government

359
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,579
to finally address pipeline security

360
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:12,899
after more than a decade of being

361
00:14:12,899 --> 00:14:15,720
largely hands off and it was a watershed

362
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,660
moment as they say

363
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:21,000
but if anyone was surprised by the

364
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,459
attack they shouldn't have been because

365
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:25,980
it was entirely predictable

366
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,620
when stuxnet was discovered in 2010 it

367
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,540
shown us a light on vulnerabilities and

368
00:14:30,540 --> 00:14:32,399
critical infrastructure that few had

369
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:33,839
noticed before the security Community

370
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,760
largely had focused on it networks until

371
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,459
then and now they had and they had

372
00:14:38,459 --> 00:14:40,260
previously ignored what were known as

373
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,300
what are known as operational networks

374
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:45,240
dot networks industrial Control Systems

375
00:14:45,240 --> 00:14:46,500
all of those systems that manage

376
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:48,120
pipelines and Railways and the electric

377
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,740
grid and water treatment plants and

378
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:51,779
Manufacturing and so many other pivotal

379
00:14:51,779 --> 00:14:54,000
Industries stockstep provided Stark

380
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,160
evidence that physical destruction of

381
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,079
critical infrastructure using nothing

382
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,600
more than code was possible

383
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:03,180
but no one should have been surprised

384
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,399
there had been warnings about the use of

385
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:07,500
digital weapons to disrupt or destroy

386
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,180
critical infrastructure a decade prior

387
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:10,620
to stuxnet

388
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,420
and the same year that stuxnet was

389
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,579
discovered operation Aurora was exposed

390
00:15:14,579 --> 00:15:16,680
many of you probably remember this it's

391
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:18,720
a widespread Espionage campaign by China

392
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,639
that hit 34 companies and targeted

393
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:23,339
source code repositories at Google Adobe

394
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:25,680
and Juniper and included one of the

395
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:26,820
first significant supply chain

396
00:15:26,820 --> 00:15:29,399
operations targeting RSA seed repository

397
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,440
the engine for its multi-factor

398
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,260
authentication systems Aurora introduced

399
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:36,480
the public to apt's advanced persistent

400
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,519
threats and the growing capabilities of

401
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:40,260
nation-state hackers the security

402
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:42,420
Community which had largely been focused

403
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,399
on Cyber criminals until then began to

404
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,339
focus more on nation-state actors and

405
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:49,380
the sophisticated techniques that made

406
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:51,600
the actions of cyber criminals feels

407
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:54,060
kind of quaint hacking operations became

408
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,620
more aggressive and more consequential

409
00:15:55,620 --> 00:15:59,220
the OPM hack the DNC hack not petcha

410
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,160
solarwinds but none of this should have

411
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,760
been a surprise

412
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:08,220
the hackers behind operation Aurora went

413
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:09,720
after as I mentioned source code

414
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:11,940
repositories through source code

415
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:13,860
Management Systems the systems that

416
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:15,899
track changes and updates to source code

417
00:16:15,899 --> 00:16:18,600
which turned out to have security holes

418
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,600
here's what Dimitri alperevich then vice

419
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,160
president of threat research at McAfee

420
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,740
said about it in 2010 the source code

421
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,899
Management systems were wide open no one

422
00:16:27,899 --> 00:16:30,240
ever thought about securing them yet

423
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,100
these were the crown jewels of most of

424
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,320
these companies in many ways much more

425
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:36,120
valuable than any Financial or

426
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,279
personally identifiable data that they

427
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:40,380
may have that they may have and spend so

428
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,779
much time and effort protecting

429
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:44,579
and here's what someone told me last

430
00:16:44,579 --> 00:16:46,860
year after hackers injected a back door

431
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:49,320
into the solarwinds software during the

432
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:50,459
build process

433
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:52,380
quote software makers had all these

434
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,300
safety mechanisms for detecting changes

435
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,800
to source code in the source code

436
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:58,199
repository but none protecting the build

437
00:16:58,199 --> 00:17:00,180
environment because no one had ever

438
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:01,980
injected malware into the software build

439
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:03,839
process before

440
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,119
do you spot the pattern

441
00:17:06,119 --> 00:17:08,459
there's a lack of imagination or a lack

442
00:17:08,459 --> 00:17:10,740
of anticipation about the next move that

443
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,839
hackers will make this is often the case

444
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:14,760
here

445
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:16,939
foreign

446
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,780
so I call this talk pre-stax Net post

447
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:23,160
stuxnet Everything Has Changed nothing

448
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:25,319
has changed because stuxnet in the year

449
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:28,280
2010 is often seen as a demarcation

450
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,540
insecurity between what preceded it and

451
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:32,940
what came after there have been a lot of

452
00:17:32,940 --> 00:17:34,740
real advancements in security since

453
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:37,919
black cat was founded 25 years ago and a

454
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:39,539
lot of advancements even since stuxnet

455
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:42,360
was discovered in 2010 but despite a

456
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,220
multi-billion dollar security industry

457
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:47,100
and an unprecedented government focus on

458
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,140
threats everyone still seems to be

459
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:51,660
surprised when threat actors pivot to

460
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,340
new but often wholly predictable

461
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,720
directions

462
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,220
there are a few things that truly

463
00:17:56,220 --> 00:17:58,380
Blindside us however the rest casts

464
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,360
signals long before they occur what

465
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:02,220
happened with Colonial pipeline last

466
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:04,440
year was foreseeable as was the growing

467
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:06,059
threat of ransomware and the problems

468
00:18:06,059 --> 00:18:07,740
created by security issues with voting

469
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,360
machines something I've covered a lot of

470
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,400
over the years Russians going after

471
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:14,100
election infrastructure in 2016 really

472
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,360
we should have been asking what took

473
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,940
them so long not being surprised by them

474
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,980
we have a habit of reacting to threats

475
00:18:19,980 --> 00:18:22,620
to threats after they occur rather than

476
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:25,440
preparing for them or of ignoring voices

477
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,539
of reason that warn of impending

478
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:29,820
problems only to scramble into action

479
00:18:29,820 --> 00:18:33,059
when they occur that is when panicked

480
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:36,299
drivers are lining up at East Coast Gas

481
00:18:36,299 --> 00:18:38,520
Stations trying to fill up a trunk full

482
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:40,980
of canisters with gasoline

483
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:43,919
or when election when election officials

484
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:45,780
turn Rogue and undermine the public

485
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:47,760
trust in voting

486
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:50,640
so I want to talk today a bit about the

487
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,380
changes in the security landscape after

488
00:18:52,380 --> 00:18:54,539
stuxnet and the changes that stuxnet

489
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:56,700
brought and the things we ignore until

490
00:18:56,700 --> 00:18:58,500
it's almost too late

491
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:00,660
but first for those who might not know

492
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:02,280
my work I know that Jeff talked a bit

493
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:03,900
about it but I'll just give you a brief

494
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:08,760
background I began covering Security in

495
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:10,980
my first reporting job at PC World where

496
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,059
I worked for just a couple of years

497
00:19:12,059 --> 00:19:14,160
before I moved to wired as Jeff said I

498
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,660
worked there I wrote for wire for 13

499
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,500
years until I left in 2016 and and I

500
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:21,120
started attending black hat and Defcon

501
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,580
during the early years when Defcon was

502
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,980
still held at the Alexis Park Hotel off

503
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:28,500
the strip that was when there were about

504
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,840
a thousand attendees to Defcon instead

505
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:32,820
of thirty thousand

506
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:34,679
um Las Vegas has always had a lot to

507
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:36,360
distract people from the conference

508
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:39,500
talks but at 3 A.M in the August heat

509
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:41,820
there was probably no better place to be

510
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,220
than at the Alexis Park poolcon as we

511
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:46,440
called it where you could Wade in three

512
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:48,480
swimming pools get lost in deep

513
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:50,760
technical or philosophical conversations

514
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,860
to the BackBeat of a techno soundtrack

515
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:56,400
and make lifelong friends

516
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,900
there wasn't such a thing as a security

517
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:00,059
beat in those days at least not outside

518
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:02,280
the tech press reporters in mainstream

519
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,900
media parachuted in to cover security

520
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:06,860
only when a major virus or a data breach

521
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:10,440
affected mainstream audiences this

522
00:20:10,440 --> 00:20:12,480
tended to produce mistrust in the media

523
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,220
a feeling that journalists didn't really

524
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,020
care about security except to spread

525
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:18,360
hype and focus on the antics of blackout

526
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:21,179
hackers but after the Snowden lakes and

527
00:20:21,179 --> 00:20:23,520
the DNC hack a lot of media realized

528
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,200
that they needed to have full-time

529
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,360
reporters on a security beat who

530
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,860
understand the issues and could really

531
00:20:28,860 --> 00:20:30,539
translate this Technical and complex

532
00:20:30,539 --> 00:20:33,000
issues to mainstream audiences and so

533
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,440
today we have a host of really great

534
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:36,960
reporters that are covering this beat

535
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,240
when I first began attending black hat

536
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:41,760
and Defcon I had a huge learning curve I

537
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,799
didn't come from a tech background I was

538
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:45,660
an English literature major I was

539
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,600
studying Joyce and Chaucer not Java and

540
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:49,919
C plus plus

541
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:54,000
and but if you were committed to getting

542
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,900
things right and had genuine curiosity

543
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:59,880
people were open and willing to talk and

544
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:01,620
from the first days I had a seasoned

545
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:04,020
group of hackers and security Pros that

546
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,880
helped me sort through out sort through

547
00:21:05,880 --> 00:21:08,160
all of the technical details and avoid

548
00:21:08,160 --> 00:21:11,539
and sidestep the hype

549
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,179
so uh in those days I covered Wikileaks

550
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:16,740
and Julian Assange before they became

551
00:21:16,740 --> 00:21:19,080
really household names I covered the

552
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,120
early years of their first leagues I

553
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:23,400
broke the story with a colleague about

554
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,200
Chelsea Manning's arrest for leaking

555
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:29,520
government documents and I uh covered

556
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:30,980
that trial

557
00:21:30,980 --> 00:21:33,860
uh at the NSA campus

558
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:37,260
I exposed a secret at T room in Missouri

559
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,240
used by the NSA to spy on internet

560
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:41,840
traffic this was years before Snowden

561
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:44,520
exposed the surveillance program in its

562
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,400
broad swath

563
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:49,440
and I wrote numerous stories about the

564
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,960
karting underground and about election

565
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,179
security trying to bring attention to

566
00:21:54,179 --> 00:21:55,440
something few people wanted to pay

567
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,400
attention to back then

568
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:04,980
and then uh finally uh something shifted

569
00:22:04,980 --> 00:22:08,760
in 2010 with the discovery of stuxnet uh

570
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,380
when the Aurora campaign and stuxnet

571
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,720
occurred uh the much of my focus of

572
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,880
coverage turned to nation state hackers

573
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,400
uh digital infrastructure and of course

574
00:22:17,400 --> 00:22:19,740
cyber War which brings me to what I want

575
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:21,960
to talk about now which are the changes

576
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:25,100
that stuck snap brought

577
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:29,220
so aside from introducing

578
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,960
uh

579
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,400
sorry I've lost my place here

580
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:41,520
so aside from introducing the world to

581
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:43,500
cyber warfare stuxnet brought about four

582
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,380
major changes in security the first one

583
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,659
was a trickle-down effect of techniques

584
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:50,880
and tools prior to stuxnet Innovations

585
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,440
and computer attacks were driven largely

586
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,120
by the criminal underground with

587
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:55,740
nation-state hackers learning novel

588
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:57,659
techniques from hackers and researchers

589
00:22:57,659 --> 00:23:00,000
but after stuxnet the tools and

590
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,799
techniques that nation states developed

591
00:23:01,799 --> 00:23:03,480
began trickling down to the criminal

592
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,419
underground instead of government

593
00:23:05,419 --> 00:23:07,799
learning from the underground the

594
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:09,120
underground was starting to learn from

595
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,059
Government after Dooku maybe many of you

596
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:13,919
remember this this was a spy tool that

597
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:15,120
was created by some of the same team

598
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:17,580
behind stuxnet after Dooku was

599
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:20,580
discovered in 2011 exploits attacking

600
00:23:20,580 --> 00:23:22,380
the same font rendering vulnerability

601
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:25,140
that Dooku attacked were added to Tool

602
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:26,520
kits sold in the criminal underground

603
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,520
and it wasn't a year before it was the

604
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,140
most commonly targeted vulnerability

605
00:23:31,140 --> 00:23:33,240
used to install banking Trojans and

606
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:35,280
other malware the same thing occurred

607
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:38,220
with the infamous dot lnk vulnerability

608
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:43,140
that stux Nets used uh in 2016 oops

609
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:46,620
sorry in 2016 six years after stuxnet

610
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:49,559
exploited it uh the dot lnk

611
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:52,260
vulnerability accounted for 25 of all

612
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:54,960
exploits used Microsoft had patched the

613
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:58,620
vulnerability back in 2010 but in 2015

614
00:23:58,620 --> 00:24:01,380
research researchers discovered that the

615
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,840
patch was ineffective and hackers were

616
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:06,360
still exploiting it

617
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:09,720
so the next uh big change that stuxnet

618
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:12,000
brought was the launch of a cyber arms

619
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,700
race among nations this heralded the

620
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:17,760
militarization of cyberspace stuxnet

621
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,620
demonstrated the viability of resolving

622
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,020
geopolitical conflicts through cyber

623
00:24:22,020 --> 00:24:24,120
attacks and suddenly everyone wanted in

624
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:26,100
the game before only a handful of

625
00:24:26,100 --> 00:24:28,320
Nations had offensive hacking programs

626
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,059
but after stuxnet many launched their

627
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:32,100
own cyber commands for spying and

628
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:34,740
destructive attacks including Iran the

629
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:36,840
target of stuxnet where an official told

630
00:24:36,840 --> 00:24:39,000
University students to prepare for the

631
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,740
coming cyber war with the country's

632
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:42,539
enemies

633
00:24:42,539 --> 00:24:44,580
the next thing that sucksnet brought was

634
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:47,039
the political the politicization of

635
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,200
security research and defense

636
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,419
stuxnet had conducted itself throughout

637
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:53,940
South stealth sabotage for three years

638
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:56,460
from 2017 to 2010 before it was caught

639
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,220
until workers at an anti-virus firm in

640
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:02,700
Belarus discovered it and researchers at

641
00:25:02,700 --> 00:25:05,039
Symantec and others around the world uh

642
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,320
reverse engineered the digital weapon to

643
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:09,360
determine what it was designed to do

644
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,640
the developers behind stexnet probably

645
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:14,360
assumed Iranians didn't have the skills

646
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,280
to uncover or decipher the malicious

647
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,620
code but they didn't count on the global

648
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,200
cyber security Community helping them

649
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,419
and with stuxed at a new world a new

650
00:25:24,419 --> 00:25:26,460
world order was established in which

651
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,020
security researchers became the

652
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:30,600
unwitting draftees in a new militia one

653
00:25:30,600 --> 00:25:32,159
enlisted to dismantle the digital

654
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,260
weapons that nations lobbed against each

655
00:25:34,260 --> 00:25:36,600
other this created new ethical dilemmas

656
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,580
for researchers caught between the needs

657
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:40,500
of customers and the interests of an

658
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:43,020
intelligence agency if stuxnet announced

659
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:45,299
the militarization of cyberspace it also

660
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:46,919
signaled the politicization of security

661
00:25:46,919 --> 00:25:49,140
research in which digital Defenders

662
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:51,480
might be asked to look the other way to

663
00:25:51,480 --> 00:25:53,580
avoid destroying the covert operations

664
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,320
of their government

665
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:58,140
there's a new good guy this is a quote

666
00:25:58,140 --> 00:25:59,700
from Eric chin from Symantec there's a

667
00:25:59,700 --> 00:26:01,500
new good guy and bad guy question here

668
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,840
that puts us potentially in a very good

669
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:06,419
very difficult situation this is Eric

670
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:08,700
chin who told me this back in 2012 after

671
00:26:08,700 --> 00:26:10,740
they'd finished deciphering stuxnet

672
00:26:10,740 --> 00:26:13,140
their research hadn't been marred by

673
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:15,419
political influence no one had tried to

674
00:26:15,419 --> 00:26:17,400
to stop semantic researchers from

675
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,400
digging into stuxnet no one had stopped

676
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:22,740
them from publishing their findings but

677
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:24,299
Jen knew that might that might not

678
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:26,760
always be the case and if his team was

679
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,500
ever forced to choose between customers

680
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:31,500
and government interests he said uh

681
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,120
quote it's going to be a very hard

682
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:35,899
question to answer

683
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:38,700
the last thing that stuxnet did was

684
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:41,039
introduce the security Community to a

685
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,480
world of vulnerabilities and critical

686
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:44,820
infrastructure as I mentioned earlier

687
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,260
stuxat brought awareness about

688
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:48,120
vulnerabilities in the systems that

689
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,220
operate pipelines water treatment plants

690
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,980
Etc and once security researchers turned

691
00:26:52,980 --> 00:26:54,419
their sites to Industrial Control

692
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:55,980
Systems they found a host of security

693
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:58,500
vulnerabilities in the software but not

694
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:01,200
just that also basic architectural

695
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:02,640
problems that could never be fixed with

696
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,400
a patch uh and with so many systems

697
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:07,440
directly connected to the internet cyber

698
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:09,840
security suddenly became uh interlinked

699
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,760
with National Security

700
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,860
but again this shouldn't have surprised

701
00:27:13,860 --> 00:27:15,240
anyone

702
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,039
so let's look at what we would have seen

703
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,240
had we been paying attention

704
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,000
in 1997 after Timothy McVeigh blew up a

705
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,640
federal building in Oklahoma the marsh

706
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,500
commission was tasked with looking into

707
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:30,059
ways that other critical infrastructure

708
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:31,679
might be open to attack either

709
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,480
physically or through digital attacks

710
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:35,700
and in the final report they produced

711
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:37,380
the Commissioners warned against a

712
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:39,600
growing Trend toward connecting critical

713
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:42,299
control systems for oil gas and

714
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:45,320
electricity to the internet

715
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,659
they wrote the capability to to do harm

716
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:50,940
is growing at an alarming rate and we

717
00:27:50,940 --> 00:27:52,679
have little defense against it this was

718
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:55,380
25 years ago commands sent to the

719
00:27:55,380 --> 00:27:56,880
command control computer at a power

720
00:27:56,880 --> 00:28:00,059
plant could be just as devastating as a

721
00:28:00,059 --> 00:28:03,440
backpack full of explosives

722
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,100
we should attend to our critical

723
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,900
foundations before we are confronted

724
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:09,659
with a crisis not afterward waiting for

725
00:28:09,659 --> 00:28:11,880
disaster would prove as expensive as it

726
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,760
would be irresponsible

727
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:16,919
a second report released the same year

728
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:18,659
by the White House National Security

729
00:28:18,659 --> 00:28:20,640
telecommunications advisory committee

730
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,460
echoed exactly what they'd said writing

731
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,200
that an electronic Intruder could dial

732
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,600
into an unprotected port and reset the

733
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:29,279
breaker to a higher level of Tolerance

734
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:31,380
than the device being protected by the

735
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:33,419
breaker can withstand it would be

736
00:28:33,419 --> 00:28:35,159
possible to physically destroy a given

737
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:37,440
piece of equipment within a substation

738
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,779
the electric sector because it's heavily

739
00:28:39,779 --> 00:28:42,480
regulated did actually heed the warnings

740
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,179
and over time did eventually become more

741
00:28:45,179 --> 00:28:46,980
secure but a lot of other critical

742
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:48,900
infrastructure became more connected and

743
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,940
more insecure

744
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,740
when Colonial pipeline was hacked last

745
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:54,659
year many were surprised at how quickly

746
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:56,340
the pump the company paid the ransom

747
00:28:56,340 --> 00:28:58,620
surely a business this big and critical

748
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:01,200
to U.S economy as Colonial pipeline is

749
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:04,080
they Supply 45 of fuel to the east coast

750
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,240
which amounts to about 2.5 million

751
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,120
barrels of fuel daily surely it had

752
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:10,919
sufficient backups and a response plan

753
00:29:10,919 --> 00:29:12,360
in place that it wouldn't need to pay

754
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:15,020
the ransom

755
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:19,320
but as the company's CEO told lawmakers

756
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:22,080
on Capitol Hill months later although it

757
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:24,360
did have an emergency response plan that

758
00:29:24,360 --> 00:29:26,760
response plan didn't didn't include

759
00:29:26,760 --> 00:29:28,919
ransomware attack and even though

760
00:29:28,919 --> 00:29:30,899
ransomware attackers had been targeting

761
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:34,200
critical infrastructure since 2015.

762
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:36,419
so the signs were there if Colonial

763
00:29:36,419 --> 00:29:38,580
pipeline had looked

764
00:29:38,580 --> 00:29:41,880
in 2019 just two years before Colonial

765
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:44,399
pipeline was hit Temple University began

766
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:47,039
compiling statistics on ransomware that

767
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:48,360
targeted critical infrastructure

768
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,640
critical infrastructure of course being

769
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,860
the defined being defined as an entity

770
00:29:52,860 --> 00:29:55,440
within the 16 government categories

771
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,559
designated by the government

772
00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:01,440
based just on incidents reported in the

773
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,500
media or publicly exposed by security

774
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,960
firms Temple researchers counted some

775
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,000
400 ransomware attacks on critical

776
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:12,559
infrastructure in 2020 and a total of

777
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:15,899
1246 attacks between November 13 and

778
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:18,840
June 30th 2022.

779
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:21,120
these weren't just attacks on hospitals

780
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,260
which of course had been a big Target

781
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:25,140
for ransomware actors in 2016 but these

782
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,940
were also targeting oil and gas

783
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:29,159
facilities and the attackers weren't

784
00:30:29,159 --> 00:30:31,380
just targeting I.T systems they were

785
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:34,320
already going after the OT networks that

786
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,559
are controlling the critical processes

787
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:39,960
in 2020 the year before Colonial

788
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:42,299
pipeline was hit Mandan reported that

789
00:30:42,299 --> 00:30:44,640
seven ransomware families had struck

790
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,039
industrial industrial organizations

791
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,460
since 2017 resulting in significant

792
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:52,200
disruptions and delays in production and

793
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,419
delivery of goods and services

794
00:30:53,419 --> 00:30:55,440
ransomware actors were becoming more

795
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:57,600
sophisticated Mandy and said conducting

796
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,520
internal reconnaissance in order to

797
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,200
determine which systems were the most

798
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,120
critical to production so that they

799
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,799
could Target those and demand a higher

800
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,620
Ransom both mandiant and dragos reported

801
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:09,240
that ransomware targeting industrial

802
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,700
organizations contained kill lists of

803
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,020
more than one thousand critical

804
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:15,480
processes that they were designed to

805
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:18,480
Halt before they initiated the

806
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:20,820
ransomware or the encryption and

807
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:23,779
demanded a ransom

808
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:28,440
so if this wasn't warning enough

809
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:32,580
that same year 2020 dhs's cyber security

810
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,320
infrastructure and Security Agency

811
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,659
published an alert warning specifically

812
00:31:36,659 --> 00:31:38,100
about ransomware attacks against

813
00:31:38,100 --> 00:31:40,500
pipelines it described an attack against

814
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,500
a natural gas compression facility that

815
00:31:43,500 --> 00:31:45,960
began with a phishing attack against the

816
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,360
in the I.T Network and once the

817
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:50,340
attackers got into the I.T Network they

818
00:31:50,340 --> 00:31:52,140
made their way to the corporate from the

819
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,279
corporate Network to the OT Network

820
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:54,919
because they weren't properly segmented

821
00:31:54,919 --> 00:31:58,260
and spread to the latter and once the um

822
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:01,380
the ransom were engaged The Operators

823
00:32:01,380 --> 00:32:03,120
were prevented from obtaining real-time

824
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,399
Control Data and it forced the plant to

825
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:08,399
close down operations for two days the

826
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:10,200
plant didn't have a response plan at all

827
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,059
for cyber attacks

828
00:32:12,059 --> 00:32:15,419
in its 2020 alerts sisa advised Pipeline

829
00:32:15,419 --> 00:32:16,799
and other critical infrastructure owners

830
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:18,779
to have a response plan in place to

831
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:20,760
conduct red team exercises to simulate

832
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,159
attacks and test responses but put

833
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:24,919
backups offline

834
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:28,980
or only on um fully segment segmented

835
00:32:28,980 --> 00:32:31,080
networks and to build redundant

836
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:33,120
workflows so they could maintain

837
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,980
critical operations in the event of an

838
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:35,880
attack

839
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,100
a year later the ransomware struck

840
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:39,659
Colonial pipeline

841
00:32:39,659 --> 00:32:42,539
the attackers got in through the

842
00:32:42,539 --> 00:32:44,580
company's VPN using an employee password

843
00:32:44,580 --> 00:32:46,919
a password a worker had apparently

844
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:49,980
reused Elsewhere on on other networks

845
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:52,799
because mandiant found the password on

846
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:55,260
leaked passwords online that have been

847
00:32:55,260 --> 00:32:57,059
stolen in another breach though it's not

848
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:58,860
clear if the colonial pipeline hacker

849
00:32:58,860 --> 00:33:00,899
actually obtained the password that way

850
00:33:00,899 --> 00:33:03,299
but the VPN account was a Legacy account

851
00:33:03,299 --> 00:33:05,340
that hadn't been disabled and it also

852
00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:07,500
wasn't using multi-factor authentication

853
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:09,600
so it created a clear path for the

854
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,919
attackers to get in once they had the

855
00:33:10,919 --> 00:33:11,820
password

856
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:14,039
The ransomware Struck around 5 a.m on

857
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:16,320
May 7th and by 6 a.m the company had

858
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,440
shut down its 5 500 Mile pipeline

859
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:22,140
by late afternoon CEO Joseph Blount

860
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:24,179
decided to pay the ransom which was sent

861
00:33:24,179 --> 00:33:26,460
out the next day and as we all now know

862
00:33:26,460 --> 00:33:28,679
the pipeline was down for nearly a week

863
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:30,539
and resulted in a Cascade of effects

864
00:33:30,539 --> 00:33:31,980
that Colonial pipeline really couldn't

865
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,960
control at that point when frenzied

866
00:33:33,960 --> 00:33:36,179
customers consumers initiated a panic

867
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:38,519
buy the hack itself didn't inflate

868
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:40,799
prices it didn't cause a fuel shortage

869
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:44,519
but people responding to it did

870
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:47,580
in 2018 three years before Colonial

871
00:33:47,580 --> 00:33:50,100
pipeline was hit an audit of its systems

872
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,600
found that it was deficient and security

873
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,360
best practices Robert Smallwood whose

874
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:56,159
consulting company did the audit called

875
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:57,480
Colonial pipelines information

876
00:33:57,480 --> 00:34:00,240
management practices atrocious and said

877
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,860
the company had a patchwork of poorly

878
00:34:01,860 --> 00:34:04,080
connected and secured systems and lacked

879
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:06,600
security awareness quote an 8th grader

880
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:07,799
could have packed into that system

881
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:10,918
unquote he said

882
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:13,980
Colonial pipeline which had no CSO when

883
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,440
it got hacked last year instead security

884
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:18,960
duties fell to a deputy CTO

885
00:34:18,960 --> 00:34:21,179
disputed Smallwood's characterization

886
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:23,460
and said that its I.T network was quote

887
00:34:23,460 --> 00:34:25,320
unquote strictly segregated from

888
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,780
pipeline control systems but the CEO

889
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:29,760
blowns also told lawmakers that he shut

890
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,679
down the pipeline because he was afraid

891
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,000
the ransomware would spread to the O

892
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,980
Network suggesting they weren't as

893
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:37,020
confident in their strict segregation as

894
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:38,159
stated

895
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,080
and although Blount said his company had

896
00:34:40,080 --> 00:34:41,580
the ability to operate the pipeline

897
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:43,918
manually this was true only if a small

898
00:34:43,918 --> 00:34:45,780
portion of the pipeline went down not if

899
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:50,099
they shut down all 5 500 miles of it he

900
00:34:50,099 --> 00:34:52,320
also said the company had a good had

901
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:54,540
good data backups and yet the company

902
00:34:54,540 --> 00:34:55,918
paid the ransom

903
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:57,720
so why would a company pay their Ransom

904
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:59,940
if they had good data backups Bill

905
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:01,920
Siegel who is CEO and co-founder of

906
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,320
co-work coverware told me last year that

907
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,660
it's generally because a company never

908
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,220
practiced restoring their data from

909
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:10,500
backups before they got hacked they

910
00:35:10,500 --> 00:35:12,839
might have 50 petabytes of data backed

911
00:35:12,839 --> 00:35:14,400
up but if it's in a facility 30 miles

912
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,560
away and they have to restore over a

913
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:18,720
copper wire it can take weeks or months

914
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:21,000
to get the data they need or they might

915
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:23,400
discover when it's too late that the

916
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,540
applications that they need to actually

917
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,880
do the data restoration are on the it

918
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,520
Network that's locked

919
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,440
so I don't mean to beat up on Colonial

920
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,839
pipeline uh they're just a convenient

921
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,760
example because the attack was so

922
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,500
significant but other critical

923
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:38,760
infrastructure is in the same position

924
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:41,220
or worse after the colonial pipeline

925
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:43,740
hack sisa released a lengthy list of

926
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,619
basic security guidelines for pipelines

927
00:35:45,619 --> 00:35:48,960
isolate ICS scada systems and networks

928
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,540
from corporate networks and the internet

929
00:35:51,540 --> 00:35:53,640
and Implement strong perimeter controls

930
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,500
limit communications leaving and

931
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:57,000
entering those perimeters use

932
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:59,339
multi-factor authentication have a cyber

933
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:01,680
incident response plan in place and

934
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:03,839
maintain good offline backups pretty

935
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:05,760
much the same guidelines that CSA had

936
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,320
released in 2020 before Colonial

937
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,000
pipeline was hacked

938
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,700
when these came out many wondered why

939
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,740
would cisa find the need to release

940
00:36:13,740 --> 00:36:16,200
these now after years of red flags

941
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,460
against critical infrastructure

942
00:36:17,460 --> 00:36:20,820
shouldn't this already be uh obvious and

943
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:22,920
shouldn't already be done but Colonial

944
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,960
pipeline of course showed that many of

945
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,040
these measures were still not

946
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,020
implemented despite the fact that the

947
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:30,780
Ukrainian power grid got hacked back in

948
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,520
2015 because they didn't have

949
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,920
multi-factor authentication despite the

950
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,900
fact that a study by Google and two

951
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:39,119
universities found that MFA can block up

952
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,760
to 99 of bulk fishing attacks and about

953
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,760
66 percent of targeted attacks a survey

954
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,920
published this year by trellix which is

955
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:50,280
a conglomeration of fire formerly fire

956
00:36:50,280 --> 00:36:52,099
eye and McAfee

957
00:36:52,099 --> 00:36:54,839
tralex survey found that 75 percent of

958
00:36:54,839 --> 00:36:57,000
respondents in the U.S oil and gas

959
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,640
sector still don't have MFA fully

960
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:00,660
implemented

961
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:03,180
and over half of them blamed it on a

962
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:06,420
lack of In-House cyber skills

963
00:37:06,420 --> 00:37:09,900
in 2013 I wrote about a researcher named

964
00:37:09,900 --> 00:37:12,780
Paul McMillan who used Mass scan to find

965
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:14,460
systems connected to the internet using

966
00:37:14,460 --> 00:37:17,280
Port 5900 the port used by VNC and

967
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,900
TeamViewer two tools that critical

968
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,000
infrastructure facilities often use for

969
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:23,160
Remote Management though they shouldn't

970
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:25,380
he wanted to see if he could access them

971
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:27,300
he found thirty thousand connected

972
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:29,520
systems that required no authentication

973
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:32,940
to access controls this included two

974
00:37:32,940 --> 00:37:35,160
hydroelectric plants in New York a

975
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:37,140
generator in Los at a Los Angeles

976
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:40,020
boundary the automated feed system at a

977
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:42,480
Pennsylvania pig farm milk inventory

978
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,579
controls for a Holstein Farm in British

979
00:37:44,579 --> 00:37:46,740
Columbia a system for monitoring and

980
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,480
controlling ventilation for underground

981
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,560
miners

982
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:51,720
and the refrigeration system for a Food

983
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,700
Service Company in Pennsylvania that

984
00:37:53,700 --> 00:37:55,140
provided lunch to schools and other

985
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:58,320
facilities that was 2013.

986
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,320
surely you think things are better now

987
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:03,720
but we all recall last year

988
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,460
when hackers breach the Oldsmar Water

989
00:38:05,460 --> 00:38:07,380
Treatment Facility in Florida through

990
00:38:07,380 --> 00:38:09,960
its team viewer application and changed

991
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,820
the settings for sodium hydroxide levels

992
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:13,140
in the water supply

993
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,880
the plant was using an out-of-date

994
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,440
Windows operating system that Microsoft

995
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,599
no longer supported its control system

996
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:19,920
was directly connected to the internet

997
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,140
without a firewall and all of its

998
00:38:22,140 --> 00:38:23,579
operators use the same t-viewer

999
00:38:23,579 --> 00:38:25,440
TeamViewer password to access the

1000
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,420
network

1001
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:29,160
the fact that there aren't more attacks

1002
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,480
against critical infrastructure isn't

1003
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:32,160
because the systems are secure it's

1004
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,720
mostly because attackers haven't been

1005
00:38:33,720 --> 00:38:35,460
interested in disrupting or destroying

1006
00:38:35,460 --> 00:38:36,119
them

1007
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:37,800
after stuxnet was discovered people

1008
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,119
expected that there would be a lot of

1009
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,380
CopyCat attacks that would Target

1010
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:42,060
critical infrastructure in other places

1011
00:38:42,060 --> 00:38:44,460
but that didn't happen and it didn't

1012
00:38:44,460 --> 00:38:47,220
happen for primarily two reasons lack of

1013
00:38:47,220 --> 00:38:49,859
Will and lack of capability those who

1014
00:38:49,859 --> 00:38:51,420
had the political will to launch such

1015
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:54,000
attacks for example Al Qaeda and Isis

1016
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:57,240
and who weren't necessarily deterred by

1017
00:38:57,240 --> 00:38:59,099
the same things that deterred nation

1018
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:01,260
states these people didn't have the

1019
00:39:01,260 --> 00:39:02,760
capability to conduct sophisticated

1020
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,859
cyber attacks and were more focused on

1021
00:39:04,859 --> 00:39:06,900
terror attacks anyway they could have

1022
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:09,180
purchased mercenary skills but they

1023
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,740
didn't because the terror attacks were

1024
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,020
so much more effective and those who

1025
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:14,400
were capable of such sophisticated

1026
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:16,560
attacks like Russia and China lacked the

1027
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:18,420
political will to launch them and knew

1028
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:19,920
that any disruptive or destructive

1029
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,200
attack against U.S infrastructure at

1030
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:24,780
least would elicit an equal response or

1031
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:27,599
worse as one U.S official put it quote

1032
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:29,400
shut down our power grid and maybe we'll

1033
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,599
put a missile down one of your

1034
00:39:30,599 --> 00:39:34,020
smokestacks end quote

1035
00:39:34,020 --> 00:39:36,900
but this has changed in recent years and

1036
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:38,760
we've begun to see greater interest in

1037
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,260
disruptive and destructive attacks

1038
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:42,060
against critical infrastructure this

1039
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:46,980
began in of course 2015 and 2016 with

1040
00:39:46,980 --> 00:39:48,359
the Russian attacks against Ukraine's

1041
00:39:48,359 --> 00:39:50,880
power grid the ante was upped with a

1042
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,579
trident attack in 2017 that targeted the

1043
00:39:53,579 --> 00:39:56,400
safety mechanisms at a Saudi Arabia

1044
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,619
petrochemical plants and introduced the

1045
00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:00,119
potential for attacks that cause

1046
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:02,820
physical harm or death and the recent

1047
00:40:02,820 --> 00:40:05,579
discoveries of in Destroyer 2 which

1048
00:40:05,579 --> 00:40:07,079
could have caused a widespread blackout

1049
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:08,940
in Ukraine if not uncovered and of

1050
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,520
course pipe dream the expansive attack

1051
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:13,260
platform which researchers say had the

1052
00:40:13,260 --> 00:40:15,180
potential to cause disruption or

1053
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,400
destruction the version of pipe dream

1054
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,220
that was found appeared to be focused on

1055
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:22,619
liquefied natural gas systems but it

1056
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:24,300
could be modified for use against any

1057
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:26,040
industrial environment and had the

1058
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,900
ability to disable or brick control

1059
00:40:27,900 --> 00:40:30,780
systems or undermine Safety Systems in

1060
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:32,160
ways that could potentially endanger

1061
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:34,619
lives

1062
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:38,099
so I want to move down now to election

1063
00:40:38,099 --> 00:40:40,079
security because I've covered it so

1064
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:42,599
extensively over the years and it's

1065
00:40:42,599 --> 00:40:43,680
another sector of critical

1066
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:44,820
infrastructure that has long been

1067
00:40:44,820 --> 00:40:47,040
ignored despite warnings for years about

1068
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:50,700
insecurities election infrastructure was

1069
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:52,680
only added to the critical

1070
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:56,040
infrastructure list in 2017 11 years

1071
00:40:56,040 --> 00:40:58,020
after the list was first created in

1072
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:00,359
2006.

1073
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:03,060
I need to preface this discussion though

1074
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:06,180
unfortunately by recognizing that events

1075
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,040
of the past two years have made it hard

1076
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,440
for anyone to discuss legitimate

1077
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:12,480
election security problems without it

1078
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:14,220
having without without it being

1079
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:16,440
misappropriated by people looking to

1080
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:19,320
cast doubt on the 22 on the 2020

1081
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:21,720
presidential presidential election and

1082
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,420
undermine the Democratic process

1083
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:25,619
um but I think that there's a greater

1084
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:28,079
danger in not discussing the problems

1085
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,359
they won't get corrected that way and it

1086
00:41:30,359 --> 00:41:31,859
will leave elections open to further

1087
00:41:31,859 --> 00:41:34,200
Integrity attacks

1088
00:41:34,200 --> 00:41:36,780
in order to understand the current state

1089
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:38,359
of affairs

1090
00:41:38,359 --> 00:41:41,040
with election systems we actually have

1091
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:44,160
to go back to the year 2000 to that

1092
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,960
presidential debacle

1093
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:50,119
in Florida sorry I'm losing my voice

1094
00:41:52,859 --> 00:41:55,859
back in Florida in 2000 you all remember

1095
00:41:55,859 --> 00:41:58,020
when paper punch card ballots

1096
00:41:58,020 --> 00:42:00,960
and dangling Chads led to a call for

1097
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,480
recounts and a controversial Supreme

1098
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,520
Court ruling after that election U.S

1099
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,140
lawmakers moved to ban paper ballots

1100
00:42:07,140 --> 00:42:08,460
paper Punch Cards through the help

1101
00:42:08,460 --> 00:42:10,859
America vote act which they proposed to

1102
00:42:10,859 --> 00:42:13,380
give four billion dollars to states to

1103
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:14,760
among other things replace the punch

1104
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,980
card systems with new electronic voting

1105
00:42:16,980 --> 00:42:19,020
machines preferably paperless ones

1106
00:42:19,020 --> 00:42:21,420
because the dangling chats had convinced

1107
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,400
lawmakers that all paper ballots were

1108
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:24,300
bad

1109
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,800
there were already years of warnings

1110
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:28,859
against computers tabulating votes in a

1111
00:42:28,859 --> 00:42:31,020
1969 front page article in the Los

1112
00:42:31,020 --> 00:42:33,540
Angeles Times described an Integrity

1113
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:35,579
test of new computerized election

1114
00:42:35,579 --> 00:42:38,280
tabulators used by LA County three

1115
00:42:38,280 --> 00:42:40,140
computer scientists on a red team faced

1116
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,640
off against three computer scientists on

1117
00:42:41,640 --> 00:42:43,440
a blue team to see if they could rig an

1118
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,599
election without detection the red team

1119
00:42:45,599 --> 00:42:48,300
won repeatedly

1120
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:50,820
Jump Ahead two decades to 1984 in Rock

1121
00:42:50,820 --> 00:42:52,560
Island County Illinois a computer

1122
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,599
tabulator gave one candidate two votes

1123
00:42:54,599 --> 00:42:56,880
for everyone casts for him the next year

1124
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,500
in a different Illinois County a punch

1125
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,060
card tabulator elected the wrong

1126
00:43:00,060 --> 00:43:01,980
candidate for city council which is only

1127
00:43:01,980 --> 00:43:03,720
discovered in a recount

1128
00:43:03,720 --> 00:43:05,760
but even in the problematic 2000 Florida

1129
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,859
election that made lawmakers hate paper

1130
00:43:07,859 --> 00:43:09,960
a problem occurred with electronic

1131
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:11,400
voting machines in Volusia County

1132
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:13,740
Volusia was already using electronic

1133
00:43:13,740 --> 00:43:15,240
systems for about four years at that

1134
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:16,920
point the incident should have given

1135
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:18,900
lawmakers pause about pushing states to

1136
00:43:18,900 --> 00:43:20,940
buy electronic voting machines if only

1137
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:22,560
they'd been paying attention

1138
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:25,079
at 10 pm on Election night Democratic

1139
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:26,880
presidential candidate Al Gore was ahead

1140
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:30,180
in Volusia County with 83 000 votes to

1141
00:43:30,180 --> 00:43:33,060
gore sorry with 83 000 votes to George

1142
00:43:33,060 --> 00:43:35,460
Bush's 62 000. things were going well

1143
00:43:35,460 --> 00:43:38,339
for Gore across the state uh and exit

1144
00:43:38,339 --> 00:43:40,020
polls projected a six-point lead for him

1145
00:43:40,020 --> 00:43:42,180
but then something went wrong

1146
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:44,160
Gore's total on the Volusia County

1147
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:47,280
website suddenly dropped by 16 000 votes

1148
00:43:47,280 --> 00:43:50,520
the drop occurred in Precinct 216. it

1149
00:43:50,520 --> 00:43:52,680
was a community Senator center located

1150
00:43:52,680 --> 00:43:55,440
in a primarily elderly neighborhood the

1151
00:43:55,440 --> 00:43:57,119
results were showing that Gore's total

1152
00:43:57,119 --> 00:44:01,500
was actually negative 16 022 votes

1153
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:04,920
while George Bush had 2183

1154
00:44:04,920 --> 00:44:06,960
and a Socialist Workers Party candidate

1155
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,619
named James Harris had 988 votes

1156
00:44:10,619 --> 00:44:12,480
there was a problem however Precinct

1157
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,619
2000 Precinct 216 only had 585

1158
00:44:16,619 --> 00:44:19,260
registered voters

1159
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:21,660
and only 219 of those had cast ballots

1160
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:24,078
that day

1161
00:44:24,180 --> 00:44:26,520
unfortunately for Gore reporters were

1162
00:44:26,520 --> 00:44:28,140
watching overall numbers for the state

1163
00:44:28,140 --> 00:44:30,599
and not individual County returns so

1164
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:32,400
they didn't notice the sudden drop all

1165
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:34,140
they saw was a gourd was falling behind

1166
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:36,300
the voter news service a Consortium of

1167
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,040
media Outlets reporting election results

1168
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,319
had projected Gore the Florida winner at

1169
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,260
8 pm but when Gore lost 16 000 votes

1170
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:45,300
from his total in Volusia County and

1171
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:47,040
another Florida county posted results

1172
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,720
that were inadvertently missing four

1173
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:51,480
thousand votes for for Gore Bush shot

1174
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:54,060
into the lead and news outlets retracted

1175
00:44:54,060 --> 00:44:56,099
their call for Gore and called the state

1176
00:44:56,099 --> 00:44:57,720
for Bush instead

1177
00:44:57,720 --> 00:44:59,880
luckily the electronic voting machines

1178
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:02,160
in Volusia County were Optical scan

1179
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,319
machines Optical scan machines use a

1180
00:45:04,319 --> 00:45:06,540
paper ballot that voters fill out by

1181
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:08,520
hand and then put through a scanner to

1182
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,660
be tabulated

1183
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:11,460
because of that paper ballot they can be

1184
00:45:11,460 --> 00:45:15,240
manually re retaliated by hand

1185
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:17,720
so this method that

1186
00:45:17,720 --> 00:45:19,500
officials could actually get to the

1187
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:20,700
bottom of what happened and find the

1188
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:23,040
true results Gore's team requested a

1189
00:45:23,040 --> 00:45:25,020
manual recounts in this County in

1190
00:45:25,020 --> 00:45:26,520
Volusia County and three other counties

1191
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:29,220
but the Supreme Court halted them as you

1192
00:45:29,220 --> 00:45:31,260
all remember but not before Volusia

1193
00:45:31,260 --> 00:45:33,599
actually completed its recounts and the

1194
00:45:33,599 --> 00:45:36,599
manual tally in the end showed the gore

1195
00:45:36,599 --> 00:45:40,920
actually got 193 votes uh that says 192.

1196
00:45:40,920 --> 00:45:44,520
uh Bush got 22 votes and Harris got zero

1197
00:45:44,520 --> 00:45:46,440
after the election Volusia officials

1198
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:48,540
blamed the problem on a faulty memory

1199
00:45:48,540 --> 00:45:50,940
card on Election night Precinct workers

1200
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:53,040
were supposed to transmit the votales

1201
00:45:53,040 --> 00:45:55,200
Via a modem that was connected to the

1202
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:57,060
voting machines but that night in

1203
00:45:57,060 --> 00:45:59,760
Precinct 216 the modem failed and so a

1204
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:02,099
worker drove in the memory card from the

1205
00:46:02,099 --> 00:46:03,599
voting machine into the elections office

1206
00:46:03,599 --> 00:46:05,400
where it was inserted into the election

1207
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:07,740
management system to tabulate the votes

1208
00:46:07,740 --> 00:46:09,359
logs for the management management

1209
00:46:09,359 --> 00:46:11,460
system however showed that two memory

1210
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:13,680
cards from Precinct 216 were uploaded

1211
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,819
that night

1212
00:46:14,819 --> 00:46:17,880
an hour apart and the 16 000 votes for

1213
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:20,339
Gore disappeared after that second card

1214
00:46:20,339 --> 00:46:23,339
was loaded into the machine

1215
00:46:23,339 --> 00:46:25,380
the County's Optical scan machines were

1216
00:46:25,380 --> 00:46:27,359
made by global election systems a

1217
00:46:27,359 --> 00:46:29,520
Canadian firm later acquired by diebold

1218
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,460
and renamed diebold election systems so

1219
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:35,160
if Lucia County official worker sent an

1220
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:36,900
email to Diboll demanding an explanation

1221
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,339
about what went wrong

1222
00:46:38,339 --> 00:46:40,560
and a Debold programmer replied that a

1223
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,480
corrupt memory card was the most likely

1224
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:43,859
explanation

1225
00:46:43,859 --> 00:46:46,079
but since the memory card was now no

1226
00:46:46,079 --> 00:46:48,720
longer was now nowhere to be found the

1227
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,460
only evidence of his existence was in

1228
00:46:50,460 --> 00:46:53,160
that computer log from election night he

1229
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,020
couldn't say for sure

1230
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,060
but then he posited an alternative more

1231
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:00,300
ominous explanation he said quote there

1232
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:02,220
is always the possibility that the

1233
00:47:02,220 --> 00:47:04,260
second memory card actually came from an

1234
00:47:04,260 --> 00:47:06,660
unauthorized source suggesting that

1235
00:47:06,660 --> 00:47:09,060
someone perhaps a rogue Insider had

1236
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:10,560
intentionally inserted a malicious card

1237
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:12,960
into the tabulation system to alter the

1238
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,020
election but had botched the operation

1239
00:47:16,020 --> 00:47:17,880
to which a diebold colleague of his

1240
00:47:17,880 --> 00:47:20,819
replied second shooter Theory all we

1241
00:47:20,819 --> 00:47:24,020
need now is a grassy knoll

1242
00:47:24,660 --> 00:47:26,579
though there was some validity to the

1243
00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:28,440
corrupt memory card explanation Depot

1244
00:47:28,440 --> 00:47:29,819
that experience problems with memory

1245
00:47:29,819 --> 00:47:32,160
cards before no one seemed to wonder why

1246
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,839
a correct memory card would alter votes

1247
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:35,579
only in the presidential race while

1248
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:37,800
leaving other races untouched nor did

1249
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:39,420
anyone ask what this meant for memory

1250
00:47:39,420 --> 00:47:41,819
cards and other precincts or counties or

1251
00:47:41,819 --> 00:47:44,220
any others corrupted as well there was a

1252
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:46,500
curious lack of curiosity

1253
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,260
many months later when Congress passed

1254
00:47:49,260 --> 00:47:50,819
went to pass the help America vote act

1255
00:47:50,819 --> 00:47:53,819
they held hearings to determine if they

1256
00:47:53,819 --> 00:47:55,140
should be giving States money to buy

1257
00:47:55,140 --> 00:47:57,240
election machines and two respected

1258
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,040
computer science scientists testified

1259
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,319
against it one told the officials any

1260
00:48:01,319 --> 00:48:03,060
programmer can write code that displays

1261
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:05,040
one thing on the screen record something

1262
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,240
else in the voting machine's computer

1263
00:48:06,240 --> 00:48:08,460
log and print out something else as an

1264
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:10,319
entirely different result I have

1265
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:13,800
freshmen who can do this she said

1266
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:15,599
but the problem with voting machines

1267
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:18,359
wasn't just hackers or Rogue insiders or

1268
00:48:18,359 --> 00:48:20,579
Rogue programmers if a corrupt memory

1269
00:48:20,579 --> 00:48:22,319
card caused the problem in Volusia

1270
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:24,060
something similar could go wrong in

1271
00:48:24,060 --> 00:48:25,920
other elections but the warnings went

1272
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,599
ignored and States went on a buying

1273
00:48:27,599 --> 00:48:29,400
spree many of them purchasing paperless

1274
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,740
electronic moving machines before Hava

1275
00:48:31,740 --> 00:48:33,599
just nine percent of precincts in the US

1276
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:35,640
were using paperless vending machines

1277
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:38,040
and after Hava that shot up to 67

1278
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,900
percent

1279
00:48:39,900 --> 00:48:41,819
um in the years that followed uh

1280
00:48:41,819 --> 00:48:43,319
computer Security Experts showed time

1281
00:48:43,319 --> 00:48:44,940
after time that the voting machines were

1282
00:48:44,940 --> 00:48:47,160
insecure including here in Vegas at the

1283
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,740
Defcon voting machine hacking Village

1284
00:48:48,740 --> 00:48:51,420
but vendors and election officials

1285
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:54,180
secure actively fought back against any

1286
00:48:54,180 --> 00:48:56,819
criticisms of the machines they said the

1287
00:48:56,819 --> 00:48:58,980
machines couldn't be hacked because they

1288
00:48:58,980 --> 00:49:02,060
were never connected to the internet

1289
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,819
aside from the fact that we know air gap

1290
00:49:05,819 --> 00:49:08,099
systems thanks to stuxnet can be hacked

1291
00:49:08,099 --> 00:49:09,060
whether or not they're connected to the

1292
00:49:09,060 --> 00:49:11,040
internet it turned out that some voting

1293
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:12,660
machines actually did connect to the

1294
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:14,280
internet when they transmitted election

1295
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:17,880
results on Election night I need to add

1296
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:20,280
a footnote to this because this story

1297
00:49:20,280 --> 00:49:22,380
unfortunately was seized by the stop the

1298
00:49:22,380 --> 00:49:24,020
steel movement

1299
00:49:24,020 --> 00:49:26,760
to back their claims of election fraud

1300
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:29,220
in 2020. this was a story about systems

1301
00:49:29,220 --> 00:49:31,520
made by election systems and software

1302
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,599
and the story is reporting that only

1303
00:49:33,599 --> 00:49:36,060
some systems that have embedded modems

1304
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:37,920
were connecting to the internet to

1305
00:49:37,920 --> 00:49:39,960
transmit the the votes on Election night

1306
00:49:39,960 --> 00:49:42,900
because esns systems were not used in

1307
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:44,520
the counties and states that were being

1308
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:46,760
disputed by the stops the still people

1309
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:49,880
they appropriated this story anyway

1310
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:52,800
to imply that Dominion voting systems

1311
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,660
were connected to the internet so this

1312
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:56,660
is why I talk about the the

1313
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:59,220
sensitivities around continuing to

1314
00:49:59,220 --> 00:50:01,260
report problems about this because that

1315
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:04,319
information will be misused

1316
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:07,020
for other systems of course that are not

1317
00:50:07,020 --> 00:50:09,540
connected to the internet Rogue insiders

1318
00:50:09,540 --> 00:50:12,060
of course are a Potential Threat

1319
00:50:12,060 --> 00:50:13,560
um though election officials have always

1320
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:15,240
been offended at the suggestion that

1321
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,160
election staff might not be trustworthy

1322
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:19,140
the last two years of course have maybe

1323
00:50:19,140 --> 00:50:21,420
changed their minds election officials

1324
00:50:21,420 --> 00:50:22,920
have been indicted for giving off

1325
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:24,900
unauthorized persons access to voting

1326
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:27,359
machines and voting machine software and

1327
00:50:27,359 --> 00:50:29,520
candidates in dozens of States as you

1328
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:31,920
can see here who are considered election

1329
00:50:31,920 --> 00:50:34,140
deniers and doubters are currently

1330
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:36,180
voting for offices buying for offices

1331
00:50:36,180 --> 00:50:37,920
that would give them authority over

1332
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,380
elections or access to voting machines

1333
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:42,839
and here's one in Arizona who recently

1334
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:46,040
got the Republican nomination

1335
00:50:49,380 --> 00:50:52,260
so luckily due to the work of election

1336
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:53,640
Integrity activists and security

1337
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,140
researchers over the years States like

1338
00:50:55,140 --> 00:50:57,059
California have since banned paperless

1339
00:50:57,059 --> 00:50:58,440
voting machines or reduced their

1340
00:50:58,440 --> 00:51:00,780
Reliance on them today jurisdictions in

1341
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:02,640
just Six States Indiana Louisiana

1342
00:51:02,640 --> 00:51:05,339
Mississippi New Jersey Tennessee and

1343
00:51:05,339 --> 00:51:07,920
Texas still use paper Electro paperless

1344
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:09,660
electronic machines as their principal

1345
00:51:09,660 --> 00:51:11,819
voting equipment most other states use

1346
00:51:11,819 --> 00:51:13,680
Optical scan machines with paper ballots

1347
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:16,200
that can be audited but even these

1348
00:51:16,200 --> 00:51:18,420
systems have security and reliability

1349
00:51:18,420 --> 00:51:21,059
issues and the paper ballot ballots mean

1350
00:51:21,059 --> 00:51:23,339
nothing if no one ever looks at them few

1351
00:51:23,339 --> 00:51:26,220
States conduct robust manual audits the

1352
00:51:26,220 --> 00:51:28,020
kind designed to catch software errors

1353
00:51:28,020 --> 00:51:30,599
or manipulated results some just run the

1354
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:31,980
ballots a second time through the same

1355
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:34,680
Optical scanner others that do manual ad

1356
00:51:34,680 --> 00:51:38,339
audits typically only examine ballots

1357
00:51:38,339 --> 00:51:40,380
from a random selection of one percent

1358
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:42,900
of precincts instead of a percentage of

1359
00:51:42,900 --> 00:51:45,480
ballots across all precincts so if the

1360
00:51:45,480 --> 00:51:47,160
selected precincts aren't ones where

1361
00:51:47,160 --> 00:51:49,319
problems occurred the audit won't

1362
00:51:49,319 --> 00:51:51,599
uncover them

1363
00:51:51,599 --> 00:51:53,400
I want to be clear that having robust

1364
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,140
audits won't necessarily prevent what

1365
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:57,480
occurred after the 2020 election robust

1366
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:59,280
manual audits were conducted after the

1367
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:01,319
election in some states and the stopless

1368
00:52:01,319 --> 00:52:03,059
steel proponents simply dismissed them

1369
00:52:03,059 --> 00:52:05,220
but some initial supporters of the

1370
00:52:05,220 --> 00:52:07,200
election fraud claims did say the audits

1371
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:08,760
convinced them the fraud claims weren't

1372
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:11,579
real and if audits can do this and also

1373
00:52:11,579 --> 00:52:13,440
catch errors created by faulty voting

1374
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:15,359
software then election Integrity

1375
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:17,160
activists say this can only be good for

1376
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,759
democracy

1377
00:52:20,280 --> 00:52:23,040
in the time I have left I want to shift

1378
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,339
Focus slightly to Ukraine and something

1379
00:52:26,339 --> 00:52:28,319
that isn't about vulnerable critical

1380
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:30,540
infrastructure per se but has relevance

1381
00:52:30,540 --> 00:52:32,339
to these systems and potential future

1382
00:52:32,339 --> 00:52:34,800
threats against them poses potential

1383
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:36,960
future threats against them I'm

1384
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:39,540
referring to cyber norms and the

1385
00:52:39,540 --> 00:52:41,400
hacktivism that has been Unleashed by

1386
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:43,559
the Russian invasion of Ukraine as well

1387
00:52:43,559 --> 00:52:45,839
as some recent events in Iran

1388
00:52:45,839 --> 00:52:48,119
uh justice Texan altered the cyber

1389
00:52:48,119 --> 00:52:49,859
security landscape recent events in

1390
00:52:49,859 --> 00:52:51,839
Ukraine and Iran have the potential to

1391
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:53,880
do the same with regard to cyber norms

1392
00:52:53,880 --> 00:52:55,800
and the security of Civilian

1393
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:57,300
infrastructure

1394
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:58,980
before I proceed though I want to

1395
00:52:58,980 --> 00:53:00,960
acknowledge that of course the situation

1396
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,420
in Ukraine is unprecedented and this

1397
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:05,220
isn't meant to criticize the country for

1398
00:53:05,220 --> 00:53:06,900
doing what it thinks is necessary to

1399
00:53:06,900 --> 00:53:09,119
defend itself but the security community

1400
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:11,280
and governments have to be aware of the

1401
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:13,619
potential path that this is leading us

1402
00:53:13,619 --> 00:53:15,059
to

1403
00:53:15,059 --> 00:53:18,059
in 2015 government experts from 20

1404
00:53:18,059 --> 00:53:20,040
Nations including the U.S the UK and

1405
00:53:20,040 --> 00:53:22,260
Estonia we're tasked by the United

1406
00:53:22,260 --> 00:53:24,780
Nations with developing cyber Norms that

1407
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:26,700
states should follow they agree that

1408
00:53:26,700 --> 00:53:28,260
states should not intentionally damage

1409
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:29,819
another State's critical infrastructure

1410
00:53:29,819 --> 00:53:31,980
or otherwise impair the operation of

1411
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:33,359
critical infrastructure that provides

1412
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:34,680
Public Services

1413
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,240
they also agree that states shouldn't

1414
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,700
allow their territory to be used for

1415
00:53:38,700 --> 00:53:40,740
cyber attacks against other states and

1416
00:53:40,740 --> 00:53:42,420
should take steps to mitigate malicious

1417
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:44,339
activity emanating from their territory

1418
00:53:44,339 --> 00:53:45,839
when it's aimed at critical

1419
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:48,980
infrastructure of other states

1420
00:53:49,079 --> 00:53:50,880
to recap what's been happening in

1421
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:53,819
Ukraine shortly after Russia invaded

1422
00:53:53,819 --> 00:53:55,980
Ukraine in February Ukraine's vice prime

1423
00:53:55,980 --> 00:53:58,980
minister Michael o'federov issued a call

1424
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:00,420
for volunteer activists to launch

1425
00:54:00,420 --> 00:54:02,160
offensive cyber operations against

1426
00:54:02,160 --> 00:54:04,380
Russia and provided a list of 31

1427
00:54:04,380 --> 00:54:05,940
government and Commercial sector

1428
00:54:05,940 --> 00:54:08,700
websites to attack the aim was to erode

1429
00:54:08,700 --> 00:54:10,500
the Russian public support for the

1430
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:12,000
invasion by making their lives so

1431
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,099
unpleasant and inconvenient they'd

1432
00:54:14,099 --> 00:54:16,200
question the war and also to force

1433
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:17,700
Russia to focus on defending its own

1434
00:54:17,700 --> 00:54:19,319
networks so that it might give less

1435
00:54:19,319 --> 00:54:21,420
attention to attacking ukraines

1436
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:24,300
the results of course was the I.T Army a

1437
00:54:24,300 --> 00:54:26,460
quasi civilian body that operates

1438
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:27,960
independent of the Ukrainian government

1439
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:30,599
but also seems to have some Nexus with

1440
00:54:30,599 --> 00:54:32,040
Ukraine's military and intelligence

1441
00:54:32,040 --> 00:54:35,760
apparatus according to Stefan sasanto of

1442
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:37,140
the center for security studies in

1443
00:54:37,140 --> 00:54:39,180
Switzerland so Santa has tracked the it

1444
00:54:39,180 --> 00:54:41,160
Army since its Inception and published a

1445
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:42,780
great paper in June that I'd highly

1446
00:54:42,780 --> 00:54:44,040
recommend

1447
00:54:44,040 --> 00:54:46,140
within days of federov's call of action

1448
00:54:46,140 --> 00:54:48,180
the it Army launched DDOS attacks

1449
00:54:48,180 --> 00:54:49,859
against the Moscow exchange Stock

1450
00:54:49,859 --> 00:54:51,780
Exchange the foreign Ministry the

1451
00:54:51,780 --> 00:54:54,059
Kremlin and a state-owned bank and the

1452
00:54:54,059 --> 00:54:55,980
initial Target list of 31 has expanded

1453
00:54:55,980 --> 00:54:58,440
to more than 600 targeting a network of

1454
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:00,839
pharmacies a large Electronics retailer

1455
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:02,880
and a Russian payment service provider

1456
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:05,400
after the company stated that U.S and

1457
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:07,619
ueu sanctions in Russia against Russia

1458
00:55:07,619 --> 00:55:09,300
hadn't affected it

1459
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:11,099
they also hit the Russian government

1460
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:13,319
system for tracking the production and

1461
00:55:13,319 --> 00:55:15,300
distribution of alcohol which appeared

1462
00:55:15,300 --> 00:55:17,339
to affect shipments of liquor prior to a

1463
00:55:17,339 --> 00:55:20,280
holiday in May and in addition there are

1464
00:55:20,280 --> 00:55:22,260
many offshoot groups including members

1465
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:24,059
of anonymous who conduct operations

1466
00:55:24,059 --> 00:55:27,059
under their own Banner not not strictly

1467
00:55:27,059 --> 00:55:29,400
under the I.T Army Banner most of the

1468
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:30,660
attacks of course have been DDOS

1469
00:55:30,660 --> 00:55:32,280
campaigns but massive hack and leak

1470
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:34,800
operations have also emerged two groups

1471
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:36,300
claimed responsibility for ciphing more

1472
00:55:36,300 --> 00:55:38,640
than 200 gigabytes of emails from a

1473
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:40,859
Belarusian defense weapons manufacturer

1474
00:55:40,859 --> 00:55:43,140
another group released industrial

1475
00:55:43,140 --> 00:55:45,660
Blueprints and schematics said to be

1476
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:47,700
from an engineering firm an anonymous

1477
00:55:47,700 --> 00:55:49,920
claimed responsibility for 800 gigabytes

1478
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:51,960
of leaked data from Russia's Federal

1479
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:54,059
censorship Bureau

1480
00:55:54,059 --> 00:55:56,160
in addition there appears to be in-house

1481
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:58,319
teams conducting more sophisticated

1482
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:00,660
operations for the it Army that either

1483
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:02,520
consists of Ukrainian defense and

1484
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,380
intelligence Personnel or has direct

1485
00:56:04,380 --> 00:56:06,839
ties to them and may also be getting

1486
00:56:06,839 --> 00:56:09,420
tasking from them so Santo thinks this

1487
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:11,099
group is responsible for destructive

1488
00:56:11,099 --> 00:56:12,900
attack that struck are you our our

1489
00:56:12,900 --> 00:56:15,240
YouTube or YouTube a Russian competitor

1490
00:56:15,240 --> 00:56:17,400
to you to YouTube which was dispensing

1491
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:19,440
in misinformation about the war the it

1492
00:56:19,440 --> 00:56:22,619
army with help from two Specialists they

1493
00:56:22,619 --> 00:56:25,200
said change the passwords of root tube's

1494
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:28,260
administrators blocked access cards that

1495
00:56:28,260 --> 00:56:29,940
staff use to get into root tube server

1496
00:56:29,940 --> 00:56:32,940
rooms and erased dozens of petabytes of

1497
00:56:32,940 --> 00:56:36,300
data leaving uh route to offline for

1498
00:56:36,300 --> 00:56:38,099
almost three days before it recovered

1499
00:56:38,099 --> 00:56:40,859
with backups the third element to the it

1500
00:56:40,859 --> 00:56:42,900
Army is the ukrainian-owned security

1501
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,819
firms in and outside of Ukraine

1502
00:56:44,819 --> 00:56:47,280
providing support tools one company

1503
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:49,800
headquartered in Estonia is the maker of

1504
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:51,960
a tool called disbalancer that works as

1505
00:56:51,960 --> 00:56:53,640
a distributed defense against DDOS

1506
00:56:53,640 --> 00:56:55,800
attacks users download the client to

1507
00:56:55,800 --> 00:56:57,300
their phone or their or their computer

1508
00:56:57,300 --> 00:56:59,760
in order to lend computing power to

1509
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:01,319
handle the load of DDOS attacks against

1510
00:57:01,319 --> 00:57:03,500
other members but in March the

1511
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:05,640
disbalancer team created a different

1512
00:57:05,640 --> 00:57:08,160
tool called The Liberator that uses the

1513
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:10,140
same concept to actually conduct DDOS

1514
00:57:10,140 --> 00:57:12,540
attacks against Russian sites and

1515
00:57:12,540 --> 00:57:14,400
another company in Estonia launched a

1516
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:16,200
bug Bounty program seeking

1517
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,640
vulnerabilities in Russian critical

1518
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,800
infrastructure to pass to Ukrainian

1519
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,540
cyber forces to Target

1520
00:57:21,540 --> 00:57:22,980
despite the fact that these two

1521
00:57:22,980 --> 00:57:25,440
companies are both based in Estonia a

1522
00:57:25,440 --> 00:57:27,780
member of NATO and the EU their activity

1523
00:57:27,780 --> 00:57:29,040
doesn't seem to have sparked any

1524
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:31,859
criticism from other NATO and E2 EU

1525
00:57:31,859 --> 00:57:33,240
member states

1526
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:35,280
obviously there are unique circumstances

1527
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:37,380
to consider Russia has been recognized

1528
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:39,000
by the United Nations as the clear

1529
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,760
aggressor in its invasion of Ukraine and

1530
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,500
the cyber attacks launched by the it

1531
00:57:43,500 --> 00:57:45,540
Army and others is occurring during an

1532
00:57:45,540 --> 00:57:46,619
active War

1533
00:57:46,619 --> 00:57:49,079
the it Army also seems to be showing

1534
00:57:49,079 --> 00:57:51,300
some restraints in not destroying or

1535
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:53,880
disrupting Russian Emergency Services

1536
00:57:53,880 --> 00:57:58,140
but so Santo uh

1537
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:00,960
so Santo notes that this activity is in

1538
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:03,839
danger of setting unintended legal legal

1539
00:58:03,839 --> 00:58:05,940
and ethical precedents that may create

1540
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:08,040
significant political blowback in the

1541
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:08,819
future

1542
00:58:08,819 --> 00:58:11,099
what if a Russian this is a quote from

1543
00:58:11,099 --> 00:58:12,900
him what if a russian-owned company

1544
00:58:12,900 --> 00:58:15,119
located in Germany were to organize an

1545
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:16,980
offensive bug Bounty program that

1546
00:58:16,980 --> 00:58:18,240
targets Ukrainian critical

1547
00:58:18,240 --> 00:58:20,520
infrastructure and shares the discovered

1548
00:58:20,520 --> 00:58:21,839
vulnerabilities with the Russian

1549
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:23,940
intelligence Community would Berlin

1550
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:26,460
Brussels and Washington deem this

1551
00:58:26,460 --> 00:58:28,500
acceptable behavior by the private

1552
00:58:28,500 --> 00:58:30,480
sector

1553
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:33,059
and as critics point out

1554
00:58:33,059 --> 00:58:34,980
another problem is that it may be hard

1555
00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:37,020
to rein in the it Army and members of

1556
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:39,599
anonymous after this one can easily see

1557
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:41,940
such forces being harnessed by other

1558
00:58:41,940 --> 00:58:45,059
governments or for causes other than the

1559
00:58:45,059 --> 00:58:48,180
context of War perhaps a diplomatic

1560
00:58:48,180 --> 00:58:50,400
crisis or even just in response to a

1561
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:53,700
cultural insult as we saw in 2007 when

1562
00:58:53,700 --> 00:58:56,099
Russian hacktivists launched targets

1563
00:58:56,099 --> 00:58:58,500
against Ukraine for the relocation of a

1564
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:00,000
war memorial

1565
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:03,180
such a free-for-all if targeted against

1566
00:59:03,180 --> 00:59:04,980
critical infrastructure has the

1567
00:59:04,980 --> 00:59:06,720
potential to create chaos at the very

1568
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,299
least and potentially worse

1569
00:59:09,299 --> 00:59:11,640
so Santo says continuing to ignore the

1570
00:59:11,640 --> 00:59:13,500
essence of the it Army will wreak havoc

1571
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:15,480
on the future stability of cyberspace

1572
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:17,040
and with it the National Security

1573
00:59:17,040 --> 00:59:20,099
landscape in Europe and Beyond

1574
00:59:20,099 --> 00:59:22,680
Victor Jorah Deputy head of Deputy head

1575
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:24,240
of Ukraine State service a special

1576
00:59:24,240 --> 00:59:26,400
Communications and information who spoke

1577
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:28,380
here at Black Cat yesterday morning told

1578
00:59:28,380 --> 00:59:30,839
motherboard earlier this year in my

1579
00:59:30,839 --> 00:59:32,220
opinion it would be wrong for the

1580
00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:33,960
government to enforce to endorse this

1581
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:36,599
activity but as a citizen as a person

1582
00:59:36,599 --> 00:59:38,819
who wishes our country to Prevail in

1583
00:59:38,819 --> 00:59:40,380
this absolutely unprecedented

1584
00:59:40,380 --> 00:59:43,140
unbelievable war in the 21st century I

1585
00:59:43,140 --> 00:59:45,000
would be grateful for their help in well

1586
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:47,160
in weakening our enemy

1587
00:59:47,160 --> 00:59:49,380
a couple of months ago the Ukrainian

1588
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:51,299
government did appear to endorse the

1589
00:59:51,299 --> 00:59:53,700
activity when the it Army and Deputy

1590
00:59:53,700 --> 00:59:55,680
Prime Minister federov were given awards

1591
00:59:55,680 --> 00:59:58,940
at a security conference in Poland

1592
00:59:58,940 --> 01:00:01,799
for their heroic resistance for their

1593
01:00:01,799 --> 01:00:03,540
quote heroic resistance to Russian

1594
01:00:03,540 --> 01:00:06,059
aggression and protection of the digital

1595
01:00:06,059 --> 01:00:08,099
borders of the democratic world

1596
01:00:08,099 --> 01:00:10,920
fedorov praised the I.T Army for quote

1597
01:00:10,920 --> 01:00:13,200
waging the world's first cyber war with

1598
01:00:13,200 --> 01:00:15,799
us end quote

1599
01:00:15,799 --> 01:00:18,720
uh quickly just I wanted to mention Iran

1600
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:22,579
before I end recent events there

1601
01:00:22,579 --> 01:00:25,260
attacks that have disabled more than

1602
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:26,819
four thousand gas pumps across the

1603
01:00:26,819 --> 01:00:29,040
country and appeared to cause equipment

1604
01:00:29,040 --> 01:00:32,880
malfunction at a fire uh and is still at

1605
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:35,040
a still plant it caused equipment

1606
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:36,660
malfunction and to fire at a still plant

1607
01:00:36,660 --> 01:00:39,720
raised similar concerns about attacking

1608
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:41,940
critical infrastructure outside of War

1609
01:00:41,940 --> 01:00:43,260
though it's unclear if these were

1610
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:45,420
launched by hacktivists or the Israeli

1611
01:00:45,420 --> 01:00:47,339
government or Western governments

1612
01:00:47,339 --> 01:00:49,380
intelligence agency

1613
01:00:49,380 --> 01:00:51,119
they show that interest in critical

1614
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:53,339
infrastructure civilian infrastructure

1615
01:00:53,339 --> 01:00:55,619
is very much on the agenda of tackers

1616
01:00:55,619 --> 01:00:57,599
and will only become a greater Target

1617
01:00:57,599 --> 01:00:59,579
going forward

1618
01:00:59,579 --> 01:01:01,510
thank you very much for listening

1619
01:01:01,510 --> 01:01:02,280

hey thank you everyone I just have two

1624
01:01:15,119 --> 01:01:17,339
notes before we get going

1625
01:01:17,339 --> 01:01:20,880
our next session start at 10 20.

1626
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:22,380
so you've got a little bit of time to

1627
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:23,940
get over to the next session you want to

1628
01:01:23,940 --> 01:01:26,160
see and then tonight opposite this

1629
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:28,559
keynote we have our lock note and our

1630
01:01:28,559 --> 01:01:31,920
lock note will be our review board some

1631
01:01:31,920 --> 01:01:33,540
review board members who helped picked

1632
01:01:33,540 --> 01:01:35,819
all the content for black cat myself

1633
01:01:35,819 --> 01:01:39,480
sitting down exploring the content the

1634
01:01:39,480 --> 01:01:41,579
trends the technologies that we found

1635
01:01:41,579 --> 01:01:43,200
interesting

1636
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,000
and we kind of chill out we have a beer

1637
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,799
we have a conversation and the idea is

1638
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:49,020
that you have an opportunity to listen

1639
01:01:49,020 --> 01:01:51,540
to us have a conversation about what we

1640
01:01:51,540 --> 01:01:53,700
found interesting and then about halfway

1641
01:01:53,700 --> 01:01:55,680
through you get to get involved and

1642
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,240
start asking questions and it's just a

1643
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:59,339
really nice way to wind down a

1644
01:01:59,339 --> 01:02:01,980
hyper-connected conference so I'll see

1645
