2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,720
foreign

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:13,860
thank you and I wish I was there with

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,079
you today and unfortunately I've been

5
00:00:16,079 --> 00:00:18,960
feeling sick and decided selfishly that

6
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:20,279
I was going to keep that to myself

7
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:23,220
rather than bringing it to you all

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:27,000
and so today I really wanted to kick off

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,720
with a little bit of a pop quiz

10
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:34,380
Jedi do you see in this picture

11
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:38,360
just shout out the answers

12
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:42,719
I'm hearing none I'm hearing one and the

13
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:45,840
one by the way is a trap Luke Skywalker

14
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,000
is not yet a Jedi

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:50,940
and in this picture how many Jedi do you

16
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:53,180
see

17
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:56,360
none none

18
00:00:56,360 --> 00:00:59,820
we don't see any Jedi here and the

19
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,460
reason I wanted to start with this

20
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:04,559
is because

21
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,540
a rebellion requires all sorts of skills

22
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,780
all sorts of people from different

23
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,420
backgrounds coming together to

24
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,880
accomplish an important goal

25
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:20,460
and whether that important goal is

26
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:24,000
overthrowing an evil Galactic Empire or

27
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:27,540
shipping a product we need all sorts of

28
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:30,060
skills to make that happen

29
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:34,259
and in cyber security we talk a lot

30
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:38,700
about the need for Jedi and you know I'm

31
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:41,880
gonna be honest as much as I love using

32
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,140
Star Wars to help tell stories

33
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,600
I think that asking everyone to be a

34
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:51,680
Jedi is a bad goal

35
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,439
expectations of heroism drive burnout

36
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:57,600
Stacy Thayer is going to be giving a

37
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,720
talk on this later on this afternoon I'm

38
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,159
really looking forward to her

39
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:04,439
perspectives on burnout

40
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:09,119
and you know being a Jedi Knight is not

41
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:12,420
all fun you get torn from your family as

42
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,000
a small child you're expected to live

43
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,819
without forming attachments

44
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:19,860
and

45
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:22,260
many people just don't qualify they

46
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:24,480
don't have the right little magical

47
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,000
creatures in their blood

48
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,319
and even if you do qualify even if you

49
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:34,980
make it through the training you become

50
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,660
a Jedi

51
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:39,360
a lot of Jedi end up murdered by Sith

52
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,080
and murdered by Sith just isn't good

53
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,099
so this talk is a fully trained Jedi you

54
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:48,300
are not

55
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,879
I'm Adam schroestack and by way of

56
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,160
introduction I'm on the review board

57
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:56,040
here at black hat I helped to create the

58
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:59,879
CVA and I do a lot of work in threat

59
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,220
modeling through my company show stack

60
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:05,340
and Associates and I want to share with

61
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,280
you some lessons that I've learned

62
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:11,099
as I've done a tremendous amount of

63
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:14,640
training helped people learn about cyber

64
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,580
security and some of the challenges that

65
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:21,420
I see them going through

66
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,459
and so today

67
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:25,800
I want to start by Framing the security

68
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,200
problem you know we heard Chris Krebs

69
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,840
talking about the problem

70
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:33,780
talking about Supply chains talking

71
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:37,099
about the issues as everything becomes

72
00:03:37,099 --> 00:03:39,900
digital as more and more things are

73
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,640
connected

74
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:42,900
and

75
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,879
even though the problem starts with

76
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,459
software there's this idea of Shifting

77
00:03:47,459 --> 00:03:49,080
left I'm going to talk about that and

78
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,299
I'm going to talk about what we can

79
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:53,879
expect of people who do not want to

80
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:56,220
become Jedi Knights

81
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,680
so let me go back in time a little bit

82
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,640
and so this this is from Cheswick and

83
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,560
bellavin's book firewalls and Internet

84
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,940
Security

85
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:09,000
almost 30 years ago and at the beginning

86
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,299
of chapter one they wrote that all

87
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:15,299
programs are bugging and large programs

88
00:04:15,299 --> 00:04:17,279
are even buggier than their size would

89
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:20,399
indicate and this was 30 years ago let

90
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,100
me tell you

91
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,540
they I don't want to say they didn't

92
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,340
know what was coming but I think it's

93
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:29,280
gotten a lot worse since then

94
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,160
and as a corollary of programs having

95
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,400
bugs a security program has security

96
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:36,840
bugs

97
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:38,580
and we know that

98
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,160
and so we can ask where do security

99
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:44,180
issues come from

100
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,639
sorry

101
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:51,360
um and you know security issues like

102
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,240
other aspects of the programs that we

103
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,759
use like other elements of the programs

104
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:57,960
that we use

105
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,860
come from developers developers are the

106
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,759
cause of and perhaps the solution to the

107
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,759
security problems that we face in

108
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:10,979
building software

109
00:05:10,979 --> 00:05:13,139
and you know

110
00:05:13,139 --> 00:05:16,620
I I joke about it being developers and

111
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:19,199
really I think it's more broad than that

112
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,259
it is software engineers

113
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:27,360
and I include developers sres scrum

114
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,539
Masters the people who put together

115
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:32,639
these systems

116
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,440
by and large don't mean to introduce

117
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,440
problems as they build features but they

118
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:41,400
do

119
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:45,000
and developers actually introduce sets

120
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,180
of security problems they wrote great

121
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:51,840
code with security bugs and flaws and

122
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,820
flaws being a little bit bigger than a

123
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:57,720
bug it's a design issue of some type

124
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,479
they introduce problems when they fail

125
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:02,880
to write the security features that we

126
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:08,240
need to operate the system in a good way

127
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:11,280
they introduce problems when they create

128
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:14,539
security features which are unusable

129
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:18,300
and so when I think about the world of

130
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:21,900
software I think about this mostly in a

131
00:06:21,900 --> 00:06:23,639
model of there's the development

132
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:26,240
activity and production

133
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,840
and we have different sets of security

134
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:33,000
activity we have application security

135
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,699
and we have operational security

136
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:39,780
to help us secure these two sides of

137
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:42,180
the way we deliver value

138
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:44,759
and in development we add and remove

139
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:48,900
bugs and in production we've got just a

140
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:53,280
fire hose of cves of security issues

141
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,380
that we care about

142
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,780
and so light shows look and Melvin

143
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:00,479
taught us we put firewalls in front of

144
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,520
those operational systems we deploy

145
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:05,460
scenes to help us manage the alerts

146
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:09,479
we have tools like xdr that

147
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:12,900
help us respond to issues we scan the

148
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:16,620
things in production for vulnerabilities

149
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,319
and we reverse engineer them

150
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:21,180
and I want us I want to stick with the

151
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:23,639
word reverse engineering for a second

152
00:07:23,639 --> 00:07:25,259
because it's fundamental we've got a

153
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:28,199
reverse engineering trap here at black

154
00:07:28,199 --> 00:07:29,580
hat

155
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:32,759
and inherent in the idea that we reverse

156
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:36,840
engineer things is the idea that we have

157
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:40,560
little access to the development world

158
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,539
we don't get to talk to the developers

159
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:45,120
and so we need to reverse engineer

160
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,160
things to understand what they were

161
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:50,520
doing and what they've created and

162
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,259
reverse engineering also helps us

163
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:54,660
validate those things but a lot of it is

164
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:56,639
built on the idea that there's this big

165
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,720
gap

166
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:02,520
that we in operational security

167
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,099
are so far from the developers they work

168
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:06,360
in different companies different

169
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,880
divisions that we can't go and

170
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,520
collaborate with them

171
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,520
sometimes we use penetration testing as

172
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:16,860
a way to gate what's going to make it

173
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:20,639
into production but all of this all of

174
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:23,660
this focus on operational security

175
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,120
is based on the assumption that we've

176
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,879
got this fire hose of issues and it's

177
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:31,680
never going to change

178
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,440
and on the application side we're

179
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:37,320
starting to see techniques uh things

180
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:40,140
like fuzzing static analysis

181
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:43,380
even better languages to help us write

182
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,940
code with fewer bugs and these

183
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:50,899
improvements in application security

184
00:08:50,899 --> 00:08:54,839
are often referred to collectively as

185
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:58,820
let's shift security to the left

186
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:01,680
and what this means is let's build

187
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:04,560
Security in it means there's changes to

188
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,920
how we or they design develop and deploy

189
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:10,920
things it requires that we have new and

190
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,720
different skills

191
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,779
and it means less Reliance on

192
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:18,360
penetration testing and more on software

193
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,940
engineering and this shifts security to

194
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,980
the left idea

195
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:25,800
is really gaining in popularity and what

196
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,660
it means is instead of doing security

197
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,480
and production we move to staging or

198
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:33,120
test or even development ideally

199
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,399
development because

200
00:09:35,399 --> 00:09:38,519
the cost of fixing issues grows

201
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:41,100
dramatically if I write a line of buggy

202
00:09:41,100 --> 00:09:42,180
code

203
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:44,220
and then I write a unit test and I

204
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:47,519
detect that bug it's cheap to fix

205
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,339
if that buggy code makes it to

206
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,720
production

207
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:54,240
I need to go and fix my production

208
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:57,959
systems if the buggy code is in an API

209
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:01,019
and it's a flawed API it doesn't do

210
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:02,820
authentication well it doesn't do

211
00:10:02,820 --> 00:10:05,519
authorization well I might have to

212
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,640
change the apis and if I do I might have

213
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:11,519
to support V1 and V2

214
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,580
for months even years

215
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,360
if the buggy API is in a platform like

216
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,399
Windows or iOS

217
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:23,279
I might have millions of developers who

218
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:26,519
have taken dependencies on what that is

219
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:29,940
and fixing that requires each of those

220
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,420
developers to change their application

221
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,339
so it works with the next rev of my

222
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:36,720
platform

223
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,240
fixing those issues well it's in

224
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,480
production and relied on by others can

225
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,200
be tremendously expensive

226
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,680
so we shift left and sometimes security

227
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:52,260
shifting left is a little bit like the

228
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,700
fellow in the right in the orange

229
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:58,920
they've got a goal they've got a plan to

230
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,920
to dunk that ball into the basket and

231
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,320
sometimes

232
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:07,500
developers Engineers can feel like the

233
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,519
person on the on the left excuse me

234
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,200
they're like wait what's happening here

235
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,060
why are you doing this this I don't want

236
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:18,300
you to do this and my goal is that we're

237
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,899
all playing for the same team

238
00:11:21,899 --> 00:11:24,019
and so shift left

239
00:11:24,019 --> 00:11:27,300
involves requires that we change the

240
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,899
development processes that are happening

241
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:35,220
and that requires clear responsibility

242
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:39,839
because hey let's face it change is hard

243
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:41,940
we are all

244
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:45,420
tired of change we're all tired of

245
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:49,079
whiplash in today's world in all sorts

246
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:50,160
of ways

247
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,800
not judging when I say that I'm simply

248
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,480
acknowledging it

249
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,760
and so when we want to have change

250
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,600
happen at an organization we have to be

251
00:12:00,600 --> 00:12:03,540
clear about what exactly is changing are

252
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,760
we changing the deliverables

253
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,459
are we changing the tasks that I have to

254
00:12:08,459 --> 00:12:10,800
do for example for example if I'm

255
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:12,720
changing the deliverables

256
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,940
I might change the language we're

257
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:16,920
writing software and we can get a lot of

258
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:20,279
security gains it's a big change I might

259
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:22,140
change the tasks by putting in a

260
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:25,800
checklist before I do a pull request

261
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:28,019
I might expect different skills of

262
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:31,440
people as they're developing software

263
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:34,920
and as we make these changes it's

264
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:40,980
crucial that we do it in a way that

265
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,800
serves the goals of the people whose

266
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,660
world were changing

267
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:48,600
if I'm sitting there and saying

268
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,639
if I'm sitting there in application

269
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,139
security and saying hey dear developer I

270
00:12:55,139 --> 00:12:57,540
need you to change for me I'm like I

271
00:12:57,540 --> 00:12:59,579
don't want to change to please absec I'm

272
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:01,139
the person who's shipping this awesome

273
00:13:01,139 --> 00:13:03,720
feature it's going to make our company a

274
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,600
lot of money or serve the community or

275
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:09,300
whatever value they're getting it's

276
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:12,600
probably not make appsec happy

277
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:16,920
and so we need to make these changes as

278
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:18,600
easy as possible

279
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:21,000
and I mentioned these days I work with a

280
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,339
lot of organizations helping them make

281
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:26,399
these changes and I sometimes joke that

282
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:29,940
my job is simply asking this question of

283
00:13:29,940 --> 00:13:32,940
who delivers what to whom an awful lot

284
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:36,839
and training people and how that happens

285
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:40,200
and I joke and I don't this question of

286
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,720
what am I delivering to you

287
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,440
what does that look like is

288
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,980
in underlying question and if we can

289
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:52,620
answer it well

290
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:55,320
we can develop training we can assess

291
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,240
how people are trained we can see if

292
00:13:57,240 --> 00:14:00,240
people are doing their jobs in ways

293
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,300
which are clear and predictable and if

294
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,100
the way we expect someone to do their

295
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,560
job is clear they're way more likely to

296
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,120
be on board

297
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,220
so there's a tool that I've become

298
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:14,279
incredibly fond of over the last few

299
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:17,160
years which is Bloom's taxonomy and I'm

300
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,860
going to walk you through this briefly

301
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:22,560
but Bloom's taxonomy is a fundamental

302
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:26,040
tool in learning it helps us Define what

303
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:29,880
learning goals are it helps us evaluate

304
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:32,279
whether or not people have learned the

305
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,959
things we hope that they're going to

306
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:34,680
learn

307
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,500
and so at the bottom of the taxonomy the

308
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,320
first thing you need to learn

309
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,199
will be the ability will be basic facts

310
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:44,639
and Concepts and just be able to

311
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,940
remember them we use words like Define

312
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:51,060
and duplicate in lists for example I

313
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:53,820
might want you to remember that data

314
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,860
center over a network can be read by

315
00:14:55,860 --> 00:14:57,000
anyone

316
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,660
and

317
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:03,720
all I want you to do in this talk is

318
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,180
remember that Bloom's taxonomy exists

319
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,480
and that it has levels

320
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,820
higher up in the taxonomy is evaluation

321
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:15,420
being able to justify our stands our

322
00:15:15,420 --> 00:15:20,120
decisions we use words like argue defend

323
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:25,139
critique insecurity we love to critique

324
00:15:25,139 --> 00:15:27,000
um and so we might ask a question like

325
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,880
does encryption protect against this the

326
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:31,279
graph

327
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:35,399
and judge whether or not people have

328
00:15:35,399 --> 00:15:37,560
acquired that knowledge

329
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,260
one last thing on bloom

330
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:43,380
Bloom Bloom's taxonomy is being used for

331
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:47,279
a long time my only goal for you for

332
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,620
this slide is that you remember that

333
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:51,120
there are lots of tools out there

334
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,000
because at the end when I'm suggesting

335
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:57,360
that we do a better job of defining the

336
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,420
knowledge that we expect developers to

337
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,500
have

338
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:04,019
you could go and you can look for things

339
00:16:04,019 --> 00:16:08,060
like Bloom question stems these

340
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,940
ways of framing our learning goals

341
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:14,459
with

342
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:17,040
um Mad Libs essentially and the helpful

343
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,500
hundred verbs that help us Define what

344
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:22,320
we want people to know because I think

345
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:25,680
this is a really helpful tool for

346
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,440
thinking about what security work we ask

347
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:30,360
of different people

348
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,060
so for example if you're going to be a

349
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:35,279
speaker at black hat we expect you have

350
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:37,680
we expect that you will have created

351
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,540
something new

352
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:42,120
if you're a pen tester you're going to

353
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,459
be doing evaluative work

354
00:16:44,459 --> 00:16:47,459
is this thing fit for production

355
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:49,620
and if you're a developer

356
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:52,139
we're going to expect you to understand

357
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:54,440
some things about security

358
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:58,500
and you know unfortunately

359
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:03,120
this is not how we tend to teach we tend

360
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,780
to teach a little bit like this with a

361
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:09,020
little guy on your back

362
00:17:09,020 --> 00:17:11,760
explaining to you that when you're 900

363
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,799
years old hopefully you'll understand

364
00:17:13,799 --> 00:17:18,299
all this security stuff

365
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:21,780
um or we have people stand on their head

366
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:25,380
and levitate boxes in the air

367
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:28,559
and you know well it makes for a cool

368
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,240
training montage

369
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,640
I'm really not sure

370
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,520
um sir could you explain how this helps

371
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,580
me defeat the Galactic Empire or ensure

372
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,799
that there's no SQL injection in my code

373
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:42,360
because

374
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:45,960
just not sure why I'm doing this if

375
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:46,560
that's okay

376
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,220
[Music]

377
00:17:49,220 --> 00:17:54,720
we need to think about the way we train

378
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:56,940
because

379
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:59,760
if you're a developer

380
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,640
we need to give you training that is

381
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:06,660
sensible we need to provide training

382
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,539
that is sensible in the training time

383
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:11,580
that's available

384
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:15,059
and I have a lot of critique of the

385
00:18:15,059 --> 00:18:17,340
things we have we teach developers right

386
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:19,200
now but I I want to focus on the

387
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:20,520
positive

388
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:24,240
and say we need to help developers find

389
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:27,900
and follow paved roads we need to help

390
00:18:27,900 --> 00:18:30,840
them recognize the danger signs as

391
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,840
they're doing things which have security

392
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:35,039
implications and they need to think

393
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,960
about them

394
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:40,200
and when we think about what fits here

395
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:43,679
you know I love each and every one of

396
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:46,140
these books I've learned a huge amount

397
00:18:46,140 --> 00:18:47,660
from them

398
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:51,419
and none of them are small except the

399
00:18:51,419 --> 00:18:54,480
one at the very top uh Kent Vex extreme

400
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,760
programming explained which helped kick

401
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,460
off the agile Revolution

402
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:02,340
and if we expect every developer is

403
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:05,280
going to know everything and Mike Howard

404
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,500
and Dave leblanc's book or everything in

405
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,240
Ross Anderson's book

406
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,400
or everything in the amazing shell

407
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,280
coders handbook

408
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:19,080
um well that is why we fail

409
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:24,240
and so we have to think about what it is

410
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,059
that it is reasonable

411
00:19:27,059 --> 00:19:31,200
to ask a normal developer to know about

412
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,600
software security

413
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:35,220
and

414
00:19:35,220 --> 00:19:40,799
one of the tools that we need to use

415
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:41,700
um

416
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:44,460
so before I say this

417
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:48,720
one of one of the things that

418
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:51,059
when we give people these four books one

419
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:52,620
of the things which happens is they're

420
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:57,120
like I'm overwhelmed and

421
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,760
if you think about how you might feel

422
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:02,160
about

423
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,340
being overwhelmed facing say investment

424
00:20:05,340 --> 00:20:07,860
decisions you can go and read books like

425
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,299
these

426
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:13,220
quest for Value the rational investor

427
00:20:13,220 --> 00:20:14,820
or

428
00:20:14,820 --> 00:20:20,760
you could go to your retirement bank and

429
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:24,299
say give me a defined a Target date fund

430
00:20:24,299 --> 00:20:27,539
and a Target date fund says hey it's

431
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:32,580
2022 I plan to retire in 2050

432
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:35,220
figured out for me make the right

433
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:38,760
allocation of Investments for me to

434
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,059
retire in 2050 and they do that for you

435
00:20:42,059 --> 00:20:45,000
and this is important because most of us

436
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:47,400
get overwhelmed when we're thinking

437
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:50,460
about our retirement planning in the

438
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:52,980
same way that developers may get

439
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:56,100
overwhelmed thinking about all of this

440
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,919
stuff we're asking them to learn so we

441
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:01,919
need to make it easier and to make it

442
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:04,260
easier one of the tools we can use is

443
00:21:04,260 --> 00:21:05,460
chunking

444
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:08,520
our being our brains are amazing at

445
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,740
pattern recognition dealing with chunks

446
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,559
of data and you may have heard that

447
00:21:13,559 --> 00:21:16,500
short-term memory is seven plus or minus

448
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,520
two

449
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:20,280
it's optimistic but it's about chunks

450
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:23,220
it's not about individual pieces of data

451
00:21:23,220 --> 00:21:26,880
and so if you look at this sequence one

452
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:31,020
one two three five eight thirteen Etc

453
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,659
and you don't know what it is that might

454
00:21:33,659 --> 00:21:35,640
be all you can remember if I were to ask

455
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,159
you to remember it

456
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,860
if you've learned that this is a

457
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:42,840
Fibonacci Sequence you can chunk that

458
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,360
data in as a single thing

459
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:47,100
and if you've really learned the

460
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:50,280
Fibonacci sequence you will notice and

461
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:52,559
you're you're like wanting to scream

462
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,400
because I left out 21. uh it's a trap

463
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,260
but I'm doing it because you're to show

464
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:03,780
that your brain works with these chunks

465
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:07,200
of information it recognizes it and if

466
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,659
you were in the group that knew that 21

467
00:22:09,659 --> 00:22:11,760
was missing

468
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,820
it's because your brain does pattern

469
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:17,340
recognition

470
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:20,640
and this is crucial because if we don't

471
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,980
Define the chunks that we want people to

472
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,980
understand they will they may anyway

473
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,140
people as I say our brains are really

474
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:31,080
good in pattern recognition and even

475
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:33,480
inventing patterns that we might not

476
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,220
think are there

477
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:38,820
and so I have to ask what is the

478
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:42,419
category that we want a normal developer

479
00:22:42,419 --> 00:22:44,419
to know

480
00:22:44,419 --> 00:22:47,460
and with respect to Chris Krebs and his

481
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,100
great keynote this morning he covered a

482
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:52,320
bunch of these he covered cyber War he

483
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,299
covered threat actors he covered

484
00:22:54,299 --> 00:22:56,159
compliance

485
00:22:56,159 --> 00:22:58,559
and for us

486
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:00,299
you know I personally thought it was a

487
00:23:00,299 --> 00:23:04,260
great talk but for people who are not in

488
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,419
security it may have been a little

489
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:08,820
overwhelming

490
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:11,039
oftentimes we try and teach normal

491
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,280
developers explode techniques we try and

492
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,700
teach them things like this

493
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:19,260
and I think

494
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:22,020
and if you know some of my work you

495
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:24,360
might you might be unsurprised to know

496
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:25,980
that I think we should teach them about

497
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:30,539
threats ways to answer the question what

498
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:34,260
can go wrong and I believe having spent

499
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:37,200
a lot of time teaching people about this

500
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,480
spent a lot of time with Executives that

501
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:42,600
what can go wrong focuses our attention

502
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:46,340
on threats and it's an incredibly

503
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:51,299
powerful framing for how to engage

504
00:23:51,299 --> 00:23:53,460
everyone has an answer if you ask them

505
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:55,200
and encourage them

506
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:58,320
all the way up to Executives when I ask

507
00:23:58,320 --> 00:24:00,179
Executives what are they worried about

508
00:24:00,179 --> 00:24:02,640
what keeps them up at night and then I

509
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,620
stop and wait for an answer

510
00:24:04,620 --> 00:24:06,299
when I encourage them they've got

511
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:10,440
answers when I ask normal developers how

512
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:15,179
would you attack this I get good answers

513
00:24:15,179 --> 00:24:18,059
and what can go wrong works as an

514
00:24:18,059 --> 00:24:20,418
umbrella

515
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:23,960
um and if we ask just ask that question

516
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:28,200
are answers vary a loss there's lots of

517
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:31,140
ways that we might answer this

518
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:33,480
and I'm going to speed up just a little

519
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:37,020
bit here and jump over some of this but

520
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,940
it's important to think that what can go

521
00:24:38,940 --> 00:24:41,460
wrong is not just bugs it's not just the

522
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:43,559
buffer overflows and the SQL injections

523
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:45,419
and the memory safeties

524
00:24:45,419 --> 00:24:47,580
it's the failure to authenticate it's

525
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:50,820
the failure to encrypt it's not having

526
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:53,520
logs or keeping those logs for long

527
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:54,480
enough

528
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:57,960
it's not building MFA support into our

529
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,740
systems those flaws matter a lot

530
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:05,780
yeah and so

531
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:09,539
um when I get to the question of

532
00:25:09,539 --> 00:25:12,179
what's what are the four best ways of

533
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:15,240
doing something that's a side task

534
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:19,260
I get to I'm asking a developer someone

535
00:25:19,260 --> 00:25:22,620
who's not an expert to do work at the

536
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:25,679
expert end of this taxonomy and so they

537
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:28,260
need us to offer specific advice

538
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:31,440
and I I was slightly out of order when I

539
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:34,919
talked about the

540
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:36,419
um

541
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:39,659
the personal finance example but you

542
00:25:39,659 --> 00:25:41,460
know I went I Googled for some advice

543
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:45,000
and it's not just match out your tax

544
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,039
advantage matched accounts I found this

545
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,220
the 50 personal finance tips that will

546
00:25:50,220 --> 00:25:53,220
change the way you think about money

547
00:25:53,220 --> 00:25:57,480
50. I have to think about 50 things

548
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:01,140
for for goodness sake

549
00:26:01,140 --> 00:26:03,720
um and so Target date funds again are a

550
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:08,340
great tool for helping people avoid

551
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,380
having to think and there's this lovely

552
00:26:10,380 --> 00:26:13,679
book on usability by Steve Krug don't

553
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,720
make me think

554
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,020
because people are overwhelmed they have

555
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:22,200
so much going on

556
00:26:22,200 --> 00:26:25,080
and so when I get to the question of

557
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:26,940
what does every engineer need to know

558
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:29,220
there's a couple of projects

559
00:26:29,220 --> 00:26:31,679
that I've been doing that really have

560
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,720
pulled me towards this question the

561
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:35,880
first is a white paper fast cheap and

562
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:37,679
good I'm going to show you some of the

563
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,679
bits from it in a second the other is my

564
00:26:40,679 --> 00:26:43,380
next book coming out this fall

565
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:46,799
and the subtotal of that book so that's

566
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:48,120
what every engineer should learn from

567
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,700
Star Wars the subtitle what every

568
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:55,260
engineer should learn has really been a

569
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:58,380
crucible for me in thinking about this

570
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,240
question of what does every engineer

571
00:27:00,240 --> 00:27:01,919
need to know and I'm going to share my

572
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:05,159
answers with you but before I do I want

573
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:07,799
to start with a simple question

574
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:11,340
which is is every flaw unique

575
00:27:11,340 --> 00:27:14,640
And if every flaw is unique we need a

576
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:17,279
lot of security expertise

577
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:20,520
but if there are clusters then maybe we

578
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:22,260
can think about the security expertise

579
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:25,400
we need and relate that security

580
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:28,679
expertise to the knowledge about the

581
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:31,200
system that we need to find them

582
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,000
and so

583
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,640
if we're doing penetration testing a lot

584
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,860
of penetration testing work

585
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:41,279
is developing knowledge about the system

586
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:45,659
under test so that we can apply our

587
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:48,659
security knowledge to it and find bugs

588
00:27:48,659 --> 00:27:51,900
and maybe these bugs are just in a

589
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:54,120
uniform space Maybe these flaws are in a

590
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,820
uniform space and any amount of system

591
00:27:56,820 --> 00:27:58,799
knowledge any amount of security

592
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:02,279
expertise will help us find them

593
00:28:02,279 --> 00:28:04,020
Maybe

594
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,500
the security flaws really require more

595
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:09,779
security knowledge and the more security

596
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:12,960
expertise I have the more stuff I will

597
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:14,159
find

598
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,980
or maybe and this represents my belief

599
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,140
these days

600
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,400
um

601
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,860
we don't need very much system knowledge

602
00:28:22,860 --> 00:28:24,900
and we don't need very much security

603
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:29,520
expertise to find most of the flaws in

604
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:32,279
the system and I think of these as

605
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:36,059
lightweight flaws where we kick over a

606
00:28:36,059 --> 00:28:38,100
rock and there's stuff underneath

607
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:40,200
scarting around

608
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:43,679
and we've all had the experience of I

609
00:28:43,679 --> 00:28:45,120
think many of us have had the experience

610
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:47,039
of kicking over those rocks and finding

611
00:28:47,039 --> 00:28:48,600
these flaws

612
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:52,020
and so if these flaws are common I think

613
00:28:52,020 --> 00:28:54,120
we should transform how we work with

614
00:28:54,120 --> 00:28:56,159
engineers

615
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,460
and so my proposal for how we should do

616
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:01,740
this is we should ask people to know

617
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,740
about stride stride stands for spoofing

618
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:06,539
tampering repudiation and for disclosure

619
00:29:06,539 --> 00:29:08,039
denial service and expansion of

620
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:09,240
authority

621
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:12,600
we should ask developers to know that

622
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,460
parsing and predictability lead to

623
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,679
danger and we should ask them to

624
00:29:16,679 --> 00:29:18,720
understand how to use kill chains to

625
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,340
bring them together and that's four

626
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:23,220
things and I think it's a reasonable set

627
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:27,899
of knowledge and so as an example

628
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:31,020
we might say that spoofing has to be

629
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,760
addressed differently for each of

630
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:35,039
machines or people authenticating to

631
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,779
machines or people

632
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:39,659
spoofing programs is easy if I'm running

633
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:42,000
on a traditional desktop

634
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,919
one program could talk to another

635
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:46,320
there's no program identity the way

636
00:29:46,320 --> 00:29:49,799
there is on mobile platforms and I

637
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:52,080
believe that we

638
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,179
as a community

639
00:29:54,179 --> 00:29:56,820
and within each of our organizations

640
00:29:56,820 --> 00:29:59,880
needs to be defining what developers

641
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:04,100
need to know I think that's crucial

642
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:08,580
because if you and I have different

643
00:30:08,580 --> 00:30:10,919
perspectives about what developers need

644
00:30:10,919 --> 00:30:15,000
to know or you and I and your colleagues

645
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:18,000
and your developers promotion committee

646
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:21,419
have different perspectives on what

647
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:23,580
developers need to know

648
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:25,799
I can tell you which of those groups is

649
00:30:25,799 --> 00:30:27,240
going to win

650
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,980
and I can tell you that the only way

651
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:31,980
we're going to influence those people on

652
00:30:31,980 --> 00:30:33,659
the promotion committee on the hiring

653
00:30:33,659 --> 00:30:38,279
committee is if we in cyber security

654
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:41,760
have consistent answers

655
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,159
and so

656
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:47,039
to recap and and leave even a couple of

657
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,100
minutes for some questions code issues

658
00:30:50,100 --> 00:30:53,279
underlie many probably even most

659
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:55,740
security issues

660
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:59,100
gifting and when I say most I'm saying

661
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:01,200
usable secured if we include usable

662
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,120
Security in there I think it's clearly

663
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,340
most security issues

664
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,399
shifting left is an admirable goal

665
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:10,380
but it only works when we're clear about

666
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,700
change

667
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,399
and to date we have not been clear

668
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:18,000
enough about the changes we need to make

669
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,799
and so

670
00:31:19,799 --> 00:31:22,440
you know rebellions are built on Hope

671
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,580
and my hope is that we Define normal

672
00:31:26,580 --> 00:31:30,360
levels of security that when we Define

673
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:33,059
these things developers will be more

674
00:31:33,059 --> 00:31:36,120
able to build more secure systems

675
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:40,020
and the goal the hope the reason for

676
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,940
making this

677
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:46,380
for making this change is that if we are

678
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:49,799
developing more secure systems there

679
00:31:49,799 --> 00:31:52,500
will be less rework there will be fewer

680
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:55,080
escalations where people show up at the

681
00:31:55,080 --> 00:31:57,360
last minute and say hey

682
00:31:57,360 --> 00:31:59,880
security we forgot to come to you we've

683
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,039
got this thing we're ready to ship off

684
00:32:02,039 --> 00:32:04,799
net we're going to ship it tomorrow

685
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:07,740
can you sign off on the risk

686
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:12,360
have you been there do you enjoy it

687
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,659
if we make our expectations more clear

688
00:32:15,659 --> 00:32:18,240
we can reduce the frequency that that's

689
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:21,539
going to happen we can reduce the pain

690
00:32:21,539 --> 00:32:24,720
of those escalations we can increase the

691
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:27,779
predictability of delivery of the

692
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:30,539
systems that we're building

693
00:32:30,539 --> 00:32:33,480
and so coming out of this

694
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,659
I encourage you

695
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:40,200
within your organizations and us as a

696
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,360
community we need to decide what

697
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,640
developers need to know about threats as

698
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:47,039
experts we have to help Define this we

699
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,380
have to put forward

700
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:51,059
proposals like I have done

701
00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:53,460
we have to help people meet them we have

702
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:56,520
to develop training that works we have

703
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,340
to measure how this is addressing those

704
00:32:59,340 --> 00:33:01,799
goals of more predictable deliveries

705
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:04,740
with fewer escalations and if we do

706
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,440
those things I think we are setting

707
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,559
ourselves up for a really positive

708
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:13,799
Improvement in the way we build security

709
00:33:13,799 --> 00:33:17,820
over the next 25 years

710
00:33:17,820 --> 00:33:20,460
with that I want to say thank you very

711
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:22,460
much for listening

712
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:27,000
and I am happy to take questions I'm

713
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,519
happy to take them now live I'll be on

714
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:32,700
the swap card platform and there's my

715
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:34,620
email address you'll have these slides

716
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:39,059
by 9 30 tomorrow you can take a picture

717
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:40,740
um I think this is important I would

718
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:44,480
love to talk to people about thank you

719
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:57,120
okay uh hey Adam Charles here uh the the

720
00:33:57,120 --> 00:34:01,399
question I had for you is

721
00:34:01,399 --> 00:34:04,500
you mentioned risk and risk is important

722
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,659
for for some of us especially who work

723
00:34:06,659 --> 00:34:09,740
in safety critical stuff

724
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,119
you go through the effort you do the

725
00:34:12,119 --> 00:34:14,879
threat modeling and

726
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:18,480
then the the people who are responsible

727
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,119
for risk for the product come and say

728
00:34:21,119 --> 00:34:24,780
well that's not really important that'll

729
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:26,460
never happen

730
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:30,480
and so you end up with the the situation

731
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:32,460
where you've built a relationship with

732
00:34:32,460 --> 00:34:34,679
the development staff whether they be

733
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:38,159
Hardware software and you you show them

734
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:40,560
the joy that is threat modeling

735
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,960
and then at the end of the day a

736
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:45,000
different group says yeah don't listen

737
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,440
to them

738
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:50,280
how do you recommend that people build

739
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,960
that relationship

740
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:56,520
with the the Arbiters of risk so that

741
00:34:56,520 --> 00:35:00,660
they don't end up losing uh that

742
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:03,599
believability that they have with the

743
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,880
people who have to actually Implement

744
00:35:05,880 --> 00:35:09,200
these things at the end of the day

745
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,740
so

746
00:35:10,740 --> 00:35:13,260
so I

747
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:16,800
I think that if we engage with the

748
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:19,680
people who build these things no one

749
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,020
wants to be the engineer who only put

750
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:26,940
one air speed indicator on the next 737.

751
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:29,839
we get to the risk committee

752
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:33,900
when there's a disagreement about what's

753
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:36,780
there and so I think step one is to

754
00:35:36,780 --> 00:35:38,940
reduce the number of times we get to the

755
00:35:38,940 --> 00:35:40,859
risk committee

756
00:35:40,859 --> 00:35:43,740
and then number two I really think we

757
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:48,260
actually need to change the way we do

758
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:51,240
risk calculations but that's probably

759
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,099
another talk also hey Charles good to

760
00:35:53,099 --> 00:35:54,660
good to hear your voice

761
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,660
um

762
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,339
so

763
00:35:59,339 --> 00:36:01,320
so I think it's developing the

764
00:36:01,320 --> 00:36:04,320
understanding of this is what the risk

765
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,200
is and and that the developers take

766
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:10,020
responsibility for us

767
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:12,980
okay thank you

768
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:25,200
I would like to ask like how would you

769
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:26,700
view

770
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:30,980
um like something like working with the

771
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:32,760
requirements when you are building

772
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:35,099
something uh

773
00:36:35,099 --> 00:36:39,240
in in this sense so so I I believe it's

774
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:41,940
like important the same way how we want

775
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:45,480
to like Define these deliverables that

776
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:47,040
we have

777
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:49,740
um like make them unified and same for

778
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:52,680
everything so how do you approach like

779
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:55,500
defining these requirements for building

780
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:58,440
uh projects that they should be like

781
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,540
we should always have the same

782
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:03,240
preferably and how do you align this

783
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:06,780
with this let's say a chunking of the

784
00:37:06,780 --> 00:37:09,240
knowledge that everybody should have so

785
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,180
how how do you then use it to to like

786
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,160
Define predictable repeatable

787
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,800
requirements like in the beginning of

788
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,119
these projects

789
00:37:18,119 --> 00:37:20,060
so

790
00:37:20,060 --> 00:37:23,099
developers are taking on more and more

791
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:26,400
responsibility for qualities when I

792
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:29,339
started in software we had separate

793
00:37:29,339 --> 00:37:33,079
quality assurance divisions and that's

794
00:37:33,079 --> 00:37:36,000
changed developers are expected to

795
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,359
produce reliable excuse me reliable code

796
00:37:39,359 --> 00:37:41,760
they're expected to produce performance

797
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,380
code

798
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:46,260
and so if we don't know what they should

799
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,280
know

800
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,180
about security we can't expect them to

801
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:53,339
write it into requirements

802
00:37:53,339 --> 00:37:56,579
but if we do have expectations

803
00:37:56,579 --> 00:38:00,780
then we can say hey we expected you to

804
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:02,400
think about authentication and you've

805
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:04,440
built an entire system without thinking

806
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:06,960
about it how did that happen that you

807
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,700
didn't think about the spoofing threats

808
00:38:08,700 --> 00:38:11,460
as you were writing those requirements

809
00:38:11,460 --> 00:38:13,500
and so I think the way we get to

810
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,800
uniformity is through shared a shared

811
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:20,160
expectations of what every developer

812
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,819
needs to know

813
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:29,579
hi um thanks for the presentation I

814
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:31,980
really liked it so I I would like to add

815
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:34,200
one thought though

816
00:38:34,200 --> 00:38:34,920
um

817
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:36,900
when I think about the Jedi

818
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:40,800
apprenticeship I I kind of always saw

819
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:43,680
the movies in a way that the real point

820
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:45,660
of that is that you get into the

821
00:38:45,660 --> 00:38:47,280
situation where you know you're a

822
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:49,920
beginner you have to learn a lot and it

823
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,180
doesn't really matter if you end up

824
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:54,000
becoming a Jedi Knight so I'm wondering

825
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:56,520
you you made the presentation about

826
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:59,460
people and I think it's very important

827
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,140
and

828
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:04,200
I don't know if we are able quite yet to

829
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,520
Define what

830
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:07,800
the basic knowledge of developers needs

831
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,760
to be it sounds a bit like you're saying

832
00:39:10,760 --> 00:39:13,560
we can keep them at a lower level of

833
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,359
knowledge and that is different from

834
00:39:15,359 --> 00:39:18,420
what I saw in the movies right so so so

835
00:39:18,420 --> 00:39:21,420
I would like to take the apprenticeship

836
00:39:21,420 --> 00:39:25,500
I I started with the idea that we did

837
00:39:25,500 --> 00:39:27,660
the idea that have more than just Jedi

838
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:30,900
Knights in the rebellion and I I welcome

839
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,359
you and and people here at black hat

840
00:39:33,359 --> 00:39:36,740
often aspire to this Jedi Knight status

841
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:40,940
Grace but not everyone in that Rebellion

842
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:43,680
aspires to the same thing and I don't

843
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:45,720
mean to say this is secret mystical

844
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:47,640
knowledge that only a few people should

845
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,079
ever have

846
00:39:49,079 --> 00:39:52,619
but rather recognize that the ground

847
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:56,099
troops the fighter pilots the mechanics

848
00:39:56,099 --> 00:39:59,640
that make up the Rebellion have

849
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:02,280
different skills that they spend their

850
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:05,520
time honing and we need to Define what

851
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:08,880
we expect of them for security in a

852
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,640
reasonable time frames so that we can

853
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,180
achieve it with that I know I'm out of

854
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:18,300

855
00:40:18,300 --> 00:40:21,240
