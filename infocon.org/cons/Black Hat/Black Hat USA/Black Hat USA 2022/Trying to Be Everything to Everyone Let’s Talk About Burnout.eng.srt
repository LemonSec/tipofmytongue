thank you all for being here so let's uh

4
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:13,799
let's talk about trying to be everything

5
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:17,400
to everyone to talk about burnout

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:19,800
so for this talk in particular uh what

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,720
we're going to do is focus on some of

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:24,240
the theoretical and kind of big picture

9
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,000
issues around burnout and then after

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:30,900
this so directly following uh in 2 30

11
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:33,360
South Pacific J

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:35,820
there'll be a community discussion and

13
00:00:35,820 --> 00:00:37,260
so what that would be is an opportunity

14
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:39,899
to get into some specific items all

15
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:42,300
right so looking at so q a that'll be a

16
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:44,640
great chance for Q a and looking at the

17
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:46,920
real world application of what we talk

18
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:48,840
about during this session so we'll begin

19
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:51,059
with the opportunity to be here right

20
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:52,320
now to talk about some of the big

21
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,840
picture items and then any q a

22
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,120
situations that you may want to share or

23
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,919
talk about in the community discussion

24
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:03,180
so very quickly just a little bit about

25
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:05,400
me I'm very familiar with the security

26
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,260
industry going from just in high school

27
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:09,780
just calling local bbs's attending 2600

28
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:11,580
meetings I started source security

29
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,100
conferences and I've worked at security

30
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:16,020
companies like Vera code I'm currently

31
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:17,780
at natography

32
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,979
I have a PhD in clinical and

33
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:23,340
organizational psychology and an MBA

34
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,740
which I'm basically a targeted that to

35
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,060
be able to understand not only the

36
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:28,860
social issues of what happens in a

37
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:31,200
workplace but the bottom line of a

38
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,299
business too and so I've looked at

39
00:01:33,299 --> 00:01:35,280
depression anxiety Employee Engagement

40
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,380
of course burnout and Technology sectors

41
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,880
and specifically in the security

42
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:41,220
industry and I'm currently adjunct

43
00:01:41,220 --> 00:01:43,560
professor at Norfolk State University

44
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,840
where I teach cyber psychology and

45
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,520
everybody always gives me that what is

46
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,619
cyber psychology which is basically the

47
00:01:49,619 --> 00:01:51,180
intersection of psychology and

48
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,000
technology so studying the impact that

49
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,840
technology has on on humans

50
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,880
okay so let's get to why you're here

51
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,000
today and let's talk about burnout

52
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,820
so what is burnout we've felt it we

53
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:07,439
understand it let's just get that clear

54
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,520
definition

55
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:10,258
the clinic is clinically defined as a

56
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:12,720
psychological syndrome

57
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,500
that occurs due to Chronic emotional

58
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:19,340
interpersonal stressors on the job

59
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:21,599
interpersonal stressors

60
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,360
I highlight that okay

61
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,099
what's called what may be causing your

62
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:28,440
burnout it's not necessarily what you

63
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,879
applied for when you read your job

64
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:31,920
description when you applied for your

65
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,120
job it's not necessarily the computer

66
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,400
it's not necessarily something that you

67
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,220
may be doing for your work it's defined

68
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,200
as the relationships

69
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,300
the interpersonal relationships the

70
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:47,700
people your managers what may be going

71
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:50,940
on in the relationships in your life so

72
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,400
we know what burnout is okay and I want

73
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,660
to highlight the interpersonal

74
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:56,879
relationships so when we're feeling

75
00:02:56,879 --> 00:02:58,200
burnt out

76
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:00,360
we tend to express it in three different

77
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,980
ways according to the research and if

78
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,360
you're here and you're familiar with

79
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,980
burnout you know about mozlak and you're

80
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,260
familiar with the crowning goal of the

81
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,040
way that Reese burnout is defined of the

82
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:12,959
emotional exhaustion

83
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,239
you're tired you have given so much

84
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,379
it's you're just generally overextended

85
00:03:22,379 --> 00:03:24,599
and depleted of your resources

86
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:27,060
and cynicism

87
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:30,540
just done with it done I'm angry I'm

88
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:33,599
detached I'm indifferent

89
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,540
professional efficacy

90
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,860
you don't feel good about your work

91
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:39,659
anymore maybe you chose this career

92
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:41,040
because you were like hey I'm good at

93
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:43,280
this I like this this makes me feel good

94
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,720
and now you're like maybe I feel like

95
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:48,180
I'm gonna get fired tomorrow I I stink

96
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:51,180
at this that I am terrible

97
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:53,099
so I did a research study of any of you

98
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:54,780
are familiar with with Jack Daniel his

99
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,340
research on Barnett I was also part of

100
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,099
that research project and we found that

101
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:01,860
in the security industry

102
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:04,500
most likely to express

103
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,340
uh burnout responses through cynicism so

104
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,900
something that's unique to it to the

105
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:12,480
security industry is the most common

106
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:14,519
response to burnout was the cynicism

107
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:18,358
this disconnect this feeling of

108
00:04:18,358 --> 00:04:22,380
I just done the whole place could burn

109
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,960
and I'm just not going to care this

110
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,639
anger this resentment so we'll talk

111
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:28,620
about that in a little bit so I wanted

112
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:30,780
to just these are the definitions when

113
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:32,820
we look at burnout and the way that we

114
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:34,800
tend to express them

115
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,419
and I always find it's important to look

116
00:04:36,419 --> 00:04:38,220
at burnout holistically

117
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:40,860
we're one person

118
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,660
when you're frustrated or you're upset

119
00:04:42,660 --> 00:04:45,240
say at your job chances are you're

120
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,919
coming home

121
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:49,259
and you're mad and you may be taking

122
00:04:49,259 --> 00:04:50,940
that out of your partner you may be

123
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:52,680
taking that out of your kids you would

124
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,600
be taking that out in your friends

125
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:57,120
or let's say you're feeling like

126
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,000
you're not doing a good job at work and

127
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,800
then you come home and your partner says

128
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,720
oh did you do the dishes did you do this

129
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,520
and you're like no now you're like great

130
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,919
now now I'm a lousy partner and then

131
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:09,180
your kids come home and say I want to

132
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:12,060
play no no I can't great now I'm a bad

133
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,320
parent I mean you're just kind of

134
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,300
kicking your butt left and right about

135
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,639
how you feel and it starts to have the

136
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:20,699
Snowball Effect where now

137
00:05:20,699 --> 00:05:23,160
you're just completely depleted so it's

138
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:25,320
not like you're feeling terrible about

139
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:27,479
just the way that you're feeling at work

140
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:30,000
you're trying to be so many things to so

141
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,560
many people

142
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,840
and it begins to hurt you in all aspects

143
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,220
of your life

144
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,560
so you're a lot of times your anger or

145
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:39,300
your frustration is often targeted at

146
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:40,800
work

147
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:43,139
and being taken out in so many different

148
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:45,180
areas in your life

149
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:46,860
so I always want to set things up of

150
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:49,560
when we look at burnout we're looking at

151
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,440
it in that big picture and that holistic

152
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,660
view of how is this impacting your life

153
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,520
and impacting you as a person

154
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,759
so let's look at burnout in the security

155
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:05,400
industry in particular

156
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:08,039
and what's interesting is when a lot of

157
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:09,840
the research that's out there that looks

158
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:10,979
at burnout

159
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:13,080
they're looking at caregivers a lot of

160
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,419
times you want to look at research and

161
00:06:15,419 --> 00:06:17,639
burnout that's on nurses doctors

162
00:06:17,639 --> 00:06:20,220
caregivers there's a lot of research out

163
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:22,319
there

164
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,240
less so in other professions

165
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,660
and what's interesting when we look at

166
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:30,060
the security industry

167
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:32,819
there is some research out there

168
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:35,100
but there needs to be more

169
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,560
right now those research that shows that

170
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,880
in some studies

171
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,300
that 77 to 80 percent of people in the

172
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:43,919
security industry are experiencing

173
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,800
burnout that means if there's 10 000

174
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,440
people walking around as a 10 000

175
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:50,759
Security Professionals walking around

176
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:53,100
black hat right now I mean can you eat

177
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:55,440
000 of those 7 500 to 8 000 of them are

178
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,180
burnt out

179
00:06:57,180 --> 00:07:00,900
to me that is an alarming number

180
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:03,300
out of 10 000 people

181
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:06,000
so why what what's going on I mean you

182
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,440
all know it you probably are living it

183
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,940
every day you could probably tell me

184
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:10,979
more than I can tell you but what I

185
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:12,840
think is important is to recognize it

186
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,360
and to acknowledge it because of what we

187
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,160
talk about in the next you know 30 some

188
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,800
odd minutes that we have left is the

189
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,120
more aware that you are of the

190
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,979
situations in your life that are causing

191
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:25,080
the burnout the better you're going to

192
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:27,360
be able at anticipating

193
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,880
how to manage them and how to solve them

194
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:31,860
so when we look at okay what's in the

195
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,300
security industry that is causing these

196
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,860
triggers that is causing the situations

197
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:36,180
in my life

198
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:38,400
the mental workload being able to have

199
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:39,900
to respond to things being able to

200
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:41,639
anticipate things

201
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:44,099
right anticipate these cyber attacks a

202
00:07:44,099 --> 00:07:46,199
shortage in Staffing and this increase

203
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,720
in workload trying to find your place in

204
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,580
an organization what if you're working

205
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,960
in an organization who doesn't even

206
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,000
understand the difference between what's

207
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,819
going on in security versus I.T

208
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:58,620
or maybe you're working for somebody who

209
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,780
just became a CSA who was brought over

210
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:02,880
and maybe you know more about the

211
00:08:02,880 --> 00:08:04,680
nuances of security than the person

212
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,419
you're working for and that's stressing

213
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,500
you out because you're trying to

214
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:09,960
convince them of the tools that you need

215
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,120
I mean all of these different things

216
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,880
that a lot of times the people in the

217
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,699
organization don't understand security

218
00:08:17,699 --> 00:08:19,800
practices in general

219
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:23,300
let alone how to support you let alone

220
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:26,400
how to manage and balance all of the

221
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,460
different asks that are coming through

222
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,960
and it's not often appreciated in the

223
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,000
organization I mean I've even wrote

224
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,740
written these things down yet I've been

225
00:08:34,740 --> 00:08:36,899
in the position where

226
00:08:36,899 --> 00:08:39,479
we're trying to get a new contract

227
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:41,880
through and we had one one poor

228
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:44,279
wonderful but sole security person who

229
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:46,200
had audit and review everything

230
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,420
and when we were in line and we had to

231
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:50,220
wait it was holding up our contract and

232
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:52,560
we're trying to to

233
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:54,180
they wanted to gently go like Could you

234
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,440
hurry this up Could you hurry this up

235
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,839
and I'm going don't don't this

236
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:00,720
individual is helping our company by

237
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:03,839
making sure that we don't introduce a

238
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,160
new program that's going to be

239
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,019
vulnerable and hurt the company and

240
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:08,220
everybody's getting all frustrated

241
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,959
because they want to speed it up because

242
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:12,120
it's causing delays

243
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,519
and I even know better and I'm still you

244
00:09:14,519 --> 00:09:15,480
know

245
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:17,820
getting tempted to go after our poor

246
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:19,740
security person I mean all of these

247
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,839
things that we don't understand

248
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,399
and if we don't even understand security

249
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:25,380
to begin with how can people begin to

250
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:27,480
understand how to help people who are

251
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,920
working in the security industry

252
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:33,720
so if you go online and you look at oh

253
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:36,240
okay what do we do for Burnout

254
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,880
and this is what drives me crazy

255
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:40,440
this is usually what you'll start to

256
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,640
find out

257
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,200
the tape

258
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:45,680
a hobby

259
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:52,220
great yes

260
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:58,620
so when I get into my burnout

261
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,360
when I'm in like the dark place like the

262
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,519
really dark place I look at this and I'm

263
00:10:02,519 --> 00:10:04,260
like oh okay yeah all right so work less

264
00:10:04,260 --> 00:10:06,720
so I'm so stressed out right now that

265
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,279
I'm feeling like if I don't give it my

266
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:10,380
all I'm gonna get fired I'm doing a

267
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:13,200
terrible job so if I work less my

268
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,700
anxiety is going to go through the roof

269
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:17,880
so I don't feel like I can take a break

270
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,760
okay take a vacation I'm gonna spend

271
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,440
that vacation checking my emails

272
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:24,360
freaking out my boss is going to be

273
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,160
calling me all the time now my family is

274
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:27,839
going to be really mad at me because I'm

275
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,220
spending the whole time checking my

276
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,839
emails and doing work and now I spent

277
00:10:30,839 --> 00:10:32,880
money and I probably shouldn't have to

278
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,380
take a vacation that everybody's mad at

279
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:35,360
me for

280
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,339
maybe not all right

281
00:10:38,339 --> 00:10:40,740
I mean all of these do things do things

282
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:43,740
do things meditate breathing new hobbies

283
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:45,720
we spend money on new hobbies that are

284
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:48,000
going to sit in the corner staring at me

285
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,740
okay yeah I have a Peloton script

286
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:51,540
subscription and every month it stares

287
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:53,279
at me with that little thing that goes

288
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,720
off and I'm not going to cancel it it's

289
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,339
not going to um

290
00:10:56,339 --> 00:10:58,920
I'm not going to cancel it

291
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:01,019
I'm not gonna let it win

292
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:02,459
but I'm not ready to go and start

293
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:05,779
exercising again because I'm

294
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:09,660
do it all right eat right

295
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:11,760
when I'm burnt out and I'm in like my

296
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,320
dark place I'm not ready to go make a

297
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,880
salad and happy I'm sitting there under

298
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,980
a pile of Taco Bell wrappers barely able

299
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:18,480
to function

300
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,860
okay like this is I'm not here I'd love

301
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:26,459
to be here but I'm not here so I I look

302
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:28,380
for these burnout strategies and I get

303
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:31,079
these perky happy do all of these things

304
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:33,300
and it just makes me mad

305
00:11:33,300 --> 00:11:34,980
okay

306
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,500
I know I want to get there but I read

307
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:39,600
these and I go okay fine you're right

308
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,459
this is good advice I'm not saying this

309
00:11:41,459 --> 00:11:43,620
is not good advice this is good advice

310
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:46,440
I don't know how to get there though

311
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,579
I don't

312
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:51,180
I'm depressed I'm anxious I'm sad I

313
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:52,740
don't feel good enough about myself to

314
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:54,959
even go get there

315
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:56,820
so what do I do

316
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,500
what do I do how do I get there help me

317
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:02,420
help me get there it's first

318
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,940
because this

319
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:09,260
this is where I'm at

320
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:13,640
okay this is where I'm at

321
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:16,320
so what do I do

322
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,300
you tell me to do this for my burnout

323
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,440
I'm with you

324
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,720
but the fact of the matter is

325
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,040
this in the long term feels good

326
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:28,079
but it doesn't make me I know I'm not

327
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,480
solving my problems I know I'm not

328
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,120
really doing the things that get me to

329
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,440
where I need to be

330
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:36,839
there's a short-term Solutions

331
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,339
I know this because then when I'm 30

332
00:12:38,339 --> 00:12:40,260
pounds heavier and

333
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:42,240
recovering from a hangover or you know

334
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,680
whatever it is I know I'm just making

335
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,779
myself feeling worse feel worse so I got

336
00:12:45,779 --> 00:12:47,820
to get to the good place but

337
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,959
how do I get there

338
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,100
so we'll talk about this so this will

339
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:55,380
come back out but as a shell we've got

340
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:58,139
one called the burnout taxonomy

341
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:00,240
because it's a process

342
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,700
you don't get from I'm eating my

343
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,620
feelings and barely functioning

344
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,760
to

345
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,740
great I'm just gonna go eat healthy and

346
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:10,139
be fine and take a break and go meditate

347
00:13:10,139 --> 00:13:13,800
and become all Zen and great overnight

348
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,779
I mean maybe you can I can't say no one

349
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:17,760
is and if you do please by all means

350
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,500
tell me what to do I'll trade come up

351
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,700
here and I'll trade with you because I'd

352
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:23,300
love to hear it

353
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,440
but um but I call it survival because a

354
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,660
lot of times that's what you're doing

355
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,560
sometimes you're still burned out and

356
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:34,139
you're just in such a dark place that

357
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:36,120
you're surviving

358
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,700
and you're surviving as a coping

359
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,680
mechanism that that's where you're at so

360
00:13:40,680 --> 00:13:43,200
how do we get to that the relief and

361
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,820
what we're calling self-efficacy which

362
00:13:44,820 --> 00:13:47,300
I'll go over

363
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,079
okay so let's talk about the first step

364
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:54,360
now I know many of you here today and

365
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,740
you want me to tell you this is what you

366
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:59,399
do and it's a magic Panacea pill it's a

367
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:00,720
statement it's a thing it's something

368
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,360
you can do love to have that I really

369
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,760
would so don't get mad at me but I don't

370
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:07,079
have that

371
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:08,700
okay

372
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:11,160
but this is what I do have for you

373
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:13,440
so what the research shows in terms of

374
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:14,820
what's the most effective for solving

375
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,220
burnout so social learning theory and

376
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,839
self-efficacy

377
00:14:18,839 --> 00:14:20,459
and so what does this mean

378
00:14:20,459 --> 00:14:22,320
and so what this means is that the more

379
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,600
that you learn about yourself the more

380
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,459
that you enhance your awareness the more

381
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:29,820
that you learn about your responses your

382
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:32,279
triggers your beliefs this your

383
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:33,899
narrative

384
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:35,639
the more that you can be better at

385
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:37,500
managing it

386
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,040
right

387
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,720
because when you get into some of the

388
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,519
situational factors

389
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:46,440
so some of those the Band-Aids some of

390
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,839
the like oh well okay if I just get a

391
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:52,199
new boss or that co-worker who doesn't

392
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:54,240
do work enough work and drives me crazy

393
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,380
some of those

394
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:57,899
factors can change

395
00:14:57,899 --> 00:14:59,880
but it's not sometimes it's just a short

396
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,260
fix

397
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,899
and then maybe you change jobs but

398
00:15:03,899 --> 00:15:06,839
there's new things that burn you out

399
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:08,820
and you may find that the same patterns

400
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:11,040
are happening in different places not

401
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,040
always in the same way

402
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:16,860
like for me I know like I know my

403
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,660
anxiety triggers

404
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,180
and I know like for me it's usually the

405
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:24,060
emotional exhaustion piece

406
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,040
for me that's just gonna happen Wherever

407
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,300
I Go

408
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,339
now sometimes in situational factors you

409
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:31,620
have a toxic work environment a boss if

410
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,660
we're going to talk about that too

411
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:35,760
when we talk about awareness you know it

412
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:38,579
becomes is it something that I can

413
00:15:38,579 --> 00:15:40,139
control is it something that's out of my

414
00:15:40,139 --> 00:15:41,639
control and how do we get that awareness

415
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:43,800
to be able to take those next steps but

416
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,959
one of the things that is important

417
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:48,899
even though the social learning theory

418
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:51,000
and self-efficacy it may be asking you

419
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,940
to do the work of recognizing the

420
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:55,920
situation in yourself and recognizing

421
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,279
what you can control or change

422
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:03,300
I am at no point saying that burnout is

423
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,800
your fault

424
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,240
and I think that that is really

425
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:08,399
important to acknowledge

426
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,220
there's a lot of lousy situations and

427
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,680
toxic workplaces and poorly managed

428
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,199
situations and so many negative

429
00:16:16,199 --> 00:16:18,660
situations that are out there that can

430
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,240
cause burnout that are frustrating that

431
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:23,000
you feel helpless about

432
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:27,120
that not just helpless but angry rage

433
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,100
frustration just keeps you up at night

434
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,959
stewing because you're so angry because

435
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:33,180
you were putting so much into your work

436
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:35,579
and you want to be heard you want to be

437
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:38,759
appreciated I mean so many things

438
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:40,500
and then here I am coming along and

439
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,360
saying well if you only just changed

440
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:43,920
your narrative about how to do you know

441
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,959
like yeah okay

442
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:49,399
I get it I do

443
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,180
but that's kind of also the rub of it

444
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:52,980
and so let's talk about that but I do

445
00:16:52,980 --> 00:16:55,440
want to be clear made that asking you to

446
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,759
do the work but asking you to think

447
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:59,100
about what you can and can't change it's

448
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,139
not saying that it's your fault that

449
00:17:01,139 --> 00:17:02,820
somebody's poor management or somebody's

450
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,919
toxic work environment they're asking

451
00:17:04,919 --> 00:17:06,660
the way that you respond to it means

452
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,919
that you're the cause of it

453
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:12,540
but is looking at what you can and can't

454
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:13,859
control

455
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:15,299
because that's the thing is that at the

456
00:17:15,299 --> 00:17:17,780
end of the day

457
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:21,839
you are impacted by what you can and

458
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:24,059
can't control

459
00:17:24,059 --> 00:17:25,740
if somebody is a poor leader and you can

460
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:28,140
make those recommendations there's many

461
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:29,940
times where I've gone into a work

462
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,260
environment that I've been brought in

463
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:33,600
and they say go fix my team

464
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,400
and I have to turn around and say okay

465
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,980
but are you willing to also change

466
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:40,140
because unless you as a manager are

467
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:41,760
willing to change

468
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,980
there's only so much that I can do

469
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:46,380
and if the answer is no from that

470
00:17:46,380 --> 00:17:47,580
manager

471
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:49,200
that I'm limited

472
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,940
and then

473
00:17:50,940 --> 00:17:54,000
I usually will say okay fine and I've

474
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,440
worked with the team and I said the last

475
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,760
team that I worked with what happened

476
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,520
was I worked with the team they built up

477
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:01,440
their confidence they managed their

478
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,520
burnout

479
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,260
and then in that particular situation

480
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:07,020
some of them found new roles

481
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,700
some of them made their own piece with

482
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:09,900
their work

483
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:11,760
and found a happier place and they were

484
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,679
able to manage it

485
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,720
but it never actually came to a good

486
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:18,419
fruition and became the potential that

487
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:19,799
the team could have

488
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:22,440
but the staff was able to at least find

489
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,000
a place where they weren't angry and

490
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,160
resentful and in when again that dark

491
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,320
place

492
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:30,059
because we need to look at what we can

493
00:18:30,059 --> 00:18:31,320
control

494
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,660
because when you're angry when you're up

495
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,480
at night fuming and raging you're

496
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,880
suffering you're hurting

497
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:41,520
the sad part is if you're burnt down and

498
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,860
it's your perform manager or there's a

499
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:45,299
situation they may be sleeping no

500
00:18:45,299 --> 00:18:46,860
problem

501
00:18:46,860 --> 00:18:50,039
you're the one hurting sorry you're the

502
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:52,200
one hurting you're the one being angry

503
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:55,740
it's your relationships that are in pain

504
00:18:55,740 --> 00:18:58,799
and that's the sad part of it

505
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,600
is that it's your situations in your

506
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,379
life that are in pain

507
00:19:03,539 --> 00:19:04,679
and so we have to look at all these

508
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:07,500
things of how do we respond to them

509
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:10,860
what are the triggers so if you've got

510
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:13,799
say a manager that you're not getting

511
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:16,919
along with or a co-worker what is it

512
00:19:16,919 --> 00:19:18,480
about that and start pulling on these

513
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:21,840
threads asking these questions what is

514
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:23,940
it about it okay

515
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:26,160
why does this frustrate me so much and

516
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,440
these are hard questions to ask because

517
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:30,380
they're hard to answer

518
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:33,179
I don't I don't know it just it's the

519
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:34,799
principle of things I come to work every

520
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:38,280
day from nine to five this person shows

521
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:39,780
up at 10 o'clock they show up late every

522
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:42,120
day meaning I have to do more work

523
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:45,120
and that's not right

524
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:48,500
you're right you are right

525
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,240
you're the one who's being angry about

526
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,820
it for good reasons and you're the one

527
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:55,500
suffering and this is what I mean

528
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:56,640
there's

529
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,679
the answer the right answer what I wish

530
00:19:58,679 --> 00:19:59,880
you could say is you know what you're

531
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,860
absolutely right that person should show

532
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,200
up at nine o'clock if not early take on

533
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,460
their job

534
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:07,980
but we can't control that person

535
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:10,320
and you're in the cycle

536
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,059
and you're this story when I talk about

537
00:20:12,059 --> 00:20:13,559
like your mental script and narrative

538
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:16,080
how many times do you go to bed or

539
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:17,520
you're sitting there thinking just

540
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,140
telling yourself the story oh they

541
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,460
should show up in time oh then you

542
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:23,039
ruminate over and over and over and over

543
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:24,840
and tell it in your head

544
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,820
because you're mad and you're doing it

545
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,919
and

546
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:31,020
what can you control and what can't you

547
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:33,260
control

548
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,320
so let's take a look at just some of the

549
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:40,919
real world examples here

550
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:44,100
so okay so let's say this you've got

551
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:47,100
a whole bunch of work to do

552
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,320
you're feeling frustrated

553
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,080
work is behind right there's the

554
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:54,360
emotional exhaustion piece so your

555
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:55,919
different responses okay I'm going to

556
00:20:55,919 --> 00:20:58,500
stay late I noticed late before but I

557
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:01,559
want to push myself as hard as I can and

558
00:21:01,559 --> 00:21:04,020
do everything my boss asks for me

559
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,940
because it's that feeling of validation

560
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:08,760
I'm going to push myself so hard

561
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:10,740
cynicism and anger this is poor

562
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:11,700
management

563
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,380
if I had a good manager this things

564
00:21:13,380 --> 00:21:15,240
wouldn't be so backed up

565
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,919
heck with it

566
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:18,720
I'm just going to leave I don't care not

567
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:21,960
my problem they're a poor manager and I

568
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,059
don't need to give any and the heck with

569
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:25,440
them

570
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,419
the professional efficacy

571
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:29,100
I used to be good at this I used to be

572
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:31,980
able to do this task and enjoy it I

573
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,020
can't do this anymore

574
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:36,539
I don't think I'm good at my job

575
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:38,159
all of these emotions that you're

576
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:40,860
feeling however you choose to express it

577
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:44,418
however you may identify with it

578
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:47,100
right

579
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,260
these may be familiar situations these

580
00:21:49,260 --> 00:21:52,100
May resonate they may not

581
00:21:52,260 --> 00:21:54,419
so it becomes about asking yourself okay

582
00:21:54,419 --> 00:21:57,120
so this is how I'm responding

583
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:00,419
for valid reasons again everything that

584
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:02,159
you're feeling about burnout

585
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,740
is valid

586
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:08,400
but asking why am I doing this

587
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,159
why am I pushing myself so hard what do

588
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:13,140
I need here

589
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:16,740
why is it that when I get a or a message

590
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,620
at 9 00 pm at night I feel the need to

591
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:21,780
reply

592
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:25,220
what's pushing me to do that

593
00:22:27,659 --> 00:22:29,940
the cynicism

594
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,159
so when was the trust broken why are you

595
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,140
angry where is this I don't care if the

596
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,940
whole place is on fire

597
00:22:35,940 --> 00:22:38,520
and so this this one is hard

598
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:40,620
and I want to be clear about the

599
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:42,299
difference between boundaries and

600
00:22:42,299 --> 00:22:43,440
cynicism

601
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,380
because this is an emotional piece

602
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,780
is when you say a boundary of I'm going

603
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,159
to work my nine to five

604
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,780
because I need to do that for me because

605
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:53,760
that's the agreement we work nine to

606
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:55,140
five it's okay

607
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:57,740
okay boundary

608
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,760
I'm gonna work nine to five and I don't

609
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,980
care if you need anything else because

610
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,700
you suck and that's it

611
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,400
and it's this emotional piece of where

612
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,620
it's coming from and if you've ever been

613
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:14,280
around also cynical co-workers

614
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,380
the ones that vent

615
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,360
the ones that are angry

616
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,880
the ones that have ever been next to a

617
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,840
toxic employee I worked with a group one

618
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,020
time and

619
00:23:27,020 --> 00:23:29,400
there was just one employee he was so

620
00:23:29,400 --> 00:23:31,880
cynical and so burnt out and so angry

621
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,380
that anyone who would basically stand

622
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:36,900
still for about five minutes

623
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,460
he was telling them how terrible it was

624
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,780
to work there

625
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,400
and so it became a very toxic work

626
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,320
environment because

627
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:44,940
even the people that were trying to be

628
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,380
more positive about their work

629
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:48,600
environment and trying to work it out he

630
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,600
would be right there just Angry Angry

631
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:52,919
Angry Angry

632
00:23:52,919 --> 00:23:55,980
and so it's trying to set boundaries and

633
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,200
can what would it take to not be angry

634
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:00,960
and to free yourself from that

635
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:03,360
because again it's not

636
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,919
you're the one that's suffering from

637
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:06,360
that anger you're the one that's

638
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,799
bringing that home

639
00:24:07,799 --> 00:24:10,260
not again not your fault there are

640
00:24:10,260 --> 00:24:11,520
things that work that are making you

641
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,020
angry there are things in situations

642
00:24:13,020 --> 00:24:15,059
that are making you angry but what can

643
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:17,280
you do to help remove yourself from that

644
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:20,820
anger and find that peace from that

645
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:22,740
and then again the professional efficacy

646
00:24:22,740 --> 00:24:24,360
of

647
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:26,340
when will you feel good enough is

648
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,620
imposter syndrome when did you feel

649
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:30,659
valued what would help you feel valued

650
00:24:30,659 --> 00:24:32,460
so whatever it is in the way that you're

651
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:34,320
expressing burnout

652
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,820
what can help

653
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:38,280
pill relief in this

654
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:41,460
so our taxonomy okay

655
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,900
so whatever it is when you're looking at

656
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,700
this is how I express my burnout so

657
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:47,100
identifying that first

658
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,020
so let's say we're down here in our

659
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:50,100
survival

660
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:52,080
okay we're eating our feelings we're

661
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,760
drinking whiskey we're listening to

662
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,559
Slayer whatever it is we are miserable

663
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,919
so the first thing that I recommend to

664
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:03,299
do

665
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:06,000
is take a second

666
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:08,220
thing

667
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:09,960
I'm aware of it

668
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,659
I'm burnt out

669
00:25:12,659 --> 00:25:14,400
this isn't okay

670
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,620
what's going on in my life right now is

671
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,979
not okay

672
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,679
that's it just stop there for a second

673
00:25:22,679 --> 00:25:25,140
right forget the dues forget the shoulds

674
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:28,020
forget the whatever right the awareness

675
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,580
of it

676
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:33,199
and I can do something about it

677
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,840
stop there I really stay away from the

678
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:39,539
do's and the shoulds right away

679
00:25:39,539 --> 00:25:41,880
um one of the things that I always

680
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,559
remind myself is as soon as you start

681
00:25:43,559 --> 00:25:45,900
getting in your head I should do this I

682
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,220
should do that you should all over

683
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:49,020
yourself

684
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,700
okay

685
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,039
do not all over yourself because

686
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:55,380
you're you're down in your survival and

687
00:25:55,380 --> 00:25:57,480
we beat ourselves up I should be doing

688
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:00,179
this I should be doing so much more

689
00:26:00,179 --> 00:26:02,400
or they should be doing this they should

690
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:04,679
be doing that they should be doing this

691
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:06,659
wherever your anger is wherever it's

692
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:09,900
internal external your sadness it's

693
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:12,059
there these these emotions are valid and

694
00:26:12,059 --> 00:26:14,159
they're real

695
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:15,659
and the thing with emotions is we don't

696
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:17,159
want to who wants to feel bad I don't

697
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:19,559
want to feel bad

698
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:21,240
and when we deny ourselves the ability

699
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,919
to just sit there and be aware of it and

700
00:26:22,919 --> 00:26:26,299
say I feel bad right now

701
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,600
that's hard sometimes to just sit there

702
00:26:30,600 --> 00:26:32,039
and sit with that we don't like to sit

703
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:34,460
with things

704
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,880
okay so I'm burnt out

705
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,520
this is not okay my life is not okay

706
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:44,640
right now I am not okay right now I am

707
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,840
not happy

708
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,679
I am lying here on the floor with 22

709
00:26:49,679 --> 00:26:51,779
liter bottles of Mountain Dew five bags

710
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:53,400
of Taco Bell and three bags of Arby's

711
00:26:53,400 --> 00:26:55,380
don't judge

712
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:58,320
okay like

713
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:00,960
and

714
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,779
this isn't where I want to be now

715
00:27:03,779 --> 00:27:05,460
don't get me wrong there's been times

716
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:06,840
where I'm like yes I've got all my bags

717
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,340
of Taco Bells and I love Arby's and I am

718
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:10,679
happy as a clam there's no judgment but

719
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:11,940
I'm in a good place about it because

720
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:14,840
it's a happy choice

721
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,360
but where do you want to be

722
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:20,159
okay this isn't really where I want to

723
00:27:20,159 --> 00:27:22,679
be right now where do I want to be what

724
00:27:22,679 --> 00:27:24,539
do I want to do what's going on so that

725
00:27:24,539 --> 00:27:25,980
awareness

726
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:28,140
right

727
00:27:28,140 --> 00:27:30,840
I can be the Catalyst for change this

728
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:32,460
this has to change

729
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:35,760
okay I'm gonna make change happen

730
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,940
don't go crazy don't start committing to

731
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:42,179
things you can't commit to don't rush it

732
00:27:42,179 --> 00:27:43,679
there's anything I think when you rush

733
00:27:43,679 --> 00:27:45,240
it when you start like I'm gonna go to

734
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,320
the gym

735
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,140
and I'm gonna run five miles a day

736
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,600
like I don't know but uh you know if

737
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:54,240
you've ever guilty here started a diet

738
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:57,419
plan and then failed it like 20 times

739
00:27:57,419 --> 00:27:59,279
um you just feel worse sometimes right

740
00:27:59,279 --> 00:28:01,080
like set yourself up for Success

741
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,299
whatever that may be

742
00:28:03,299 --> 00:28:05,400
and it can be baby steps but set

743
00:28:05,400 --> 00:28:07,440
yourself up for success in that

744
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:09,539
and begin to understand it and so this

745
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:11,520
is why I was pushing the you know asking

746
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:13,740
questions like okay why am I doing this

747
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,720
what do I feel do I like this begin to

748
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,400
understand it so as you go to

749
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,679
understanding it then you begin to find

750
00:28:19,679 --> 00:28:21,240
the relief because you understand it

751
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,039
okay this is when this person does this

752
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,740
it's really going to make me mad

753
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:28,080
I'm gonna go for a walk I'm gonna go do

754
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,179
something differently I'm gonna I know

755
00:28:30,179 --> 00:28:31,559
that's gonna trigger me when they do

756
00:28:31,559 --> 00:28:33,659
this maybe I'm gonna go sit somewhere

757
00:28:33,659 --> 00:28:35,640
else maybe I'm just going to take a step

758
00:28:35,640 --> 00:28:37,980
away and I'm going to schedule time at

759
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:39,360
that meeting every that we have every

760
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,520
day really makes me frustrated so I'm

761
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:43,380
going to schedule 15 minutes afterwards

762
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:45,840
to take a break and not do back to backs

763
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,460
I'm going to start coming up with the

764
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,900
awareness of what happens I'm going to

765
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:51,779
look for patterns and try to manage what

766
00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:54,299
frustrates me

767
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:55,679
and then eventually I'm bringing it up

768
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,200
to what we call that self-efficacy as I

769
00:28:58,200 --> 00:29:00,419
mentioned so that is the knowing of your

770
00:29:00,419 --> 00:29:02,340
worth knowing being able to anticipate

771
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:05,159
being able to have that awareness

772
00:29:05,159 --> 00:29:06,960
because that's what the research shows

773
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,460
is the best way to managing burnout

774
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,960
learn yourself

775
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:13,140
learn yourself learn new situations to

776
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:15,480
be able to basically go Jujitsu on that

777
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:17,700
stuff right like oh I see you coming

778
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,520
Dodge it Dodge it got it move it back I

779
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:22,500
mean it's just learning the situations

780
00:29:22,500 --> 00:29:24,960
now this doesn't mean that if you're in

781
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:26,220
a bad situation that you can't just

782
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:27,840
polish off your resume and say this is

783
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,299
not working and we need to end this

784
00:29:30,299 --> 00:29:32,940
okay I mean you know your your life you

785

and in your life you do have experience

792
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:48,059

799
00:30:01,500 --> 00:30:04,159
takes change

800
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:09,539
so some of the quick advice and tips

801
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:11,940

that have nothing to do with the job

808
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:25,380
itself or your company

809
00:30:25,380 --> 00:30:26,880
but if you don't know what it looks like

810
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,220
how will you know if you're there

811

00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:05,640
ask yourself these questions

831
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:09,059
yeah a lot of this does benefit from

832
00:31:09,059 --> 00:31:11,100
professional help okay either through

833
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,659
coaches and talk about that stuff

834
00:31:12,659 --> 00:31:14,520
through professional help coaches ask

835
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:15,840
for help

836
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:19,679
okay you can benefit from that from

837
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,480
working that through from helping with

838
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:22,980
that awareness

839
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,840
know your triggers again know your

840
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,460
triggers externally and internally

841
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:29,880
sometimes we are our own worst critics

842
00:31:29,880 --> 00:31:32,580
that we criticize ourselves know your

843
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:33,899
inner critic

844
00:31:33,899 --> 00:31:36,600
don't just shut up if you have to right

845
00:31:36,600 --> 00:31:39,480
like be able to know like I'm doing that

846
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,799
thing right now

847
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,140
please stop doing that thing right like

848
00:31:43,140 --> 00:31:46,080
being able to be able to Traverse

849
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,899
the paths and the situations

850
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:50,700
setting the expectations about what's

851
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:52,440
being asked of you and I love this this

852
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,740
idea of this 42 role right that 42 of

853
00:31:55,740 --> 00:31:58,020
your day should be sent resting and

854
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:01,140
doing something stress relieving

855
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:03,240
I don't know who came up with that exact

856
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:05,279
number I mean I do and not personally

857
00:32:05,279 --> 00:32:06,840
but in terms of like that's what

858
00:32:06,840 --> 00:32:09,899
research shows but I don't know anybody

859
00:32:09,899 --> 00:32:11,340
that actually

860
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:14,399
bends 42 percent of their day just

861
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,520
taking care of themselves in self-care

862
00:32:17,520 --> 00:32:19,440
but I love that idea

863
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,600
right like you know and sometimes but

864
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:22,620
look at that and I'm like wait a minute

865
00:32:22,620 --> 00:32:25,500
okay 42 let me do the numbers where am I

866
00:32:25,500 --> 00:32:27,840
at right I am not even close to 42 like

867
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,279
I wake up in the morning and I get my

868
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,779
kids to school I go to work I go pick up

869
00:32:30,779 --> 00:32:32,640
my kids I get home and then I have two

870
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:35,520
hours a day and I play some video games

871
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:36,960
yeah

872
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:38,700
which is fun

873
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:40,140
it's not myself I wouldn't call that

874
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:43,020
self-care that's more like

875
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:45,779
I'm just vegging out I'm decompressing

876
00:32:45,779 --> 00:32:47,820
kind of self-care but

877
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:50,700
uh to bring it to does it energize me

878
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:52,860
that's a tricky one I love my video

879
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:53,760
games

880
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,240
fun

881
00:32:56,580 --> 00:32:58,440
but that's more of like I just need to

882
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:01,440
like chill out for a minute

883
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:03,059
there's a couple of things and I'm still

884
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:05,279
on the the Quest for this but like

885
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:07,020
what's something that I that gives me

886
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,659
satisfaction that makes me feel like yes

887
00:33:09,659 --> 00:33:12,419
this makes me feel awesome when I do

888
00:33:12,419 --> 00:33:14,340
this thing I win at life

889
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:17,399
right like should we have that I'm

890
00:33:17,399 --> 00:33:18,840
struggling to find that still there's a

891
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,940
couple of things but

892
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:21,720
um

893
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,580
because sometimes we don't find our

894
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:26,580
self-worth from work

895
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:28,980
and when I started my career path long

896
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:30,659
time ago it was well if we're going to

897
00:33:30,659 --> 00:33:32,399
spend so much time at work I want to

898
00:33:32,399 --> 00:33:33,899
learn about Employee Engagement and all

899
00:33:33,899 --> 00:33:35,760
these things because we're going to

900
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,019
spend that much time at work we should

901
00:33:37,019 --> 00:33:38,880
love what we're doing

902
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:40,740
we should feel validated by it we're

903
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:42,179
putting all this time and all this

904
00:33:42,179 --> 00:33:44,159
effort we spend more time at work than

905
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,620
we do anywhere else then we should love

906
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,640
it

907
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:49,620
been a long time ago and I was very

908
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:51,179
naive

909
00:33:51,179 --> 00:33:53,700
but I still can't believe that I do

910
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:56,240
I do

911
00:33:58,019 --> 00:33:59,940
but if you can't find that from work if

912
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:02,220
you're not in an opportunity for that if

913
00:34:02,220 --> 00:34:04,200
by the nature of the security industry

914
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,419
by the nature of the work environment

915
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:08,760
that you're in whatever it may be but is

916
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,379
there something that energizes you where

917
00:34:10,379 --> 00:34:12,060
you can say you know what this is my job

918
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,339
this is the situation I need to put a

919
00:34:14,339 --> 00:34:15,719
little fence around that and say I'm

920
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:17,520
going to do my work I'm going to leave

921
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,320
at the end of the day and then I'm going

922
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:22,199
to go do my hobby and that makes me feel

923
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,940
awesome

924
00:34:23,940 --> 00:34:25,619
or I'm gonna go hang out with my friends

925
00:34:25,619 --> 00:34:27,480
or I'm gonna go be with my family what

926
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,099
you know whatever it is what energizes

927
00:34:29,099 --> 00:34:30,179
you

928
00:34:30,179 --> 00:34:31,800
and bringing that back to what do you

929
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,239
want

930
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:35,040
and celebrate it

931
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:38,659
take pleasure in the small things

932
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:42,179
your job is important it is you are

933
00:34:42,179 --> 00:34:44,099
important

934
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:47,639
but find yourself in your life

935
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,619
your work doesn't have to Define you it

936
00:34:49,619 --> 00:34:52,918
doesn't have to Define your happiness

937
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:55,739
and as cliche as it sounds and cliche

938
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:57,900
and the you know find your happiness and

939
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:00,420
defend it and you know I I

940
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:02,220
like I said when I started I would love

941
00:35:02,220 --> 00:35:04,680
to have some magic solution for you that

942
00:35:04,680 --> 00:35:06,540
says this is what you do if you go do

943
00:35:06,540 --> 00:35:08,460
these fine things this will reduce your

944
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:10,320
burnout and everybody leaves and comes

945
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:11,579
back and I see you next year and you're

946
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:13,079
like hi Stacy I'm really happy now and

947
00:35:13,079 --> 00:35:14,700
I'm not at all burnt out

948
00:35:14,700 --> 00:35:18,420
that would be awesome I would love that

949
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:19,859
um sorry

950
00:35:19,859 --> 00:35:21,900
I'm not here to tell you that part

951
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,220
but

952
00:35:23,220 --> 00:35:24,540
it is there

953
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,579
that I can tell you

954
00:35:26,579 --> 00:35:28,440
that I can tell you that I believe that

955
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,180
every single one of you can walk out of

956
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:31,140
this room

957
00:35:31,140 --> 00:35:32,940
do the work

958
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:36,119
and find the happiness and protect it

959
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:38,280
in the way that you choose that I do

960
00:35:38,280 --> 00:35:39,440
believe

961
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,880
and I'm very happy to go and discuss

962
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,320
that with you

963
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,520
if you would like in the session

964
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,020
following after this because I know we

965
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:48,000
only have a couple of minutes which

966
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,040
doesn't leave much time for Q a or

967
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:51,960
anything but I'm more than happy to

968
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,640
discuss that as well after the

969
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:55,740
conference itself bringing us just to

970
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:59,940
the last time of resources and tools

971
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:02,280
um these are all tools that can help you

972
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,780
actually even just applying some of what

973
00:36:03,780 --> 00:36:06,060
I've talked about today in terms of

974
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:08,400
professional therapist

975
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:11,339
that will always in my opinion be your

976
00:36:11,339 --> 00:36:12,839
best bet I mean this is what they do

977
00:36:12,839 --> 00:36:14,820
they are trained to help you go through

978
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:16,200
and pull on those threads and ask you

979
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:17,579
those questions and say what makes you

980
00:36:17,579 --> 00:36:19,619
happy and if nothing else it's like a

981
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:21,660
whole hour just to talk about the

982
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,040
problems that are in your life and help

983
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:24,839
you figure it out and now with

984
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:26,640
teletherapy

985
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:29,280
um that help make things easier because

986
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:30,960
um you don't have to leave your house I

987
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:33,300
like that I don't want to leave my house

988
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,940
um life coach physical personal trainer

989
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:38,220
self-care code I mean all of these all

990
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,619
of these things there are opportunities

991
00:36:40,619 --> 00:36:42,660
there are resources that can help you

992
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:43,920
but

993
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:44,940
um

994
00:36:44,940 --> 00:36:48,500
so again tying it back

995
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,579
it can happen there are ways to reduce

996
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:52,619
burnout there are situations again I do

997
00:36:52,619 --> 00:36:54,359
have compatible compassion and empathy

998
00:36:54,359 --> 00:36:55,920
of

999
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:58,020
you're putting a lot into your work I

1000
00:36:58,020 --> 00:36:59,940
think if you're here in this room

1001
00:36:59,940 --> 00:37:02,339
chances are you're in pain

1002
00:37:02,339 --> 00:37:04,140
you're feeling the frustrations you're

1003
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:06,200
not getting what you are putting into

1004
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:09,000
your work environment

1005
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,060
you're tired you're angry you are a

1006
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:13,800
wealth of emotions

1007
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,079
right now

1008
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,820
from your burnout

1009
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,800
and you don't have to be

1010
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:21,660
you shouldn't be

1011
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:23,160
you shouldn't be

1012
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:26,299
you don't deserve to be

1013
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,079
and so I hope if anything as you walk

1014
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,339
away from this talk that that's

1015
00:37:29,339 --> 00:37:31,560
something that you can sit with that you

1016
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:34,079
don't deserve to be burnt out but that

1017
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:35,820
each and every single one of you and

1018
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:37,859
whatever it is

1019
00:37:37,859 --> 00:37:41,520
can find a way to to not be whatever the

1020
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,400
choices are but but first just to even

1021
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,020
sit with that and say

1022
00:37:46,020 --> 00:37:48,000
I don't need to be

1023
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,440
okay

1024
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,420
let's start with that

1025
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,160
and then decide

1026
00:37:53,160 --> 00:37:55,320
what you want to do and where you can go

1027
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:57,680
from there

1028
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:00,130
but thank you
