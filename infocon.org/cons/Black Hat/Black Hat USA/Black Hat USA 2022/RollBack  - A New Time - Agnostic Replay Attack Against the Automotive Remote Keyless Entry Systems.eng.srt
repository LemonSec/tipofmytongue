00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:10,920
hi ladies and gentlemen hope you enjoy

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,139
your lunch and thank you for coming back

4
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:15,420
here for our talk we are a group of

5
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:17,880
researchers based in Singapore my name

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:19,039
is

7
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,980
I represent NCS it's a digital and

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,380
Technology service provider and I run

9
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:28,080
the cyber security R D team and with me

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,960
is my collaborator Levy we used to work

11
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,239
for NCS and is now a senior research

12
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:35,520
scientist with esta which is a national

13
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,460
Research Institute in Singapore and

14
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,860
before I start just want to acknowledge

15
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:44,460
and thank the nus NCS research lab for

16
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,420
supporting our works

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:52,620
in the first half of last year

18
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,520
there were 124 car thefts including 42

19
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:59,100
luxury cars occur in a city in Canada

20
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:01,020
called Oakville

21
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:03,120
the city has only about a couple of

22
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,640
hundred thousands of residents

23
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,560
and there's quite a lot of contents for

24
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:10,380
relatively small City

25
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:12,740
and more than 50 of the car sales

26
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:16,020
involve Killers technology

27
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,240
targeting a broad range of cars

28
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,840
including Lexus Range Rovers Ford and

29
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:22,920
Etc

30
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,380
and in a separate incident in April this

31
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,640
year

32
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,560
a warning statement was issued to the

33
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,619
public of a mid-ausar in Northern

34
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:34,259
Ireland after six cars were stolen

35
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:36,659
without using the original car keys

36
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:38,820
basically the car will not still had

37
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,460
keys with them and there are more such

38
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:44,939
incidents reported in the media

39
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:48,060
these days it's feasible to steal a car

40
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,220
without even physically breaking into

41
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,240
the car

42
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,700
without having access to a car key or

43
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:56,520
alerting the car owner

44
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,240
the increase

45
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,060
um

46
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,700
the device of car theft has been

47
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,500
reported not just in the public media

48
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:08,098
but also by Automotive driven industry

49
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:10,440
forums such as Auto Isaac right which is

50
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,300
a global Community for sharing threat

51
00:02:12,300 --> 00:02:13,440
intelligence

52
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,379
about emerging Automotive cyber security

53
00:02:16,379 --> 00:02:18,000
risk

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,819
in their annual threat assessment report

55
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:23,940
one of their key judgments was that

56
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:27,300
the the risk of killers contact will

57
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:30,060
continue to rise

58
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:32,340
in general there are two types of threat

59
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:34,520
against Killers entry systems

60
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:38,220
non-intrusive and intrusive

61
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,180
the non-intrusive types usually involve

62
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,440
eavesdropping or manipulation of radio

63
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,400
signals without having access or making

64
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:49,620
changes to the underlying components of

65
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,459
the aquilas entry systems for example an

66
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:55,560
attacker could use very simple signal

67
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,959
jamming to prevent a lock command from

68
00:02:57,959 --> 00:02:59,340
reaching a car

69
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,920
so that the car remains unlocked the

70
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,140
other examples are relay and repair

71
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:06,120
tanks and there are some differences

72
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,519
between the two a relay attacks is

73
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:10,800
usually perform real time

74
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,200
with the intention to extend the

75
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,540
boundary of communication range between

76
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:19,379
a car and its corresponding key fob on

77
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:21,180
the other hand

78
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,580
a replay attacks is usually performed

79
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:25,800
offline the attacker first capture the

80
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,500
signal and then will only replay it at a

81
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:31,080
later time

82
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,760
attack on key management and

83
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,620
cryptographic algorithms are more

84
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:37,379
inclusive as they require direct access

85
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:39,540
to the in vehicle Network for example

86
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:43,680
ODB port or ecu's

87
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:46,340
furthermore these are usually more

88
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:49,140
sophisticated and delicate as they

89
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:51,659
require more expensive potentially more

90
00:03:51,659 --> 00:03:54,180
expensive devices and Technology

91
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:55,980
and also deep knowledge in crypto

92
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:57,980
analysis and

93
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:01,739
reverse engineering skill set as well

94
00:04:01,739 --> 00:04:03,360
in this talk we're going to focus on

95
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,080
non-intrusive replay attacks

96
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,659
if you do a quick search on replay

97
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:12,659
attacks on cars these are probably some

98
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:14,459
of the recent headlines that you would

99
00:04:14,459 --> 00:04:16,500
find

100
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,959
there was an article about

101
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,019
um

102
00:04:21,298 --> 00:04:23,699
a hack on on that vehicle published

103
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:26,460
earlier this year by blipping computer

104
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:28,979
two researchers discover a hack they

105
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:31,860
allow them to unlock Honda Civic what's

106
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,259
interesting about this was that they

107
00:04:34,259 --> 00:04:37,740
showed that codes transmitted by key fob

108
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,600
can be flipped to perform a different

109
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,620
function

110
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,180
for example

111
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:44,699
the code corresponding to a log command

112
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:47,759
can be turned into an unlock command by

113
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,000
flipping some of the beats in the codes

114
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:54,180
separately in another article which

115
00:04:54,180 --> 00:04:56,460
which was published very recently just

116
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,780
few weeks ago

117
00:04:57,780 --> 00:05:00,479
also targeting Honda cars

118
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,699
two researchers discovered that

119
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:06,060
of Honda car can also be unlocked by

120
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:08,699
signing commands in a constructive

121
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:11,699
sequence

122
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:15,120
and by the way no offense to those who

123
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:18,000
work for Honda this is just based on

124
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,280
what I found

125
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:21,620
in fact I'm a great supporter of Honda

126
00:05:21,620 --> 00:05:24,960
because I own a Honda Jazz

127
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,820
but please don't hack or steal my car

128
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:30,560
it's a very old one

129
00:05:32,940 --> 00:05:34,560
so

130
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,600
um why why does our findings

131
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,759
matter

132
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:41,340
we started our research on this topic

133
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,400
about 15 16 minutes ago

134
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:47,039
by trying to replicate some of the

135
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,400
previously reported replay attacks in

136
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,560
doing so we had our initial Discovery

137
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:55,199
around August last year

138
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,979
when we observe an unusual behavior that

139
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:02,400
a car can be unlocked using or by

140
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,259
replaying through consecutive unlock

141
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:07,199
signals within five seconds right two

142
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:08,759
signals and it has to be within five

143
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:09,780
seconds

144
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:11,580
we thought that that was quite an

145
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,080
interesting finding

146
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:16,020
as researchers we wanted to know if it

147
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,720
is repeatable and can be generalized so

148
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,259
we try that on more cars in the next few

149
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:25,860
months but we didn't make much progress

150
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:29,639
the Breakthrough came subsequently in

151
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:31,319
one of car tests that we carried out

152
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:34,319
sometime in March this year when we

153
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,720
discovered that a car can also be

154
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,060
unlocked using more than two

155
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,699
consecutive unlock signals right and not

156
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:44,639
necessarily within a time uh specific

157
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,620
time window

158
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,259
and what was really exciting was that in

159
00:06:49,259 --> 00:06:51,240
addition we also discovered other attack

160
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:53,940
metrics that work across different

161
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,340
comics and models

162
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,500
so now our findings become very

163
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,539
interesting because we show that it's

164
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:02,580
more than a simple replay attack

165
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,580
right it's about different ways and and

166
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,639
variations of how we can use or we can

167
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,740
replay signals

168
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:13,440
um using different attack parameters

169
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,660
I'm just giving a teaser for now if you

170
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,580
are interested in a details of please

171
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:19,259
stay tuned

172
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:21,599
another interesting observation we made

173
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,460
was that

174
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,280
um we found that our findings

175
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,440
seems to be consistent with some

176
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,740
assessment performed by

177
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:34,020
catch some research It's a UK based

178
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,599
company that provides security

179
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,060
assessment on vehicle Technologies

180
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:41,039
so a couple of years ago they assessed

181
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,979
13 new cars

182
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:46,199
on whether they have commonly accepted

183
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,300
security measures in place including

184
00:07:48,300 --> 00:07:49,919
resistance against

185
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,780
digital car theft

186
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,199
so in comparison to our findings those

187
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:57,599
that were rated poor or basic India

188
00:07:57,599 --> 00:07:59,940
assessment tend to also be vulnerable to

189
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:02,120
our rollback attack and on the contrary

190
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:04,979
those celebrated Superior in the

191
00:08:04,979 --> 00:08:07,740
assessment also tend to be safe against

192
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:09,720
rollback

193
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,880
and as far as responsible disclosure is

194
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:14,400
concerned we reached out to two of the

195
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,340
effect affected default Chief

196
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,220
manufacturers and one of them brought

197
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:21,360
back to us

198
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:24,180
and we had a very good discussion with

199
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:29,940
him which then led us to give a give a

200
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,620
sharing session we don't want to

201
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,120
affected the

202
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,479
car or VMS via Auto insight

203
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:39,299
and since then we were told that the

204
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:41,760
relevant car vendors and their

205
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,679
respective suppliers have started their

206
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,800
investigation into the root cause

207
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,660
and with that I'm going to hand over to

208
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,519
Levy

209
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:53,940
um who did an amazing job to bring this

210
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:55,800
research to the next level from where we

211
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,080
began he's going to walk through with

212
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:00,180
you on Discovery journey by sharing the

213
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:02,700
details or findings including how we

214
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,860
have adapted our research strategy along

215
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,160
the way

216
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,860
thank you for the quick introduction so

217
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:13,740
let me quickly go into the details let

218
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:16,080
me first talk about rolling codes A

219
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,820
system that has been designed more than

220
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:20,100
20 years ago it's quite prevalent and

221
00:09:20,100 --> 00:09:21,779
the reason why it was defined to

222
00:09:21,779 --> 00:09:23,700
actually prevent any replay attack but

223
00:09:23,700 --> 00:09:25,140
the reason why you're here is to see

224
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:28,080
that it's still not 100 sufficient so

225
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,120
the way how it works is quite easy so

226
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:32,700
every time you press an unlock button on

227
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,820
your key fob basically every signal is

228
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,880
unique so you won't find any two signals

229
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:41,040
emitted from the key fob which looks the

230
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,779
same and the way how it works is that

231
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:44,580
when you press the button there is a

232
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,019
counter in the key fob and there's also

233
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,300
a counter at the car and every time the

234
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,399
signal is received by the car it also

235
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:51,959
increases the counter for the next

236
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:55,140
future use and if all these counters are

237
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,180
in sync it means that everything is okay

238
00:09:57,180 --> 00:09:59,700
and the car unlocks but there is a

239
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:01,800
safety provisioning feature embedded

240
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,839
into the system because of accidental

241
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,240
button presses because this is something

242
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,279
that usually happens you just have a kid

243
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:10,740
playing around with your key fob or just

244
00:10:10,740 --> 00:10:12,660
accidentally your pocket comes to life

245
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:15,779
and then presses a button and of course

246
00:10:15,779 --> 00:10:17,580
outside of the vicinity of the vehicle

247
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:19,560
for this purposes there is a provision

248
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:21,480
made in the system so it's basically

249
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,459
allowed to do so so the key fob can be

250
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:25,500
in a more advanced State regarding the

251
00:10:25,500 --> 00:10:28,260
counters compared to the vehicle itself

252
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,540
and basically when you go again to your

253
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:32,700
vehicle with your key fob which has had

254
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:35,040
the advanced counters you just send it

255
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,019
again a new signal and they will be

256
00:10:37,019 --> 00:10:38,880
re-synchronizing again and everything

257
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,160
works as it should be as it should be

258
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:44,100
working so now from this you can already

259
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,720
imagine that basically there is some

260
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,760
sort of a straightforward exploit into

261
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,339
this right because if an attacker can

262
00:10:50,339 --> 00:10:52,680
capture those accidental button presses

263
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,260
then eventually you can take those

264
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:57,060
signals and you can go to the vehicle

265
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,040
and then basically to straightforward

266
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,660
exploit so you can get access to those

267
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,940
future codes and then you can access to

268
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,220
the vehicle but the thing is that the

269
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:08,339
reason why most of the vendors do not

270
00:11:08,339 --> 00:11:10,140
really care about it is because

271
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:12,300
obtaining such future codes are

272
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:13,860
extremely difficult especially if you

273
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:16,079
want to Target someone it might easy to

274
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:17,760
prank your friend or your mom you go to

275
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:19,320
a coffee shop you pay your friend a cup

276
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,820
of coffee goes out to the restroom and

277
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,740
then you take the kefir from the table

278
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:24,360
and and record the signal that's fine

279
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:26,820
but normally it's extremely difficult to

280
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,680
to get them and the thing is that

281
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,720
recently I mean we are keep saying

282
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,220
recently but it was almost seven years

283
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:34,440
ago when there was this famous or I

284
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,480
would say Infamous attack called rojam

285
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,899
which was basically uh using a careful

286
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:42,120
sequence of signal jamming capturing and

287
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:44,519
replaying to lure the victim into a

288
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:47,220
situation where you can get those future

289
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,040
codes easily and the thing is that even

290
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,459
the order of it was semi-com car uh I

291
00:11:53,459 --> 00:11:55,440
think that guy is much more famous than

292
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,959
we are but the thing is that even he

293
00:11:57,959 --> 00:11:59,339
said and many other researchers said

294
00:11:59,339 --> 00:12:01,200
that that attack is not a hack so it's

295
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:02,880
not something like Breaking an

296
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,560
encryption key or something it's just

297
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,660
basically converts this safety

298
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:09,300
provisioning feature into an exploit so

299
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,100
the way how it works let me quickly also

300
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,660
go through that because it's easier to

301
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,519
understand first how it worked and then

302
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:16,860
when I talk about our attack it will be

303
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,440
much more easier to see how similar it

304
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,660
is or how much it differs from this road

305
00:12:21,660 --> 00:12:23,760
gem attack so

306
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,160
Road gem attack is basically you have a

307
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,899
small device that nowadays you can get

308
00:12:27,899 --> 00:12:30,360
even less than 30 US Dollars and what

309
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,579
that device can do is basically it can

310
00:12:32,579 --> 00:12:34,980
capture signals it can jam the frequency

311
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:37,680
band and it can also replace signals and

312
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,440
the way how it is deployed is basically

313
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,600
it's it acts as a man in the middle of

314
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,639
proxy between the key fob and the car so

315
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,260
it's this device is something that you

316
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:47,940
hide in a hidden spot near to the

317
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,339
vehicle and then it has a clear

318
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:51,959
reception of the signals and it can also

319
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:53,700
Jam the frequency man so the way how it

320
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:55,860
works is that you the owner come back to

321
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,480
your parking lot where you left your car

322
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,459
you press the unlock button once because

323
00:12:59,459 --> 00:13:01,560
you want to get onto your car and then

324
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,779
this road gem device sits in between the

325
00:13:03,779 --> 00:13:06,300
car and you and then basically Gems or

326
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,240
frequency band which makes the car

327
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,100
unable to receive the signal and at the

328
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,560
same time what it does is that it also

329
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:15,540
captures this signal and then since the

330
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:17,160
vehicle won't react because the signal

331
00:13:17,160 --> 00:13:19,740
was jammed is that what do we do we are

332
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,420
just human beings we just accept maybe

333
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:23,639
the button the the button was not

334
00:13:23,639 --> 00:13:25,680
working or there was a lousy signal

335
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,540
reception so we just press the button

336
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,519
again and then what the device is doing

337
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:31,680
is basically the same so we are still

338
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,839
keep jamming the frequency band we are

339
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:35,579
still capturing the consecutive second

340
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:37,800
analog signal but here comes a catch

341
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,540
because at the same time then we replay

342
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:42,060
the previously captured signal and then

343
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:43,800
basically the vehicle will act as

344
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:46,019
intended we the owner just assumed that

345
00:13:46,019 --> 00:13:48,180
there was indeed uh allows a signal

346
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,920
reception everything is fine I only want

347
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,360
to drive away my car so I'm not going to

348
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,980
think about why it was not working for

349
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,300
the first time I'm just happy it was

350
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,519
working for the second time so then the

351
00:13:56,519 --> 00:13:58,139
thing is that the attacker is now

352
00:13:58,139 --> 00:14:00,000
basically having that future code which

353
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,339
is now turned as unlock signal 2 and

354
00:14:02,339 --> 00:14:04,620
then it basically follows the victim

355
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,600
until a point when the victim will leave

356
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,459
the vehicle again locks it and go home

357
00:14:08,459 --> 00:14:10,680
or just do the grocery whatever and then

358
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,720
the attacker can come and instruct this

359
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:15,180
device or whatever other means but the

360
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:16,680
thing is that when replaying this second

361
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:18,600
unlock signal but he or she captured

362
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:22,440
then he will have access to the car

363
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,600
okay so now let's see how our attack

364
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,459
which is kind of like capturing the same

365
00:14:26,459 --> 00:14:28,320
name but because of how it works to be

366
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,600
termed as rollback it's a Time agnostic

367
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:32,880
resynchronization attack and the way how

368
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,040
it works uh I'm going to go through the

369
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:38,279
same example just to make a a good

370
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:40,560
comparison to rollback so basically the

371
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,240
setup is similar so we have a device

372
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,920
which can capture Gem and replace

373
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,440
signals and the way how it works the

374
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,120
first step is basically the same so you

375
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,100
go to your vehicle you try to unlock it

376
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,720
you press the button but nothing happens

377
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:53,100
because we are jamming the signal and

378
00:14:53,100 --> 00:14:54,839
we're also capturing your unlock signal

379
00:14:54,839 --> 00:14:56,760
and what happens next is is already

380
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,740
something that it's different from row

381
00:14:58,740 --> 00:15:01,260
Jam is that for the second time we don't

382
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,060
really care about whether the vehicle

383
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:05,220
receives that second signal or not the

384
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:06,839
only purpose why we jump for the first

385
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:09,120
time is because we want you to press the

386
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,699
button twice to capture two signals but

387
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:13,019
we don't care whether the vehicle

388
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:14,519
receives it or the vehicle can be

389
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:16,620
unlocked doesn't matter and if I just

390
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:17,940
continue this doesn't matter kind of

391
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:20,100
approach the thing is that we even let

392
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,560
the vehicle to be used as normal so you

393
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,360
can keep using your key fob you can

394
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,980
locate unlock it lock it unlock it as

395
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,779
many times as you want I I'm the

396
00:15:27,779 --> 00:15:30,000
attacker I don't have to follow you uh

397
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,800
to the next spot to see when will you

398
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:34,079
leave again your vehicle attended it

399
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:35,579
doesn't matter the thing what I can do

400
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:37,560
is basically you just I wait for the

401
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:38,760
right moment where you leave your

402
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:41,040
vehicle unattended and then I just get

403
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,139
my t two unlock signals that I captured

404
00:15:43,139 --> 00:15:45,300
before and I replay it and it's done

405
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:47,940
basically for some reason the vehicle or

406
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:50,160
most of the vehicle get unlocked and

407
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,560
then you have access to the car so the

408
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,779
way and why that we call it rollback and

409
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:56,399
what are the advantages compared to row

410
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:59,220
gem so why rollback I don't know how

411
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:00,779
familiar you are with some old

412
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:02,940
traditional database systems but

413
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,880
rollback is a mechanism in traditional

414
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,380
database systems when basically before

415
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:09,420
committing all your changes you can

416
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:11,100
issue this rollback comment which

417
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:12,839
basically goes back to your previous

418
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:15,060
checkpoint so that's why we are calling

419
00:16:15,060 --> 00:16:17,399
your rollback we because we've seen that

420
00:16:17,399 --> 00:16:19,220
when we are replaying these signals

421
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:22,320
these kind of rolling code counters are

422
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,660
rolling back to a previous state

423
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,639
and then from there again all the

424
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,920
signals that should be invalid already

425
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,199
start to work again

426
00:16:31,199 --> 00:16:31,800
um

427
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,899
so basically this is a quick example to

428
00:16:33,899 --> 00:16:35,820
see so what you can see on this on on

429
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:37,980
the image is that we have five signals

430
00:16:37,980 --> 00:16:39,720
and all the five signals have been

431
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:41,279
emitted from the key fob and also

432
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:43,320
received by the vehicle so in the time

433
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:46,079
we are somewhere here at the end so the

434
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:47,699
last unlock signal was received that we

435
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:49,620
are collected as intended and whatever

436
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,600
and we also have all the signals just to

437
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,759
be sure and then according to how the

438
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:55,800
rolling ecosystem works right it means

439
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,660
that all these signals are invalid and

440
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,339
cannot be worked again

441
00:16:59,339 --> 00:17:01,740
what we can do is that if I'm actually

442
00:17:01,740 --> 00:17:03,959
captured the signals and I replay these

443
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:06,480
two signals here the first two one what

444
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,160
we've seen is that basically we are

445
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,959
rolling back the rolling post to the

446
00:17:09,959 --> 00:17:11,939
state which was encoded in the second

447
00:17:11,939 --> 00:17:14,699
signal that we replayed uh and of course

448
00:17:14,699 --> 00:17:16,500
according to again how rolling ecosystem

449
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:18,480
Works those two signals will be invalid

450
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,059
again but eventually all the

451
00:17:21,059 --> 00:17:23,400
signals that were basically after that

452
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,839
point which should be already

453
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,819
invalidated starts to be valid again

454
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:28,439
just because we roll back it's kind of

455
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:29,880
like a time machine we just roll back

456
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,559
everything

457
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:33,480
and that's why we call our attack time

458
00:17:33,480 --> 00:17:36,179
agnostic and uh the thing is that just

459
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:38,400
because of this feature uh unlike the

460
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,200
road gem basically we can launch this

461
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,179
attack at any time in the future so I

462
00:17:42,179 --> 00:17:43,440
don't have to follow you I just capture

463
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,820
your two signals or three signals

464
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:46,020
whatever I'm going to talk about that

465
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,419
later and I can launch my attack anytime

466
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:50,820
uh and the thing is that I can also

467
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:52,860
launch it as many times as I want so

468
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:54,660
it's very easy for the attacker I just

469
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,880
capture your signals once and I can

470
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:59,039
basically relaunch it indefinitely uh

471
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,320
against your vehicle

472
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,480
so that's why we call it kind of like

473
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,340
more effective than Road gem but as we

474
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:06,480
you will see at the end of my

475
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:08,760
presentation about the results why row

476
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:10,740
gem is something that is tricks with the

477
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:12,720
technology so it basically breaks all

478
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,299
rolling code based systems our attack is

479
00:18:15,299 --> 00:18:18,539
something that is uh probably affecting

480
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:20,640
70 of the vehicles but this is just

481
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,740
about the set of vehicles that we tested

482
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,480
so we don't know the exact numbers but

483
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,260
for

484
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:28,380
for some uh for now we at least found uh

485
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,880
some vehicles that are not actually

486
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,799
susceptible to attack

487
00:18:31,799 --> 00:18:33,900
and on the other hand we also seen that

488
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,940
there are different systems in the

489
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:37,559
system which basically means that we

490
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:39,780
have different variants of rollback and

491
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:41,880
the properties that this attack has is

492
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,440
basically one of the first properties

493
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,419
which is very important is that how many

494
00:18:45,419 --> 00:18:47,460
signals I have to capture to get access

495
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,980
to your car this is a very important is

496
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,660
it just two signals or there are some

497
00:18:51,660 --> 00:18:53,160
cars that might require you to capture

498
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:55,500
three signals or five signals and why is

499
00:18:55,500 --> 00:18:56,880
it important because capturing two

500
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,340
signals is probably not as difficult as

501
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,140
finding someone who will press the

502
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,220
button five times for instance

503
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:03,840
consecutively because that's very

504
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:06,299
suspicious uh so it's a very important

505
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:07,919
feature the other thing is that what we

506
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,260
have also seen that once you capture the

507
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:12,780
signals do those signals have to be

508
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:15,600
really strictly consecutive or is it

509
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,520
okay if you just capture two signals

510
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:19,320
let's say one on Monday and one on

511
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,440
Friday and in between Maybe the owner

512
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:24,059
was using the key for the 100 times

513
00:19:24,059 --> 00:19:25,559
doesn't matter

514
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:28,740
and the third property what is important

515
00:19:28,740 --> 00:19:30,480
is the time frame it's not that

516
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:31,799
important though because you can really

517
00:19:31,799 --> 00:19:33,179
play around with the time frame but the

518
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:35,640
time frame here defines how fast I have

519
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:37,500
to replay these uh these captured

520
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,960
signals and the variance that we see is

521
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:42,480
basically we identified four variants so

522
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,700
far so it doesn't mean that we only have

523
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,200
four maybe there are more in the wild

524
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,179
but we just didn't found it the first

525
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:49,860
one which I really have to emphasize is

526
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:51,600
that that's particularly alarming

527
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,400
because the first one requires only two

528
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,860
signals to be captured and the sequence

529
00:19:55,860 --> 00:19:58,679
part lose means that those signals don't

530
00:19:58,679 --> 00:20:00,299
have to be consecutive which means that

531
00:20:00,299 --> 00:20:01,860
I just follow you once you press the

532
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,320
unlock signal on Monday and then I see

533
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,480
you again uh next next week you come to

534
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,160
the work and then I again capture your

535
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:10,799
unlock signal and by just replaying

536
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,419
those two I can basically access your

537
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,980
vehicle so I'm really reducing the

538
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:16,500
chance basically of being caught when

539
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,020
I'm capturing your signals and the rest

540
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,200
are basically uh a little bit

541
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:24,360
um more difficult in terms of how many

542
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:26,280
signals you have and how consecutive the

543
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,539
signals have to be and all these things

544
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:30,000
so before getting into the details I

545
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,380
have to make a disclaimer so we haven't

546
00:20:31,380 --> 00:20:33,900
done any real attempts in a while and we

547
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:35,460
always remove those signals that we

548
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:38,039
captured except two cases when we were

549
00:20:38,039 --> 00:20:40,140
trying to prove at least for ourselves

550
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,940
the time agnostic feature of rollback

551
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:43,679
that I just mentioned before

552
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:46,020
and the other thing I have to emphasize

553
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:48,179
that just like rollback any kind of

554
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:49,980
Replay attack by default doesn't make

555
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,080
any harm to your vehicle I don't want to

556
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:53,940
say this to just rush home and try our

557
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:56,100
attack on your own vehicle but it's

558
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,419
something that doesn't make any harm to

559
00:20:57,419 --> 00:20:59,360
the to the car sometimes you might get

560
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:02,340
locked out by being by having your key

561
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:04,679
fob banned for a while but eventually by

562
00:21:04,679 --> 00:21:06,179
using the physical case you can always

563
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:08,100
get access to your car and then do some

564
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,840
recent transition tricks without

565
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,400
basically bringing your car to the

566
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:14,340
workshop so it's not a big thing

567
00:21:14,340 --> 00:21:17,100
um so the the evaluation we have done is

568
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,140
quite limited for now

569
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:21,360
um so we basically had access to a

570
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,559
couple of

571
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:25,080
Japanese cars mostly or like Asian cars

572
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,240
no wonder why they're coming from a

573
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,679
southeast Asia so basically what we can

574
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:33,720
make here is some kind of a blurry

575
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,580
conclusion still so what we have

576
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:37,500
identified at at least the vehicles that

577
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:39,360
we found vulnerable the age doesn't

578
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,740
matter because this is something that

579
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:42,240
most people will think about it yeah you

580
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,679
found the vulnerability that might

581
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:46,440
affect some old vehicle I just bought my

582
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:48,659
car two years ago so that's probably not

583
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:50,340
effective but this is not we have seen

584
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:53,159
so we have seen uh 10 plus year old car

585
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:55,260
or even two years old car that were

586
00:21:55,260 --> 00:21:56,640
acting in the same way and being

587
00:21:56,640 --> 00:21:58,559
vulnerable to the attack the other thing

588
00:21:58,559 --> 00:22:00,059
is that the drivetrain also doesn't

589
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:01,620
matter so you cannot say that okay I'm

590
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,000
driving a hybrid or I'm driving an

591
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,620
electric car which probably means there

592
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:06,600
are more electronic systems inside of it

593
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,580
there are some any software or some

594
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:10,860
further measures that might prevent this

595
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:13,140
no the remote keyless entry system is

596
00:22:13,140 --> 00:22:14,760
probably the same doesn't matter how

597
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:17,760
your vehicle is basically uh made and

598
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:19,500
the most important part is that all of

599
00:22:19,500 --> 00:22:21,059
the popular Asian cars that we have

600
00:22:21,059 --> 00:22:22,740
tested are affected and actually some of

601
00:22:22,740 --> 00:22:24,299
these cars are also very popular in the

602
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:26,100
US and all around the world so that's

603
00:22:26,100 --> 00:22:28,440
why it's quite important and we've seen

604
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,780
that like old tested Mazda Honda and Kia

605
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,640
vehicles were vulnerable and for some

606
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,860
reason we found that Toyota is not so

607
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,919
who is driving a Toyota uh then you you

608
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:39,419
don't have to go home and try this

609
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:41,100
because at least the Toyotas that we had

610
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,559
access to they were not vulnerable at

611
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:45,240
all and the other thing what we try to

612
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,400
find is uh okay I forgot to mention that

613
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:49,380
some of the details on the slides are

614
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,659
purposely obscured but it's going to be

615
00:22:51,659 --> 00:22:53,460
released soon probably a couple of weeks

616
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:55,860
later after black hat to release reveal

617
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,299
what are the models that we have tested

618
00:22:57,299 --> 00:22:59,520
but we are still in kind of like in the

619
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,860
middle of the some clearance process so

620
00:23:01,860 --> 00:23:03,720
we cannot reveal those models for now

621
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,299
and also not the our key manufacturers

622
00:23:06,299 --> 00:23:08,299
but what we have identified that

623
00:23:08,299 --> 00:23:10,320
manufacturer 2 and manufacture three

624
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,419
these are the Key Food manufacturers I

625
00:23:12,419 --> 00:23:14,280
mean if you have some sort of knowledge

626
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,200
about Vehicles you might can't guess who

627
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,900
are they uh but they are very prevalent

628
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:21,120
ones and then these two manufacturers

629
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:22,559
are basically affected and they only

630
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:25,140
require two signals and most of the

631
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,539
vehicles from which are using actually a

632
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:30,240
key fob from manufacturer one were also

633
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,559
affected and most of the vehicles

634
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:33,179
require actually three signals so this

635
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:34,260
is already something that I was

636
00:23:34,260 --> 00:23:35,760
referring to in my previous slide so

637
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,860
some Vehicles need more than two signals

638
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:39,120
so most of the vehicles need three

639
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,159
signals and Honda vehicles for some

640
00:23:41,159 --> 00:23:43,080
reason needs five signals it's something

641
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:45,299
like already a counter measure but then

642
00:23:45,299 --> 00:23:48,020
Wi-Fi and uh why does it work with five

643
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:51,539
and as as you can see Toyota is using a

644
00:23:51,539 --> 00:23:53,820
key fob from a manufacturer 4 so it's

645
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:55,620
not affected at all but I have to

646
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:58,260
emphasize that not the key fob itself is

647
00:23:58,260 --> 00:23:59,820
vulnerable in this in this scenario so

648
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,440
the key fob is just emitting the signals

649
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,659
the main logic is basically in the

650
00:24:03,659 --> 00:24:07,020
receiving part and usually the key fob

651
00:24:07,020 --> 00:24:08,760
manufacturer is not the one who is

652
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:12,240
making the receiving part in the vehicle

653
00:24:12,240 --> 00:24:14,640
now I have a demo just because I talked

654
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:16,799
anyway too much so let's see how our

655
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:21,240
attack Works uh in the reality okay all

656
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:23,760
right so now here we are going to uh

657
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:26,460
present our effect roll backwards so

658
00:24:26,460 --> 00:24:29,159
this is a quite new monster to a

659
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:31,679
hatchback vehicle we have the key pop

660
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,140
here so this is now I'm just showing you

661
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,419
that the key fob is itself the info

662
00:24:36,419 --> 00:24:38,039
which belongs to the vehicle so if I

663
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:40,260
press the open you can see now it's open

664
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:42,179
the flashing lights are there and I can

665
00:24:42,179 --> 00:24:44,340
also close it and then now I close you

666
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,799
can see that the mirrors are holding and

667
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,140
I can reopen it again so this is the key

668
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:51,419
fob that belongs to the vehicle and now

669
00:24:51,419 --> 00:24:54,179
what we are going to do is to record the

670
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:57,419
input signals uh actually a few keep up

671
00:24:57,419 --> 00:24:59,520
signals and we will see whether we can

672
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,799
unlock the vehicle by just replaying

673
00:25:01,799 --> 00:25:05,159
those old hip-hop signals uh which we of

674
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:08,159
course shouldn't be able to do so so now

675
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:10,740
so this is a quick and true I wanted to

676
00:25:10,740 --> 00:25:12,480
fast forward it but basically that we

677
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,340
are using is a quite commodity of the

678
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,080
Shelf devices I have a laptop I have a

679
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:17,940
heck RF connected to my laptop through

680
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:20,940
USB and then basically this is like so

681
00:25:20,940 --> 00:25:21,919
uh

682
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:23,940
so now what I'm going to do is just

683
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:26,100
before the unlock signal so now I'm not

684
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,080
jamming any signal or whatever this is

685
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,000
the car rental scenario so I have access

686
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,179
the key fob so I just record one hook

687
00:25:33,179 --> 00:25:35,400
unlock and another unlock

688
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:38,400
and another unlocked and let's say I

689
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:40,980
also record a few more I don't know

690
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:44,100
let's say five dollars okay

691
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:45,840
yeah so now it's also again fast forward

692
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:47,580
a bit because sometimes saving the

693
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,380
signals takes some time but don't worry

694
00:25:49,380 --> 00:25:50,460
it's just

695
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:53,100
just so what now I'm going to do is to

696
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,200
replay this enough I put the key Focus

697
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,820
I'm not touching the keyboard there is

698
00:25:56,820 --> 00:26:00,299
no any uh extra trick in the background

699
00:26:00,299 --> 00:26:03,720
so what I'm what I'm going to do is to

700
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,700
replay the signals and now you can see

701
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,919
that the vehicle is closed because the

702
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:11,700
the mirrors are folded okay so I'm just

703
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:13,320
replaying the signals and what we are

704
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:16,080
going to see here is that when I we play

705
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,640
the third signal

706
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:21,360
uh this one then the rolling Code system

707
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,640
will be re-synthesizing back to the

708
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:25,860
previous state and then the vehicle will

709
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:28,559
unlock and every further unlock signals

710
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:30,779
here will also work you will also see

711
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:32,460
this from the flashing light

712
00:26:32,460 --> 00:26:36,620
so now I I replay the signals

713
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:39,000
we have the blue bar indicates the

714
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:42,419
current status so now we will play

715
00:26:42,419 --> 00:26:44,100
the first signal

716
00:26:44,100 --> 00:26:46,679
and then the second signal and now the

717
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:48,960
third signal

718
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,120
and now it holds it so now you see that

719
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:52,740
the vehicle actually unlocked the

720
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:54,900
mirrors came off so the vehicle is

721
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,740
locked

722
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:58,039
foreign

723
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:02,820
if I play further then if you will see

724
00:27:02,820 --> 00:27:04,380
from the flashing lights that it still

725
00:27:04,380 --> 00:27:06,299
works

726
00:27:06,299 --> 00:27:09,900
it's still a lot to do

727
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:12,240
and it still unlocks again so now we are

728
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:13,740
back to the original state where we

729
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:17,159
actually left with the key fob uh but I

730
00:27:17,159 --> 00:27:19,020
can still replay again all these signals

731
00:27:19,020 --> 00:27:20,100
to see whether we can do the

732
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,260
resynchronization again so now if I

733
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:24,120
start again what we should expect that

734
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:25,679
of course these first three signals

735
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,559
won't work uh because now in the time

736
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:30,659
they are somewhere here but let's see

737
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:32,039
again so I replayed the first one

738
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:35,580
nothing happens the second one and then

739
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:37,860
the third one and then it's again locks

740
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,779
the flashing signals out here and it's

741
00:27:39,779 --> 00:27:42,320
keep working

742
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:46,140
okay so now what I'm going to see and

743
00:27:46,140 --> 00:27:48,179
show you that

744
00:27:48,179 --> 00:27:50,700
now I start to use the key form so the

745
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:53,039
key fob is of course belonging to the

746
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:55,260
owner so we we still let the victim to

747
00:27:55,260 --> 00:27:58,200
to use the key fob as usual so now I can

748
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,659
just lock my vehicle I'm just leaving it

749
00:28:00,659 --> 00:28:03,600
or I just unlock it again I open the

750
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,419
door of course I can sit in I can drive

751
00:28:06,419 --> 00:28:09,539
away it doesn't matter and then I again

752
00:28:09,539 --> 00:28:11,580
brought back my vehicle if this is still

753
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,039
a functioning scenario or I just brought

754
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:15,960
back my car to my own parking lot at my

755
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,940
home and I just lock the vehicle and

756
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:19,740
then I go away I leave the key fob on

757
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:23,039
the top of the vehicle to just see so

758
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,960
the victim went away and now we again we

759
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:26,580
come back we have all the previously

760
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:28,919
capture signals which is still the old

761
00:28:28,919 --> 00:28:31,020
signals we capture back in the past so

762
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:32,700
we don't need any more signals to be

763
00:28:32,700 --> 00:28:34,020
captured we just only need this

764
00:28:34,020 --> 00:28:36,299
capturing process once and now I just

765
00:28:36,299 --> 00:28:38,580
start trying to reopen the vehicle again

766
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,080
so I again

767
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:42,539
focus on the on the on the mirrors of

768
00:28:42,539 --> 00:28:43,740
course so now we will pay our old

769
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:45,900
signals the one two and for the third

770
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,840
time it's going to open

771
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:51,600
and then the vehicles are Vehicles the

772
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,279
mirrors are unfolded and I have access

773
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:55,080
to the vehicle

774
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:59,840
so yeah this is how it thank you

775
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:05,760
it's not over yet it's not over yet uh

776
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:07,500
so there is something new that we also

777
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:10,980
found after submitting our our talk uh

778
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:13,440
to blackhead is that our attack rollback

779
00:29:13,440 --> 00:29:16,020
is also instruction agnostic which means

780
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:17,039
that

781
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,600
it doesn't really matter what kind of

782
00:29:18,600 --> 00:29:20,100
signal you capture so you don't even

783
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,419
have to focus to whether it's an unlock

784
00:29:21,419 --> 00:29:23,340
signal or not so the thing is that we

785
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,559
confirm this to Mazda and also for Kia

786
00:29:25,559 --> 00:29:26,700
and we're going to show you a video

787
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:28,620
about that so it doesn't matter what

788
00:29:28,620 --> 00:29:30,539
kind of signal that you have it's just

789
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:33,059
to be usually consecutive if that's the

790
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:35,159
scenario which makes everything even

791
00:29:35,159 --> 00:29:36,779
more easier if you thought that it's

792
00:29:36,779 --> 00:29:38,880
already very easy to do now you even

793
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,100
have less things to do if you are an

794
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:43,260
attacker so basically the victim goes to

795
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,240
the parking lot again and then presses

796
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,220
the lock button and usually you anyway

797
00:29:47,220 --> 00:29:49,020
press the lock button twice because the

798
00:29:49,020 --> 00:29:50,760
first lock button is something that is a

799
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:52,500
silent lock and then you press it again

800
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:54,899
just to see whether the flashing lights

801
00:29:54,899 --> 00:29:57,059
are on and then the vehicle honks anyway

802
00:29:57,059 --> 00:29:58,980
to double confirm that okay you have

803
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:01,620
left your car adequately closed and then

804
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:04,080
basically I have already two signals uh

805
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,460
and then I just wait for you to finish

806
00:30:05,460 --> 00:30:07,140
your grocery you come back and you're

807
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:09,059
going to unlock the car and now I just

808
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:10,679
realized when I rented the car here that

809
00:30:10,679 --> 00:30:12,360
basically if I press the unlock button

810
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:15,899
White Once it only opens my side door my

811
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:18,419
driving door but my is complaining all

812
00:30:18,419 --> 00:30:20,880
the time why am I not leaving uh getting

813
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,679
her inside so I always had to press the

814
00:30:22,679 --> 00:30:24,600
unlock button twice anyway so just

815
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:26,220
because of these extra safety measures

816
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,620
it's basically making our cars even more

817
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:30,419
vulnerable to our attack so we can

818
00:30:30,419 --> 00:30:32,880
easily profit out of it and I just also

819
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,860
want to take a note about car sharing

820
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,720
and car renting so it's even much more

821
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,039
easier right because if it's a car

822
00:30:38,039 --> 00:30:40,679
sharing scenario then you can easily

823
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:42,600
have access to the key fob anyway so I

824
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,580
can record the signal and later on I

825
00:30:44,580 --> 00:30:46,860
just let someone else to use the vehicle

826
00:30:46,860 --> 00:30:48,720
but using the websites or whatever

827
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,360
Services the car sharing things are

828
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,159
providing us I can basically keep track

829
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:55,140
of the vehicles and I can go and unlock

830
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:58,260
it whenever I want and the thing is that

831
00:30:58,260 --> 00:31:00,480
our attack is just about unlocking the

832
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,100
vehicle but in a car sharing scenario

833
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,380
the key fob is also usually kept inside

834
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:06,779
a car so I just replay my two signals

835
00:31:06,779 --> 00:31:08,460
and then I can go later on and I

836
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,140
basically not just have access to the

837
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:12,419
car but I can easily steal the car of

838
00:31:12,419 --> 00:31:13,559
course there are probably some other

839
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:16,140
measures from the car sharing company

840
00:31:16,140 --> 00:31:18,419
but it's not we are going to test this

841
00:31:18,419 --> 00:31:20,880
one uh whether our effect is actually

842
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:23,520
agnostic for the instruction embedded in

843
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,279
the signals so the main question here is

844
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:28,679
that is it only the matter of the

845
00:31:28,679 --> 00:31:31,140
Rolling code and the counters or also it

846
00:31:31,140 --> 00:31:32,760
depends on what is the instruction in

847
00:31:32,760 --> 00:31:35,460
the signals so now we can see that this

848
00:31:35,460 --> 00:31:38,299
vehicle is open

849
00:31:39,059 --> 00:31:41,760
and normally we we're only talking about

850
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,740
Outlook signals in the beginning we were

851
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:45,480
always focusing on the unlock signals we

852
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:47,039
wanted to capture unlock signals only

853
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:50,220
but for the sake of the attacker uh it's

854
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:52,080
actually easier to capture a lock signal

855
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,000
and an unlock signal because this is how

856
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,919
we usually use the vehicle so this is

857
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:57,840
what we're going to test so the vehicle

858
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,960
is still unlocked uh now what I'm going

859
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:03,360
to do is that I'm using the key fob I

860
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:06,179
will record the signal a lock signal

861
00:32:06,179 --> 00:32:07,679
first because that's the usual scenario

862
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,539
when I just left the car in the parking

863
00:32:09,539 --> 00:32:12,179
lot so then I go away and then I

864
00:32:12,179 --> 00:32:14,159
actually like imitating the scenario

865
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:16,140
when the victim comes back and unlocks

866
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:17,880
the vehicle because he or she wants to

867
00:32:17,880 --> 00:32:21,000
drive the vehicle away so this is what

868
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,500
we're going to do so now I capture a

869
00:32:22,500 --> 00:32:24,120
lock signal

870
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,799
there's a lock signal you can see that

871
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:27,539
the mirrors are folded and the vehicle

872
00:32:27,539 --> 00:32:30,240
is now on unlocked and then I capture an

873
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,620
unlock signal

874
00:32:31,620 --> 00:32:33,899
so it's two different signals

875
00:32:33,899 --> 00:32:35,520
and I don't capture any more signals

876
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:37,020
because we know that for this vehicle we

877
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,600
only need two signals uh so now I'm

878
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:42,240
going to replay this uh but first I have

879
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,340
to save so it's a

880
00:32:44,340 --> 00:32:45,899
walk

881
00:32:45,899 --> 00:32:48,620
and unlock

882
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:51,539
I'll just save it again uh it takes

883
00:32:51,539 --> 00:32:55,140
quite some seconds okay I have it

884
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:58,620
so now I just love the vehicle uh

885
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:01,140
at least to to get the rolling system to

886
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:03,600
be triggered at least once uh and

887
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:05,039
eventually I'm going to unlock it at the

888
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,779
end so we have basically a lock signal

889
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:09,779
here and an unlock signal I just removed

890
00:33:09,779 --> 00:33:13,380
the space here for the sake of time so

891
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,480
let's see what will happen so now we

892
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,159
replay the lock signal

893
00:33:17,159 --> 00:33:19,980
and the unlock signal

894
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,840
and you can see that the vehicle has

895
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,179
been unlocked

896
00:33:23,179 --> 00:33:26,279
uh so yeah the mirrors again came off

897
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:28,799
the emergency lights were flashing

898
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,200
and we can access the vehicle so

899
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:34,320
basically to prove that this vehicle uh

900
00:33:34,320 --> 00:33:35,820
and it actually applies for the Mazda

901
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,860
vehicle as well that it only requires

902
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,659
two signals or the Mazda vehicle

903
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:41,940
requires three signals but the whole

904
00:33:41,940 --> 00:33:44,940
effect is agnostic to the instruction in

905
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:46,380
the signal so it doesn't matter if it's

906
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:48,059
a lock or an unlock signals they are

907
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:50,100
using the same rolling code we just only

908
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,080
have to replay those consecutive signals

909
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,960
and it will work

910
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,840
okay that was the second video so let's

911
00:33:57,840 --> 00:33:59,940
talk about the root cause and the

912
00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,740
mitigation which is basically still

913
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,419
something that are the missing pieces of

914
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:05,880
the puzzle so even though we uh

915
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:07,440
conducted some of the vendors and they

916
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:09,780
got back to us we had some sessions uh

917
00:34:09,780 --> 00:34:12,179
with with them but basically the root

918
00:34:12,179 --> 00:34:15,060
cause now is still unknown and the thing

919
00:34:15,060 --> 00:34:16,679
is that most of these things are anyway

920
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:19,260
proprietary so we simple researchers

921
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:21,060
don't really have access to that and to

922
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,739
be honest we don't have the knowledge

923
00:34:22,739 --> 00:34:25,139
for now to tear down the vehicle and get

924
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:27,119
access to that specific ECU and see

925
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:29,280
really how it works so now we are kind

926
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,918
of like doing some black box testing in

927
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:33,540
this uh in this research at this stage

928
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:37,320
but we try to find something that might

929
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:39,000
be the reason but it's still just the

930
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,099
might a very big might because as I

931
00:34:41,099 --> 00:34:42,418
mentioned all of there are proprietary

932
00:34:42,418 --> 00:34:44,099
so you don't have access to it but there

933
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:46,260
is a keyfold learning process which is

934
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,820
basically standardized or at least

935
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,020
released by one of the key for

936
00:34:49,020 --> 00:34:51,359
manufacturer which is microchip so now

937
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,040
you know that out of the four that I was

938
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:54,659
referring to in my previous table one of

939
00:34:54,659 --> 00:34:56,580
them is microchip and they have some

940
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,740
kind of documentation when you have this

941
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,180
key fob learning process it's basically

942
00:35:00,180 --> 00:35:02,040
a process when you lost your key fob and

943
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,839
you get a new one from a from a

944
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:05,700
dealership and then you want the key fob

945
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:07,260
to be learned to your vehicle to make it

946
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:08,760
to usable

947
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,520
so the thing how what we've seen is that

948
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:13,200
basically there are some steps you don't

949
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,579
really have to focus all the steps in

950
00:35:14,579 --> 00:35:16,020
this flowchart but there are some steps

951
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:18,300
that are quite in line with how we are

952
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:19,800
doing so you can see that there is a one

953
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,020
unlock signal or whatever and then there

954
00:35:22,020 --> 00:35:24,359
is a second button press and at the end

955
00:35:24,359 --> 00:35:26,280
there is the key fob uh synchronization

956
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:28,500
process on the other hand you see a lot

957
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:30,599
of other boxes which are not quite in

958
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:32,400
line how our attack rollback works

959
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:34,320
because normally as you can see you

960
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,260
somehow uh sorry this one you somehow

961
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,359
have to enter into the learning mode and

962
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:40,800
once you learn the keep up to the

963
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,540
vehicle it automatically exits from the

964
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,400
mode so it's either some of the vehicles

965
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:46,260
are in the learning mode forever I don't

966
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:48,480
know maybe can be a thing the other

967
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,680
thing is that also there is no

968
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,599
indication about the time frame how fast

969
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:52,859
you have to press the buttons when

970
00:35:52,859 --> 00:35:55,020
you're learning the key fob uh the

971
00:35:55,020 --> 00:35:56,940
vehicle reaction is also not part of the

972
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:58,619
specification once you are learning a

973
00:35:58,619 --> 00:36:00,839
key fob will the vehicle really act

974
00:36:00,839 --> 00:36:02,880
according to the button you are pressing

975
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:04,800
we don't know and the other thing we

976
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:06,480
don't know is that no one really learned

977
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:08,099
a key fob to the vehicle if you already

978
00:36:08,099 --> 00:36:09,660
have the key for self so what happens

979
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,520
basically when you're learning an

980
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:13,020
already existing key fob to the vehicle

981
00:36:13,020 --> 00:36:14,700
it's also not part of the specification

982
00:36:14,700 --> 00:36:16,920
but at least it's something that mimics

983
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,680
how our attack Works uh what about the

984
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,020
mitigation so I usually say something

985
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,540
like a general advice that works against

986
00:36:24,540 --> 00:36:26,280
jamming attacks if you are just very

987
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,900
precautious and you always watch when

988
00:36:27,900 --> 00:36:29,220
you press a button how the vehicle

989
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,740
reacts that's okay but rollback as I

990
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:33,420
mentioned doesn't need jamming at all so

991
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,520
it's kind of like a passive listener and

992
00:36:35,520 --> 00:36:36,839
just because of the time agnostic

993
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:39,119
feature you won't be able to basically

994
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:41,400
prevent it so probably the best thing to

995
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,680
do is do some additional measure to the

996
00:36:43,680 --> 00:36:45,359
system not only use rolling code but use

997
00:36:45,359 --> 00:36:47,280
some timestamps or whatever to make it

998
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,619
more uh

999
00:36:49,619 --> 00:36:52,320
I mean less susceptible to attack so the

1000
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,000
three main takeaways of our talk is

1001
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,500
basically that we show that this is this

1002
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,780
attack called rollback and we show that

1003
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,280
by capturing and replaying a couple of

1004
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,079
signals and we can basically

1005
00:37:01,079 --> 00:37:02,520
re-synchronize the rolling Code system

1006
00:37:02,520 --> 00:37:04,859
and I can also unlock your vehicle and

1007
00:37:04,859 --> 00:37:07,020
uh we proved it that many Asian cars are

1008
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:08,400
basically vulnerable and it doesn't

1009
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:10,320
matter what instructions are in the key

1010
00:37:10,320 --> 00:37:12,060
fob the other thing is that unlike Road

1011
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:14,339
gem our attack is basically does not

1012
00:37:14,339 --> 00:37:16,380
require signal jamming at all you can

1013
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:19,079
only capture the signal once uh and then

1014
00:37:19,079 --> 00:37:21,000
you can use it indefinitely basically

1015
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:24,300
for live I would say and the capture

1016
00:37:24,300 --> 00:37:26,640
signals uh yeah as I just mentioned you

1017
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,040
can replay it as at any time in the

1018
00:37:29,040 --> 00:37:31,079
future and as many times as required so

1019
00:37:31,079 --> 00:37:33,900
it's uh you're almost like the owner of

1020
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:35,359
the car at some point

1021
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:38,220
and the third most important part is was

1022
00:37:38,220 --> 00:37:39,599
just basically about my previous slide

1023
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:40,859
that we still don't know the root cause

1024
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:43,140
so please don't rush into it to to eBay

1025
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:45,839
and buy a hack RF on your own and then

1026
00:37:45,839 --> 00:37:47,700
you know use this knowledge that you

1027
00:37:47,700 --> 00:37:49,140
just gained here and then play around in

1028
00:37:49,140 --> 00:37:51,960
a parking lot uh but there's no explicit

1029
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:54,660
mitigation for the time being uh but

1030
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:56,700
probably there could be some measures

1031
00:37:56,700 --> 00:37:58,800
that might be uh implemented in the

1032
00:37:58,800 --> 00:37:59,900
future but

1033
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:02,220
now we don't know this

1034
00:38:02,220 --> 00:38:05,220
so for that I'd like to uh finish our

1035
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,960
talks thanks for for joining us and I

1036
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:08,339
would like to also thank again for our

1037
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:10,380
co-authors from nus who take part and

1038
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:13,190
now we are ready to take questions

1039
00:38:13,190 --> 00:38:16,300
[Music]

1040
00:38:19,579 --> 00:38:22,760
thank you
