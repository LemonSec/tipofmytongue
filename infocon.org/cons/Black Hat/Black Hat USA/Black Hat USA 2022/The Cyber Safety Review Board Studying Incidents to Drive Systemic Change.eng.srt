foreign

3
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:12,360
to the stage and online

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,619
Heather Atkins Robert Silvers and Jeff

5
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:18,240
Moss

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,020
yay

7
00:00:21,619 --> 00:00:23,520
thank you

8
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,800
so let's make sure let's make sure

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,840
Heather pops up

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,119
supposed to be here somewhere remotely I

11
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:33,320
hi can you hear me

12
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:37,340
we can hear and see you

13
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:39,960
perfect okay so hey this is our this is

14
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,160
gonna be our panel we're gonna have a

15
00:00:41,160 --> 00:00:42,719
conversation

16
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,140
um for those of you who tuned in and I

17
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,719
believe it was February we did a sort of

18
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,700
a preview of what the Cyber safety

19
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,039
review board was up to what they were

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,039
working on we did this kind of q a uh at

21
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,239
black hat

22
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:00,300
um with Robin Heather but now they have

23
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,940
completed the first review

24
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,799
the verdict is in we're going to be

25
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,659
talking about their findings some of the

26
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,580
Lessons Learned in where they go from

27
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:09,240
there

28
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,159
so first just do let's do a quick quick

29
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:12,780
brief intro

30
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,240
Rob Silvers Rob Silvers I'm the

31
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,159
undersecretary for policy at the

32
00:01:17,159 --> 00:01:18,900
Homeland Security Department I also

33
00:01:18,900 --> 00:01:20,939
serve as chair of this cyber safety

34
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:21,960
review board

35
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:23,880
so this is your fault

36
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,740
it is it's our fault that we're it's my

37
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,900
fault that we're here okay perfect uh

38
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:30,000
and Heather Atkins

39
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,979
hi I'm Heather Adkins I'm a vice

40
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:33,900
president of security engineering at

41
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:38,340
Google and I'm very delighted to uh to

42
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:41,640
co-chair the csrb here with Rob it's a

43
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:44,600
real honor and a pleasure

44
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:47,280
all right so let's uh let's get started

45
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,020
um first though

46
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:50,159
um

47
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,439
if I remember correctly the enabling

48
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:55,399
legislation that created the csrb

49
00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:57,780
mentioned solar winds

50
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:00,840
but you did log 4J first

51
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:02,340
are you gonna have to go back and do

52
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:04,320
solar winds maybe talk through how you

53
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,259
got to log 4J in the first place yeah

54
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:09,360
absolutely just for the audience's

55
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,580
benefit in brief the the Cyber safety

56
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,200
review board was created from President

57
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,180
Biden's executive order last year on

58
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,819
cyber security and it is really an

59
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:19,620
unprecedented public-private

60
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:23,459
organization to uh make an authoritative

61
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:26,280
fact-finding and then Lessons Learned

62
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,720
and recommendations coming out of the

63
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,220
very biggest cyber scene it's all public

64
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:32,360
right and we every report will be public

65
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,680
and half the members are from the

66
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,720
federal government National cyber

67
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,940
director Chris English the the leads for

68
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:42,060
cyber from the FBI NSA and otherwise and

69
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:43,440
then half the members are from the

70
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,780
private sector with uh Heather the the

71
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:47,280
lead private sector member and then and

72
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,340
then luminaries from uh from the cyber

73
00:02:50,340 --> 00:02:54,360
security world uh uh we took on as our

74
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:56,700
first review when the board launched in

75
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,040
February of this year the log 4J

76
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,140
vulnerability

77
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:03,599
and the feeling was really that this was

78
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,980
a fresh event that had a lot uh to

79
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,040
unpack in terms of for virtually every

80
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,220
kind of organization out there uh every

81
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:17,159
organization was impacted because log 4J

82
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:19,379
is sprinkled across the ecosystem it

83
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:22,800
still is uh and it also had serious

84
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,900
ramifications for the open source

85
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,239
Community uh and how open source

86
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:29,519
software is secured how the community

87
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:31,920
can effectively respond in an incident

88
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,300
where basically you have to patch

89
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,340
everything immediately because of the

90
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:37,519
severity and our feeling was that

91
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,959
re-patch and then repatch again and

92
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:41,760
sometimes multiple patching cycles and

93
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,620
so the thought the thought was that this

94
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:46,319
would really be an amazing opportunity

95
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,299
for the board to jump in on its

96
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:50,760
inaugural effort there's a really high

97
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,680
impact event that literally affected

98
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:55,580
everyone right right

99
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,260
Heather

100
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:00,200
does he speak the truth

101
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:04,620
I I don't know that Rob knows how to not

102
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:06,659
speak the truth which is always a good

103
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:08,879
thing to have

104
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,879
um I think

105
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,400
Rob said a great I think log for Jay

106
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,918
um was probably one of the most

107
00:04:16,918 --> 00:04:19,440
impactful events probably that I can

108
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,120
ever remember in terms of cyber security

109
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:22,500
I think we're going to probably dive

110
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,300
into that a little bit but I think

111
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:26,220
another thing to keep in mind is that

112
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,979
when we talk about software ecosystems

113
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:30,960
a lot of these events start to look the

114
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,880
same so while we didn't look at solar

115
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:36,000
winds as an incident specifically we did

116
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,680
end up touching on a lot of the things

117
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,780
that would have come up in a review on

118
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,000
solarwinds about how secure software is

119
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,940
built the kinds of tools and the kinds

120
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,880
of capabilities we need in the ecosystem

121
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,680
and throughout the report we do make

122
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,199
footnote references to areas of

123
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,759
recommendations and findings that

124
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,800
actually do relate to solarwinds so I

125
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,080
think we still got the benefit of

126
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,660
looking at software through the lens of

127
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,460
solarwinds having been through that

128
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,979
experience but like Rob said I think

129
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:08,040
log4j was a big moment for all of us and

130
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:09,600
it was really the right thing to do at

131
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,900
the time

132
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:14,340
okay so so why don't you step us through

133
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,280
we'll set the stage so create the team

134
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,120
you get the members you pick log 4J and

135
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,220
then what I mean it's a sea of things

136
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,199
you could explore right you could go to

137
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,699
Showdown and try to count the numbers

138
00:05:26,699 --> 00:05:28,259
and see how quickly things are being

139
00:05:28,259 --> 00:05:30,180
patched you could interview people to

140
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,740
see what strategies are working like how

141
00:05:31,740 --> 00:05:33,960
do you start to wrap your hands around a

142
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:37,139
problem of such uh such magnitude yeah

143
00:05:37,139 --> 00:05:39,180
absolutely so we split the board up into

144
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:42,360
different subcommittees to to look at

145
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,120
different parts of the event and the

146
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,100
response and I think what really

147
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:49,560
surprised a lot of people is How Deep

148
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,600
The fact-finding could go I mean this

149
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:53,759
was a v this was not a bunch of experts

150
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,380
coming together and batting around you

151
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:57,240
know policy ideas I mean this was like

152
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:00,840
an operational uh fact-finding uh

153
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,759
engagement and we ultimately the board

154
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:06,360
spoke with over 80 organizations and

155
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:09,000
security researchers to get date and got

156
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,580
data as well what'd you see how did you

157
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,259
respond what did you see in terms of

158
00:06:13,259 --> 00:06:15,240
exploitation how did this impact your

159
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,800
organization what do you think are the

160
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:19,020
lessons learned and what that mean is we

161
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:22,500
we actually created a factual roll up of

162
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,380
how the log 4J vulnerability disclosure

163
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:29,039
process the response all went down and

164
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,080
answered a lot of unanswered questions

165
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,479
just about the factual record and I

166
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:34,940
think that's one of the really

167
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:38,039
Innovative parts of this board that

168
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:40,560
fills a gap in the ecosystem that wasn't

169
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,020
there is so the reporting you think the

170
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,759
private sector reporting just they

171
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:46,620
didn't have this Focus or this depth or

172
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,479
dwell time or like why wasn't it coming

173
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,759
out through normal kind of infosec

174
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:51,960
reporting

175
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:53,940
I think I think it's a it was a missing

176
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:55,500
part of the ecosystem there's nobody

177
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,900
until the csrb was created there's

178
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:01,080
really nobody whose job it is to convene

179
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,060
80 different kinds of companies and

180
00:07:03,060 --> 00:07:05,160
security researchers and without any

181
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:07,560
particular agenda hear what they have to

182
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:09,600
say and then say here's authoritatively

183
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,699
what happened you know companies might

184
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:13,319
investigate what happened to themselves

185
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:15,840
right but that's narrow and it's also

186
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,340
not for the public it's not for the good

187
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:19,500
of the community right our charge was

188
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,960
let's figure out what happened just so

189
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:24,060
the community can know and then let's

190
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:25,259
draw out Lessons Learned and

191
00:07:25,259 --> 00:07:26,340
recommendations that are really

192
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,560
actionable from that again for the good

193
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,539
of the community not with any particular

194
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:33,300
you know organization's agendas is it

195
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,620
all sort of like off the Record so

196
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,240
they'll tell you the real deal and you

197
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,039
abstract it so you have this sort of

198
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:42,560
Chatham House ability to get at the real

199
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,360
facts or our company is like well our

200
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,099
lawyers what you know or we can't admit

201
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:49,560
that we screwed up or some we have

202
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,960
confidentiality protections available so

203
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:53,520
the companies can tell us things and we

204
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,160
could use it but in an anonymized way to

205
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,860
Ben to to animate the the thinking and

206
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,300
the findings some companies were

207
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,520
thrilled to share their data and have us

208
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:04,680
come out and share that uh with the

209
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,120
world Heather might have more to share

210
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,639
on that too yeah

211
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,400
I was really pleasantly surprised how

212
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:13,500
many organizations came and spoke with

213
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:16,199
us some in person some spent many hours

214
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:19,740
with us on video calls wrote extensive

215
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,860
documentation for us to look through and

216
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,460
it was from a variety of

217
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:28,440
Partners in the ecosystem we spoke

218
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:30,300
directly with folks from the Apache

219
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,539
software Foundation who managed log4j

220
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:35,099
all the way to cyber security vendors

221
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:37,740
who had watched the ecosystem respond in

222
00:08:37,740 --> 00:08:38,820
real time

223
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:41,640
uh we we spoke to organizations who had

224
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,860
witnessed exploitation

225
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,399
um and we even heard uh from the

226
00:08:47,399 --> 00:08:50,160
People's Republic of China uh the the

227
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,339
government and I think uh it's a

228
00:08:53,339 --> 00:08:55,140
testament to the appetite that people

229
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:57,600
have to to get the facts out there I

230
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,000
think um one of our biggest findings was

231
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,279
that information spread quickly on

232
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:04,440
Twitter which was great you had a lot of

233
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:06,420
real-time information but it was

234
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:07,800
difficult to get canonical information

235
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,959
about what was really happening so I

236
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:12,540
think there's an appetite to pull this

237
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,300
kind of information together in a way

238
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:17,100
where everybody can trust the facts or

239
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,420
at least trust that they have been

240
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,800
deeply looked at in some way

241
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:24,240
so there's a lot of immediate anecdotal

242
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,220
evidence on Twitter but uh like you were

243
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:28,380
saying the canonical that takes time and

244
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:29,760
effort

245
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,800
did you notice any difference between

246
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,600
the participation or the way you

247
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,640
interacted with say a commercial entity

248
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:39,000
versus say an open source project or did

249
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:40,500
everybody kind of participate in the

250
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,940
same way or could you see sort of

251
00:09:41,940 --> 00:09:43,560
distinct lines across different say

252
00:09:43,560 --> 00:09:46,440
sectors or countries or

253
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,640
you know

254
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,140
um I'd be interested Heather's

255
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:51,180
observations but I will say that the

256
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:54,600
board approached every stakeholder big

257
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,480
or small powerful or not

258
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,580
um the same way and gave the same

259
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:03,060
opportunity so you know we we talked

260
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,880
with friendly governments we talked with

261
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,040
the UK we talked with Israel with their

262
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:09,839
National cyber authorities to see what

263
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,640
they saw so we can get the benefit in

264
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:14,220
addition to obviously talking with sisa

265
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:17,279
um we also sent an information request

266
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:19,620
as we did to so many other stakeholders

267
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,720
to the government as Heather said of the

268
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:24,360
People's Republic of China because they

269
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:27,839
had a substantial role uh in um in some

270
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:29,700
of the background uh behind this uh

271
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,980
event and we actually spoke with a

272
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:34,339
representative of the Chinese government

273
00:10:34,339 --> 00:10:37,740
uh to in a full board meeting in the

274
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:39,600
same way that the board spoke with uh

275
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,899
U.S entities and organizations so we

276
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:46,260
were really equal opportunity and you

277
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:48,000
know in terms of how different kinds of

278
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,740
organizations responded back to us like

279
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:52,260
I'm not sure I can identify an exact

280
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:55,740
pattern I can just say that overall it

281
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:58,320
was really good to see 80 different

282
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,240
stakeholders being willing to come to

283
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,120
the table with us and and you know speak

284
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,180
with us give data that was remarkable

285
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,399
yeah I would say

286
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:13,740
um the thing that stood out for me as a

287
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:16,019
pattern was that we were able to speak

288
00:11:16,019 --> 00:11:17,640
with a number of the foundations who

289
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:21,360
support open source and they have a

290
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:23,160
particular role in this ecosystem that

291
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,880
is very unique they're volunteer-based

292
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:30,300
um a lot of the projects uh are governed

293
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,220
according to how they want to run the

294
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,540
project so there's a lot of variety

295
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:35,880
there and they also have a lot of very

296
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:37,920
strong opinions about what should and

297
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,540
shouldn't be happening within their

298
00:11:39,540 --> 00:11:42,360
communities and I think that diversity

299
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:44,279
was certainly very different than some

300
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,079
of the commercial entities we spoke to

301
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,180
where companies are run in very specific

302
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:51,839
ways and I think we learned a lot about

303
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,180
um the benefits of the open source

304
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:57,060
Community having the freedom to run

305
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:00,180
software the way they run software

306
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:03,240
but we also learned that there are

307
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:04,980
millions if not billions of people

308
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:07,320
relying on them getting it right and so

309
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:09,060
that was actually a pretty interesting

310
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,860
tension that came out not sure it's

311
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,560
necessarily a pattern but the different

312
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:16,800
foundations across the globe that build

313
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,600
open source software manage open source

314
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:20,880
software have really particular ways of

315
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,800
doing that and it's a very diverse set

316
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:25,040
of ways

317
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,240
because I'm curious

318
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,279
everybody can take open source code and

319
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:31,140
they can immediately patch it with their

320
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:33,240
own Homebrew fix or they can wait for

321
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:35,579
the actual developer to fix it so sort

322
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:36,959
of everybody's waiting on the

323
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,260
authoritative log 4J fix but others

324
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,579
can't wait they're going to patch it

325
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:42,899
themselves so you probably have a whole

326
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:44,339
almost like a train wreck of different

327
00:12:44,339 --> 00:12:45,899
kinds of patching and different kinds of

328
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:47,700
solutions all trying to fix it at the

329
00:12:47,700 --> 00:12:49,500
same time

330
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,180
um

331
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,880
did you find that well I guess we'll get

332
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,440
that into the conclusions like does it

333
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,820
make sense to have to wait for the one

334
00:12:56,820 --> 00:12:58,920
patch or is it a free-for-all

335
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,440
um what gets you the best results

336
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:03,959
um kind of in a remediation phase but

337
00:13:03,959 --> 00:13:05,519
I'm curious on this yeah on the

338
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:07,320
strengths of Open Source strengths of

339
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:08,880
closed Source

340
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:09,540
um

341
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,220
especially from say a private sector

342
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:13,920
Google angle where you a lot of the work

343
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:16,380
does come from the the strength of the

344
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,420
the open Community

345
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,920
um maybe you can talk us through a

346
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,500
little bit of that that disclosure or

347
00:13:22,500 --> 00:13:24,600
the discovery process

348
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,940
um as you are sort of unpacking long for

349
00:13:26,940 --> 00:13:28,459
you where they're sort of unforeseen

350
00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:30,839
discoveries where they're

351
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:33,779
um you know the vulnerability keeps

352
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:36,300
surprising the researchers you know the

353
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,300
multiple patches maybe you can talk a

354
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,459
little bit through you know the early

355
00:13:41,459 --> 00:13:43,860
stages of maybe when you'd only

356
00:13:43,860 --> 00:13:45,300
interviewed five or ten and you thought

357
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:47,220
it was one thing and now you're at 80

358
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:49,680
and it's a completely different you know

359
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,740
can of worms yeah so so a couple of

360
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:54,720
things on the the disclosure process and

361
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,360
and the response so on the disclosure

362
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,860
process um uh Alibaba uh an Alibaba

363
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:04,620
security researcher uh discovered uh the

364
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:06,360
vulnerability and the board looked into

365
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:09,420
this very carefully and we concluded

366
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,639
that the um that Alibaba did the right

367
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:14,220
thing uh they followed coordinated

368
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,980
disclosure processes they took the

369
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,200
vulnerability to the Apache software

370
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,940
Foundation

371
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:23,459
um and uh and provided all the

372
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:25,200
information they had so that Apache

373
00:14:25,200 --> 00:14:27,180
could begin its work of

374
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:30,120
um looking into it and developing uh a

375
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:33,600
patch in terms of the uh the patching

376
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,760
Cycles yes there were there were there

377
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,500
were a few iterations of the patch and

378
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:40,019
we we definitely found that this induced

379
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:42,779
some patching fatigue and confusion in

380
00:14:42,779 --> 00:14:44,820
the ciso network Defender like everybody

381
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:47,040
surged to do this and then by the second

382
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,959
or third surge they're done yeah there's

383
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:50,940
no more surging yeah yeah I mean it

384
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:52,860
really and it was the holidays time you

385
00:14:52,860 --> 00:14:54,240
know it was a leading up to Christmas I

386
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,800
mean this was

387
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:57,779
um the the board found really may have

388
00:14:57,779 --> 00:14:59,459
been very very well been the largest

389
00:14:59,459 --> 00:15:03,180
mass scale cyber response in history uh

390
00:15:03,180 --> 00:15:05,100
just given the intent the the severity

391
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,600
of the Von the fact that it was

392
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:09,180
literally everywhere and the fact that

393
00:15:09,180 --> 00:15:11,339
companies even really sophisticated

394
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:13,440
well-defended companies didn't even

395
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,839
didn't know where they had log4j in

396
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:17,880
their environment because it had been

397
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:20,220
rolled up into so many different

398
00:15:20,220 --> 00:15:21,899
software packages which is one of the

399
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:23,959
unique you know aspects of Open Source

400
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:27,959
uh uh software uh and so and so Network

401
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:30,060
Defender fatigue and patching fatigue

402
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:33,540
was a definitely a real aspect uh of

403
00:15:33,540 --> 00:15:35,579
this response

404
00:15:35,579 --> 00:15:39,540
Heather I wanted to come back to uh the

405
00:15:39,540 --> 00:15:44,339
disclosure uh the disclosure to uh from

406
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:46,440
Alibaba to the Apache software

407
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:48,899
Foundation you know happened through the

408
00:15:48,899 --> 00:15:51,019
usual means of coordinated disclosure

409
00:15:51,019 --> 00:15:54,839
and ASF to their credit began working

410
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:57,600
immediately on the fix and one of the

411
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,160
things we learned about the open source

412
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:02,100
Community is that many times these fixes

413
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:05,040
are done in the open and that means in

414
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,399
GitHub in issue tracking systems you can

415
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:11,279
actually see the fix being developed and

416
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:13,680
that was the case here with Apache as

417
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,120
well now they didn't mark it as a

418
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,740
security vulnerability with a big sign

419
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,300
on it that said hey this is a

420
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,940
vulnerability but anybody keeping an eye

421
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:25,680
on their get pulls or looking at their

422
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,260
release candidates would have seen that

423
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,500
they were working on fixing some code in

424
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,500
the jndi functionality and we think that

425
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:36,000
is actually what happened

426
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,060
before Apache could release an official

427
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:41,519
fix for everybody and begin the mass

428
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:44,699
patching phase somebody noticed this is

429
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:47,759
our hypothesis but somebody noticed this

430
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:50,279
being done and

431
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:53,820
um we begin to see posts on WeChat in

432
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:56,160
China talking about this release

433
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:58,980
candidate that has the security fix we

434
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,779
start to see the Minecraft exploitation

435
00:17:00,779 --> 00:17:02,339
that everybody knows about happened

436
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:04,859
shortly after but this is a very common

437
00:17:04,859 --> 00:17:07,020
practice within the open source

438
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,540
community and we see it actually across

439
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:13,439
many very large projects and it was a

440
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,359
kind of a moment for us to sit back and

441
00:17:15,359 --> 00:17:17,099
think well you know as we think about

442
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:19,559
the software ecosystem and getting

443
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:21,959
patches out quickly and that surge that

444
00:17:21,959 --> 00:17:23,760
had to happen

445
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:25,079
um you know I don't want to sort of

446
00:17:25,079 --> 00:17:26,880
sneak preview the recommendations too

447
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,620
quickly but you know this is an

448
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:31,080
opportunity for us to think about how do

449
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:32,880
we build a software ecosystem where we

450
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,100
can all move very quickly because we

451
00:17:35,100 --> 00:17:37,260
know that things happen in the open that

452
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,539
bugs get dual discovered that they get

453
00:17:39,539 --> 00:17:42,120
exploited before they're disclosed and

454
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,980
so that was a really important finding

455
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,720
for us in terms of how we want to

456
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:49,500
reshape the ecosystem on software

457
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:52,559
so maybe you have those sort of updates

458
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,840
only visible to those contributing until

459
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:57,000
a certain time and then you would unmask

460
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,559
it so to speak listed for public

461
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,059
consumption or

462
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:02,280
I think that's one approach

463
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,020
um you know we we spoke to a lot of

464
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,880
people about this kind of issue and I

465
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,799
think that would be considered

466
00:18:07,799 --> 00:18:10,080
controversial depending on your point of

467
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:12,059
view I think another approach might be

468
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:14,640
for us to take a look at

469
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,980
um you know how do we make the the

470
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:18,299
knowledge of the bugs somewhat

471
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:19,620
irrelevant

472
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:21,240
um I actually it's our 19th

473
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:23,580
recommendation in the report but can we

474
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,559
turn the patching problem upside down

475
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,720
and make the sophomore self you know

476
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:29,580
more self-aware and be able to respond

477
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,440
much more quickly

478
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,059
um because there is a whole host of

479
00:18:33,059 --> 00:18:34,679
things other than just developing in the

480
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:36,059
open

481
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:38,580
um but I think it should Inspire us to

482
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:40,559
be you know really ambitious about you

483
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,600
know rethinking how software ecosystems

484
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:45,600
are done because this surge that

485
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,120
happened in December of 2021 is not

486
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:49,679
something that we can do every day I

487
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:50,940
mean there's hundreds of vulnerabilities

488
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,460
found all the time we can't always be

489
00:18:53,460 --> 00:18:55,620
constantly be surging

490
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:57,480
um and so Jeff I think some people might

491
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,460
find the hide your bugs approach

492
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,440
controversial

493
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:03,059
um I actually think you know we're gonna

494
00:19:03,059 --> 00:19:05,220
encourage the ecosystem to be much more

495
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:06,380
foundational

496
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:08,760
on you know how do we just do things

497
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:11,780
differently all together

498
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:15,419
so I want to go back to something Rob uh

499
00:19:15,419 --> 00:19:17,820
said which was the

500
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:19,080
a lot of people had it and they didn't

501
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:21,120
even know it right they have all these

502
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,679
issues and another thing that happened

503
00:19:22,679 --> 00:19:24,179
uh this year

504
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:26,280
uh was the s-bomb

505
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,200
right really it's been talked about for

506
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:30,539
a long time but now it's starting to

507
00:19:30,539 --> 00:19:34,700
take on life of its own so

508
00:19:34,740 --> 00:19:36,360
did that play a role in any of this

509
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,280
could it have played a role in any of

510
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,799
this had asked bomb been more widely

511
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,260
accepted say years ago how do you see

512
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:44,700
the two intersecting because I believe

513
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,200
one of the findings of the report is

514
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,720
that s-bomb wasn't used by any of the

515
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,500
people

516
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:51,419
so it's a little too early to tell if

517
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:54,120
that's a useful technique maybe you walk

518
00:19:54,120 --> 00:19:55,260
us through

519
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,940
uh through that

520
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,620
yeah I think what the board that's

521
00:19:58,620 --> 00:20:00,360
correct the board did not find any

522
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:01,860
stakeholders that were able to use

523
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:04,559
s-bomb to successfully get at

524
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,419
um it's a little early right but how

525
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:08,760
many are actually but the board felt

526
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:12,299
that esban has tremendous potential as a

527
00:20:12,299 --> 00:20:14,340
concept of that organizations need to

528
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,960
accelerate their efforts using

529
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,260
Automation and tooling to get s-bomb to

530
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:22,140
a state where it can be practically used

531
00:20:22,140 --> 00:20:25,260
out in the wild and also recommended

532
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,600
that uh all all software developers

533
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,280
should be ship developing and shipping

534
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:32,580
s-bombs uh together with their software

535
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,799
products be so the board is a total

536
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,200
believer in the s-bomb concept but it

537
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:39,480
has to be evolved and Heather led a lot

538
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:42,179
of work uh the board's work studying as

539
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:43,500
Bob's and how they were used here I

540
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:46,260
would turn it over to her

541
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,480
absolutely I mean a number of uh

542
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,059
industry participants on the board who

543
00:20:51,059 --> 00:20:53,100
who have studied this a lot uh Katie

544
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:55,020
Missouri is another

545
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:57,440
um I think we all recognize

546
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:02,160
the intent behind s-bombs in this space

547
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:05,220
but the standard features aren't there

548
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,799
to really let us see version information

549
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:10,440
for example so the ability to say well I

550
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:12,660
have log4j but is it a vulnerable

551
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:15,780
version and then secondly these kind of

552
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:17,700
deep dependency chains that we

553
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,340
especially see in the open source space

554
00:21:19,340 --> 00:21:22,740
where software is included

555
00:21:22,740 --> 00:21:23,400
um

556
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,980
you know many chains down down the layer

557
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,860
during the compile and It's Tricky

558
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:30,240
um so there's a lot of work that still

559
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,760
needs to be done with s-bombs we did

560
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:36,140
speak with at least one uh organization

561
00:21:36,140 --> 00:21:39,960
that had s-bombs in place for some part

562
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,460
of its infrastructure

563
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:43,919
and they are very proud of that and it's

564
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:46,380
a great achievement but that because

565
00:21:46,380 --> 00:21:48,480
that feature set is not there in the in

566
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,520
the standards it is difficult and then

567
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:52,740
the automation to actually make use of

568
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:55,500
it if you had a database full of s-bombs

569
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:57,659
uh what would you do with it when log4j

570
00:21:57,659 --> 00:21:59,520
comes up right so we need Automation and

571
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:00,780
the tooling around it to actually make

572
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,059
it useful but I think we all recognize

573
00:22:03,059 --> 00:22:04,860
its potential

574
00:22:04,860 --> 00:22:07,080
um and I think you know sisa's got a a

575
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,940
lot of great work happening on s-bombs

576
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:10,260
there's a lot of energy around around

577
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:12,720
this right now and I think given that if

578
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,340
you were to ask me again in five years I

579
00:22:14,340 --> 00:22:15,539
think we'd be in a really different

580
00:22:15,539 --> 00:22:17,280
place

581
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:20,159
and you know and just just to add on you

582
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,600
know another thing that I think cisos

583
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,340
for example can really

584
00:22:23,340 --> 00:22:24,960
um take away from this review and take

585
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:27,000
it to their boards their their their

586
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,260
leadership

587
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:29,880
um is it it really reinforced the

588
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:31,559
importance of asset management and asset

589
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,600
inventory you have to know what you have

590
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,419
and where and that has been a staple of

591
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:39,659
infosec talks for a long time

592
00:22:39,659 --> 00:22:41,460
um but you look at how it can come back

593
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:44,520
to bite you uh in the throes of such a

594
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,159
severe incident like this and how it can

595
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:49,919
cause an extended period of continued

596
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:52,380
exposure right to the most severe

597
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:54,780
vulnerability ever discovered and it

598
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:56,580
really actually makes it quite tangible

599
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:58,679
the importance of those bread and butter

600
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:00,600
issues like having good asset management

601
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:02,580
and asset inventory the only other thing

602
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:04,740
I'll just say on this on this piece is

603
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,840
that one of the recommendations of the

604
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,360
board was that the federal government

605
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,919
ought to look at using its procurement

606
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:12,720
power because we buy a lot of software

607
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:15,659
right a lot of software uh to drive

608
00:23:15,659 --> 00:23:18,780
software transparency so make software

609
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,419
developers that want to sell to us work

610
00:23:21,419 --> 00:23:24,299
on s-bomb work on other ways to have

611
00:23:24,299 --> 00:23:26,400
software transparency and use the power

612
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,860
of our purse to benefit obviously the

613
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,360
software that comes to us but that will

614
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:32,100
drive the market right because they'll

615
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,539
use that to the benefit of the entire

616
00:23:33,539 --> 00:23:35,220
Community there's a and there's history

617
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,260
of that right I think DOD was an early

618
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:40,620
adopter of IPv6 yeah right and uh and

619
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,120
even DNS SEC even if they don't really

620
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,919
use it there's there they'll pick a

621
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,480
standard and they'll say this will be

622
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:47,640
important in the future please

623
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:50,280
Community build to that so yeah so you

624
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,740
think then the report is actually

625
00:23:51,740 --> 00:23:54,000
amplifies the importance of an s-bomb

626
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,640
it's not a a story of where s-bomb let

627
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:59,700
us down it's really shows the like

628
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,679
here's a case study of the the promise

629
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:06,020
of s-bomb very much so

630
00:24:07,559 --> 00:24:10,500
right on okay good because I kind of you

631
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:12,539
know I like s-bomb I always feel like

632
00:24:12,539 --> 00:24:13,860
that's the opening act of something

633
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:15,960
greater and we have to first get through

634
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,900
the the s-bomb before we get to the

635
00:24:18,900 --> 00:24:20,700
second act I don't know exactly what the

636
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:22,620
second act is but we need success on

637
00:24:22,620 --> 00:24:24,480
s-bomb so we're taken seriously when we

638
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,000
come up with a second

639
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:28,919
um the second story of how we're going

640
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:30,600
to secure software at scale or identify

641
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:32,640
problems and so I'm always concerned

642
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,559
that if we screw up s-bomb

643
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:36,659
you know we'll be poisoning the well but

644
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:38,039
so I'm very glad that we had some

645
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:39,900
positivity there okay so let's talk

646
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:41,520
about some of the other other findings

647
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,460
uh Heather any of your favorite findings

648
00:24:44,460 --> 00:24:46,260
or anything that you found that was

649
00:24:46,260 --> 00:24:47,520
surprising

650
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,620
um or enduring

651
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,480
well they're all my favorites that's why

652
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,039
they're in there we picked them

653
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:54,960
um but I would say that I think maybe

654
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,520
it's the wrong turn but

655
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,400
yeah I think following on on your idea

656
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,960
of you know where do we go with software

657
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:03,000
ecosystems

658
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:06,480
um s-bombs we need them uh one of the

659
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,360
things we wanted to amplify in the

660
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:11,220
report is some existing work happening

661
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,860
amongst the open source foundations in

662
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:16,140
particular the

663
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,539
um the Linux Foundation the open

664
00:25:18,539 --> 00:25:21,299
uh security software Foundation openssf

665
00:25:21,299 --> 00:25:23,700
had just come together at the White

666
00:25:23,700 --> 00:25:25,799
House and released a mobilization plan

667
00:25:25,799 --> 00:25:30,179
for open source and within that plan is

668
00:25:30,179 --> 00:25:33,000
some ambitious goals around finding

669
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,760
resourcing for this all you know mostly

670
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,640
volunteer community

671
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:41,340
who need developer training you know

672
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:44,340
what would it look like if we could get

673
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:46,620
um you know hobby hackers who write code

674
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:48,419
that go into you know billions of

675
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:51,000
systems some great security training how

676
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,100
do we get code audits done

677
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:55,080
one of the big questions we had in this

678
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:57,419
review is you know could someone have

679
00:25:57,419 --> 00:26:01,020
caught this uh functionality before it

680
00:26:01,020 --> 00:26:05,220
made it into production and our finding

681
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:08,279
was only with expertise in the right

682
00:26:08,279 --> 00:26:10,559
kind of expertise during a code audit

683
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:12,840
would you have been able to flag that

684
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:14,640
this was a problem

685
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,580
and the communities just don't have

686
00:26:17,580 --> 00:26:19,620
those kind of resources available to

687
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:21,480
them all the time when they write code

688
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:24,240
and so we know that these organizations

689
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,159
have to have the resources for things

690
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:28,980
like that but also how do you get all of

691
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,559
your code fuzzed at scale how do you

692
00:26:31,559 --> 00:26:33,900
find bugs at scale

693
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:36,360
um and and so these plans are already in

694
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:37,980
place you'll find

695
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,720
and then referenced pretty heavily

696
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:42,539
throughout the report but I think you

697
00:26:42,539 --> 00:26:44,820
know we're we're somewhat skiing on top

698
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:47,940
of uh you know a pretty good Avalanche

699
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:50,580
of support around the community

700
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,120
that is looking at how do we help uplift

701
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:56,039
within uh open source communities and

702
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:57,539
I'll say the final thing I'm excited

703
00:26:57,539 --> 00:27:01,260
about in that space is uh an incentive

704
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:02,520
structure that they're calling

705
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:05,460
scorecards and the idea here is that

706
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:08,100
open source projects will get a

707
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,860
scorecard and that as they uplift their

708
00:27:10,860 --> 00:27:13,380
security their scorecard gets better you

709
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:15,659
can see that fitting in some very

710
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:17,279
interesting ways from an incentives

711
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,740
perspective to help not only fund the

712
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,860
community but also make security better

713
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:24,840
and we're interested in in you know

714
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:27,299
studying that a bit more as an ecosystem

715
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:29,640
to see you know how will it fit with you

716
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:31,679
know maybe government procurement or

717
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:34,860
s-bombs or you know even companies

718
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,020
looking at software when they're trying

719
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,520
to figure out is this the right solution

720
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:40,620
for me you know what is the score card

721
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:42,299
say right

722
00:27:42,299 --> 00:27:44,580
um so I I think these incentive

723
00:27:44,580 --> 00:27:46,799
structures are really important but I

724
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,299
think you know there's not anyone that's

725
00:27:48,299 --> 00:27:50,100
going to work it needs to be

726
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:53,340
a basket of incentives that we look at

727
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:56,840
and see how they fit together

728
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,539
yeah a couple a couple of the other

729
00:28:00,539 --> 00:28:02,400
findings that I thought were really

730
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:03,480
important

731
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:04,140
um

732
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,860
one is that log4j is not over this was

733
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:09,779
not like a historic look back but we're

734
00:28:09,779 --> 00:28:11,580
in the clear I mean this is what the

735
00:28:11,580 --> 00:28:14,039
board yeah so my next my next question

736
00:28:14,039 --> 00:28:15,539
was endemic

737
00:28:15,539 --> 00:28:18,720
vulnerability so how common are endemic

738
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:22,200
vulnerabilities and is it were you just

739
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,880
living with it now right yeah we're

740
00:28:23,880 --> 00:28:25,919
gonna be they've happened before but

741
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:28,200
this is one that is so easy to exploit

742
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:30,900
and so what you know ubiquitous that

743
00:28:30,900 --> 00:28:34,260
it's just particularly uh critical and

744
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:37,140
uh the board found that it is likely

745
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,179
that organizations are going to be

746
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:41,400
dealing with continued log 4J exposure

747
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,740
for years to come maybe a decade or

748
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,679
longer so so because it's easy to

749
00:28:46,679 --> 00:28:48,179
exploit and it's everywhere wouldn't

750
00:28:48,179 --> 00:28:49,980
that be like a fast-moving forest fire

751
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,720
like just everything's gonna burn that

752
00:28:51,720 --> 00:28:53,760
is going to burn or are you just saying

753
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,100
that people will find it it's easy to

754
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:57,600
exploit but they'll just keep doing it

755
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,460
for a decade

756
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:02,460
yeah I think I think it's it's a tough

757
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,020
one right because it's on one hand if

758
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,059
it's so bad it's so easy and so trivial

759
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:06,960
you would think it would just kind of

760
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,340
burn itself out

761
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,900
everything that could be compromised

762
00:29:09,900 --> 00:29:11,279
will be compromised because you don't

763
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:13,260
have to try too hard to get to the code

764
00:29:13,260 --> 00:29:14,820
path but

765
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:17,400
well I don't think it's always easy for

766
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:21,299
adversaries to find uh so it's not it's

767
00:29:21,299 --> 00:29:23,580
not it's not a simple thing to scan for

768
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:25,620
and so either for the for the

769
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:27,659
environment's host or for an adversary

770
00:29:27,659 --> 00:29:29,520
to get in is that where you're gonna

771
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:30,960
yeah

772
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,700
yeah I was going to say I think our

773
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,760
model for this is probably heartbeat so

774
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,279
back in 2014 very serious open SSL

775
00:29:38,279 --> 00:29:40,500
vulnerability spread like a forest fire

776
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,740
again you had Community surge

777
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,419
um there was a report released very

778
00:29:45,419 --> 00:29:46,799
recently that showed there are still

779
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:49,799
many hundreds of thousands of open SSL

780
00:29:49,799 --> 00:29:52,260
vulnerable open SSL instances on the

781
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,159
internet

782
00:29:53,159 --> 00:29:55,080
and I think the analogy here you want to

783
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:56,880
look for is not the forest fire but you

784
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:58,679
know the hot spots that are underneath

785
00:29:58,679 --> 00:30:00,779
the forest floor that can flare up at

786
00:30:00,779 --> 00:30:02,820
any time

787
00:30:02,820 --> 00:30:04,380
um what I will say about the

788
00:30:04,380 --> 00:30:06,779
exploitation Trend that we found is that

789
00:30:06,779 --> 00:30:09,419
the the very early hours of exploitation

790
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:12,240
on log4j was mostly reconnaissance

791
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,100
activity people hearing about the bug

792
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:16,140
trying it out for the first time and

793
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,880
then we see the seriousness of it grow

794
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:20,220
over time you get cryptocurrency mining

795
00:30:20,220 --> 00:30:23,399
it gets put into ransomware kits

796
00:30:23,399 --> 00:30:26,100
um into botnets and then we start

797
00:30:26,100 --> 00:30:28,760
hearing from the threat intelligence

798
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:31,440
vendors that you know you know the

799
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,700
nation's day doctors are getting

800
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,440
involved so I think you'll see the

801
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:35,940
seriousness of some of these increase

802
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:39,240
over time I do think that surge that

803
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:43,320
rally that happened in December of 2021

804
00:30:43,320 --> 00:30:46,020
um really actually did put out a large

805
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:48,240
majority of the early fires very quickly

806
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:50,940
in such a way that uh the easy stuff to

807
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:53,399
exploit got cleaned up but I think you

808
00:30:53,399 --> 00:30:56,100
will continue to see you know

809
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,799
malicious threat actors innovate the way

810
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:02,039
that they find and exploit this as they

811
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:03,840
learn more about having the capability

812
00:31:03,840 --> 00:31:06,120
to do so but it'll be around for a long

813
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:08,399
long time

814
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:11,760
the other thing that was uh interesting

815
00:31:11,760 --> 00:31:15,120
was this was an amazing case study for

816
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:17,460
how information spreads I was going to

817
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:19,919
say like uh who are the early adopters

818
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,899
of the exploiters right like who was

819
00:31:21,899 --> 00:31:23,580
first to pull position to take advantage

820
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:25,679
oh to take advantage of this well we

821
00:31:25,679 --> 00:31:29,520
found we we found that um once the

822
00:31:29,520 --> 00:31:32,580
vulnerability became publicly disclosed

823
00:31:32,580 --> 00:31:34,440
you kind of had everybody all the bad

824
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,059
guys kind of piling in you had

825
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:37,679
everything from the crypto Miners and

826
00:31:37,679 --> 00:31:39,779
the ransomware artists and the commodity

827
00:31:39,779 --> 00:31:41,760
so there wasn't one group nation states

828
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:44,220
there wasn't one that was clearly paying

829
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:46,320
the closest attention first to Market to

830
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,120
try to lock everybody else out well very

831
00:31:48,120 --> 00:31:50,820
importantly when log 4J first broke out

832
00:31:50,820 --> 00:31:52,559
publicly there was a lot of speculation

833
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:55,320
out there whether the Chinese government

834
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,899
in particular because of uh some of the

835
00:31:57,899 --> 00:31:59,940
origin story of the disclosure came out

836
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:01,860
of China may have been exploiting this

837
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,779
before it was known to the broader world

838
00:32:03,779 --> 00:32:05,520
and actually what the the board found

839
00:32:05,520 --> 00:32:07,440
and we we worked closely uh with

840
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:10,320
cloudflare on this to look at their data

841
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,559
and others we did not find evidence of

842
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:16,679
exploitation before the existence of the

843
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:19,200
vulnerability uh broke out into the

844
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,820
public and so this is an example of

845
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:23,279
fact-finding be like a really key piece

846
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:25,080
of what this board does put down the

847
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,960
room put that to bed

848
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,520
I will say okay on the on the question

849
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:33,240
of China there's an interesting element

850
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:35,880
to this story uh so we talked about how

851
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:38,720
Alibaba disclosed the vulnerability to

852
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,360
Apache there were Republic sort of news

853
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:44,399
reports that came out around the time

854
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:45,840
about how the Chinese government

855
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:49,020
sanctioned Alibaba like punished Alibaba

856
00:32:49,020 --> 00:32:51,179
for its role and we were really

857
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:53,520
interested in that as a board because

858
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,200
from our view after really looking into

859
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,000
it we think that this was a good

860
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,940
vulnerability disclosure process and it

861
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,679
was uh troubling to us that there would

862
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:04,500
be some kind of punishment and

863
00:33:04,500 --> 00:33:06,740
ultimately the board

864
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:09,440
expressed that it was very a troubling

865
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:12,720
uh the regulatory regime that the

866
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,059
Chinese government has in place uh

867
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:17,340
surrounding public surrounding

868
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:20,419
vulnerability uh disclosure and

869
00:33:20,419 --> 00:33:22,679
particularly rules that appear to

870
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:25,320
require early reporting of any

871
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:27,659
discovered zero day vulnerabilities to

872
00:33:27,659 --> 00:33:28,980
the Chinese gov

873
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:32,220
and the board expressed concern that

874
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:34,679
this could uh give the Chinese

875
00:33:34,679 --> 00:33:37,559
government uh Early Access to very

876
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:39,419
serious vulnerabilities before patches

877
00:33:39,419 --> 00:33:41,880
could be issued and network Defenders uh

878
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,640
could protect themselves uh and so that

879
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,500
was a very interesting aspect a very

880
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:47,880
interesting finding did you but we're

881
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,100
the board as well were those verified

882
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:51,659
that that actually they actually were

883
00:33:51,659 --> 00:33:53,279
sanctioned or you could never get to

884
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:55,919
that well well what what the board uh

885
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,679
found through its fact-finding was that

886
00:33:58,679 --> 00:34:00,659
um uh the the Chinese government was

887
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:03,720
first informed uh of the vulnerability

888
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:07,380
uh uh on uh by Alibaba on December 13th

889
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:09,300
of last year but the just the public

890
00:34:09,300 --> 00:34:12,060
disclosure was December 9th uh December

891
00:34:12,060 --> 00:34:14,580
10th range and so and so we don't

892
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:17,159
believe in this case that that early

893
00:34:17,159 --> 00:34:18,719
access was given to the Chinese

894
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,179
government right and just worrying but

895
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:23,280
the Chinese government then punished

896
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:25,560
Alibaba so that part was verified they

897
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,000
did get punished it wasn't just some

898
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:31,800
online room uh well um uh the um the

899
00:34:31,800 --> 00:34:33,719
Chinese government did not respond to

900
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:36,418
our request to confirm can you responded

901
00:34:36,418 --> 00:34:38,639
to other of our requests right and would

902
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,679
not uh confirm or deny or otherwise

903
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:43,260
address whether they had um given that

904
00:34:43,260 --> 00:34:44,580
punishment out and there's no public

905
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:47,159
accounting or official explanation and

906
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:49,679
so we found that uh troubling

907
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,760
right

908
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,599
so um

909
00:34:53,699 --> 00:34:55,679
so the next time this happens right you

910
00:34:55,679 --> 00:34:57,240
would have to continue to always do

911
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,680
these post-mortems to try to see if

912
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,839
anything's been taken advantage of

913
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:02,880
to see then if the Early Access had been

914
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:04,320
granted right and then how would that

915
00:35:04,320 --> 00:35:06,660
inform our policies and so everybody

916
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:09,320
keep logs

917
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:11,960
it'll be very useful

918
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:15,740
very useful in the future

919
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:18,540
um so you mentioned something uh briefly

920
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,339
about how information flowed online I

921
00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:21,839
just want to briefly talk about that and

922
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:23,460
then I want to kind of close it up with

923
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:25,020
like hearing about what you want the

924
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:26,640
takeaways to be from the public from

925
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,220
this audience like what lessons are

926
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:32,579
enduring across findings that will serve

927
00:35:32,579 --> 00:35:34,020
everybody in this audience whether it's

928
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,540
log4j or the next thing or are the

929
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,680
findings always going to be hyper

930
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:39,300
specific do you think maybe to the

931
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:42,240
specific incident yeah I'll I'll start

932
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,980
with the um the information flow and

933
00:35:43,980 --> 00:35:45,180
then maybe Heather can talk about some

934
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:46,980
of the recommendations I

935
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,800
um so what was very interesting this is

936
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,320
really a case study in a sort of a

937
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:56,040
Defcon one scenario of how Network

938
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:58,380
Defenders get and circulate information

939
00:35:58,380 --> 00:36:00,960
and what we found was first of all cyber

940
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:02,880
Twitter Twitter is the center of the

941
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:06,180
universe right okay when it comes to uh

942
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,859
information flowing like an emerging

943
00:36:07,859 --> 00:36:12,020
infosec uh threat stream not Facebook

944
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:15,180
you know Twitter Twitter was Twitter

945
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:17,220
Twitter Myspace Twitter was really um

946
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:19,800
Twitter was really uh where it was at

947
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,200
okay and what um what we found and

948
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,460
people found that really valuable

949
00:36:23,460 --> 00:36:25,260
because it's real time

950
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:26,760
um but what we found was that it was

951
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,560
also like information over well and it's

952
00:36:28,560 --> 00:36:30,480
so ephemeral too right the decision that

953
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,640
answer might have been six hours ago and

954
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,380
you missed it yeah so that's ephemeral

955
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:36,660
and so here and so what we found is that

956
00:36:36,660 --> 00:36:38,099
sisa

957
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:39,420
um the cyber security and infrastructure

958
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:43,140
security agency within DHS played a

959
00:36:43,140 --> 00:36:45,839
really valuable role in sort of being

960
00:36:45,839 --> 00:36:47,700
the the sort of collector and

961
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:50,460
authoritative voice on okay here's the

962
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:53,099
best of the vet the best remediation and

963
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:55,460
mitigation

964
00:36:55,460 --> 00:36:57,960
function yeah and it was really valuable

965
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:00,839
and then it also um was really uh sisa

966
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:02,339
did something that I don't believe the

967
00:37:02,339 --> 00:37:04,079
U.S that the board could not find

968
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:05,579
another example of the the US government

969
00:37:05,579 --> 00:37:06,839
or any other government doing anything

970
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:09,359
similar because it was so hard to know

971
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,359
what software products had log4j in it

972
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:14,040
for a ciso

973
00:37:14,040 --> 00:37:16,260
um what sisa did was it worked with

974
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:19,380
security researchers to build a GitHub

975
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:23,160
repo with an inventory of all the

976
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,720
software products that were known to

977
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,960
have log4j wow so if you're a ciso and

978
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:30,540
you can't figure it out you can just go

979
00:37:30,540 --> 00:37:33,240
to sisa in this GitHub repo and you can

980
00:37:33,240 --> 00:37:34,859
say okay I know I have these software

981
00:37:34,859 --> 00:37:37,920
packages okay the you know a b and c I

982
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,960
need to address right that was totally

983
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:42,000
Innovative it was spun up on the Fly

984
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:43,560
very nimbly and with the security

985
00:37:43,560 --> 00:37:46,200
research community and so I think what

986
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:48,780
this incident showed was that sisa has

987
00:37:48,780 --> 00:37:50,280
this role of being kind of like the

988
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:52,380
lighthouse right you know where there's

989
00:37:52,380 --> 00:37:54,180
there's a lot of like there's a lot of

990
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:55,800
great input but it's all over the place

991
00:37:55,800 --> 00:37:57,540
you don't know as a network Defender

992
00:37:57,540 --> 00:37:59,280
what's the best advice or what's the

993
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,839
most current and sister could kind of

994
00:38:00,839 --> 00:38:03,780
pull it all out together right on it's a

995
00:38:03,780 --> 00:38:07,400
big victory there big victory there

996
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:11,520
Heather yeah I I think the GitHub uh

997
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:12,900
Innovation was really great and they

998
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:14,280
just sort of give a call out to Kevin

999
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:17,400
Beaumont who who worked on that

1000
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,500
um I think recommendations wise just to

1001
00:38:19,500 --> 00:38:21,000
get to the the second part of your

1002
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,380
question there Jeff

1003
00:38:22,380 --> 00:38:24,060
um you know our recommendations in the

1004
00:38:24,060 --> 00:38:25,920
report are broken up into four areas

1005
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:28,200
we've actually run through a lot of them

1006
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:31,500
here but I I think you know early reads

1007
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:33,240
of the report people have focused a lot

1008
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:35,040
on uh what I've heard a colleague of

1009
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,339
ours call Mom and apple pie uh kind of

1010
00:38:38,339 --> 00:38:40,260
recommendations you know please do your

1011
00:38:40,260 --> 00:38:41,940
security hygiene please make sure you

1012
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:45,240
have it assets but we also do have a

1013
00:38:45,240 --> 00:38:47,880
section on this kind of the you know the

1014
00:38:47,880 --> 00:38:51,359
future of software and I think that any

1015
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:53,640
review we do that involves software is

1016
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:55,140
going to have some some of these

1017
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:57,540
components of the software ecosystem

1018
00:38:57,540 --> 00:39:00,660
must support safety by default and so

1019
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:03,480
expect to see that theme come up again

1020
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:06,180
and again but I do want to call out kind

1021
00:39:06,180 --> 00:39:08,640
of the fourth and final section which is

1022
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,740
really more futuristic so it's sort of

1023
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,200
mom and apple pie but it's like apples

1024
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:15,780
from Mars right a little bit Space Age a

1025
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:17,280
little bit futuristic

1026
00:39:17,280 --> 00:39:19,920
really looking into how we create these

1027
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:23,700
good incentives for people to adopt

1028
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,160
um the the next generation of safety

1029
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,560
practices

1030
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,180
but also taking a little bit of a look

1031
00:39:30,180 --> 00:39:32,760
at what research do we need to do to

1032
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:34,320
build better software that's more

1033
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:36,900
self-defending that is more self-aware

1034
00:39:36,900 --> 00:39:40,320
and upturning this sort of very manual

1035
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,359
patch

1036
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:44,339
um you know learn about it on Twitter

1037
00:39:44,339 --> 00:39:46,380
and then patch your whole universe kind

1038
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:48,780
of process we can't do that every day of

1039
00:39:48,780 --> 00:39:50,520
the year at scale and there's enough

1040
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,619
software now on this planet let alone

1041
00:39:52,619 --> 00:39:56,099
coming on the moon and on Mars that you

1042
00:39:56,099 --> 00:39:57,780
know we're going to have to have much

1043
00:39:57,780 --> 00:39:59,700
more automated much more safety by

1044
00:39:59,700 --> 00:40:01,859
default software and I think that that

1045
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:04,619
really is the kind of pushing the

1046
00:40:04,619 --> 00:40:06,780
boundaries and why I'm so excited about

1047
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,460
the board because we really have an

1048
00:40:08,460 --> 00:40:11,040
opportunity to help levitate some of

1049
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:14,640
that to a highly visible view where we

1050
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,779
can get people working on it

1051
00:40:18,359 --> 00:40:21,180
okay final thought where to next what's

1052
00:40:21,180 --> 00:40:24,660
next for the csrb

1053
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:26,640
um and do you figure this will be you

1054
00:40:26,640 --> 00:40:28,200
know three of these things a year one a

1055
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,180
year you wait for the apocalypse you

1056
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:32,099
fill in your time in between apocalypses

1057
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:33,720
what's

1058
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:37,020
what's the vision yeah the the vision is

1059
00:40:37,020 --> 00:40:39,240
um we are using what we call the off

1060
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:41,760
season a term made up our board's

1061
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,880
executive director Abby dieft uh to uh

1062
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,040
build up permanent Staffing and

1063
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,680
infrastructure uh for this board and we

1064
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,720
are refining procedures and streamlining

1065
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:53,160
there was you know an element of the

1066
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,720
first review of it was the initial Test

1067
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:56,880
Flight of the board we had to address

1068
00:40:56,880 --> 00:40:59,160
certain things and procedural things as

1069
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,619
they came up and make make calls and now

1070
00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:02,940
we're into like sort of a maturation

1071
00:41:02,940 --> 00:41:05,099
phase but I will tell you this

1072
00:41:05,099 --> 00:41:06,599
um I I believe that the first review

1073
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:09,359
proved this concept up I mean there is

1074
00:41:09,359 --> 00:41:11,520
nobody out there that thinks this is the

1075
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:13,380
wrong idea

1076
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:15,480
um this is um it's pretty clear to me

1077
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,420
going to be an enduring institution in

1078
00:41:18,420 --> 00:41:19,700
the cyber security

1079
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:22,320
ecosystem right this is just something

1080
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,780
that wasn't getting done the way that we

1081
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:26,880
have brought together the leading

1082
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,160
expertise from the public sector and the

1083
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:32,040
private sector is just an incredible I

1084
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,680
mean with the 14

1085
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:36,060
incredible sense of experience and brain

1086
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,920
power that we have from our members you

1087
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,900
are looking at a problem from like every

1088
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:42,240
perspective and with with over A Century

1089
00:41:42,240 --> 00:41:46,140
of cyber security experience uh so this

1090
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:48,480
is now about tuning this up uh for

1091
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:50,339
future reviews which will surely come

1092
00:41:50,339 --> 00:41:52,020
fantastic

1093
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,520
right on well if you haven't read the

1094
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:56,160
report it's available online right what

1095
00:41:56,160 --> 00:41:58,260
are they available online it's a public

1096
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,780
report right on as as they should all be

1097
00:42:00,780 --> 00:42:02,339
in one form or another we're committed

1098
00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:03,660
to that this needs to be transparent for

1099
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,160
the benefit of the community right on

1100
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:07,320
okay well thank you everybody for coming

1101
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:09,000
and hopefully you've learned something

1102
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,920
and we'll see you next time

1103
