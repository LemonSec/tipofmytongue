1
00:00:01,730 --> 00:00:03,720
[Music]

2
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:06,720
foreign

3
00:00:10,099 --> 00:00:12,840
yeah we're here today to present our

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:15,719
research around 2fa bypass and we call

5
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:17,760
it smishmash because it's really a mix

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,039
of techniques and it's called text-based

7
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:22,740
two-phase blue thing using ocean fishing

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:25,080
techniques and a burner phone and our

9
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,599
burner phones we brought them yeah

10
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,359
we've got a old Sony Ericsson and a

11
00:00:30,359 --> 00:00:33,360
Nokia N900 old hacker phone as you all

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:34,100
know

13
00:00:34,100 --> 00:00:37,559
but unfortunately You're such way ahead

14
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:39,420
in the phone service that you have

15
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:41,820
disabled 2D and 3D so they don't work

16
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:42,600
here

17
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:44,700
so we'll have to do the demos during

18
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:46,980
other meets but you have to take a word

19
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,660
for us they work really well in Sweden

20
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,579
in Europe in Europe they work really

21
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:52,920
well but and we didn't have time to buy

22
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:55,860
any more modern burner phones but uh the

23
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:57,719
idea is the same and the demos will work

24
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:00,600
the same on on Modern Hardware

25
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,320
um

26
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,799
so yeah about us I'm Thomas olafson uh

27
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:06,180
I've been working with security for a

28
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:09,299
long long time I'm also the founder of

29
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:12,000
SEC t.org Swedish security conference

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,159
running yearly

31
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:16,439
um I used to play ctfs back in the good

32
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:18,119
old days actually managed to win the

33
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:21,060
Defcon CTF back in way back in the day

34
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:23,159
so it barely counts anymore before it

35
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:25,799
became this big and complicated and hard

36
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:27,540
to win

37
00:01:27,540 --> 00:01:29,580
um I'm into secure coding and secure

38
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:32,100
development and except for doing hacking

39
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,460
and I.T stuff I like climbing diving and

40
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:37,920
motorcycles really safe Sports actually

41
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,579
uh Michael yeah and hi everyone I'm Mike

42
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:45,479
uh a hacker and also a co-founder of IO

43
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,220
uh also a lock picker and a collector of

44
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:53,220
Intel

45
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,759
yeah

46
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,680
so uh basically this talk if you don't

47
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,299
want to attend the whole talk I'm going

48
00:02:00,299 --> 00:02:03,299
to start with with our conclusions uh so

49
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,100
and the conclusions are basically text

50
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:07,320
messages smns for two-factor

51
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,220
authentification is broken and this is

52
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:13,440
no news for a lot of us I I worked in

53
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:14,940
the Telco industry and this is no news

54
00:02:14,940 --> 00:02:17,520
it's been broken since the Inception of

55
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,680
Pixma it was never intended to be used

56
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,540
anything like this and we have been

57
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,760
spoofing text messages for

58
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,459
as long as we've been hacking and and

59
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:27,840
Michael has some good stories about

60
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,120
actually yeah I have some great examples

61
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:33,120
of a colleague that was abroad and he

62
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,739
received a text message from the local

63
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:37,500
police that he had fraudulent soldiers

64
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:41,580
on his card uh so he called them up but

65
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,680
of course the local police doesn't send

66
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,920
text messages when you get fraudulent

67
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:48,480
charges

68
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,400
so so these techniques have been working

69
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,099
for years just now that we're seeing the

70
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:55,080
the like mainstream adoption of

71
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:57,840
weaponization of this but but the actual

72
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,340
hacking techniques have always been

73
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,660
there

74
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:02,819
um so a bit of setting the scene the

75
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:04,920
last couple of years it started in like

76
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,940
we saw some date about in 2016-17 but

77
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,860
but then it's just been escalating where

78
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,300
you've seen in the media in the computer

79
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,940
media with very little details about how

80
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:17,519
they do it's like whoa account takeover

81
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:19,739
via phishings Mission and they're

82
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:22,440
bypassing the 2fa so we were interested

83
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,120
in like oh when they empty the account

84
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,920
they sell all the data or the Bitcoins

85
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,659
or the nfts because this has been

86
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:30,180
predominantly active in the crypto space

87
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,400
as you can imagine

88
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,920
um so we wanted to research how are they

89
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,680
doing this what's the modus operandum

90
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,959
how did they do it

91
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:42,659
and like what do you actually need to

92
00:03:42,659 --> 00:03:45,360
facilitate these attacks and can be

93
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:48,840
reproduce it in a like in a good way and

94
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,459
also at the end of the talk we're going

95
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:51,599
to get to how do you actually protect

96
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:53,040
against this and what you can do to

97
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,180
change it

98
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:57,420
so the first hack was that got main

99
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:00,720
media attention was the Outlook bypass a

100
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,879
couple of years ago but that one when we

101
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:03,959
research it was actually a

102
00:04:03,959 --> 00:04:06,000
misconfiguration or open port where you

103
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,980
could actually on the exchange servers

104
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:09,599
go in and change the two-factor

105
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:12,000
authentication settings so that one

106
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,939
doesn't really count into this I mean it

107
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:16,560
is a 2fa bypass but you're actually

108
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,660
hacking the Outlook server to more or

109
00:04:18,660 --> 00:04:21,418
less switch off the 2fa which I think is

110
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:22,979
cheating because then it's not actually

111
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:24,900
to if I bypass it's more

112
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,419
misconfiguration or vulnerability but if

113
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:28,860
you look at the more modern and hacks we

114
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:30,660
have like crypto.com all the modern

115
00:04:30,660 --> 00:04:33,060
crypto exchanges for instance have been

116
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:35,720
attacked during the last couple of years

117
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,520
uh and like lost millions and millions

118
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:41,220
and millions of this

119
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:43,199
um so we looked at some of these attacks

120
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,620
and this Mission Trends are I'm I know

121
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:49,860
there is discussions on Twitter like

122
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:51,540
why do we need in other words mission

123
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:54,120
for this and I sort of agree but it is

124
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,479
its own thing so I I sort of object

125
00:04:57,479 --> 00:04:59,100
there I think smashing is very different

126
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,139
from phishing because most of the

127
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:02,759
fishing protection mechanisms that we

128
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:04,919
have only work for email and your

129
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:06,240
built-in browser it doesn't actually

130
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,759
work from apps if you're in in like

131
00:05:08,759 --> 00:05:11,820
telegram or signal all of these links

132
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,560
actually get to you uh totally unchecked

133
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:18,360
what we see in statistically According

134
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,160
to some research which is not our own

135
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,860
but like we've seen a huge increase in

136
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:25,860
number of submission links sent in last

137
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:27,720
year how many of you have got an

138
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,699
unsolicited text message in the last

139
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:31,259
couple of weeks

140
00:05:31,259 --> 00:05:35,400
yeah it's like I I get now 10 at least

141
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,160
10 a week uh and the reason for that is

142
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,500
that your phone numbers are increasingly

143
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,539
being leaked on the leak phones and the

144
00:05:42,539 --> 00:05:44,940
attackers are starting to exploit that

145
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,220
and it's actually very hard to verify

146
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:49,560
the Integrity of the sender of these

147
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,500
messages because and and this actually

148
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,259
leads to up to 35 percent of the people

149
00:05:55,259 --> 00:05:57,720
Target actually don't even understand

150
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:00,660
that the targeting this machine attack

151
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:03,780
so for some reason the text message

152
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,660
still has a higher implicit trust than

153
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:09,360
emails especially by the the older user

154
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,280
base because it's like no I got the text

155
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,539
message from the police like in

156
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:14,520
Microsoft no I need to call the police

157
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,860
because the police texted this to me but

158
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:18,840
where we all know you can spoof emails

159
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,400
and there you get hundreds of spam

160
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,139
emails we're now getting to that point

161
00:06:22,139 --> 00:06:25,440
but the market is not saturated yet so

162
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,600
we still have a higher trust and that's

163
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,280
why these attacks have much higher

164
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,380
success rate and that's why we're seeing

165
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:33,080
such an increase in them

166
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:36,360
also contributing to this we will show

167
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,639
in demos is the mobile browser

168
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,500
functionality which actually plays into

169
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:42,419
the hands of the attacker

170
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:44,639
oh and that brings us to the internal

171
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,440
source of leaked user data that just

172
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,600
keeps rolling and rolling and rolling we

173
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:51,780
had the Twitter leak last week which we

174
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,639
haven't indexed yet we have the sample

175
00:06:53,639 --> 00:06:55,020
files we have the phone numbers from

176
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:58,080
there so the number of like leaked phone

177
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:01,440
numbers are just exploding and also on

178
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,360
my way here I had to to check in on

179
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:05,280
American Airlines to get my boarding

180
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,860
pass I had to put in my phone number not

181
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,720
only my email I also need my phone

182
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,160
number now to actually get a boarding

183
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,440
pass so there's more and more leaked

184
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,360
phone numbers coming out

185
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:18,600
which is really Michael's Forte yeah so

186
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:20,759
what we have done is

187
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,900
everyone knows uh all the regular hacker

188
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,259
forums and breach forums uh where where

189
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:30,720
they leaked these credentials and phone

190
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,020
numbers uh and it's both on Clearnet

191
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:36,500
websites and it's also on the dark net

192
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:40,460
uh we can combine them together into a

193
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:43,620
elasticsearch where it's easily searched

194
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,240
we also

195
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,340
have been collecting from ransomware

196
00:07:47,340 --> 00:07:50,220
sites that has increased recently as

197
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:51,500
well

198
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:54,479
how do these forums work for you yeah

199
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:57,840
here we have an example of a site where

200
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,900
they post lead credentials uh usually

201
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,000
they all work the same you need points

202
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,360
to download the and you get points

203
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:09,360
by either posting or posting your

204
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:13,160
own leaks or paying

205
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:15,960
um and and most of the leaks that are

206
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,300
available on have I been pawned Etc are

207
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,160
publicly available on these sites

208
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,780
basically for free they're always

209
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:24,479
located so uh and then we have the the

210
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,699
leak files and this is just the

211
00:08:26,699 --> 00:08:28,379
screenshot from today because we like to

212
00:08:28,379 --> 00:08:30,479
be up to date so these are this the

213
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:32,640
companies they can download today yeah

214
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,279
this is a ransomware site where it shows

215
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,940
uh what companies have chosen not to pay

216
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:42,140
good work of them

217
00:08:42,899 --> 00:08:45,240
um and and then and then we were doing

218
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,980
this research we actually got so much

219
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,779
spam like do you want to buy the

220
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:52,380
attendee list of black hat 2022 uh so we

221
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:53,760
actually had to do that so we actually

222
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,680
bought that list and indexed that one as

223
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:57,540
well as part of the research how much

224
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:00,360
did it cost uh and we we got it below a

225
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,100
hundred dollar if we're like if you were

226
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:03,480
texting back and forth with these guys

227
00:09:03,480 --> 00:09:06,120
we got below 100 to buy all that indeed

228
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,940
list of black cat 2022. uh so we indexed

229
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:10,440
that in our data set for this research

230
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:12,600
as well

231
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:15,120
um so yeah yeah and here you can see

232
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,880
some of the leaked credentials that we

233
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:20,880
have imported into a elasticsearch uh

234
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:24,300
it's around 500 million right now uh and

235
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:27,000
we're gonna release this data later uh

236
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,700
it's actually live now the 500 million

237
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,459
that we have indexed yeah um and we we

238
00:09:32,459 --> 00:09:34,320
have found credentials of more than a

239
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:35,760
billion leaked phone numbers we haven't

240
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:37,740
actually in the had time to index all of

241
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,560
them because it takes a long while and

242
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:42,779
the data is very unstructured in some

243
00:09:42,779 --> 00:09:45,899
ways so basically all your numbers are

244
00:09:45,899 --> 00:09:47,820
belong to us so you do you want to see a

245
00:09:47,820 --> 00:09:49,920
demo of this that we can actually get

246
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,480
some phone numbers and tie them to

247
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:53,580
emails

248
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,580
place

249
00:09:59,220 --> 00:10:01,080
he has a better Unix beard than me

250
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,500
that's why

251
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,080
so let's start by searching for or

252
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,560
lovely CEO that's here in the crowd uh

253
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:12,420
he's always a good Target to search he's

254
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,459
in all breaches we don't import the

255
00:10:14,459 --> 00:10:16,019
bridge if Brian is not part of the

256
00:10:16,019 --> 00:10:19,800
bridge it's not worth importing yeah

257
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,500
so we see here the Brian exists in in

258
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:25,620
three dumb files P2 beta Labs uh

259
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:28,019
LinkedIn the LinkedIn scrape and

260
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:31,080
risley.com so and we can also search by

261
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:32,040
phone number and this is actually

262
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,200
Brian's real phone number so so you can

263
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,899
call him if you want to yeah please do

264
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:39,360
and then we can also do the reverse

265
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:40,920
search we can search for Brian's phone

266
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,779
number and see which other leagues and

267
00:10:42,779 --> 00:10:44,579
he has registered under other email

268
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:47,880
addresses uh so this is real data and

269
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:51,019
it's actually really scary

270
00:10:52,339 --> 00:10:54,060
so

271
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:56,040
yeah we

272
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:59,399
and we're actually making available uh

273
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:01,140
like a test site where you can actually

274
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:03,060
see if your data has been leaked your

275
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:04,620
phone numbers has been leaked I know

276
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,420
have been pawned or starting to import

277
00:11:06,420 --> 00:11:08,820
as well but we've done quite a lot of

278
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:10,320
important we're going to publish the

279
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,440
links later yeah they come in the end of

280
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,760
the slides

281
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:22,220
the back to the presentation I guess

282
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:25,560
um so basically what we thought a

283
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:27,779
credentials that used to be yes username

284
00:11:27,779 --> 00:11:29,640
password slash has that's what we

285
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,920
thought about as League credential what

286
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,140
we're doing now is like saying that well

287
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:35,519
actually if you have username password

288
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,579
and telephone username cracked password

289
00:11:38,579 --> 00:11:40,620
and your telephone numbers you have a

290
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:41,880
good chance to actually use that

291
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:45,120
information to bypass 2fa because a lot

292
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,660
of uh the the

293
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:51,779
2face Solutions only allow text messages

294
00:11:51,779 --> 00:11:54,480
some of the banks in the US have heard

295
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,420
only allow Tech space to fa you can't

296
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:59,940
have to P or any more secure devices so

297
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:01,680
in a lot of places you don't have any

298
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,540
choice

299
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,640
um so basically what this means we have

300
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:08,399
indexed a total you have numbers down

301
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:10,920
here 4.8 billion unique email password

302
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,519
combinations and we have 524 index phone

303
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:17,100
numbers we're very close to a billion

304
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,500
which means that we can tie one of five

305
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,320
every five one in every five email

306
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,500
addresses to a valid phone number so

307
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:28,140
that's how broad the attack spectrum is

308
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:31,939
for the adversaries if you do this

309
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:33,899
um so we looked at some of these attacks

310
00:12:33,899 --> 00:12:35,459
uh we're gonna

311
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:38,760
be fairly quick of this and and the

312
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,800
official response is yeah we've seen a

313
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:42,360
small number of using reporting

314
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:45,660
suspicious activity uh but we will be

315
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,399
pausing with Royals that means it's not

316
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,500
a small number because it's a lot for

317
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,300
people because they're losing a lot of

318
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,220
money and this attack they lost

319
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:57,839
crypto.com lost 34.6 million uh from

320
00:12:57,839 --> 00:12:59,820
several hundred accounts and our

321
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,740
Research indicates yes they were

322
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:03,180
targeted because they had a lot of

323
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:06,360
League credentials so the the users are

324
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,920
targeted because they have leak

325
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,240
credentials and leaked phone numbers

326
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,100
leaked phone numbers is important

327
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,959
because that's why you can bypass the

328
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,519
2fa

329
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:18,120
uh similar with openc openc reported

330
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,820
multiple attacks because nfts are super

331
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:23,579
super popular last year and you can buy

332
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:26,760
a pixelated monkey for like Millions uh

333
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:28,980
so so for some reason kids had like

334
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:31,500
Millions worth of pixelated monkeys that

335
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,540
people wanted to steal

336
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:34,620
so

337
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:36,720
fishing is Michigan attacks in this area

338
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:40,200
is Rife so basically what they did they

339
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:42,920
did is found people's phone numbers

340
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:45,360
actually did this mission Attack and

341
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:47,760
saying like hey we upgraded our contract

342
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,339
so you keep your pixelated monkey say if

343
00:13:50,339 --> 00:13:51,839
you need to upgrade the contract and

344
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,760
transfer them to the to the new contract

345
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,459
and actually they copied word by word

346
00:13:56,459 --> 00:13:59,220
mail from openc but they pointed the

347
00:13:59,220 --> 00:14:00,899
contract to execute the transfer of all

348
00:14:00,899 --> 00:14:05,820
their nfts into the adversaries wallets

349
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:07,860
um oh and while we're doing this

350
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:10,500
research this happened last week they

351
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:12,420
were also breached and had all their

352
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,600
contact and emails leaked yeah it was a

353
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,120
third party so it's not it was not a

354
00:14:18,120 --> 00:14:19,980
bridge for themselves

355
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,720
but in general we are seeing a lot of

356
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,820
bridge and looking at this attack for

357
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,740
instance coinbase said in order to

358
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:27,959
access your account these third parties

359
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:30,060
needed prior knowledge of the email

360
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:33,560
address password and your phone number

361
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:36,240
and that's basically what we're saying

362
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,160
here yeah we can get there for one out

363
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,480
of five people

364
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,000
uh however in that incident they also

365
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,079
took uh exploited some vulnerabilities

366
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:47,519
during their account recovery process

367
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:50,279
and this is the most common way of

368
00:14:50,279 --> 00:14:53,940
fooling 2fa is actually to initiate a

369
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:57,959
password reset and then fool the device

370
00:14:57,959 --> 00:15:00,920
and

371
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:06,420
kind of demo very soon so account

372
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:09,600
recovery we looked at like five or six

373
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,060
different attacks two or three of them

374
00:15:12,060 --> 00:15:15,180
were account recovery the number two was

375
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:18,000
SMS injection where you initiate the

376
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,519
login and you you some sites I mean you

377
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:22,740
can log into basic functionality with

378
00:15:22,740 --> 00:15:24,360
just username and password but if you

379
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:27,000
want to do a transfer then you need 2fa

380
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:29,399
so what the attackers are doing then is

381
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:31,380
that they're initiating a transfer then

382
00:15:31,380 --> 00:15:33,720
sending an SMS to the the perpetrator

383
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,220
saying like hey

384
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,959
we can demo this there is something

385
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,699
wrong with your account input your

386
00:15:38,699 --> 00:15:40,920
credentials and doing a man in the

387
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:43,279
middle attack

388
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,339
um and this is also very common now but

389
00:15:47,339 --> 00:15:49,680
you have this attack combining smashing

390
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,620
with adversary in the middle proxies so

391
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:53,880
we're actually getting the real

392
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,560
credentials as the people input them

393
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,000
and number four which we're not going to

394
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,800
talk too much about here but another

395
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:05,639
common way uh is same jacking or Sim

396
00:16:05,639 --> 00:16:09,180
cloning or Sim porting basically Michael

397
00:16:09,180 --> 00:16:11,519
yeah well it's very common here in the

398
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,040
states at least at your social

399
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,720
engineered

400
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:17,880
telephone companies to switch their

401
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:19,800
accounts to another sim card

402
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:21,959
or you can go in and buy with a false ID

403
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:23,579
and saying like hey I want to buy the

404
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:26,880
new subscription for Verizon can you

405
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,620
port over my number from this other

406
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,720
phone I recommend you doing that but

407
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:33,420
it's been known to happen

408
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,579
but in general the account recovery

409
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,500
process is very relaxed and this is

410
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:39,720
actually my account so if I go in and

411
00:16:39,720 --> 00:16:42,120
try to do account recovery on myself on

412
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:44,519
Google and remember Google has the most

413
00:16:44,519 --> 00:16:47,040
tested well-known process for account

414
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,720
recovery of everyone in the world

415
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,459
because they have the most users but

416
00:16:50,459 --> 00:16:52,500
even them I think is a bit relaxed you

417
00:16:52,500 --> 00:16:54,779
give way like at the ending of my phone

418
00:16:54,779 --> 00:16:57,180
number to other of my email addresses

419
00:16:57,180 --> 00:17:00,060
this is giving a way of a lot of data if

420
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:02,220
I also have the dump funds

421
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,180
um

422
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:05,520
but yeah let's talk in general about

423
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:08,520
text messages text messages was invite

424
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:12,059
invented like in 1984 as part of the GSM

425
00:17:12,059 --> 00:17:13,260
specification

426
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:16,319
uh and the first text was sent in 1992

427
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,839
and said merry Christmas and I did for

428
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:20,819
originally it was like they had padding

429
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:23,819
left in the data packets because of like

430
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:26,040
alignment bugs so they had a couple of

431
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,839
characters left so some engineer there

432
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,640
like what can we do with this ah we can

433
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,620
put in seven bit ASCII and we can encode

434
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,720
it on the line and run it over the

435
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,700
network and then text messaging was

436
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:39,179
basically born it was never intended to

437
00:17:39,179 --> 00:17:41,460
be a security protocol at all literally

438
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,559
there is no verification of anything

439
00:17:43,559 --> 00:17:46,559
except it being 7-bit ASCII there is no

440
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:47,940
sender verification there is no

441
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:50,460
checksums there's no nothing it's just

442
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:53,179
like seven bit ASCII encoded on the line

443
00:17:53,179 --> 00:17:56,640
and then pulled up by the Broadband

444
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:59,580
shape and displayed

445
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:00,179
um

446
00:18:00,179 --> 00:18:04,020
so getting a telegram from or a text

447
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:06,600
message from Santa Claus is as valid

448
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,640
according to the specifications as one

449
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,960
from a phone number

450
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:12,360
and that's why we what we see now

451
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:15,240
uh that we are getting all these text

452
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:18,059
messages from like Verizon where you're

453
00:18:18,059 --> 00:18:20,160
getting these text messages that's like

454
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,900
not intended but that's how the protocol

455
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,820
is used

456
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:25,500
so there's a couple of ways to send text

457
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:28,580
messages manually via your phone

458
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:31,860
but then through modem and old phones

459
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:33,419
which we're going to demonstrate here

460
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:35,460
but it's good because we're not going to

461
00:18:35,460 --> 00:18:37,140
have time for that demo anyway but you

462
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,580
have to trust us you can just plug in a

463
00:18:38,580 --> 00:18:41,520
USB cable write 80 some 80 commands

464
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,440
transpose it to some bit asking to send

465
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,539
it off

466
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:46,500
um

467
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:49,260
or you can use an API service so that's

468
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:53,100
what we're going to demo now the

469
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:56,659
oofing stuff

470
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,020
okay

471
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:06,440
let's see

472
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:10,039
start another one

473
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:13,460
it's green recording

474
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:18,320
come on

475
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,660
thank you

476
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:26,539
okay this worked a second ago

477
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,720
let me see

478
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:38,280
otherwise we have videos because that's

479
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,620
boring

480
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,159
and

481
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:49,039
a new movie

482
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,700
restart the QuickTime

483
00:19:57,660 --> 00:19:59,640
okay

484
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:04,039
this is always thing with live demos huh

485
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,380
fine

486
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:15,299
oh look at us sweet

487
00:20:15,299 --> 00:20:17,900
close-up

488
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:28,559
not working

489
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:31,100
okay

490
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:36,120
now there we go fantastic

491
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:38,899
let's go

492
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:43,380
uh so what we're seeing here is the the

493
00:20:43,380 --> 00:20:45,179
point of the attack from the adversary

494
00:20:45,179 --> 00:20:46,620
where we're seeing the phone to the left

495
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:50,280
which is my actual normal phone uh and

496
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,020
then we have some scripts that are going

497
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,880
to use API providers we actually got

498
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,640
blocked uh not for spoofing this mess

499
00:20:56,640 --> 00:20:58,860
because that's total okay we got locked

500
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,240
because some of the payloads that we're

501
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,919
sending

502
00:21:01,919 --> 00:21:05,340
um were bad by some providers so we have

503
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:06,600
switched to another there's literally

504
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,299
hundreds of providers out there uh where

505
00:21:09,299 --> 00:21:11,660
you can

506
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:14,580
let's see

507
00:21:14,580 --> 00:21:16,919
is the cable bad now

508
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:20,640
no yeah it's not showing up on screen so

509
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,620
I got the text message here from binance

510
00:21:22,620 --> 00:21:24,720
let's see if it shows up again

511
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,380
try it again

512
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,860
and change

513
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:34,158
close up

514
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:38,960
okay bad cable

515
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:42,080
um so

516
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:46,620
you just have to watch the video then

517
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:49,500
I'm just use this one try try and we're

518
00:21:49,500 --> 00:21:51,179
going to try one cable for you to see

519
00:21:51,179 --> 00:21:53,580
this otherwise we're gonna have to go to

520
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,780
the videos of the demos

521
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:59,520
five

522
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,740
email recording

523
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,400
come on

524
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:10,440
yes new cable Finance new text message

525
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:13,559
so I click on on the binance text

526
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:17,840
and I face ID I use my passcode

527
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,419
um and what we're seeing here if you

528
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:24,299
select the window here

529
00:22:24,299 --> 00:22:26,640
is this is actually inside my nor I do

530
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:28,140
have a binance account

531
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,419
uh and this is the real binance account

532
00:22:30,419 --> 00:22:32,940
where they're saying sending my

533
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:34,260
verification code

534
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:36,059
you're requesting a transfer if this was

535
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:38,940
not you please be aware of the spam

536
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,280
calls and SMS phishing so obviously

537
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,020
we're doing the same we're copying their

538
00:22:43,020 --> 00:22:45,780
text and basically saying your account

539
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:48,659
is blocked due to suspicious activity to

540
00:22:48,659 --> 00:22:51,299
unlock this phone and or your account

541
00:22:51,299 --> 00:22:54,720
please go here uh and obviously the

542
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,240
domain name would not be

543
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:57,919
demo.smishmash.net

544
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:00,539
and we're not going to do binance we

545
00:23:00,539 --> 00:23:03,980
have set up our own crypto uh

546
00:23:03,980 --> 00:23:07,799
exchange.com don't sue us don't so so we

547
00:23:07,799 --> 00:23:09,720
don't get sued live because it would be

548
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,700
bad to do this on

549
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,340
um so crypto exchange this is my email

550
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:19,380
and look here uh there is a code and

551
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:22,320
this is actually from the real uh SMS

552
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,880
that comes from binance because we're

553
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:26,760
also initiating a login or a transfer

554
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:29,340
and boom just fill it

555
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,320
and hit next

556
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,179
and we're not really

557
00:23:33,179 --> 00:23:35,059
and here

558
00:23:35,059 --> 00:23:38,640
with next and we redirected to in this

559
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:42,240
case crypto.com because this goes for

560
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,440
all of them and on the adversary side we

561
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,720
actually get the username and the token

562
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,240
as well as the session tokens and to

563
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,100
actually log in and complete the

564
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:55,020
transfer and as you see it's actually

565
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,900
very hard to spot on the phone that

566
00:23:57,900 --> 00:23:59,880
you're actually being man and middle

567
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,039
attacked and fished

568
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:04,500
um and the thing is that the text

569
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:07,860
messages actually like shows up

570
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,900
and here actually we have another script

571
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,480
so we're actually texting the the

572
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,299
credentials to ourselves as well via

573
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:18,080
texting from file

574
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,640
which is our company because yeah you

575
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,940
can send text from anything so that's

576
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:25,620
um and you can also do this through

577
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,860
Google

578
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:30,120
um we have some sample for Google I

579
00:24:30,120 --> 00:24:33,139
think yeah

580
00:24:45,960 --> 00:24:48,059
fourth message from Google because they

581
00:24:48,059 --> 00:24:49,559
actually say what message from Google

582
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:52,200
and it shows up in my normal auth

583
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:54,419
messages coinbase is using the same

584
00:24:54,419 --> 00:24:57,000
short code suspicious activity at your

585
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,440
account please verify your credential

586
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,600
yeah I'm gonna do it always click always

587
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,158
click these links very good

588
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,419
uh and if the internet is quicker here

589
00:25:06,419 --> 00:25:07,620
you're going to see what's happening now

590
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:11,580
the internet is not super fast

591
00:25:11,580 --> 00:25:13,500
um but we are getting the requests

592
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,960
eventually as you can see from the

593
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:17,220
adversary

594
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,919
point of view

595
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:22,020
but uh

596
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,400
it's loading Maybe

597
00:25:27,059 --> 00:25:29,779
it's on the way

598
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,100
is it

599
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,900
should be

600
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:36,620
hmm

601
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,620
come on

602
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:43,939
let me click on it again

603
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:50,039
Finance yeah

604
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:01,500
cannot write the last response from

605
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:03,480
under middle client

606
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,840
okay

607
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:14,580
so

608
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:16,440
um we might have to show you the

609
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:20,000
recorded sorry click again click again

610
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:23,700
and so they don't but they they work

611
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:27,179
really well before this morning

612
00:26:27,179 --> 00:26:29,700
uh so we're blaming Network speeds

613
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,400
actually I would say

614
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,580
um accountsgofishing.com

615
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:39,620
but yeah

616
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,260
let's do the video yeah do the video of

617
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,559
that one

618
00:26:53,779 --> 00:26:57,860
screen recording in here

619
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:01,140
oh okay now yes because I'm doing that

620
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:03,900
it is low speeds so basically what would

621
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,000
happen if we had the faster speed here

622
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,900
the actual pre-fill would actually

623
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:13,200
overlay uh the the bar if you showed the

624
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,419
phone again uh so what's happening here

625
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:18,539
is that my pre-filled credentials to log

626
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:20,720
in to Google

627
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:26,520
uh no it didn't work we will actually uh

628
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:32,100
over uh overlay uh the bar

629
00:27:32,100 --> 00:27:34,860
so I'm gonna use black cat let's go find

630
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:37,820
anything now

631
00:27:41,880 --> 00:27:44,880
and my Google verification code is very

632
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,640
small here actually gets pre-filled

633
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:49,919
let's stop um

634
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,720
five

635
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:55,220
you remove recording

636
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,700
so my What's Happening Here is that my

637
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,600
credentials from Google and these are

638
00:28:00,600 --> 00:28:02,039
the real credentials actually get

639
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:04,080
pre-filled in the enter code even though

640
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:06,360
I'm going to a man in Middle side and

641
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,340
not the intended side because they come

642
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,380
from the same source which were spoofed

643
00:28:10,380 --> 00:28:13,020
so I now log in and now we're going to

644
00:28:13,020 --> 00:28:15,659
get an error because I'm I'm redirected

645
00:28:15,659 --> 00:28:17,400
to the dot SC domain which I don't have

646
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:19,860
a certificate for for this demo but as

647
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:24,080
you see here we have the token already

648
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,820
on the adversary side so I'm logged into

649
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:28,559
my Google account without

650
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:31,620
with the real 2fa codes with the man in

651
00:28:31,620 --> 00:28:33,360
the middle of the proxy

652
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:35,760
so yeah sorry about the demos there were

653
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:39,000
a bit of cables and slow internet but

654
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,380
that's the idea and that's how people

655
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:42,779
are doing it you inject yourself into

656
00:28:42,779 --> 00:28:45,419
the SMS stream

657
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:47,820
um and then we found if you're doing

658
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:49,679
this professionally if you're like big

659
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:51,960
time adversary you don't have crappy

660
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:54,980
codes and then you go into your famous

661
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:57,539
Chinese site and you buy the hardware

662
00:28:57,539 --> 00:29:00,840
for like 160 bucks you can buy a custom

663
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:03,419
Hardware that does all these SMS moving

664
00:29:03,419 --> 00:29:06,179
for you and you can even buy bigger rigs

665
00:29:06,179 --> 00:29:08,220
like like going large scale release

666
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:11,039
attacks where you can slot in like 64

667
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,039
SIM cards in parallel and just Brute

668
00:29:14,039 --> 00:29:16,080
Force these away

669
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,419
um and funnily enough they're actually

670
00:29:18,419 --> 00:29:21,480
marketed by like you can also from 80

671
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,659
commands change the EM IE number which

672
00:29:24,659 --> 00:29:26,520
is like the hardware number where you're

673
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,260
sending from so you totally can't be

674
00:29:28,260 --> 00:29:32,159
tracked and you can also send the smsc

675
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,559
sender to whatever you like on these

676
00:29:34,559 --> 00:29:36,840
devices and this you can just order off

677
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,860
of eBay or Chinese eBay

678
00:29:39,860 --> 00:29:42,120
and funnily enough and some of them

679
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,980
they're actually having the marketing

680
00:29:43,980 --> 00:29:45,779
materials look at that screenshot

681
00:29:45,779 --> 00:29:47,940
they're actually marketing them with

682
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:49,919
like here's your Google authentication

683
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:52,740
code so so this is sort of a a

684
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:55,500
well-known secret that this is possible

685
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:58,140
it's not like no one's heard of this

686
00:29:58,140 --> 00:30:00,539
they're actually marketing them this way

687
00:30:00,539 --> 00:30:03,720
so the idea that we just showed is that

688
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:06,360
we have a fish user adversary in the

689
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:11,880
middle and TLS set up but we can still

690
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:16,140
uh do this so okay we're over time uh

691
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:18,179
but I'm just going to say some closing

692
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:19,399
remarks

693
00:30:19,399 --> 00:30:22,200
uh or protection against this we have

694
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,539
seen a couple of the really targeted

695
00:30:24,539 --> 00:30:27,419
side protecting against this there are

696
00:30:27,419 --> 00:30:29,700
several ways recapture seems to be the

697
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,500
most common because there you can set a

698
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:33,899
cookie from which site the recapture can

699
00:30:33,899 --> 00:30:36,899
come so you know at least you as a user

700
00:30:36,899 --> 00:30:40,080
will see this uh if you're on the middle

701
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:42,419
side that there's an arrow in recapture

702
00:30:42,419 --> 00:30:44,340
some sites are protecting with

703
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,020
cloudfront cookies you can do a similar

704
00:30:46,020 --> 00:30:49,080
way and you could protect most likely

705
00:30:49,080 --> 00:30:51,120
with cores for doing some

706
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:52,860
experimentation with this with setting

707
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,419
up the course headers correctly between

708
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:56,580
the API service everyone uses this

709
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:58,860
course star like everywhere everyone's

710
00:30:58,860 --> 00:31:00,539
like yeah of course yeah that's fine but

711
00:31:00,539 --> 00:31:02,039
you could protect against these type of

712
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:03,960
mandible attacks by doing correct core

713
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,000
setups so there is ways to protect

714
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,980
against these attacks

715
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,679
so uh we're fully releasing all the

716
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:13,559
research data that we've done on this uh

717
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:16,980
under an S3 bucket uh so you start to

718
00:31:16,980 --> 00:31:19,559
take a picture of this slide

719
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:21,299
um because that was the best we could

720
00:31:21,299 --> 00:31:24,059
think of because we wanted to release it

721
00:31:24,059 --> 00:31:27,120
as soon or as late as possible to get as

722
00:31:27,120 --> 00:31:29,159
much data as possible into this dump

723
00:31:29,159 --> 00:31:32,720
file the dump file is about 50 60 gigs

724
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:35,399
so that's why we put it on S3 bucket

725
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:37,799
because it's a lot of numbers and emails

726
00:31:37,799 --> 00:31:40,500
are hashed in that one so so it's show

727
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,720
one hashed so you can actually you can

728
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:44,159
search yourself

729
00:31:44,159 --> 00:31:47,039
so the key takeaways from this one in

730
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:48,899
five email accounts can be titled out

731
00:31:48,899 --> 00:31:51,120
the phone number SMS has no built-in

732
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,460
security can be spoofed it's hard to

733
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:55,260
spot fake sites on the mobile because

734
00:31:55,260 --> 00:31:57,840
the mobile actually hides the the bar of

735
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,940
where you're going uh and the mobile

736
00:31:59,940 --> 00:32:02,520
will automatically fill the tofa tokens

737
00:32:02,520 --> 00:32:05,700
the correct ones to help you okay thank

738
00:32:05,700 --> 00:32:08,039
you guys we had to get ready for the

739
00:32:08,039 --> 00:32:09,840
next briefing but thank you guys for

740
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,490
attending
