lock the door where no one's leaving

5
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,800
here until we can all agree on what

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,720
thread hunting is

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:21,720
kidding me much time or the appetite for

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,880
violence so thank you so much for coming

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:25,859
out and listening to us talk today so

10
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,599
I'm John

11

Neil I'm sorry celebrity names this is

00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:31,380
grifter I don't know if you guys heard

13
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,899
of him and Samir and between us we have

14
00:00:33,899 --> 00:00:35,940
Decades of experience in you know threat

15
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:37,380
hunting and incident response and

16
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:38,640
security engineering and Building

17
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,020
Technology

18
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:42,120
been around the block a few times and

19
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:44,579
today we want to talk a little bit about

20
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,559
our new approach to

21
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:48,180
building and maturing a threat hunting

22
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:49,379
program and I'm going to do that by

23
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:50,820
starting talking about a story about

24
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,219
fishing and I don't mean the fishing

25
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:54,300
that you're probably going to hear about

26
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,280
all week I mean like really ripping lips

27
00:00:56,280 --> 00:00:58,739
catch me a marlin fishing

28
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,980
so I have a buddy Ryan Ryan loves to

29
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,040
fish actually this logo appears from his

30
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,920
blog realfishing.net give them a follow

31
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,200
and I go fishing with Ryan quite a bit

32
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:12,000
actually and not that I particularly

33
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,460
love fishing it's fun you know what I do

34
00:01:14,460 --> 00:01:17,460
love I love having drinks on a boat so I

35
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,920
make myself available

36
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,560
one I've been to Ryan's house and Ryan

37
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,439
has a stupid amount of fishing gear like

38
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,020
it's all over his house and I said Ryan

39
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:30,000
do you really need

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,759
this much stuff to catch a fish and he

41
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:34,200
responds with

42
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,880
depends on the fish right I've kind of

43
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,100
walked into that one so he goes on and

44
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,720
shows me all the different baits and

45
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,460
lures and hooks that he has and he says

46
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:43,920
each one of these things is designed to

47
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,079
catch a particular type of fish and each

48
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,579
one of these things requires a

49
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:49,500
particular technique

50
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:51,540
Danny gets real excited he runs over the

51
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:52,920
wall and he shows me all these different

52
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,500
rods and he's like see all these rods

53
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,200
depending on where I'm fishing I might

54
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,720
need to use a different Rod so that was

55
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,399
really interesting to me because what I

56
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,320
learned is that it is the environment

57
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,119
and the fish

58
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:08,880
that is driving Ryan's decision and

59
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,380
tools and techniques and not the other

60
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,640
way around

61
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,560
and Ryan finally makes this comment that

62
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:15,480
that really stuck with me he's like and

63
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:16,860
sometimes I don't use a rod at all

64
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:19,020
because sometimes I like to do spear

65
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,040
fishing

66
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,500
and he said it's kind of weird because

67
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,300
some people don't consider that real

68
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,940
fishing but it doesn't matter to him as

69
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,920
long as he's having fun

70
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:31,940
so what I learned from Ryan is that

71
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:35,340
Ryan's goal was not to fish Ryan's goal

72
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:39,060
was to have fun and fishing was just his

73
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:42,660
way to achieve his goal and fishing can

74
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,360
take on many different shapes forms or

75
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,040
functions and use drastically different

76
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,800
tools or methodologies

77
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,300
I'm going to tie this together bear with

78
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:52,860
me

79
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:54,660
so that reminded me about one this one

80
00:02:54,660 --> 00:02:57,000
time I was having I was doing a threat

81
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,900
briefing for a bunch of different

82
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:01,500
security teams and I had mentioned in

83
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:03,840
passing something about what threat

84
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,500
hunting could do not realizing that I

85
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,720
had just hooked a Molotov cocktail into

86
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,040
this conference call

87
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,440
and it broke out into what I can only

88
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,060
describe as a war

89
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:18,319
between multiple different factions

90
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,599
on what is or isn't threat hunting and

91
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,040
people are getting like big feelings

92
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,800
about this and arguing right

93
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:29,099
and then suddenly it goes like the whole

94
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:31,080
call focuses on me and they want to get

95
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:32,879
my take they're like well where do you

96
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,980
stand you know because you got the the

97
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,959
hypothesis people here you got the free

98
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,879
form searching people here you have the

99
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:40,260
people think that it's intelligence

100
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:42,239
driven here and they're all closing in

101
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:43,620
on me so you guys ever see Jurassic

102
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,900
world like where he's got that he's

103
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:48,180
keeping the the Raptors at Bay and

104
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,980
they're all closing in I'm just standing

105
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,500
there I'm looking out it's not like a

106
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,840
slightly more handsome Chris Pratt

107
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,760
don't laugh at that

108
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,260
true

109
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,940
suddenly I stand up and I said you're

110
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,220
all right you see because why can't we

111
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,920
approach threat hunting like Ryan

112
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,540
approaches fishing why can't we let the

113
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:09,239
goals of their respective hunt teams

114
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:11,400
Drive what the definition of threat

115
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:12,900
hunting is and now it's an individual

116
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,879
decision and then we can stop arguing

117
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,160
about what is or isn't threat hunting

118
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,600
and focusing on the thing that really

119
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:20,880
matters which is are they effective

120
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,919
and Effectiveness you can use their

121
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:23,940
goals

122
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,800
so that was really interesting to me and

123
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,440
I got really really curious about

124
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:30,060
measuring Effectiveness on threat

125
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:32,280
hunting programs versus goals and

126
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,419
objectives

127
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:36,360
so I started writing down like a rubric

128
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:38,699
if you will of like characteristics of a

129
00:04:38,699 --> 00:04:40,860
threat hunting program that I you know

130
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,900
generally wants and which ones that

131
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:45,240
perhaps in this thing this actually

132
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,680
became the maturity model in the

133
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:48,000
framework

134
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,680
if I look at these things is there

135
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,060
something in here that'll allow me to

136
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:52,919
predict whether or not a threat hunting

137
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:55,199
program was going to be effective

138
00:04:55,199 --> 00:04:56,699
so I had my thing and I was like I need

139
00:04:56,699 --> 00:04:57,960
to test this right I need to get out

140
00:04:57,960 --> 00:04:59,220
there I need to talk to people much

141
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:00,479
smarter than me people that are just

142
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,520
crushing it in the game to find out what

143
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:04,740
other threat hunting teams are doing and

144
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:06,720
what works really well to see if I can

145
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,120
identify High performers

146
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,580
and identify what characteristics are

147
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,040
shared amongst that group

148
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,300
so I did

149
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,280
the P the people that know me the best

150
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,919
are not shocked by this at all because I

151
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:21,840
am that golden retriever I love making

152
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,740
friends so I spent two years guys two

153
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,960
years talking to various threat hunting

154
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,660
teams of all shapes and sizes about

155
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,639
getting into their processes their

156
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:35,220
Staffing their you know how they execute

157
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:37,680
a hunt how do they do hunt Tempo all

158
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,060
these different things

159
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:41,940
and trying to identify you know who the

160
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:43,800
high performers were like who were

161
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,720
clearly crushing it based on you know

162
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,120
the rubric that I had and measuring

163
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:50,699
their effectiveness and I was able to do

164
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:52,680
that and here was what was very very

165
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,919
interesting to me because what the

166
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:57,840
shared characteristics of the high

167
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,780
performers wasn't the fancy bang tools

168
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:03,300
it wasn't the hunters with phds it

169
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,699
wasn't any of the technical capabilities

170
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:07,919
really because they varied so much but

171
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,479
what it was is all of the high

172
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:11,160
performers whether they knew it or not

173
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:14,520
had a well-defined long-term vision and

174
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,160
Mission and a leader who was hyper

175
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,620
focused on making sure that all of the

176
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:22,080
people processes and Technologies were

177
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,900
designed to keep that threat to a lot

178
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,979
with that long-term mission

179
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:30,120
so that was very interesting

180
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,460
because I didn't expect that right so

181
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,780
now we're talking about why likes things

182
00:06:33,780 --> 00:06:35,400
like strategic management and how it

183
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,160
might impact threat hunting

184
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,080
because I got to see

185
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,479
what you know another Frameworks would

186
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,400
consider a lower maturity threat hunting

187
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,259
program they were using open source free

188
00:06:46,259 --> 00:06:48,479
tooling but you know based on the

189
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:49,740
threats that were applicable to them

190
00:06:49,740 --> 00:06:51,840
they were highly effective like they

191
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,340
brought a lot of value to the

192
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,539
organization

193
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:56,400
so how can I say that they are lower

194
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,740
than another hunt team that I got to see

195
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,780
where they had all the fancy whiz-bang

196
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,580
tools they had phds in the hunter

197
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:04,860
program they had just giant data Lake

198
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:07,139
but they didn't take the time to

199
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:09,000
Institute those fundamental components

200
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,400
of an effective program so they've ran

201
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,800
into issues like political problems and

202
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,020
getting access to data and doing

203
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,880
interfacing with the sock and so they

204
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,220
were never really able to find their

205
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:22,259
full potential

206
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:24,419
it's important to note that it wasn't

207
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:26,460
enough and I want to make sure that I'm

208
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,319
clear on this it wasn't enough for a

209
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:30,120
program to have a mission or strategy

210
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:32,460
written down or even fantastic goals and

211
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,660
objectives

212
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:35,940
it was all about execution so in an

213
00:07:35,940 --> 00:07:38,099
atomic habits there's this great quote

214
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:40,139
and it says we don't rise to the level

215
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:42,479
of our goals we fall to the level of our

216
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:45,000
systems and that was held true

217
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,880
even in in this case

218
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:50,759
the other thing that was really really

219
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:53,340
interesting to me and I want to talk

220
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,259
specifically to the executives in the

221
00:07:55,259 --> 00:07:58,800
room is when I was interviewing Hunters

222
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,639
the the more Hunters within a program

223
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:04,199
who could fully articulate what the

224
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,180
program's long-term goals and vision

225
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:08,639
were the more likely they were belong to

226
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,560
a high performing group

227
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,039
so think about that like the more

228
00:08:14,039 --> 00:08:15,599
individual contributors that are

229
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,539
Marching In The Same Direction

230
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:21,120
that's when the magic happens

231
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,919
and I challenge you to make some magic

232
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,500
of your own like get involved with your

233
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,360
threat hunting programs start a threat

234
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,520
hunting program and put your best

235
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:31,560
leaders in charge of that regardless of

236
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,360
their technical capabilities the best

237
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,919
threat hunting program that I got to

238
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,559
view over this time is run by a woman

239
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:40,140
who essentially had no threat hunting

240
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,719
experience at all before she took over

241
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:43,740
the program but you know what she is

242
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:45,600
she's a fantastic leader

243
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,519
she's great at building and managing a

244
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:51,000
team and she's absolutely world class at

245
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:52,620
building effective processes and

246
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,600
procedures

247
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:57,000
it's really great when you get to see

248
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,519
when it's doing when it happens really

249
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:00,660
well

250
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,100
all the great things that come out of

251
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:04,200
threat hunting program in that specific

252
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,959
example through her work through her

253
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:09,060
Mission and her program that

254
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:11,160
organization is using threat hunting as

255
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:12,899
the driver for their entire security

256
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:16,080
strategy so outputs from their threat

257
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,000
hunting program are going into things

258
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,980
like Risk and compliance and governance

259
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:22,440
they're making decisions about data for

260
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:24,240
like what is valuable data versus

261
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,480
invaluable data so like every bit of

262
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,399
data that we centralize has a dollar

263
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:31,980
amount associated with it usually in in

264
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:33,959
some way or fashion so they're making

265
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:35,820
decisions that are impacting things like

266
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,580
budget or identifying dependencies

267
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,779
between

268
00:09:39,779 --> 00:09:41,700
systems like critical Business Systems

269
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:43,800
so that feeds into operations so they

270
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:46,500
may change how they actually monitor the

271
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,540
most important things within their

272
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:50,459
organization just for uptime because

273
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:53,339
they oh I didn't realize that this

274
00:09:53,339 --> 00:09:54,779
application

275
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:56,700
had a critical dependence on something

276
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,860
two moves away

277
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:01,980
is great so like there's a lot to this

278
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:04,860
and I've seen what happens

279
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:07,560
unfortunately when the magic doesn't

280
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:10,500
happen I've lived that I want to like

281
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,360
I've lived this life before guys I don't

282
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:13,920
want to seem like I'm just like did

283
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:15,420
research and I don't understand what

284
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:17,220
it's like in the real world but

285
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:20,640
I have so a couple of years ago I was

286
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:23,160
asked to launch a threat hunting program

287
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:24,779
for an organization

288
00:10:24,779 --> 00:10:26,640
and can't mince words about this I

289
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,880
failed I failed and it sucked at the

290
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:31,800
time but I'm incredibly proud of my

291
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:34,740
failures now like a failure to me is now

292
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,779
I've been gifted with the opportunity to

293
00:10:36,779 --> 00:10:38,760
learn and grow

294
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:40,980
and from that example

295
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,680
I can look back and see why it was so

296
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,380
easy for me to fail

297
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,060
because if you go out there and you look

298
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:49,800
at all the resources out there they're

299
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:51,779
talking about threat hunting it kind of

300
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:54,060
flies in direct conflict with everything

301
00:10:54,060 --> 00:10:55,380
that we've found

302
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,720
the first thing that most threat hunting

303
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,180
resources out there do within the first

304
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,920
sentence is they Define what threat

305
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,660
hunting is to the reader

306
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:05,519
we've already kind of established why

307
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,500
that might not be the best idea so when

308
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,779
I had this project I found a definition

309
00:11:09,779 --> 00:11:11,459
of threat hunting that I thought was

310
00:11:11,459 --> 00:11:13,740
really cool and that's the one that I

311
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,180
wanted to do but I didn't consider

312
00:11:15,180 --> 00:11:16,860
whether or not that aligned with what

313
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:19,440
the organization needed or wanted

314
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:21,180
I didn't think about how that would work

315
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:23,540
with the other teams within the security

316
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:25,980
and so I set it up for fail just by

317
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:28,560
making that critical misstep right out

318
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,899
of the gate because I was taking someone

319
00:11:30,899 --> 00:11:33,360
else's Viewpoint and trying to apply it

320
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:36,180
to an internal organization

321
00:11:36,180 --> 00:11:38,640
the second thing is that most resources

322
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,660
out there

323
00:11:39,660 --> 00:11:41,579
are hyper focused on the technical

324
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:44,760
execution of finding evil which is great

325
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,440
I'm not saying that the technical pieces

326
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,300
aren't important they they are they're

327
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,800
they're obviously

328
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,920
but what I am saying is that

329
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:55,920
when the fundamental pieces are not

330
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,019
implemented and executed

331
00:11:58,019 --> 00:12:00,300
the technical pieces become extremely

332
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,440
hard

333
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,720
whereas if you do the work on the

334
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,880
fundamental high impact things for an

335
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,620
effective threat hunting program the

336
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,260
threat the technical pieces that becomes

337
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:13,320
easy that that's the easy part because

338
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,940
there's so much great work out there in

339
00:12:14,940 --> 00:12:17,040
that that you can use the people doing

340
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,720
work in that space are doing absolutely

341
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:21,480
great it's just we need to focus on you

342
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,800
know the cart before the horse kind of

343
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,940
deal like we really need to think about

344
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:25,320
the building blocks before we start

345
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:26,940
executing

346
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:28,800
finally the the other thing that I

347
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,600
noticed is while it did seem like there

348
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:32,100
was

349
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,200
some resources out there that looked

350
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:35,700
like they were well thought out and

351
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,260
designed they were usually tied to a

352
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:39,959
particular vendor or technology or

353
00:12:39,959 --> 00:12:41,519
Consulting service

354
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,740
which is good I mean I get it like we

355
00:12:43,740 --> 00:12:45,899
got to make money but

356
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,300
um what what kind of bothers me about

357
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:51,959
that is if I lead with tech so I make a

358
00:12:51,959 --> 00:12:53,519
technical decision

359
00:12:53,519 --> 00:12:55,440
because I go out there and I Google it

360
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,139
now I'm buying a solution to a problem I

361
00:12:58,139 --> 00:13:00,060
don't fully understand yet and now I'm

362
00:13:00,060 --> 00:13:02,399
invested in this like are we are we

363
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,079
going to try to create an environment we

364
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:05,639
got to pay to play in threat hunting

365
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:06,420
like

366
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,540
that just didn't sit right with me so

367
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:11,279
I thought about what what can I do what

368
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,680
can I do to help right so Simon cynic

369
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:15,240
has this he talks about this all the

370
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:17,100
time but he says like in the bookstore

371
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:19,860
there's a whole section dedicated on

372
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:21,839
self-help but there's no section on

373
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:24,300
helping others and we really need to

374
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,440
help each other

375
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:28,560
so I thought what can I do to help how

376
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,180
can I make sure that everyone learns

377
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,680
from my mistakes

378
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,480
so this doesn't happen again so I

379
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,639
started creating a new framework one

380
00:13:35,639 --> 00:13:38,399
that was free and open will be Community

381
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,100
Driven vendor agnostic that we can try

382
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,959
to make a real big impact and make some

383
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:43,920
magic

384
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,440
so at this point I'd like to bring up

385
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,540
Samir who's going to actually introduce

386
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:49,980
the open threat hunting framework and

387
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:51,660
talk about the modules a little bit

388
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,160
about his experience

389
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:55,880
thank you John

390
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:59,279
so what John mentioned about uh

391
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:01,399
development of the open thread framework

392
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:03,959
and having decades worth of experience

393
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:06,540
doing the threat hunting I was the new

394
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,940
kid on the Block he brought in here who

395
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:10,920
can ask all the silly questions

396
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:13,139
every time he put in some idea why

397
00:14:13,139 --> 00:14:15,540
because I did not have that experience I

398
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,380
do

399
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:17,940
OT security I have done application

400
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,920
development so threat hunting

401
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,200
specifically was a new thing for me to

402
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:24,300
learn as well while I was learning I was

403
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:27,360
asking all these questions why why why

404
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:31,740
why so that that made it to uh pique my

405
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,920
interest more and more while I was uh

406
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:37,440
trying to relate all these elements of

407
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:40,260
threat hunting framework that he had

408
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:42,360
started putting together tying back to

409
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:45,839
the problems I had when I was leading an

410
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,180
OT security program for a manufacturing

411
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,380
organization

412
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:52,199
uh the classic problem that we have

413
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:56,040
about which data do you have I don't

414
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:59,399
know uh what do you need and all these

415
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,620
questions always had created some

416
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:04,440
bottlenecks for me getting the automated

417
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,120
detection setup for the operational

418
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,459
technology environment and made it more

419
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:10,139
difficult to get buy-in from the

420
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,660
operations it's always the struggle we

421
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:15,540
all know that so when

422
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,639
we started working on this there are

423
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:19,139
several elements of these which were

424
00:15:19,139 --> 00:15:20,940
very particularly interesting and hit

425
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:24,000
hit it on the uh hit the nail on its

426
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,740
head I won't go through all of the

427
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:29,160
modules that are over here but we have

428
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:31,560
already talked about some fundamental uh

429
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:34,800
modules that are foundational for

430
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,540
building the good threat hunting program

431
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:39,120
for example the foundational piece which

432
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,579
is where you need to have a goal that

433
00:15:41,579 --> 00:15:44,040
works for your organization but taking

434
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:46,079
it to the next level you need an

435
00:15:46,079 --> 00:15:48,300
organization when we talk about the

436
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,860
organization it's not about just the

437
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:52,500
organizational structure it's about the

438
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:54,779
skills that you need to place and you

439
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:56,399
need to have the right skills for the

440
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,959
right type of threat hands that you are

441
00:15:57,959 --> 00:16:00,120
going to have you need networking

442
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,420
expertise you need endpoint expertise so

443
00:16:03,420 --> 00:16:05,880
you need a right balance and if a person

444
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:08,160
is new to the threat hunting or somebody

445
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,920
who wants to have the have a go in the

446
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:14,579
threat hunting as a career choice you

447
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:17,579
need to be able to have have some weight

448
00:16:17,579 --> 00:16:20,940
or guidance where you can find what

449
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:23,100
skills I need to acquire this is exactly

450
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:26,820
where structure hits uh its home run

451
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:30,360
because the skill Matrix basically gives

452
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:32,040
you this

453
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,260
there are a couple of things a couple of

454
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,000
modules as I mentioned were quite

455
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,360
critical for me to understand and relate

456
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:41,100
it to my experience one of them was like

457
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,560
preparation

458
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,660
uh we are in a Data Business when we

459
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:48,779
talk about security right so we do data

460
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:51,240
analysis all the time we've mentioned

461
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,579
about data Lakes we talked about data

462
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:56,519
analysis but if you do not have data

463
00:16:56,519 --> 00:16:59,160
good data reliable data your output is

464
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,899
going to be crap

465
00:17:00,899 --> 00:17:03,959
so garbage and garbage out you need to

466
00:17:03,959 --> 00:17:07,459
work on your data dictionary data

467
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:10,319
data Lakes clean data Lakes reliable

468
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:12,660
data Lakes to be able to drive good

469
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,720
threat hunting program going forward

470
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:17,520
lab environment we have some scripts

471
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:20,119
that we have launched with the

472
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:22,380
threat hunting framework that will give

473
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,500
you the lab to be hosted on-prem or in

474
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:28,559
the cloud environment so we hope that we

475
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:30,059
can collectively improve that going

476
00:17:30,059 --> 00:17:31,380
forward

477
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,240
important piece and heart of the

478
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:36,179
framework is operational module it's a

479
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:38,640
big complex problem to solve we want to

480
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:41,039
make sure we break it down in smaller

481
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,480
manageable chunks

482
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,020
what exactly it is identifying is

483
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:48,539
you identify a threat and you don't go

484
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:50,700
and start googling what exactly you need

485
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:52,679
to find and start threatening from a

486
00:17:52,679 --> 00:17:55,740
technical point of view identify what

487
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:57,299
problem you are trying to solve what

488
00:17:57,299 --> 00:17:58,620
threats are applicable to your

489
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:00,419
environment what threats are applicable

490
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:02,900
to your organization

491
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:05,880
retail and finance are not going to have

492
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:07,919
the same threads applicable to you so

493
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,140
make sure you filter that choice down

494
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:14,220
out of 1000 make it focus on 15 20 that

495
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:17,640
you need to have get the ttps out based

496
00:18:17,640 --> 00:18:19,740
on what you have from threats that you

497
00:18:19,740 --> 00:18:22,320
have identified make sure you prioritize

498
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,780
them create your backlog and I'm trying

499
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:26,460
to get to the project management side of

500
00:18:26,460 --> 00:18:29,039
this little bit as we spoke highly about

501
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:31,260
it you have to be organized you have to

502
00:18:31,260 --> 00:18:32,940
be able to schedule it properly you have

503
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,559
to assign your skills to the right

504
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,900
people at the right time you need to

505
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:38,400
know about your organizational

506
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,799
dependencies interdependencies in terms

507
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:42,720
of what you can do when Financial

508
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,960
closures be it from the control system

509
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,160
point of view the down turnarounds

510
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,200
everything right so that's critically

511
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,179
important once you do that once you have

512
00:18:54,179 --> 00:18:56,940
those Basics identified you can schedule

513
00:18:56,940 --> 00:18:59,720
and have those technical hunts done

514
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,580
measurement communication we have spoken

515
00:19:02,580 --> 00:19:04,440
about this basically you need to be able

516
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:07,200
to measure your success and communicate

517
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:10,080
your success unless you do that you do

518
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:13,320
not have your organization believing you

519
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:15,480
funding you to continue your threat

520
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:18,780
hunting going forward maturity is where

521
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:23,160
we have tried to provide the Matrix we

522
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:25,559
will which will allow you to do the

523
00:19:25,559 --> 00:19:27,179
assessment of your own maturity level

524
00:19:27,179 --> 00:19:29,760
and also if you want to have a goal

525
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,440
where you want to improve your maturity

526
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,840
how you get there what do you need to

527
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,640
add

528
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:38,940
important piece final note from me is

529
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:41,100
continuous Improvement we have to do

530
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,140
this right we have to improve we have to

531
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:45,840
improve our efficiency and with that I

532
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,780
will make a point that we collectively

533
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:50,640
as a community we need to improve our

534
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:53,400
framework so to take us through the next

535
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,140
stages of improvement of the community

536
00:19:55,140 --> 00:19:56,960
as well as the framework going forward

537
00:19:56,960 --> 00:20:00,059
Neil will take us through that

538
00:20:00,059 --> 00:20:02,460
thanks

539
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:05,100
all right so I mean it's fairly

540
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,539
straightforward

541
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:10,080
this is just the beginning for this when

542
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,340
um

543
00:20:11,340 --> 00:20:13,260
when I started threat hunting I got into

544
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,340
it about

545
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:17,220
eight years ago going out and finding

546
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:19,799
information that that was available to

547
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:21,240
say here's how you get started here's

548
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,440
where you should go look here's some

549
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,900
hypotheses that you should go test out

550
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,240
was really difficult

551
00:20:27,240 --> 00:20:30,120
as as John mentioned earlier when you do

552
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,400
find things they're often like three or

553
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:35,100
four page PDFs that have have you know

554
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,559
some information in it but it's specific

555
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:39,299
to this is how you search for that thing

556
00:20:39,299 --> 00:20:41,880
within this product right and so that

557
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,740
became incredibly frustrating right

558
00:20:43,740 --> 00:20:45,600
where I was like how how am I supposed

559
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,179
to get better at this if if I can't find

560
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:51,500
any information and so as I continue to

561
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:53,880
you know hunt and hunt in different

562
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,400
organizations my role at the time was to

563
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,720
go into some of the largest

564
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,220
organizations in the world and hunt in

565
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,660
their environments or assess their

566
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,280
threat hunting programs

567
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:03,840
and I would go in I would see different

568
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,900
things over and over and over again and

569
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:09,840
I would be like oh that's really cool

570
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,760
um more people should do that but nobody

571
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:14,640
had written it down and just put it on

572
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,919
the internet and so when I got to a

573
00:21:16,919 --> 00:21:19,620
point in my threat hunting Journey

574
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:22,380
um yeah I sound like a hippie uh when I

575
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,120
got when I got to the point in my

576
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:26,100
threatening Journey that I felt like I

577
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:27,960
had enough information that I had

578
00:21:27,960 --> 00:21:30,360
collected from my experience hunting and

579
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,799
all of these organizations around the

580
00:21:31,799 --> 00:21:34,260
world I started to talk about here is

581
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:36,539
the way that I think you should go about

582
00:21:36,539 --> 00:21:38,640
doing this and not only that but here's

583
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,020
what I think you should do when you find

584
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:41,640
these things and the thing that I tried

585
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:45,320
to drive home was write it down right

586
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,380
documentation matters metrics matter

587
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:52,740
they're not the sexiest part of this by

588
00:21:52,740 --> 00:21:54,480
far right but

589
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:58,020
being able to share what you have can be

590
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,400
incredibly valuable to other

591
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,799
organizations

592
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:04,500
we often in this industry have a I think

593
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:06,600
most of us have a fairly deep level of

594
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:08,580
imposter syndrome like we're like at any

595
00:22:08,580 --> 00:22:09,780
moment I'm going to be found out they're

596
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,100
going to know that I don't belong on

597
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:12,299
this stage they're coming to get me

598
00:22:12,299 --> 00:22:14,520
right now right like so

599
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:16,020
but the reality is that there's

600
00:22:16,020 --> 00:22:18,960
something that you know that could keep

601
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,940
another organization from experiencing

602
00:22:20,940 --> 00:22:23,400
either a declared incident or a verified

603
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:24,539
breach

604
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:26,220
and all you have to do is share that

605
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,020
whether that's in the form of a white

606
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:30,240
paper or in the form

607
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:34,740
a conference talk or you know

608
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:37,260
putting together this framework right

609
00:22:37,260 --> 00:22:39,539
when John approached me he was like Hey

610
00:22:39,539 --> 00:22:42,000
I started working on this thing I'd like

611
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,620
to pull a couple of you guys in we're

612
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:45,419
gonna write all this stuff down about

613
00:22:45,419 --> 00:22:48,120
programmatically how do we move a threat

614
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:50,159
hunting program forward from how do you

615
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:51,960
staff it what are the job descriptions

616
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:53,700
that you should list if you're looking

617
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:56,280
to staff uh you know or even just hire a

618
00:22:56,280 --> 00:22:58,080
single threat Hunter right what are the

619
00:22:58,080 --> 00:22:59,760
skills that that individual should have

620
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:01,679
and if you're looking within your sock

621
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:05,700
or cert team where are those folks that

622
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,100
that have the skills that can fit within

623
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:10,080
the Technologies within the bounds of

624
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,700
your organization and where are you

625
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,860
missing visibility without those things

626
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,900
you know you become again incredibly

627
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:19,200
frustrated and so it's time to put our

628
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:21,000
money where our mouth was and write

629
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,000
stuff down and so by the time we're done

630
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,799
here like okay when we're done I'll go

631
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:27,299
to the next slide and you'll see the get

632
00:23:27,299 --> 00:23:29,640
the link to the GitHub that has where

633
00:23:29,640 --> 00:23:31,080
the threat hunting framework and the

634
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,299
information within it resides clearly we

635
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:35,159
didn't just show you pictures of text on

636
00:23:35,159 --> 00:23:36,900
a screen because that's absurd oh wait

637
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:38,580
there's text on the screen but Willy

638
00:23:38,580 --> 00:23:40,140
Wonka is there too

639
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:40,860
um

640
00:23:40,860 --> 00:23:43,860
but it's it's roughly a hundred pages of

641
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,840
what is essentially advice that we have

642
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,940
gleaned over the combined 20 years of

643
00:23:47,940 --> 00:23:49,260
threat hunting experience that we have

644
00:23:49,260 --> 00:23:50,179
together

645
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:52,740
and just saying like this is this is

646
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:54,360
what worked for us this is where we fell

647
00:23:54,360 --> 00:23:56,220
on our face this is

648
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,840
um where you should go if you're trying

649
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,880
to you know improve your program and

650
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,960
we need your help

651
00:24:03,960 --> 00:24:06,419
right this should be and is Community

652
00:24:06,419 --> 00:24:08,460
Driven it's not something that is a

653
00:24:08,460 --> 00:24:10,380
vendor putting out a four-page PDF so

654
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:12,480
they can sell some product down on the

655
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,059
Expo floor probably immediately below us

656
00:24:15,059 --> 00:24:17,700
right so yeah it's happening now people

657
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:19,200
are out there saying like oh to make

658
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:22,559
your threat Huns don't right like so um

659
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:24,780
you know like find the technologies that

660
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:27,600
help enable you to find more actionable

661
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,980
data so that your hunts are more

662
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:31,860
successful what are those Technologies I

663
00:24:31,860 --> 00:24:33,480
don't know okay well let's write that

664
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,700
down and share that with people tell us

665
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:37,440
your successes share with us your

666
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:39,720
successes so we can build this framework

667
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,460
and make it larger and make it better

668
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:44,159
for everybody right it should be and

669
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,159
will be a continuous Evolution right

670
00:24:47,159 --> 00:24:49,260
we're going to this document will be a

671
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,780
living breathing thing and as people say

672
00:24:51,780 --> 00:24:53,580
like yeah but this worked for me better

673
00:24:53,580 --> 00:24:54,960
and that worked for me better oh you're

674
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,580
missing a couple skills on that skills

675
00:24:56,580 --> 00:24:58,620
Matrix that you guys developed why don't

676
00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,820
you go and throw these things in there

677
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:00,960
as well

678
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,580
um it will just get better and better

679
00:25:02,580 --> 00:25:05,159
and the next you know organization or

680
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:07,200
person who comes behind and says I don't

681
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:08,520
know how to get a threat hunting program

682
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:09,900
started or I don't know how to show

683
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:13,020
value to management so that I can you

684
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:15,840
know hire the right people for it or put

685
00:25:15,840 --> 00:25:19,200
the right amount of hours behind it so

686
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:22,500
so please help us right this is vendor

687
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,779
agnostic there is no particular vendor

688
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:26,460
behind this again it was one of the

689
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:28,140
things that kind of like tweaked us the

690
00:25:28,140 --> 00:25:30,419
wrong way so we said everything has some

691
00:25:30,419 --> 00:25:32,340
product tied to it why don't people just

692
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:34,080
share advice without trying to shove

693
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,900
something down your throat

694
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,120
that being said if you have a technology

695
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,679
that works for you and you're like it

696
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:42,299
works in this way or through these use

697
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:44,760
cases and I found that this and this

698
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:47,159
particular platform over here is better

699
00:25:47,159 --> 00:25:49,200
or more successful at this than these

700
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,600
other ones let's get that in there as

701
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:52,559
well

702
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,539
and then of course just tell us what

703
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:57,840
we're missing we are like by no means

704
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,720
the you know uh the end-all be-all of

705
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:01,919
threat hunting we have a lot of

706
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:03,960
experience we've been in some of the

707
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:05,820
largest organizations in the world some

708
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:08,340
of the you know most well-known

709
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,799
organizations and and governments and

710
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,679
you know and looked and evaluated their

711
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:15,539
programs and we're just trying to share

712
00:26:15,539 --> 00:26:18,600
what we learned but please share with us

713
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:21,960
we want to learn from you and now we've

714
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,179
hopefully at least given you a place to

715
00:26:24,179 --> 00:26:26,100
get started where maybe previously you

716
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,480
were like well yeah I have some things

717
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,860
to share but I don't know where to put

718
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,659
that and I'm not going to like spin up

719
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:33,360
some website or like write another white

720
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,159
paper or do whatever if you have three

721
00:26:35,159 --> 00:26:36,720
paragraphs that you think you can share

722
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,539
or you know

723
00:26:38,539 --> 00:26:40,919
120 characters like share that with us

724
00:26:40,919 --> 00:26:43,799
right so so please

725
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:45,960
share your experiences share what works

726
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,760
for you and share what doesn't work

727
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:49,440
because sometimes that's even more

728
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,779
valuable

729
00:26:51,779 --> 00:26:53,640
with that

730
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,340
that's where you can get it actually

731
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,020
hopefully I think I've saved it did you

732
00:26:58,020 --> 00:27:00,960
I think I think it's public but if not

733
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,240
give me five minutes and I'll do it but

734
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:06,799
I'm pretty sure I did all right

735
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:10,980
