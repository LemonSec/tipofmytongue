[Music]

2
00:00:07,400 --> 00:00:10,019
now it's my pleasure to walk into Stage

3
00:00:10,019 --> 00:00:14,240
Tom Hegel and Jax

4
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:18,660
all right

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:20,640
all right hello hello

6
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,680
um thanks for showing up everybody thank

7
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,080
you for coming to hang out my name is

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:29,099
Juanito Jags is fine uh this is my boy

9
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:32,159
Tom Hagel we're over at Sentinel labs in

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:34,860
Sentinel one of

11
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:38,219
McCarran Airport Fame today we're going

12
00:00:38,219 --> 00:00:41,280
to talk about a threat actor we call a

13
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,280
modified elephant

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,480
it's actually

15
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,539
a pretty somber story in a lot of ways

16
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:50,340
we're just trying to kind of highlight

17
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,140
some of the human costs that goes into

18
00:00:54,140 --> 00:00:56,579
some of these operations that you don't

19
00:00:56,579 --> 00:00:57,899
usually hear about right it's all

20
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:00,480
malware and fishing and you know we talk

21
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,300
about infosec but there is very much a

22
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:04,860
human cost Associated to some of these

23
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,439
things and I you know we're gonna

24
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,220
try to delve into some of that so

25
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,540
this all kicks off for us with some

26
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,760
stories and work unrelated to modified

27
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,560
elephant there was a story on Vice by

28
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,600
Andrea fiscutan who's a fantastic

29
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:28,740
journalist out of Romania where

30
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:31,700
she reports on this Turkish journalist

31
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,820
Maris balivan who was essentially framed

32
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:39,540
terrorism and the guys over at Arsenal

33
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,479
Consulting

34
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:43,880
amazing IR company

35
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:46,740
they had done this pro bono work for the

36
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,259
journalists and figured out that malware

37
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:52,200
had been used to implant evidence

38
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,619
um on his machine and then you know he

39
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:58,399
was thrown in prison

40
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:01,259
so we followed up with the Arsenal

41
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:04,079
report at the time and of course

42
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:06,479
the IR work itself is solid like we

43
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:08,160
don't need to do the digital forensic

44
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,800
stuff like those guys have it done they

45
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,500
they did it right but coming from the

46
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,200
threat intelligence side it's actually

47
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,360
much more curious to know

48
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:20,400
are there more operations by these

49
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,020
people if they're willing to do this

50
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,180
kind of like really messed up stuff are

51
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:25,379
they

52
00:02:25,379 --> 00:02:27,360
um what else have they done you know

53
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,580
chances are it's not just somebody who

54
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,860
decided to get into hacking for just

55
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:34,739
that one egregious act

56
00:02:34,739 --> 00:02:36,000
um so from the threat Intel side it

57
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,260
becomes really important for us to sort

58
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,879
of try to track some of the actors and

59
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,080
try to understand what else they're up

60
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:41,220
to

61
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,019
um interestingly you know after all this

62
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:44,940
uh you know all these folks got

63
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,780
acquitted but uh it took years for them

64
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,580
to actually get out of jail and frankly

65
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,319
I'm pretty sure Varys is back in prison

66
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,800
for some totally unrelated thing now but

67
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,660
as we kept tracking it we came on you

68
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,920
know we came across this actor we called

69
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,000
egomaniac it's a reference to uh the

70
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,760
letters egm which appear in a lot of the

71
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,519
new malware that we found sort of like a

72
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:10,860
previously unrelated

73
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:11,879
um

74
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:14,040
malware toolkit that we were able to

75
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,959
connect based on like code similarity

76
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:18,659
and a few other things

77
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:20,940
it gets really interesting because as we

78
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,340
were digging into this actor like if you

79
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,260
saw Kim Sutter this morning I mean she's

80
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,000
a giant

81
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,580
um in our space

82
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:32,099
particularly because like she's not just

83
00:03:32,099 --> 00:03:34,800
regurgitating you know whatever some

84
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:36,540
company sends her or some random report

85
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:38,760
like she's as close as we get to an

86
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:42,000
investigative journalist in in cyber

87
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,560
um and when she started to dig into it

88
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,180
we were talking about the report what

89
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:48,239
she finds is actually a ton of

90
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,000
from the attributory threads that we

91
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,220
pulled based on egomaniac what she finds

92
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,920
is actually connections to

93
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,120
um sort of reinforcing the connections

94
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:59,580
that we found to the Turkish police uh

95
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:00,720
particularly things in the hacking Team

96
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,819
league and so on so we have this sort of

97
00:04:02,819 --> 00:04:04,140
trend of like

98
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:06,720
we're seeing law enforcement abusing

99
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,840
malware to do obviously egregious things

100
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,720
when we finish this investigation we get

101
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,120
a ping from the guys at Arsenal uh Mark

102
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,639
Spencer you know the IR folks uh

103
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:19,440
basically saying hey if you care about

104
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,839
that case like you should check out

105
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,220
what's happening in India we're working

106
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:25,320
something else

107
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,500
yeah so at that point

108
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,180
we begin to look into the secondary case

109
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:33,419
and completely different a different

110
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:35,340
type of story but it strikes the same

111
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:38,460
chord to us where we have a large group

112
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,880
of activists that are potentially being

113
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:44,460
targeted uh with evidence that was

114
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:46,259
planted and they're being used to

115
00:04:46,259 --> 00:04:48,620
they're using that to throw them in jail

116
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:51,479
for terrorism charges and so forth and

117
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:53,160
and this is one of the first articles

118
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,380
from The Washington Post that began to

119
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:59,060
highlight this activity and as that

120
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:02,699
quickly evolved uh more activity began

121
00:05:02,699 --> 00:05:05,120
to be found from our friends at Arsenal

122
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,100
and we start to get an idea of there's

123
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:10,259
actually it's not just a handful of

124
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:12,500
active activists but there's potentially

125
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:15,120
the possibility that there's a larger

126
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,340
campaign at play here that you know as

127
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:19,199
threat researchers really sticks out to

128
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:21,660
us and we really want to begin diving in

129
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:23,160
so

130
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:27,300
thankfully we are uh you know blessed by

131
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,520
the Arsenal team that is able to release

132
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:32,759
the forensic details publicly and

133
00:05:32,759 --> 00:05:34,620
there's a lot of stuff that people have

134
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:36,840
written on it and there's deep dives

135
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,120
into particular pieces but you're

136
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,460
actually able to go right to the website

137
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,139
and download the actual forensic reports

138
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:44,820
that are being used to help the defense

139
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,380
team for these these activists have been

140
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,520
arrested

141
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,880
and the the cases centered around What's

142
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,860
called the bk-16

143
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,240
we'll talk more about the individuals

144
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,940
here in a second but ultimately we have

145
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:59,280
four reports that came from Arsenal that

146
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,740
detailed the forensic evidence of

147
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:03,720
malware that was associated with

148
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:05,360
potential documents that were planted

149
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,520
and those documents then being used as

150
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:10,380
evidence in cases against these

151
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:12,120
individuals

152
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,520
so in these documents we're able to take

153
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:17,220
a look at malware samples those malware

154
00:06:17,220 --> 00:06:19,199
samples can then lead to new sets of

155
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:22,620
infrastructure and as we begin to Deep

156
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:25,380
dive into this through a set of

157
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,419
infrastructure analysis taking a look at

158
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:29,699
all the samples and building our case

159
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:31,500
we're actually able to

160
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,660
lead to what we call the modified

161
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:38,039
elephant apt this is a combination of

162
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:40,380
the entire profile of this actor that we

163
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:44,580
see hitting these bk16 activists and

164
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,440
then leading to a larger campaign that

165
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,020
spans about 10 years

166
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:51,600
pretty shocking considering the the case

167
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:54,479
against these individuals where this

168
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,400
malware that is associated with what we

169
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,919
call modified elephants is being used in

170
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:01,699
cases that is uh you know leading to

171
00:07:01,699 --> 00:07:04,259
forensic evidence of documents that are

172
00:07:04,259 --> 00:07:08,400
fabricated so there's a a very

173
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,280
particular uh

174
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:13,740
I guess threats in our case where the

175
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,319
the actor is really just uh I don't know

176
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:17,699
what would you say like entirely

177
00:07:17,699 --> 00:07:19,979
unscrupulous exactly like

178
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:22,080
um keep in mind like we're obviously we

179
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,300
work a lot of Apt cases it's not that we

180
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,160
are staunchly against intelligence

181
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,900
collection or Espionage or whatever like

182
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,580
we understand that that's sort of a part

183
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:31,020
of things and people have been talking

184
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:33,740
about lawful intercept malware forever

185
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:36,919
but it turns out that if you give

186
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:39,900
capabilities like this with no controls

187
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,660
to law enforcement they don't just use

188
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,580
it for collection yeah

189
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:46,740
yeah it was an interesting set of uh

190
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:48,180
infrastructure as well you know we have

191
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:49,740
about 10 years of activity that we're

192
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:52,199
able to look at and thanks to the the

193
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:54,240
Insight that Arsenal gave us and then

194
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:56,340
widening the intelligence into this

195
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:58,380
actor based on our own Telemetry or in

196
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,020
our own analysis we're able to get a

197
00:08:01,020 --> 00:08:03,259
really interesting historical

198
00:08:03,259 --> 00:08:05,880
understanding of how this actor has

199
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,800
evolved over time

200
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,539
so to take a look at

201
00:08:09,539 --> 00:08:11,880
what they do as an adversary we're going

202
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,440
to kind of highlight some particular

203
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,300
pieces to the how they attack these

204
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,380
individuals and what they've done

205
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:19,319
historically guys hold on to your this

206
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:21,419
is not about to blow you away with

207
00:08:21,419 --> 00:08:23,340
malware which is probably the worst part

208
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:26,400
like yeah the the worst part about this

209
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,160
is the Simplicity and the uh the

210
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:30,900
Simplicity and the unsophistic

211
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,360
unsophistication of it all leading to

212
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,880
some of the most horrific results in my

213
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,200
opinion

214
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,839
but what you're seeing here is one of

215
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,279
the phishing emails from 2013 that uh is

216
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,899
associated with modified elephants and

217
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:48,480
this is just one of many many examples

218
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,360
of how they have attempted initial

219
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,519
access into these uh these activist

220
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:54,779
machines

221
00:08:54,779 --> 00:08:57,899
and this is a brutal example of the

222
00:08:57,899 --> 00:08:59,459
Simplicity here where they are literally

223
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:01,740
emailing an executable file trying to

224
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:03,660
get them to open it they've evolved over

225
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,160
time

226
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:07,800
and this is a timeline of what we've

227
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:09,120
seen them do over the last decade

228
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,279
evolving their their particularly their

229
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,040
fishing techniques so we'll talk about

230
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:16,320
other techniques but looking at fishing

231
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,060
alone you know early days they were

232
00:09:18,060 --> 00:09:19,080
doing just what I just showed you

233
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,820
emailing straight up executables

234
00:09:20,820 --> 00:09:24,240
emailing executables with Dot doc.exe

235
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,560
and then eventually getting to

236
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,240
exploit documents malicious documents

237
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:34,380
that are a bit more fabricated and are

238
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,839
going to compromise a vulnerability on

239
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:38,519
the machine to ultimately lead to

240
00:09:38,519 --> 00:09:40,500
infecting it they go through a couple

241
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:42,360
different iterations of what they do

242
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:47,700
overall but nothing shocking I would say

243
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:50,820
that's the worst part so um just to kind

244
00:09:50,820 --> 00:09:53,160
of really highlight sort of what we mean

245
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,740
by this kind of digital entrapment

246
00:09:55,740 --> 00:10:00,420
um what the Arsenal reports show is not

247
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:03,060
that a machine has malware and has

248
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:05,519
incriminating documents it's literally

249
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,820
being able to track these netwire rat

250
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,940
sessions attacker sessions where they're

251
00:10:11,940 --> 00:10:14,160
connected to the malware in these

252
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,260
machines

253
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:19,500
dropping documents into volumes folders

254
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:21,720
that the

255
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,220
owners of the machines have never

256
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,100
accessed the documents are created with

257
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:28,140
a version of Microsoft Word that they've

258
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:30,000
never had like the different version of

259
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,019
it

260
00:10:31,019 --> 00:10:31,980
um

261
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:36,899
they know as far as the incident reports

262
00:10:36,899 --> 00:10:38,040
um

263
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:40,920
could tell they'd never been opened by

264
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:43,320
anybody there so like it's literally

265
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:46,140
like attacker session just drop docs

266
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:49,320
over time and Bolt

267
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:51,779
so you can see here a list of like a lot

268
00:10:51,779 --> 00:10:55,079
of the letters and look I I would I

269
00:10:55,079 --> 00:10:56,160
would love to come here and tell you

270
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:57,720
like this is the most sophisticated apt

271
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,100
we've ever seen and they do really bad

272
00:10:59,100 --> 00:10:59,940
stuff

273
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:01,620
the banality of this is terrible like

274
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:03,300
netwire rad costs like a hundred bucks

275
00:11:03,300 --> 00:11:05,519
and you could probably just get it for

276
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,260
free at this point

277
00:11:07,260 --> 00:11:09,060
um but intent is a very different

278
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:11,339
situation yeah and one interesting piece

279
00:11:11,339 --> 00:11:13,260
here that's uh Arsenal actually

280
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:14,760
discovered during the forensic reports

281
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,980
was in many of these cases we're seeing

282
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,339
this this actor operating on multiple

283
00:11:20,339 --> 00:11:22,019
victim machines planting similar

284
00:11:22,019 --> 00:11:24,480
evidence within 15 minute time span and

285
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,000
these targets are unrelated individuals

286
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:29,459
so it's a very uh interesting campaign

287
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:31,620
but uh we'll talk about different

288
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:33,060
malware here in a second but yeah

289
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,980
netwire is one of them

290
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:37,140
so actually when we talk about the

291
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:39,300
evidence I mean you can see this is sort

292
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,920
of the main

293
00:11:40,920 --> 00:11:43,140
um the main document there's about 10

294
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:45,360
that they really the prosecution focuses

295
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:48,120
on but the main document is this uh

296
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,720
plain stated uh plot to assassinate

297
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,200
Prime Minister Modi uh about as plainly

298
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,820
as you can think of right like we're

299
00:11:56,820 --> 00:12:00,000
gonna need some m4s and like 400 000

300
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,860
rounds and we you know we're going to

301
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,720
Target his Road shows for an effective

302
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:06,000
stress like it's as plain spoken like

303
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,100
you know let's let's get to killing the

304
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,540
PM

305
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,680
um

306
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,380
the other documents or similarly this

307
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,600
idea that like they're sort of fomentic

308
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,060
domestic chaos like keep in mind look

309
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,920
whatever the politics are going on there

310
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,480
whatever the different groups live that

311
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,339
it's a local context and I'm sure that

312
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:25,019
you can have different opinions about it

313
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:26,459
but at the end of the day like yeah

314
00:12:26,459 --> 00:12:29,600
these guys are activists but

315
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,700
taking you're trying to sort of frame

316
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:35,459
the idea of this sort of uh 15-16

317
00:12:35,459 --> 00:12:39,540
individuals as this destabilizing Force

318
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:41,880
for the entire country

319
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:44,279
um in a series of what like 10 15

320
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:46,560
letters that's what the prosecution

321
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:49,139
focuses on but in the most plain spoken

322
00:12:49,139 --> 00:12:51,600
sort of way so what makes it more

323
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,000
interesting for us is this which is one

324
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,519
again one of the top 10 documents is the

325
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:59,339
last one planted it's literally 11 days

326
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:01,260
before the search and seizure so when

327
00:13:01,260 --> 00:13:03,480
you start talking about some semblance

328
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,880
of attribution

329
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,779
there's no point to putting

330
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:08,339
incriminating documents in a machine

331
00:13:08,339 --> 00:13:11,100
unless somebody shows up to check it so

332
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,019
start to kind of form a very simple

333
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:15,720
picture as we go forward

334
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,779
so of course after that these 16

335
00:13:18,779 --> 00:13:21,060
individuals get thrown in jail

336
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:23,940
as if that's not bad enough now with

337
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,820
covet and everything uh Stan Swami uh

338
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,980
who was a Jesuit human rights activist

339
00:13:28,980 --> 00:13:33,300
actually passed away in jail so

340
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:35,519
yes it's all malware and fishing and

341
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:37,620
whatnot but for us there's a very real

342
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:39,839
human cost and a very clear implication

343
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,839
to what's going on here

344
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:45,540
so some of the uh the planted evidence

345
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,040
that we showed you in some of the

346
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,320
phishing emails will or the uh the

347
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,240
malware and timelines we get a lot is

348
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,579
coming from one one Target in particular

349
00:13:53,579 --> 00:13:56,220
is Rona Wilson and the Arsenal reports

350
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:58,579
tend to focus on him a lot as well but

351
00:13:58,579 --> 00:14:01,260
this this individual sticks out to us

352
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:05,160
because of the amount of activity and

353
00:14:05,160 --> 00:14:06,959
the persistent nature of these attacks

354
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:09,540
against this individual over almost a

355
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:12,720
decade it was shocking even from

356
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,940
somebody that we researched top tier

357
00:14:14,940 --> 00:14:17,700
apts all day it was shocking to see the

358
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,620
persistent level of activity coming from

359
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:21,000
these actors

360
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,459
and looking at all the data for this

361
00:14:23,459 --> 00:14:26,279
individual we get a very unique picture

362
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:29,880
of the motivations and the different

363
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,060
Nexus of actors coming out of India that

364
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:36,120
are targeting this individual so we have

365
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,980
modified elephant obviously that

366
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:39,899
activity with Rona Wilson this

367
00:14:39,899 --> 00:14:42,540
individual you know it goes back 2012

368
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:45,779
plus there's activity that is kind of

369
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:48,720
fuzzy before 2012 but if you're familiar

370
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:51,120
with the Indian threat landscape that's

371
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,639
kind of the a big shift in that in that

372
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:55,800
Arena so it kind of started there and

373
00:14:55,800 --> 00:14:58,019
then you know later on we begin to see

374
00:14:58,019 --> 00:14:59,820
his email accounts being compromised

375
00:14:59,820 --> 00:15:01,920
2018 which we'll talk more about that in

376
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,600
a bit and that all ties back to what we

377
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:06,600
call modified elephant however there's a

378
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,579
complete other subset of activity that

379
00:15:08,579 --> 00:15:10,139
we see targeting this individual during

380
00:15:10,139 --> 00:15:12,300
our analysis that links to another one

381
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:14,279
another apt I'm very familiar with is

382
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:17,579
Sidewinder and uh and then we have other

383
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:19,980
activity that links to what Arsenal

384
00:15:19,980 --> 00:15:23,880
found is a iPhone that was infected from

385
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,699
Ron Wilson by Pegasus you know everyone

386
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:29,040
knows the mobile spyware group on the

387
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,880
private sector side

388
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:35,339
so one other really interesting thing

389
00:15:35,339 --> 00:15:37,560
here talking about the links between

390
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:39,720
modified elephants and all these other

391
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:43,920
this other uh relation of Indian apt

392
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:47,279
activity is the early early side of what

393
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:48,720
we call modified elephant it actually

394
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,740
links

395
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,440
through infrastructure overlap with the

396
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,839
almighty operation hangover report and

397
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:56,220
if you're not familiar with this

398
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:58,260
operation hangover is

399
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:01,320
kind of the turning point for public

400
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:06,060
knowledge on Indian apt activity uh that

401
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,560
this this report wasn't just it was

402
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,540
written in 2013 but it reports on

403
00:16:09,540 --> 00:16:11,579
activity that's that span years prior

404
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:13,500
and it was a big shift because this

405
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:15,480
actually highlighted the relations

406
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,660
between Indian apt activity and what we

407
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:21,300
know as potential contractors one in

408
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:23,220
particular that a lot of this activity

409
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:25,980
stems from going into the future is the

410
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:28,260
app and Security Group out of India

411
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:30,060
and that group in particular you can

412
00:16:30,060 --> 00:16:31,920
kind of think of them as the tree trunk

413
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:34,620
to all all of today's threat activity

414
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,540
coming out of India everything one way

415
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:38,699
or another tends to lead back to them in

416
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:39,959
the case of modified elephant that

417
00:16:39,959 --> 00:16:41,579
turned out true through the use of

418
00:16:41,579 --> 00:16:43,019
infrastructure that was previously

419
00:16:43,019 --> 00:16:46,820
reported in operation hangover

420
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:49,320
so Sidewinder I mentioned I'm intimately

421
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,959
familiar with them they uh they're an

422
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:53,699
Espionage group that tends to focus

423
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:55,380
throughout Asia

424
00:16:55,380 --> 00:16:59,459
and I reported on them last year and my

425
00:16:59,459 --> 00:17:01,920
report here is prior to any insight into

426
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,199
modify elephants at that point and that

427
00:17:04,199 --> 00:17:06,480
report highlights activity that was them

428
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,579
targeting or government organizations

429
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:10,559
and private businesses for Espionage

430
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:13,740
purposes uh throughout Asia so they're

431
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:15,419
well reported the industry is well well

432
00:17:15,419 --> 00:17:17,880
aware of them but they are

433
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,099
kind of more sophisticated in many ways

434
00:17:20,099 --> 00:17:21,299
than what you would think modified

435
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:23,160
elephant is

436
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,179
um so

437
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:25,559
there's an interesting relationship

438
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:27,980
between modified elephant activity and

439
00:17:27,980 --> 00:17:30,540
Sidewinder are they potentially coming

440
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,559
from the same reporting organization

441
00:17:33,559 --> 00:17:35,640
assigned to Target this particular

442
00:17:35,640 --> 00:17:37,679
individual that's where the mystery kind

443
00:17:37,679 --> 00:17:40,020
of begins it's sort of interesting for

444
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,460
us like I know sort of all the names

445
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,260
don't necessarily mean a whole lot to

446
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:45,000
folks are not in the threat until game

447
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,520
but like what makes this interesting to

448
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,380
us is you have this activity that seems

449
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:51,059
to be very related to law enforcement a

450
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:53,640
modified elephant but this Nexus is

451
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:56,100
revolving around Rona Wilson also brings

452
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,860
in another apt that has been known for a

453
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:01,740
long time as doing the kind of like

454
00:18:01,740 --> 00:18:03,600
National Security work that you would

455
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:07,080
expect sort of like Espionage on you

456
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,840
know foreign countries things that are

457
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,900
sort of important to the state so to

458
00:18:12,900 --> 00:18:14,460
have it all kind of revolve around this

459
00:18:14,460 --> 00:18:16,500
person entails a different level of

460
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:19,500
tasking from a larger organization than

461
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,900
just having one sort of Rogue set of

462
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:25,460
actors that have decided to Target him

463
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:28,860
so that relationship can actually be

464
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,299
highlighted in many interesting ways

465
00:18:30,299 --> 00:18:33,419
where there's probably a deeper

466
00:18:33,419 --> 00:18:35,160
you know bond between what we see as

467
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:37,799
modified elephant and Sidewinder overall

468
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:39,840
being that we're lucky enough to have

469
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:42,600
insight into almost a decade of activity

470
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,580
from modified elephants with sprinkles

471
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:47,039
of these other apts we can get pretty

472
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:50,280
interesting timeline here of an overlap

473
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,760
of infrastructure being used to Target

474
00:18:52,760 --> 00:18:55,380
modified elephants typical targets these

475
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:57,059
activists and so forth so what you're

476
00:18:57,059 --> 00:18:59,700
seeing here are the the green domains

477
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,620
there that's infrastructure that's been

478
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:04,559
attributed to Sidewinder activity and

479
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,299
then the blue side we see the

480
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:08,220
infrastructure that we associate with

481
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:10,799
modified elephant and when you compare

482
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,660
them against what's being used to Target

483
00:19:12,660 --> 00:19:14,280
these individuals at the same time we

484
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,660
begin to see a really interesting

485
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:19,260
overlap of kind of tasking in many ways

486
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:22,200
where there's passing back and forth as

487
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:23,640
you can see modified elephant is much

488
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,380
more persistent using them much longer

489
00:19:25,380 --> 00:19:28,020
while Sidewinder was more of a one and

490
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,059
one and burn kind of case let's also be

491
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:32,340
clear that modified elephant is not a

492
00:19:32,340 --> 00:19:34,260
subtle attacker yes like would someone

493
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,760
like Sidewinder who's doing sort of

494
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,620
proper Espionage you might get some sort

495
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:39,539
of of careful curtail and we'll send you

496
00:19:39,539 --> 00:19:41,100
a fishing email we'll wait we'll see

497
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,020
what happens modified element we'll just

498
00:19:43,020 --> 00:19:44,340
keep hitting the same Target over and

499
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:45,660
over like why don't you open this

500
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:48,000
freaking attachment over it's just it's

501
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,220
not subtle it's not amazing yeah it's

502
00:19:50,220 --> 00:19:52,380
just persistent yeah many times within

503
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:54,900
an hour shocking using the same samples

504
00:19:54,900 --> 00:19:57,780
over and over and over reforwarding the

505
00:19:57,780 --> 00:20:00,000
fishing emails that failed months ago

506
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:02,220
interesting

507
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:04,140
so talking about the Pegasus overlap

508
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,360
which I mentioned briefly I want to kind

509
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,700
of explain a little bit around how that

510
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:10,380
kind of ties in here because it's kind

511
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:12,419
of confusing in many ways so we want to

512
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:13,260
make sure you have a good understanding

513
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:14,460
of this but

514
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,679
from our perspective we're not seeing a

515
00:20:16,679 --> 00:20:19,080
direct link between modified elephant

516
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,580
and NSO but that link is done through

517
00:20:23,580 --> 00:20:25,440
what we see coming from the forensic

518
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,820
reports so

519
00:20:26,820 --> 00:20:28,440
it's kind of timeline it here or kind of

520
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:30,720
show you the workflow we have a hard

521
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,000
drive that's recovered uh in the

522
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,039
forensic analysis is done on that and

523
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,799
then there's an iTunes backup of one of

524
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:39,919
Rona Wilson's iPhones

525
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:45,059
2017-2018 and that iPhone 6s has

526
00:20:45,059 --> 00:20:47,340
indicators that it's infected with

527
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,020
Pegasus

528
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:51,419
and that was all identified by by

529
00:20:51,419 --> 00:20:54,539
Arsenal so major kudos to them but again

530
00:20:54,539 --> 00:20:57,720
this really shows the the overarching

531
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,880
tasking being done from The Entity

532
00:20:59,880 --> 00:21:03,539
leading these actors so is it the same

533
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:05,820
organization that's assigning Sidewinder

534
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,500
modified elephant and then also making

535
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:10,500
use of Pegasus to Target these

536
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:12,600
individuals kind of a spray and prayer

537
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:14,940
approach getting as many options as they

538
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:16,320
can to infect these people and track

539
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,000
them it's also important to note that

540
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,039
since we don't know who the operator is

541
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:22,520
for Pegasus in this particular case

542
00:21:22,520 --> 00:21:25,080
there is the question of whether it is

543
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:28,440
modified elephant also having access to

544
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:30,240
Pegasus because we see them attempting

545
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,500
to do

546
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:33,419
um to use mobile malware at some point

547
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:38,159
sort of again crappy Android malware

548
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,720
um and you know that didn't seem to go

549
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,120
too well at the time but after how many

550
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,940
years of successful operations do you

551
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,559
start to get a greater level of support

552
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:48,299
or is there just a completely separate

553
00:21:48,299 --> 00:21:50,760
entity that gets to Pegasus and also

554
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:53,600
cares about this target

555
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,700
on that note this is kind of a timeline

556
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,740
of the techniques that we see associated

557
00:21:58,740 --> 00:22:01,260
with modified elephants and then you

558
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:03,360
know a little bit of a highlight of

559
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,940
where that Pegasus side kind of starts

560
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:08,280
to play here so on the far left hand

561
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:11,299
side early years 2012 and Beyond we see

562
00:22:11,299 --> 00:22:13,740
primarily the initial infection Vector

563
00:22:13,740 --> 00:22:16,799
is leaning towards phishing emails and

564
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,900
that the technique in phishing emails

565
00:22:18,900 --> 00:22:21,000
ultimately has varied throughout the

566
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,860
years but in the beginning they were

567
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:26,580
making use of dark Comet rat to deploy

568
00:22:26,580 --> 00:22:28,740
onto these victim machines for their

569
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,720
collection and you know typical remote

570
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,480
access Trojan activities and then they

571
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:35,640
ultimately ended up relying on net wire

572
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,980
almost completely from a couple years

573
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,380
afterwards but there were a few cases in

574
00:22:40,380 --> 00:22:42,600
there where we saw interesting attempts

575
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:45,179
at trying to deliver probably the most

576
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:46,919
what would you say the most poorly done

577
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:49,320
keylogger and all it's like a Visual

578
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:52,320
Basic garbage key logger yeah

579
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,600
um and like when I say garbage it's not

580
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,520
just the VB aspect of it but it also

581
00:22:56,520 --> 00:22:59,640
like it's it's using email addresses to

582
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,260
like exfiltrate the data like they're

583
00:23:01,260 --> 00:23:02,460
sort of like emailing it to these

584
00:23:02,460 --> 00:23:04,980
accounts uh which ends up being kind of

585
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:08,159
the Crux of some interesting attribution

586
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,320
details that we're sort of going to go

587
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:12,179
into in a little bit yeah those those

588
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:13,740
emails that were being used in the key

589
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:15,000
loggers were actually an interesting

590
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:17,240
pivot point for us on collecting and

591
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,500
clustering the entire modified elephant

592
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:21,960
uh threat actor because those emails

593
00:23:21,960 --> 00:23:25,140
were used across many samples and uh

594
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:27,780
again attribution side as well the

595
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,419
interesting part is later on in their

596
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:32,640
lifespan going into today we obviously

597
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:35,220
see the mobile side with the the Pegasus

598
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:37,200
and that's where we think they tend they

599
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,600
are tending to lean nowadays but

600
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,220
understanding of that is a little bit

601
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:43,559
more fuzzy as we go into modern days of

602
00:23:43,559 --> 00:23:45,720
who they're potentially targeting but

603
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,640
then we have the email takeover side

604
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,559
which gets in a little bit more

605
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:52,320
confusing area so we have during these

606
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,100
campaigns activity that is associated

607
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,440
with these individuals having their

608
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,780
email accounts compromised through the

609
00:24:00,780 --> 00:24:03,299
public uh free email Services Gmail

610
00:24:03,299 --> 00:24:05,940
Yahoo and so forth and and those

611
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:09,419
accounts ultimately being used to do

612
00:24:09,419 --> 00:24:10,919
more malicious activity which we'll talk

613
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:13,140
about here in a second

614
00:24:13,140 --> 00:24:16,020
so this is where things get even more

615
00:24:16,020 --> 00:24:17,760
interesting right so

616
00:24:17,760 --> 00:24:19,620
um Andy Greenberg over at wired hits us

617
00:24:19,620 --> 00:24:22,679
up when we hit accepted for this talk

618
00:24:22,679 --> 00:24:23,880
um and he's like hey man the story

619
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,260
sounds fascinated would love to follow

620
00:24:25,260 --> 00:24:26,340
up

621
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:28,020
um we started talking we sort of started

622
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:30,480
going through uh some of we what we had

623
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,039
found and some of what we had found that

624
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:33,840
we couldn't necessarily talk about in

625
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,220
the report

626
00:24:35,220 --> 00:24:37,020
um because you know there's a fair

627
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,400
amount of data sharing that happens in

628
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,020
the industry as we try to go after bad

629
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,780
guys and um you know you have to respect

630
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:45,120
TLP you have to respect you know where

631
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:47,400
data is coming from and so on

632
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,539
um and we were under certain

633
00:24:48,539 --> 00:24:49,919
restrictions of what we could and

634
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:51,600
couldn't publish but there was a sort of

635
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:55,500
interesting uh set of data there uh it

636
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:59,640
wasn't ours but it came from

637
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:02,460
a source that will remain nameless

638
00:25:02,460 --> 00:25:05,520
because of their own request but someone

639
00:25:05,520 --> 00:25:07,679
incredibly Brave incredibly brilliant

640
00:25:07,679 --> 00:25:10,919
who was willing to go the extra mile uh

641
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:13,020
just to do what they consider to be the

642
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,880
right thing

643
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,520
um this person actually spoke directly

644
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:20,280
um with Andy it turns out this is not

645
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,020
like a whistleblower situation it turns

646
00:25:22,020 --> 00:25:25,080
out that if you do appeal uh to lawyers

647
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,240
that have a conscience at a service

648
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,480
provider they're not all soulless and

649
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,580
you do get some folks who are concerned

650
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,779
about human rights are concerned about

651
00:25:33,779 --> 00:25:35,340
sort of doing the right thing and they

652
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:38,220
were actually you know the way that our

653
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,260
friend uh put it is that they're tired

654
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:42,900
of you know watching burn and

655
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,460
that's a situation that we tend to be in

656
00:25:44,460 --> 00:25:45,539
a lot

657
00:25:45,539 --> 00:25:47,279
um in threat intelligence where you know

658
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,260
terrible things are happening and you

659
00:25:49,260 --> 00:25:50,580
know you just kind of watch it go down

660
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:51,779
because you don't have access to doing

661
00:25:51,779 --> 00:25:55,440
more so in this particular case uh the

662
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:58,200
company was willing to provide the data

663
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:01,679
and it makes for a much more interesting

664
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:02,880
story

665
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,679
yeah so

666
00:26:04,679 --> 00:26:06,539
to understand a little bit the wired

667
00:26:06,539 --> 00:26:08,640
article goes into great detail here and

668
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:12,000
this is to try and summarize kind of how

669
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:14,159
this link is done and and what you'll

670
00:26:14,159 --> 00:26:16,039
find that wired article is linking

671
00:26:16,039 --> 00:26:19,679
modified elephants ultimately to a

672
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,279
particular police individ or Pune of

673
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:25,679
India Police individual

674
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:29,400
and the process of how we got that data

675
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,620
obviously is we want to keep it or who

676
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:33,240
we got that from is a little bit more

677
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,580
sensitive however that data can then be

678
00:26:35,580 --> 00:26:37,980
used and verified to link make this link

679
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:41,159
and so this is kind of a summary of how

680
00:26:41,159 --> 00:26:43,500
wired and Andy was able to use it other

681
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:45,960
individuals in particular uh you know we

682
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:47,820
have John Scott Railton from AMC

683
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:50,299
International and uh

684
00:26:50,299 --> 00:26:53,700
citizen lab sorry jsr from citizen lab

685
00:26:53,700 --> 00:26:57,059
and stations from niso's just to kind of

686
00:26:57,059 --> 00:26:58,919
like look attribution is complicated

687
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:00,840
attribution is hard I've written on it

688
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,760
before I'm not sort of sidestepping that

689
00:27:02,760 --> 00:27:05,460
but in the process of Andy doing his

690
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:08,880
homework uh they handed the indicators

691
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,580
alone with no context to two different

692
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,900
researchers at totally different

693
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:14,580
companies without telling them what this

694
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:16,919
is about and said hey who can you link

695
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:19,200
this with how has this been used can you

696
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,299
sort of verify and this is what they

697
00:27:21,299 --> 00:27:23,700
came up with it's not sort of what we

698
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:27,360
alone uh were pushing so focusing on the

699
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:29,460
victims first to kind of summarize this

700
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:31,200
what we have is during these email

701
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,419
account compromises we have a couple

702
00:27:33,419 --> 00:27:35,520
interesting things happening first is

703
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:38,279
when modified elephants compromises

704
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:40,740
these email accounts we see a recovery

705
00:27:40,740 --> 00:27:42,600
email address being added to those

706
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,799
accounts and then we also begin to see

707
00:27:46,799 --> 00:27:48,480
a particular phone number being added to

708
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:49,740
these accounts as well

709
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:52,440
ultimately this kind of signal I would

710
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,120
say signals the

711
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,700
our expectation of modify elephant

712
00:27:56,700 --> 00:27:59,940
historically and the lack of operational

713
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:02,520
security the lack of

714
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:05,520
um savviness exactly

715
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,559
it was a pretty egregious sort of

716
00:28:07,559 --> 00:28:10,140
mistake in a variety of ways yeah but

717
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:12,419
presumably they wanted to make sure that

718
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:14,520
they could just get access again if they

719
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,039
ever you know lost access so in this

720
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:18,539
case you know we have three accounts

721
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:20,340
that are compromised and then that

722
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:22,980
ultimately leads to those accounts being

723
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:25,140
accessed through the same infrastructure

724
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,299
that we're seeing modify elephants

725
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:28,980
associated with through their attacks

726
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:32,580
and their long-term C2 setup and and so

727
00:28:32,580 --> 00:28:33,600
forth

728
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,460
and then those accounts that are already

729
00:28:35,460 --> 00:28:38,640
compromised are then later being used to

730
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,200
fish other individuals that are of

731
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:42,360
targets to modified elephants as well

732
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:44,820
and a fascinating approach to an attack

733
00:28:44,820 --> 00:28:47,279
technique is pretending to be this these

734
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,720
other individuals that may have more

735
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:51,179
trust or may have some relevance to

736
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:53,100
additional targets and that ultimately

737
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,840
leads to additional targeting throughout

738
00:28:54,840 --> 00:28:59,279
this set of the bk16 activists in India

739
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:02,820
that were we referenced at the beginning

740
00:29:02,820 --> 00:29:04,500
so we have the victims that are all

741
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:06,659
compromised at this point but what about

742
00:29:06,659 --> 00:29:09,299
the attacker how does modified elephant

743
00:29:09,299 --> 00:29:12,240
link to the Pune police of India

744
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:14,640
so we have the email address and thanks

745
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:16,380
to those two individuals from from the

746
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,880
wired article we had the email address

747
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,760
that was associated with through leaked

748
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:22,980
databases in particular we have the

749
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:25,500
Truecaller database the the app that's

750
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:27,419
used to identify individuals that you

751
00:29:27,419 --> 00:29:29,039
can install on your phone the India

752
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:30,559
version of that was leaked a while back

753
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:32,640
that particular email address is

754
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,440
associated with the the same individual

755
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,360
that his name's actually using the email

756
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,799
address so we have some more confidence

757
00:29:37,799 --> 00:29:39,600
there that it is actually his

758
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,600
and then we have that phone number also

759
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,539
linking to archived websites actual

760
00:29:45,539 --> 00:29:48,720
police websites that reference this is

761
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:51,000
the individual and this is his personal

762
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,640
email or his email address uh on an

763
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,440
official government website so the case

764
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:57,779
was pretty solid at that point and that

765
00:29:57,779 --> 00:30:00,600
alone was shocking however jsr from

766
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,580
citizen lab took it a step further John

767
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:05,340
Scott Railton in his life his simple

768
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:07,440
genius decided to just put the phone

769
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:10,860
number in WhatsApp and it turns out that

770
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,659
this up to the time of our investigation

771
00:30:12,659 --> 00:30:15,059
this same person is still using the same

772
00:30:15,059 --> 00:30:17,340
phone number with its you know this

773
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:19,559
picture his name everything sort of put

774
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:21,419
in there yeah

775
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:24,899
pretty shocking see at least

776
00:30:24,899 --> 00:30:27,840
so the the part where this kind of gets

777
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:30,539
more concerning is fine we can you know

778
00:30:30,539 --> 00:30:32,760
we can say this is like this idiotic not

779
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:37,080
very good but you know very malicious

780
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,419
threat actors out there but like hey you

781
00:30:39,419 --> 00:30:40,440
know if you don't go clicking on

782
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:41,940
phishing emails maybe you're not so bad

783
00:30:41,940 --> 00:30:43,620
but in reality what we're seeing is an

784
00:30:43,620 --> 00:30:45,480
evolution of their tactics

785
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,039
um in a way that's very concerning

786
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,559
because you have you already have sort

787
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:52,140
of this NSO Pegasus tie-in which we all

788
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,820
know the visibility into what's

789
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:57,059
happening with Pegasus is horrible like

790
00:30:57,059 --> 00:31:00,179
you take it up with apple but it's

791
00:31:00,179 --> 00:31:02,039
absolutely ridiculous that like all we

792
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:03,600
get is just

793
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,279
um whack-a-mole with exploits and

794
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:06,720
there's no visibility into what's

795
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:08,460
happening with the actual malware nobody

796
00:31:08,460 --> 00:31:10,679
knows if you know any of our phones are

797
00:31:10,679 --> 00:31:12,539
infected I don't know what to tell you

798
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:14,100
like we can all sit and stare at this

799
00:31:14,100 --> 00:31:15,240
thing and I don't know what we're going

800
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,159
to do about it reboot it um yeah just

801
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:19,380
reboot it uh and then

802
00:31:19,380 --> 00:31:21,779
at the same time what we also get as we

803
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:23,039
talk to some of these service providers

804
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,140
is an understanding that it's not that

805
00:31:25,140 --> 00:31:26,940
they've stopped fishing it's that

806
00:31:26,940 --> 00:31:29,760
they're now hijacking sessions and doing

807
00:31:29,760 --> 00:31:32,520
things directly on cloud accounts for

808
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,220
the for these folks and a much wider set

809
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,200
of folks and that's part of the biggest

810
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,179
concern for us like look Arsenal did a

811
00:31:39,179 --> 00:31:41,220
fantastic job pro bono those you know

812
00:31:41,220 --> 00:31:43,020
those guys are amazing

813
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:44,820
um and we hope that it continues to help

814
00:31:44,820 --> 00:31:47,279
the defense team but

815
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:49,200
these actors have been around for 10

816
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,059
years what else have they done what

817
00:31:51,059 --> 00:31:52,740
other people have ended up in prison

818
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:54,480
over like digital evidence that nobody

819
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:56,399
knew had just been placed on their

820
00:31:56,399 --> 00:31:59,039
machines so the idea that it's just this

821
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,480
one case

822
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:03,000
it only begins to scratch the surface

823
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,679
there are more victims there are more

824
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:06,059
people being targeted there are more

825
00:32:06,059 --> 00:32:07,980
people being surveilled

826
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:09,779
um and there's a lot of suspicious stuff

827
00:32:09,779 --> 00:32:11,880
happening around several cases not just

828
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,940
vk16 so our biggest concern now is yes

829
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,740
it was easier to track them earlier on

830
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:18,779
what do you do when they're just

831
00:32:18,779 --> 00:32:20,460
operating in the cloud like a lot of

832
00:32:20,460 --> 00:32:22,919
these things start to put the onus on

833
00:32:22,919 --> 00:32:25,799
the service providers and the truth is

834
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:27,720
that while there are some that are

835
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:29,520
amazing and willing to do the right

836
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,679
thing there's a lot that don't seem to

837
00:32:31,679 --> 00:32:34,080
really give a damn

838
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:36,740
so

839
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:40,140
as a part of that there's actually a lot

840
00:32:40,140 --> 00:32:42,000
of missing forensic artifacts if you go

841
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,100
pay attention to the Arsenal reporting

842
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,260
they're working on the official forensic

843
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,820
images that are being used in court that

844
00:32:47,820 --> 00:32:49,860
law enforcement provided they've only

845
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:53,159
provided them for a small subset of the

846
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:57,000
the folks that are in jail and there's

847
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,700
still a lot missing we God knows what

848
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:01,020
else you would find in some of these

849
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:03,419
things but at this time it's not they

850
00:33:03,419 --> 00:33:04,980
haven't been provided so far we hope

851
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,899
that the legal defense team gets you

852
00:33:06,899 --> 00:33:08,460
know gets their hands on these things

853
00:33:08,460 --> 00:33:10,440
and we can continue to you know sort of

854
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,320
bolster our understanding but if we

855
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:15,299
start to zoom out a little bit I think

856
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:17,940
what we want to discuss is it's not just

857
00:33:17,940 --> 00:33:19,799
this very particular case in India with

858
00:33:19,799 --> 00:33:21,299
these very particular folks in this very

859
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:23,519
particular threat actor but rather the

860
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:24,779
issues that come when it comes to

861
00:33:24,779 --> 00:33:26,640
digital evidence this is something that

862
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:28,860
nobody really wants to talk about right

863
00:33:28,860 --> 00:33:30,299
like it's hard enough to get the right

864
00:33:30,299 --> 00:33:31,980
evidence and make a case and take

865
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:34,019
someone to court and then hope that you

866
00:33:34,019 --> 00:33:36,720
can prosecute them assuming that they've

867
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:39,240
done something wrong

868
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:40,679
but

869
00:33:40,679 --> 00:33:43,019
keep in mind that in the last two cases

870
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:46,740
the only thing that helps these folks

871
00:33:46,740 --> 00:33:50,220
is a company out of Boston with a very

872
00:33:50,220 --> 00:33:52,620
good heart willing to do pro bono work

873
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:55,620
for them there is no aspect of that of

874
00:33:55,620 --> 00:33:58,019
these different court systems wherein

875
00:33:58,019 --> 00:34:00,179
introducing digital evidence entails

876
00:34:00,179 --> 00:34:02,240
some kind of independent verification

877
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:06,120
and actually having to go through and

878
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,620
supervise the Integrity of devices

879
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:10,199
that's the other part that like I really

880
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,520
want to emphasize when we have

881
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:13,560
conversations about lawful intercept

882
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,000
malware

883
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:18,300
what is what does it mean to find

884
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,040
evidence to present evidence to have

885
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,839
forensic chain of custody when a device

886
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:24,239
has been compromised and you know it's

887
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,099
been compromised because you compromised

888
00:34:26,099 --> 00:34:28,560
it so there are some questions there

889
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:30,719
where like look maybe we're in Western

890
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:33,179
countries and we have a you know we're a

891
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:34,560
little more comfortable with our court

892
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:36,960
systems and our government

893
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:38,580
depending on how you want to take that

894
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:42,659
but this is an issue worldwide and as

895
00:34:42,659 --> 00:34:44,460
you can see even when it's forensically

896
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:47,159
proven that doesn't mean that you get to

897
00:34:47,159 --> 00:34:49,379
go home

898
00:34:49,379 --> 00:34:51,300
talking about the digital evidence part

899
00:34:51,300 --> 00:34:53,040
and again sort of in a broader

900
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,320
perspective looking at the situation

901
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,480
like what happened in Turkey more

902
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:59,040
recently there's been these all these

903
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,660
ergonacon trials it's a really

904
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:02,520
complicated story about sort of internal

905
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:04,920
Turkish politics but one part of it

906
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:07,440
centers around a messaging app called

907
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,780
bylock and

908
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:12,000
what makes the case sort of interesting

909
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:14,820
is they they crack down on this

910
00:35:14,820 --> 00:35:17,400
Smartphone messaging app saying that

911
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,320
like it's being used to plan a coup and

912
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,240
that it's like for people who are

913
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,859
against the government whatever so they

914
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:25,680
cracked out on the app and then use the

915
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:28,200
fact that like if you have this app then

916
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,520
you're plotting against the government

917
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,560
you're going to jail and they throw I

918
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:34,440
think several thousand people in prison

919
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:36,960
where it all goes wrong is it turns out

920
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,060
that they base that on like has your

921
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:41,820
phone ever contacted these IPS and the

922
00:35:41,820 --> 00:35:46,079
IPS are not necessarily that specific

923
00:35:46,079 --> 00:35:48,420
and more importantly there's like

924
00:35:48,420 --> 00:35:50,660
certain ads that would have meant that

925
00:35:50,660 --> 00:35:52,560
your phone

926
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,540
totally unsuspecting had touched those

927
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:56,640
IPS at some point

928
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,680
So eventually you get a bunch of people

929
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:01,200
acquitted but like

930
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:03,839
it's absolutely ridiculous that this is

931
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,420
an evidentiary standard anywhere that

932
00:36:06,420 --> 00:36:08,339
your phone ever touched an IP period

933
00:36:08,339 --> 00:36:10,920
like it's ridiculous but some of these

934
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:14,280
are really patently bad cases what is

935
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:16,560
flying sort of below the threshold of

936
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,619
what calls these things into question

937
00:36:19,619 --> 00:36:21,839
the real Point here is like this isn't

938
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:24,900
sort of this free willing freewheeling

939
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:27,359
like hipified idea of like no one should

940
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:28,859
use malware no government should hack

941
00:36:28,859 --> 00:36:30,960
anyone but actually we want to draw a

942
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,700
distinction between what does it mean

943
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,460
for you to use malware for intelligence

944
00:36:35,460 --> 00:36:37,079
collection in the context of

945
00:36:37,079 --> 00:36:39,780
intelligence organizations versus doing

946
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,060
it for law enforcement and I think

947
00:36:42,060 --> 00:36:44,579
that's a very important question for us

948
00:36:44,579 --> 00:36:47,160
to figure out because the the two are

949
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:49,560
not the same they don't have the same

950
00:36:49,560 --> 00:36:51,540
evidentiary standards they don't have

951
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:53,820
the same metrics for Success it's why

952
00:36:53,820 --> 00:36:57,420
talking to I don't know FBI and NSA are

953
00:36:57,420 --> 00:36:59,339
very different experiences right so one

954
00:36:59,339 --> 00:37:00,720
of them is trying to understand things

955
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,000
the other one has to bolster doj and

956
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:04,200
making cases

957
00:37:04,200 --> 00:37:07,079
you very different motivations so what

958
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:09,180
we want to start to do is at least push

959
00:37:09,180 --> 00:37:12,180
this notion of like what is the standard

960
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,640
for lawful intercept malware when it's

961
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:17,820
being done for law enforcement and why

962
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,619
should that have I don't know upload

963
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:22,200
capabilities who oversees the use of

964
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:24,480
these things by police as opposed to

965
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,460
intelligence agencies and why isn't

966
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:28,079
there more oversight I mean technically

967
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,300
if it's for law enforcement it isn't

968
00:37:30,300 --> 00:37:32,339
necessarily

969
00:37:32,339 --> 00:37:34,079
quite under the same standards of

970
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:36,000
secrecy as the intelligence Community I

971
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,320
know that that's an oversimplification

972
00:37:37,320 --> 00:37:40,440
in some cases but

973
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,420
at the end of the day the thing to

974
00:37:42,420 --> 00:37:43,859
highlight and it's a it's something that

975
00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:46,500
touches close to home is that the real

976
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:49,619
issue here is not malware it's actually

977
00:37:49,619 --> 00:37:51,599
the importance of social institutions

978
00:37:51,599 --> 00:37:53,940
you're talking about activists being

979
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:56,640
targeted but more importantly the media

980
00:37:56,640 --> 00:37:59,339
is largely terrified to touch this topic

981
00:37:59,339 --> 00:38:00,780
because journalists have been getting

982
00:38:00,780 --> 00:38:03,240
thrown in prison as well

983
00:38:03,240 --> 00:38:06,420
the judges keep passing up the case

984
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,859
because they don't want to be the ones

985
00:38:07,859 --> 00:38:11,099
ruling on it so if you can't if the

986
00:38:11,099 --> 00:38:12,540
courts are not going to be able to

987
00:38:12,540 --> 00:38:14,760
uphold any kind of standard and the

988
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:15,660
journalists are not going to be able to

989
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,940
uphold any kind of standard it does not

990
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:20,220
matter that it has been forensically

991
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:22,560
proven and put in plain sight and

992
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:26,099
verified by multiple companies that

993
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:28,740
these people did nothing more than just

994
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,800
cross the wrong folks

995
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,780
so with that I think we might have

996
00:38:33,780 --> 00:38:36,660
actually kept a minute if people want to

997
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,579
ask questions

998
00:38:37,579 --> 00:38:42,359
but absolutely I can't thank our source

999
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:44,520
enough I can't thank Arsenal Consulting

1000
00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:46,579
enough these people are doing God's work

1001
00:38:46,579 --> 00:38:49,320
I know before the question even comes up

1002
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,420
a lot of people keep asking us who this

1003
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:54,839
cop is we're not just trying to be spicy

1004
00:38:54,839 --> 00:38:57,060
and withholding that we think it's

1005
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,240
really important that the legal defense

1006
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,000
team gets to get that data directly from

1007
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,460
the service providers and use it in

1008
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:07,980
court to try to help these individuals

1009
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:10,260
rather than us have a particularly

1010
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:14,220
spicier talk yeah so with that thank you

1011
