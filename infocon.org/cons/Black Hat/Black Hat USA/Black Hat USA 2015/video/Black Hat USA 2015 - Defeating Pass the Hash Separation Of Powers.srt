1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,950
you're currently inside Mandalay Bay EF
and you are here for defending past the

2
00:00:05,950 --> 00:00:12,780
hash with seven more and Murray said I
thank you and please put your phone's on

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:21,180
vibrate nobody's ringtone is cool thanks
guys

4
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:25,890
good morning we're here to talk about
mitigation surpassed the hash which are

5
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:32,780
in Windows 10 so passed the house is
really a term which congress applied to

6
00:00:32,780 --> 00:00:37,649
multiple attacks all of which encompass
credential fashion which is at the heart

7
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:42,540
of many high profile attacks had a
couple of years ago we had us'

8
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,120
newspapers such as The Wall Street
Journal New York Times were breached

9
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,038
just last year I believe Sony Pictures
right around the release of the

10
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,120
interview the movie they had a big time
reach lots of lots of data dumped out

11
00:00:56,120 --> 00:01:01,250
they didn't want external and then kind
of my personal favorite just because

12
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:05,110
it's kind of a movie heist is the carbon
at group indian guys made off with a

13
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:11,789
billion dollars by deeply infiltrating
bank networking computers and

14
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:15,759
essentially setting up time dropped at
ATM machines and they would just walk

15
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:16,390
out

16
00:01:16,390 --> 00:01:19,970
make a small withdrawal and actually
walk off with hundreds of dollars

17
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:26,869
instead of $20 so all of these attacks
use a feature that nobody really wants

18
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:31,900
to live without their OS that is single
sign-on so single sign-on is effectively

19
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:37,180
delegating to the operating system the
capability to act as you on the network

20
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:41,950
to access resources no one wants to log
onto the computer and then type your

21
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:45,759
password every time the access a file
share internet site something like that

22
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,880
they just want those things to happen
and that means the computer connectors

23
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:56,280
you and that means attackers like this
or to Pilates heists steal those things

24
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,970
still credentials off the device to act
is here so what does

25
00:02:00,970 --> 00:02:06,250
past the hash or credentials have to
look like in Windows so poor start

26
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:09,180
talking about it we need to talk a
little bit about what this architecture

27
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:15,710
looks like in on Windows in this example
we show Alice and her laptop there's

28
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:20,160
something called else asked which is the
Local Security Authority subsystem else

29
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,420
asked and it hosts all the
authentication protocols and does a lot

30
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:30,359
of security stuff in Windows in here you
can see it's hosting in TLM and Kerberos

31
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:37,970
the two most commonly used protocols on
demands so inside the logic inside the

32
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:43,570
memory else asked for these protocols we
contain things which are still double by

33
00:02:43,570 --> 00:02:48,450
the attacker so an admin level attacker
can read into memory on the device that

34
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:54,089
he wants to which means he can read your
in TLM hash or we call it here in teow s

35
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:58,470
kind of a mouthful he'll still that and
be able to authenticate his you using

36
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:02,740
NTLM the attacker can steal your ticket
draining ticket key out of Kerberos

37
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:08,300
which means he can act as you using the
Kerberos protocol and if your user like

38
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:11,500
Alice in this example is using a
password

39
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,780
the attacker concealer that password
still it out of memory or just social

40
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:23,390
engineer or fish house so once the
attacker has one or multiple of these

41
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:30,059
credentials they take he's in replay
them forming a sort of chain reaction to

42
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,200
the chain reaction starts with one
system a foothold system and it could

43
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:41,089
just be something like a front desk PC
that an administrator uses and the

44
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:44,930
administrator get social engineered or
something on Facebook downloads and

45
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:51,950
malware and and their pop their own it
happens that often back user is admin on

46
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:56,470
their PC which means the attacker the
malware can now harvest the credentials

47
00:03:56,470 --> 00:04:00,090
out of Alsace once the attacker does
this

48
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:04,010
they can move to another system once
they're on that system they attempt to

49
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:08,230
gain more credentials if there's
administrator access and then they go to

50
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:11,190
more systems and where systems gathering
more and more credentials and till

51
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:17,010
you're doomed right they they've they've
deeply infiltrating your network is kind

52
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:22,740
of a big deal so multiple technologies
exist today to make prudential theft

53
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:27,570
more difficult so one of these
multi-factor off which means you you

54
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:31,180
can't just steal when prudential in
order to completely take over someone's

55
00:04:31,180 --> 00:04:34,190
identity you have to have to steal
multiple things such as their cell

56
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,719
phones and a password

57
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:41,100
there's something we call strong
credentials which really needs key based

58
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:45,669
credentials for a key a private key is
in hardware such as with a smart card or

59
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:53,020
a Fito hearing these the attacker cannot
steal the private key software attack

60
00:04:53,020 --> 00:04:57,680
and another solution to the problem
which kinda takes a different tack is

61
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:02,449
called token binding which is the
concept of credentials are tokens which

62
00:05:02,449 --> 00:05:06,860
are downloaded to the device as a part
of authentication are then bound to that

63
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:11,539
device cryptographically so that even if
the attacker steals them they can't

64
00:05:11,539 --> 00:05:16,219
replace them they can only be used on
the original device so we have some cool

65
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:22,250
technology and its well-known but we
can't always deploy it because

66
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:26,740
businesses like to make money it's it's
what they do and the corollary to that

67
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,780
is they don't want to spend more money
than they have to so businesses have

68
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:35,460
lots of legacy components like a printer
or a file server that only talks in TLM

69
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:41,008
and the businesses don't see a big
return on replacing those so

70
00:05:41,009 --> 00:05:46,449
these devices use legacy protocols and
these legacy protocols are vulnerable to

71
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:53,509
attacks such as past the hash so our
challenge here is defending against

72
00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:57,719
these attacks on legacy protocols
without requiring a lot of training in

73
00:05:57,719 --> 00:06:03,860
these devices which requires keeping
secrets which already talked about in

74
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:05,550
Christchurch

75
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:10,469
morning Caroline my name is going to say
that I am one of the leads in situations

76
00:06:10,469 --> 00:06:16,889
team and we know spanned by some group
decision is about keeping secrets and

77
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:22,169
remaining product is keeping secret is
not very difficult actually let me share

78
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:28,139
a story too long long time ago perhaps
they could exceed far far away and

79
00:06:28,139 --> 00:06:32,639
improved told me to get ready for a big
motor company share information

80
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:39,619
disclosure though he doesn't share the
exact time I am so tired country stood

81
00:06:39,619 --> 00:06:40,729
catch them off guard

82
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:46,580
one of the general security she knew the
details she could prepare his army much

83
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:51,899
finished goods repaired a tactic
spirited queue size of two teams

84
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:57,479
everything's so he insisted on knowing
the details he kept asking the Emperor

85
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:03,990
kept asking asking asking you one day
and told him to his presence he said

86
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:11,399
come close tell me do you know how to
keep a secret jail got excited said yes

87
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:13,879
I do know how to keep a secret

88
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:16,180
members found it so the white

89
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:22,120
implying just be me lol so keeping
secret is easy in fact all you have to

90
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,590
do is just keep your mouth shut by did
nothing productive either of course the

91
00:07:27,590 --> 00:07:31,429
Emperor was issued a sick received his
generals so they can prepare better

92
00:07:31,430 --> 00:07:35,470
generalize right and you'll of course
want to be able to share your secrets

93
00:07:35,470 --> 00:07:40,930
said maybe to return email with your
accountant doctor just keeping secrets

94
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:47,389
to yourself is not the solution so you
need to be productive long gone are the

95
00:07:47,389 --> 00:07:53,680
days of emperors individuals who can
make all kinds of decisions

96
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,190
oversight or No Deal accountability
other governments today Dave balance

97
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:04,430
powers to ensure accountability and
parental

98
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:12,120
the way they achieved by separating
powers first legislative day make laws

99
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:19,389
they may decide the highway from this
city that city which lanes and just kind

100
00:08:19,389 --> 00:08:26,000
of quality executive branch carries out
the tasks they hired contractors to

101
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,080
build a high-wage they make sure that
the quality is there and just judicial

102
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:36,088
system make sure everyone is playing by
the rules even though the justice system

103
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:41,089
even the executive branch for instance
they've made dramatic wish to build a

104
00:08:41,089 --> 00:08:45,890
highway is to pass off the highways
going true tribal dance or two national

105
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,100
parks or they made

106
00:08:48,100 --> 00:08:53,970
punished executive branch is down not
awarding the contracts charity it is

107
00:08:53,970 --> 00:08:57,819
reasonable to think all the modern
operating system as a modern government

108
00:08:57,819 --> 00:09:06,509
in this case administrators for power
stage and decide who / AP Egyptians

109
00:09:06,509 --> 00:09:13,959
authorization kernel system services
drivers Rd executive power they allocate

110
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:19,359
memory they create processes threats
they allocate see if you called us and

111
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:24,550
they just perform those tasks arguably
the biggest difference of modern

112
00:09:24,550 --> 00:09:29,819
operating systems he trusted computing
base which combines the operating system

113
00:09:29,819 --> 00:09:34,079
from being a jungle make sure that
everyone is playing by the rules

114
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:41,550
Edmonds and turn opens with it if you go
to assume the kernel which includes a

115
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:47,969
TCB you would be taking a huge risk for
118 staters humans and humans make

116
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:56,009
mistakes you made it really curious
about an email to watc and you hate to

117
00:09:56,009 --> 00:10:01,470
see those cast by these two double click
on that and you shouldn't i mission is

118
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:08,089
compromised we don't want that also who
say administrators can be trusted at all

119
00:10:08,089 --> 00:10:17,069
times they cannot be humans can play tf2
gaming channels you know cheating point

120
00:10:17,069 --> 00:10:18,390
of view all

121
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:24,100
software licensing or think of month in
scenarios hussein's these administrator

122
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,580
is the only administrator on the system
did he not be the case that may be

123
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:32,910
operating the street to street certain
secured expectations and who says this

124
00:10:32,910 --> 00:10:38,750
system is the only system on this hot
day maybe virtual machines which

125
00:10:38,750 --> 00:10:46,010
certainly security expectations so it
was being equal to TCB his logo journal

126
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:52,660
on our hands one may argue is just so
fair and just like humans they don't

127
00:10:52,660 --> 00:11:00,890
make mistakes maybe but is a Tax Service
and the typical operating system

128
00:11:00,890 --> 00:11:05,280
hundreds if not thousands of system
calls and I'll tourists there's a huge

129
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:10,870
attack surface and most operating
systems journal is shared between August

130
00:11:10,870 --> 00:11:16,350
and told party drivers and you start by
two drivers may come from companies had

131
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:21,470
questionable security policies this is
not a new problem

132
00:11:21,470 --> 00:11:25,800
Microsoft Windows tried to solve this is
the best one of them is attached to

133
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:32,270
court or in principle we are putting in
a petition often attends cheated

134
00:11:32,270 --> 00:11:37,750
identity on the line I just Microsoft
Microsoft scientists piece of court and

135
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:41,250
I trust is key dates

136
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:44,880
well in theory but in practice

137
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:49,400
strongly situation off publishes buying
certificate authorities is questionable

138
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:56,709
at best and if one of them makes a
mistake to certificate is slow and hard

139
00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:03,520
process so this can be the ultimate
solution for ticket process sleepy or

140
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:09,470
product process like people to do the
same we noticed a big no salen in

141
00:12:09,470 --> 00:12:13,720
principle protect certain user more
processes says the processes from the

142
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:18,940
rest of the user mode including the
engineer if it means stated choice to

143
00:12:18,940 --> 00:12:25,620
access for instance a CSS process by
injecting tracks it has blocked the

144
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:32,080
kernel or if she tries to read memory
right memory just block the problem is

145
00:12:32,080 --> 00:12:37,940
it all boils down to colonel and he just
so join those cannot be the source of

146
00:12:37,940 --> 00:12:43,560
truth because of its attack surface of
its complexity that God was designed to

147
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:50,920
protect Colonel Charles it limits what
Kermode can do in kernel however it is

148
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,780
risk-based and your brain too choppy to
hackers

149
00:12:54,780 --> 00:13:04,000
dates not feel safe for them or doesn't
protect drivers from other drivers which

150
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:08,680
I am proud of the state agencies are
designed and developed by PeopleSmart

151
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:13,459
today these are good technology spot
they all head of fundamental flaw they

152
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:20,520
rely on software we should do our
security on something harder something

153
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:29,740
for her let's take a quick locates hard
and long distance on x86 and x64 systems

154
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:37,860
they headed a single spaced Journal ran
a min 00 had access to end I additional

155
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:45,980
200 space so if you get code execution
colonel it means stands you have D

156
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:49,930
D with a hypervisor

157
00:13:49,930 --> 00:13:55,569
another section made it just similar
story inspired is nothing time winding

158
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:59,880
stairs and nothing to do with the Rings
it's it's brought it down for its also

159
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:07,350
known as minus one its promises on
hardware and all the difference from

160
00:14:07,350 --> 00:14:12,930
earnings that it is very small very very
very small therefore it is much easier

161
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:19,609
to protect and it is so much easier to
secure Darfur hypervisor and show me

162
00:14:19,610 --> 00:14:27,130
that small simple space can be our true
trusted computing base now we heard

163
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:33,390
place to store our secrets but says I'm
ancient the only goal is not starting to

164
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:39,560
secrets also being able to process them
to do something with those so we need

165
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:43,530
extra cords to make something
encouraging secrets

166
00:14:43,530 --> 00:14:47,810
the province keep in mind that coating
hypervisor we are back to square one

167
00:14:47,810 --> 00:14:54,189
hypervisor gets more complex it is more
difficult to secure and it is coming a

168
00:14:54,190 --> 00:15:02,380
jungle so we don't want that carry yours
hypervisor technology want not pollute

169
00:15:02,380 --> 00:15:09,000
hypervisor let me introduce virtual
trust levels using virtualization

170
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,500
technology and six others translation
sections of memory can be protected in a

171
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:21,930
just getting fishin just virtual to
physical which can lead to a system

172
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:28,380
physical that way I love of memory it is
access protected from the Rizal to

173
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:34,060
system with the ground case of
hypervisor and from their busiest the

174
00:15:34,060 --> 00:15:38,529
architecture behave today bring three
user mode on the top

175
00:15:38,529 --> 00:15:47,410
which is less access 2003 space which
has more pillage I need to buy them is

176
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:53,509
the IP wiser and Amir Johnson computing
base that's called his detailed 0

177
00:15:53,509 --> 00:15:59,839
instead of growing vertically norwegen
Grove rising forty we have all the

178
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:07,040
information security video 1 isolates
itself sleep to leave from the rest of

179
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:13,009
the system by default the rest of the
system including 20 cannot access media

180
00:16:13,009 --> 00:16:19,939
15 you 2012 he may decide to share
called on to shared data patients all

181

the future

182
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:35,109
extended but the school to use to you
just love exactly let's take a deeper

183
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:41,350
look this is our normal girls today we
have transplanting process is making

184
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:47,879
calls into kernel for executive branch
support and hypervisor keeping everyone

185
00:16:47,879 --> 00:16:56,329
in line between gel 19 V Pro Bowls tanks
we have received your username and

186
00:16:56,329 --> 00:17:03,180
secure tunnel secured and unsecured user
behave trench just like a normal user

187
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:09,639
those threats running processes call to
+ lets those trust let's still depend on

188
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:14,360
secured kernel for certain things
creating trash other teaching memory for

189
00:17:14,359 --> 00:17:19,329
instance secure channel in turn alliance

190
00:17:19,329 --> 00:17:24,480
at the moment colonel I will explain the
interaction in the next lane but really

191
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:29,450
hard trying to use a lot of calls to
make the situation as accurate as much a

192
00:17:29,450 --> 00:17:37,620
small as possible and user roles normal
growth can talk to secure user using RPC

193
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:45,879
secure all is invisible it is not a new
education and you will see there's no UI

194
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,690
no user interaction

195
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:53,200
it has minimal impact on performance we
are expecting in fact less than 2% of

196
00:17:53,200 --> 00:18:00,600
heat in most cases it has much tighter
control there's not going to be any

197
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,549
third party called into secret journal
it's going to be all operating system

198
00:18:04,549 --> 00:18:10,629
trustees are isolated from each other so
even if one of the trustees scared all

199
00:18:10,630 --> 00:18:17,159
it's not going to be able to inject the
trust will be limited in number they

200
00:18:17,159 --> 00:18:22,120
will be purpose-built and they will be
much smaller than for it is easier to

201
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:30,309
protect it's easier to secure a dismal
into saying security is smaller the

202
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:35,029
catchphrase serious could use if there's
no security perhaps because your heart

203
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:39,750
doesn't support it translates can run as
normal process

204
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:47,630
Security Alliance and lightens normals
roles and tools for meetings scheduled

205
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:53,519
range also former management and
synchronization could use however there

206
00:18:53,519 --> 00:18:59,059
are certain things state secret journal
thats make sure the institutional stays

207
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:04,960
secure for instance contributing / are
including the pages before dad being

208
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,010
paid out by

209
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:15,580
and toes is among those tasks detailed 0
is not trust it's important to

210
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:16,629
understand

211
00:19:16,630 --> 00:19:24,940
30 doesn't mean security anymore in this
new world retail 0 is not trusted secure

212
00:19:24,940 --> 00:19:30,350
colonel while he is depending on 07 does
its job

213
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:36,899
hardening against the system called
senator Mounties

214
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:46,340
secure is important and it is not in
concrete hypervisor depends on where and

215
00:19:46,340 --> 00:19:52,760
I'll 464 is still part of the trusted
computing base just small

216
00:19:52,760 --> 00:20:00,410
1800 of course any signs of Sophia can
have box inject into he's presenting

217
00:20:00,410 --> 00:20:05,710
later this afternoon about the
implications of firmware political tease

218
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:12,780
I really encouraged to attend a
presentation at home so bottom line is

219
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:20,389
secure vault is secure all the integrity
of Holt ECB is maintained so I have to

220
00:20:20,390 --> 00:20:25,540
of course one of them is called our
partners we are in this game together

221
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:30,220
like so and he tell his partner

222
00:20:30,220 --> 00:20:34,179
providing valuable tools green shoes or
stools

223
00:20:34,179 --> 00:20:38,799
engage with us and police catch the
security vulnerabilities in bios and

224
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:44,850
other people other apostles to favored
time in a timely fashion and cold to our

225
00:20:44,850 --> 00:20:45,639
customers

226
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:52,049
it is very important to keep the
firmware and BIOS updates in Windows

227
00:20:52,049 --> 00:21:01,210
stand windows updates can make sure your
system is secure our Emperor as a way to

228
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:05,480
start of cigarettes and also too
intelligent to process them as my dear

229
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:14,500
friend said we'll explain thanks so when
I'm gonna talk about here is how we can

230
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:18,940
use this new architecture using the
hypervisor is a new essentially lowering

231
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:24,840
to secure a legacy protocols before we
can really dive into the architecture of

232
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:29,389
what we've built here need to talk about
a couple of Primaris the first one is

233
00:21:29,390 --> 00:21:34,740
down critical string not all credentials
are created equal so it some potential

234
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:40,870
such as passwords or naive cookies are
extremely weak because they can be very

235
00:21:40,870 --> 00:21:45,840
easily stolen cookies are stolen out of
browser cache users are fished for the

236
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,320
passwords are key lobbed very easily to
me credentials are a problem

237
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,200
strong credentials are credentials that
we consider theft resistant such as a

238
00:21:55,200 --> 00:22:00,940
smart card smart card requires physical
staffed tried to steal the card

239
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:06,789
two-factor authentication is also not
necessarily as strong but strong and

240
00:22:06,789 --> 00:22:12,460
this leads to a loss is accepted into
which is users with me credentials they

241
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:18,409
get out they they get finished their
passwords leaked yet still in bad things

242
00:22:18,409 --> 00:22:23,690
happen so we need to start with strong
credentials that said

243
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:27,220
I also feel it's important to talk a
little bit about how we do smart card

244
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:31,899
off in Windows Windows users Kerberos
standard protocol for porting smart card

245
00:22:31,899 --> 00:22:36,129
authentication Kerberos of course the
three headed dogs it's a three legged

246
00:22:36,129 --> 00:22:40,709
authentication protocol you have your
user and this case Alice with her smart

247
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:45,600
card at KDC distribution center that's
what you authenticate to authenticating

248
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:50,100
property and then some service you want
access network which is the files over

249
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:54,840
to the first thing that happens is
alexander's ARP in the smart card is

250
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:59,139
used to do some proof of possession of a
key that proof is presented as an

251
00:22:59,139 --> 00:23:04,570
authenticator to the KTC who hands back
a ticket printing ticket for TGT and the

252
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:10,279
key associated with that TTT so that he
needs to be used with the TGT

253
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:17,149
when Alice wants to access the file the
TGT is presented to the ATC in the KTC

254
00:23:17,149 --> 00:23:22,678
replies with a service ticket and a key
internet service ticket is used to go

255
00:23:22,679 --> 00:23:27,399
get the files so already we can see one
thing that is going to be interesting to

256
00:23:27,399 --> 00:23:33,039
attackers to steal and that is the TGT
he says if an attacker has a key there

257
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:37,129
you for a time-bound about a time but I
believe it's seven days by default in

258
00:23:37,129 --> 00:23:42,350
Windows it's it's days of time which is
plenty but there's more interesting

259
00:23:42,350 --> 00:23:47,570
stuff to steal whenever you get a
service ticket in Windows you're into

260
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:54,860
UWS NTLM authentication hash is returned
as well and that was done years ago I

261
00:23:54,860 --> 00:23:59,840
believe in 2002 support backwards
compatibility with Intel and shares

262
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:04,070
because nobody even then could give up
there in tellin so now we've we've

263
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:09,629
talked about two things in this diagram
better vulnerable to theft so how do we

264
00:24:09,629 --> 00:24:14,039
protect those things well this is sort
of a zoomed in version of the

265
00:24:14,039 --> 00:24:18,950
architecture bias was talking about
earlier but we have the attacker

266
00:24:18,950 --> 00:24:24,630
you can see that he is unable to access
memory and I UMCOR secure world and

267
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:29,660
normal world he's got free rein we're
assuming he's an administrator and it's

268
00:24:29,660 --> 00:24:33,300
also important to note that all devices
are in normal world there's no device

269
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:35,169
i/o in the secure World

270
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:41,360
everything there sits on top of the
hypervisor so when the New World things

271
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,830
look similar to the old world alsace
continues to run it continues to be

272
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:50,879
vulnerable it runs inside of normal
world and the vast majority of political

273
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:57,060
logic is inside of Alsace so I buffer
manipulation things like that

274
00:24:57,060 --> 00:25:02,240
what is new is prudential guard or
credit card for short it's a new process

275
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:07,750
that runs inside of the secure
environment it's very very small and it

276
00:25:07,750 --> 00:25:13,570
contains protocol support logic so
anything the protocol needs to do with a

277
00:25:13,570 --> 00:25:20,189
secret such as you're into your WF for a
curb risky that always happens inside a

278
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:26,850
credential guard that secret is never in
Alsace in the NL SAS uses the protocol

279
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:33,030
support logic but hardly see all the
secrets are only ever in the clear in

280
00:25:33,030 --> 00:25:38,440
credit card they may exist in an
encrypted format in normal world so

281
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:41,300
we're assuming the attacker can still be
encrypted Wednesday its strong

282
00:25:41,300 --> 00:25:47,790
encryption 256 bit AES those secrets may
be passed back into credential garden

283
00:25:47,790 --> 00:25:53,420
used where there in a decrypted form the
attacker here cannot access them so it's

284
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:58,490
just a little bit more and look at the
specific artists artifacts to protect so

285
00:25:58,490 --> 00:26:03,230
in the old world prix windows 10 all
these artifacts just satin memory

286
00:26:03,230 --> 00:26:09,240
waiting for someone to run many cats or
something and come out in the New World

287
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:14,040
the only ever exist in the clear in
credit card and they're protected from

288
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:19,820
sniffing so that's a pretty good first
start but it's not quite enough to

289
00:26:19,820 --> 00:26:26,399
really mitigate attacks as noted earlier
in the prior slide devices are

290
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:27,770
accessible in normal world

291
00:26:27,770 --> 00:26:32,330
this includes your USB bus which means
if you're using for example a smart card

292
00:26:32,330 --> 00:26:37,830
an attacker can sniff your smart card
and key target then use that smart card

293
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:42,480
to start the entire authentication
process go get a TGT service ticket they

294
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,690
can play the whole game so you're still
here still owned this point so we need

295
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:52,780
something to prevent this avenue of
attack in the way we do it is by

296
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:59,040
building a promise that the secrets are
isolated since the attacker historical

297
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:03,550
access to your cred they can still pass
the hash so we need to guarantee the

298
00:27:03,550 --> 00:27:07,490
isolation is actually happening but it's
not an attacker using your smart card

299
00:27:07,490 --> 00:27:15,690
and so the solution here is actually an
existing IETF standard RFC 6113 its

300
00:27:15,690 --> 00:27:21,140
astoundingly good bedtime reading if you
can't get to sleep in existing standards

301
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:26,000
we implemented I believe in 2012 are too
it's it's out there in the field and it

302
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,860
provides something called compound
authentication so with compound

303
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:34,379
authentication you combine the user's
credential with the machine credential

304
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:40,450
in order to build proof of where the
user is authenticated trunk and so with

305
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:45,020
this proof we can build the promise that
the artifacts that are returned to the

306
00:27:45,020 --> 00:27:51,430
client from the KTC remain hidden so the
first thing we need to do to leverage

307
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:56,840
compound authentication is start with
strong machine credentials so machines

308
00:27:56,840 --> 00:28:01,649
in Active Directory domain have
credentials just like a user they sign

309
00:28:01,650 --> 00:28:07,530
on to the domain prior to 2012 are to
the only credential machine can use was

310
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:11,960
a password is a high entropy strong
passwords not to generate a couple but

311
00:28:11,960 --> 00:28:16,270
it was still stored on the device it
could be east slope ran it could be

312
00:28:16,270 --> 00:28:22,410
gathered off the hard disk not very
strong so we need to do is use a private

313
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:27,560
key which is owned inside of credential
guard in that way represent attacked her

314
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:30,360
access to the key

315
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:34,760
so by combining this stronger machine
authentication with a strong potential

316
00:28:34,760 --> 00:28:40,910
with compounding which is provided by
Kerberos fast and 2012 are to that level

317
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:46,810
of functionality we can apply what we
call an authentication policy which

318
00:28:46,810 --> 00:28:51,169
dictates which systems a user is
actually allowed to authenticate from

319
00:28:51,170 --> 00:28:57,600
let's talk a little bit more about
exactly how this compound authentication

320
00:28:57,600 --> 00:29:03,679
works so first we start with the machine
ninety key the machines logs onto the

321
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:07,880
demand just like user gets a TGT and PGT
key with that

322
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:14,500
credential from the machine TGT key we
now derive what we call in our murky

323
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:19,170
it's really sort of proof of origin key
that says yes I'm coming trauma system

324
00:29:19,170 --> 00:29:26,820
which has access to this machine TGT so
our user credentials combined with the

325
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:32,429
proof of origin in order to authenticate
and using this we get beat EDT for the

326
00:29:32,430 --> 00:29:37,880
year so only by starting with a strong
team credential combining losers off

327
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:43,000
with that stronger machine off can we
get the TGT the policy is checked at the

328
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:48,440
domain controller side since the
attacker has no access to the machine I

329
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:53,170
D not even normal access to the ski
there's no way for the attacker

330
00:29:53,170 --> 00:30:00,330
even start this chain to get a DDT so
the path we have here to get to a strong

331
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:05,790
user involved users using only strong
credentials the systems need to be

332
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:09,139
secured and the systems need to be
provisioned with the machine key not a

333
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:14,740
password passwords are just too easily
stolen and then authentication policies

334
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:17,640
need to be set up on the domain
controller because that is where we

335
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:21,630
really do the gatekeeping and prevent
these steal artifacts these possible

336
00:30:21,630 --> 00:30:27,380
hashes and keys from being returned to
the device for the first question was

337
00:30:27,380 --> 00:30:30,520
everybody asks is why I'm just gonna
turn it off its on the client right

338
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,990
thing so it

339
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:39,210
what makes it a little more than just
client trickery so let's quickly so an

340
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:46,710
attacker has taken over alice's laptop
now has an N and has found a way to

341
00:30:46,710 --> 00:30:47,550
disable

342
00:30:47,550 --> 00:30:53,360
protections and that's bad news right
but if you notice the machine identity

343
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:57,949
he also goes away when credential bart
goes away because the only thing that

344
00:30:57,950 --> 00:31:03,590
can use that key is credentials so now
when alice is credentials are used to

345
00:31:03,590 --> 00:31:08,350
request a TGT from the domain controller
the domain controllers going to check

346
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:12,809
the policy see that there is no proof of
origin there's no armor on that request

347
00:31:12,809 --> 00:31:21,309
in say no no way I'm not gonna give you
what you want so that said we have a

348
00:31:21,309 --> 00:31:34,950
demo so what we have here is a couple of
clients are running care and so alice is

349
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:40,250
a user on this domain with a smart card
and we need to set alice's password

350
00:31:40,250 --> 00:31:50,860
password idea someone yell loud

351
00:31:50,860 --> 00:31:54,049
password 123

352
00:31:54,049 --> 00:31:59,610
that's an awesome password every go so
well said her password if I can't type

353
00:31:59,610 --> 00:32:06,199
correctly right now we're going to go on
to the clients and he's many cats and

354
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:10,559
tried to steal the hash for the password
so first let's go to the system the

355
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:15,790
system has no this one does not have
credentials are disabled so i'm gona

356
00:32:15,790 --> 00:32:30,200
login here with the virtual smart card
and while that's all that was cool and

357
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:33,660
I've got a second system here with
Prudential buried on cuz I like T rex is

358
00:32:33,660 --> 00:32:40,150
better and I'm gonna log on there too as
Alice so it takes a little while to log

359
00:32:40,150 --> 00:32:44,740
on when I searched rehydrate the PM's
but now you can see alice is a desktop

360
00:32:44,740 --> 00:32:49,460
we have performed a complete dance with
the domain controller I now have a TGT

361
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:55,020
and the into WS is on this device and as
you can tell by the dreadful looking

362
00:32:55,020 --> 00:33:02,340
wallpaper it's easily stolen so I'm
gonna go be a bad guy and still the

363
00:33:02,340 --> 00:33:09,699
password I can take

364
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:16,330
so the first thing we need to do is see
what alice's hash looks like so I just

365
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:21,379
got a little talk here that will dump
the Indy for the password the entire WS

366
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:23,190
so here we go

367
00:33:23,190 --> 00:33:28,480
89 F d remember the first word that's
good enough

368
00:33:28,480 --> 00:33:44,140
around rusty old many cats and see if we
can find out

369
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:50,900
so let's see it should be at the top

370
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:55,270
wow

371
00:33:55,270 --> 00:34:02,670
so here we go a 950 that sounds correct
as it so Alice you got popped you're

372
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:06,730
you're done so that's no good she should
know better because the skull and

373
00:34:06,730 --> 00:34:21,230
crossbones so forget this system which
is not running critical guard currently

374
00:34:21,230 --> 00:34:26,290
is not actually supported in the RTM
build in the initial build of Windows on

375
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:34,070
GM's we have some private that's here to
make things work so let's let's login

376
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:38,419
over here let's be Alice again except
this time when the secure system and so

377
00:34:38,418 --> 00:34:53,469
let's go maybe cats and we'll see what
comes out of jealousy memory

378
00:34:53,469 --> 00:34:58,779
that's logging on so you may have
noticed that alice is still not in a

379
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:03,160
good position 'cause alice is able to
log onto the skull and crossbones system

380
00:35:03,160 --> 00:35:09,509
right she still very very open to attack
so how do we prevent that from happening

381
00:35:09,510 --> 00:35:19,119
what we need to do is use authentication
policies so the authentication

382
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:25,330
authentication policy set up with
Prudential guard enabled so what you do

383
00:35:25,330 --> 00:35:32,569
with that policy is applied to specific
user in this case Alice to Alice's has

384
00:35:32,570 --> 00:35:38,080
this policy applied to her and this
policy says down below that alice is

385
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:43,109
only allowed to log on trial i
unenrolled machine so she can only login

386
00:35:43,109 --> 00:35:46,069
from machines which have credit card

387
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:56,210
those are the ones we trust so once I
enable this policy now can no longer

388
00:35:56,210 --> 00:36:10,480
live on the global system

389
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:15,060
so what's happening let's go back over
here this is the awesome system is that

390
00:36:15,060 --> 00:36:20,810
it has potential guard running so we can
tell credential guard is running because

391
00:36:20,810 --> 00:36:35,509
it actually shows up right here in task
manager

392
00:36:35,510 --> 00:36:42,510
right here we go running a little bit
memory waiting for you to authenticate

393
00:36:42,510 --> 00:36:54,320
producer guards running slips that
stands out now

394
00:36:54,320 --> 00:37:11,890
security and once again but now you can
see where one engage just to build off

395
00:37:11,890 --> 00:37:18,089
of the head of many catches get out from
a few days ago you can see that many

396
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:24,790
cats now recognizes that gosh this is an
encrypted hash opal you could see it as

397
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:31,600
a happy ending many cats so I'm gonna
ignore that tastes like I ignore most of

398
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:35,870
them and say hey look there's no house
share but many cats recognizes that

399
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:42,670
there something encrypted here that is
very resistant to attack so now I've

400
00:37:42,670 --> 00:38:01,650
applied that policy now so we can go
back to the first system so she is not

401
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:05,330
actually authorized to log on from let's
see what happens

402
00:38:05,330 --> 00:38:11,830
oh no I i can assume this hopefully you
can see it it says your account is

403
00:38:11,830 --> 00:38:15,970
configured to prevent you from using
this computer that's what we want this

404
00:38:15,970 --> 00:38:18,080
computer is vulnerable to attack

405
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:22,790
we want to block Alice from using his
computer and so what has happened is the

406
00:38:22,790 --> 00:38:27,460
domain controller has actually not send
any possible hash to this device and it

407
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:32,570
hasn't sent any Kerberos keys that can
be stolen device at most what the

408
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:38,309
attacker house is my pin which is 1234
the best plan ever

409
00:38:38,309 --> 00:38:42,109
and access to using that smart card on
this device but it's not really usable

410
00:38:42,109 --> 00:38:52,170
to log on from this device so that all
said I did show you the group where

411
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:56,170
we're doing a little bit of a call it
cooking show magic broken open the other

412
00:38:56,170 --> 00:39:01,089
hand pulled something out there is cake
the machines are in groups which is kind

413
00:39:01,089 --> 00:39:06,339
of weak so the way we want people to
actually use this is by enrolling

414
00:39:06,339 --> 00:39:12,979
machines with a certificate and
certificate and he's to contain a

415
00:39:12,979 --> 00:39:20,640
specific weighed so as a Windows 10

416
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:25,189
sir trek toward the built-in tool now
has the capability to enroll the machine

417
00:39:25,189 --> 00:39:29,969
with a certificate and key so what
happens is an RSA 2048 bit key is

418
00:39:29,969 --> 00:39:35,259
generated and then a Certificate Signing
Request is made and the device gets a

419
00:39:35,259 --> 00:39:39,569
certificate that it uses to authenticate
in this certificate contains an oil did

420
00:39:39,569 --> 00:39:44,469
and then we mapped out a way to the
group so the proof really comes not from

421
00:39:44,469 --> 00:39:47,719
the machine itself that you just trust
this machine and you know it's

422
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:52,819
configured right the proof comes from
only credential guard on that machine as

423
00:39:52,819 --> 00:39:57,259
the certificate enrolled and it is the
only thing that is able to actually get

424
00:39:57,259 --> 00:40:00,529
back toward it's it's it's the only
thing that can get that is the only

425
00:40:00,529 --> 00:40:09,199
thing that needs the authentication
policy and allows Alice to log on

426
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:13,900
that wraps up the demo so I want to
reiterate

427
00:40:13,900 --> 00:40:19,100
we have designated steps to mitigating
many known attacks such as writing me

428
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:23,420
capture or maybe made a splitter
something on a system and as we go over

429
00:40:23,420 --> 00:40:27,120
really quickly what these steps are the
first thing you gotta do is get rid of

430
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:31,880
terrible protocols like Emma strategy to
an Intel Mb one those are really the

431
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:36,380
same protocol but they're the terrible
they basically just blast year intel and

432
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:42,780
hash on the network with really poor
encryption at 8:57 it does or something

433
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:47,990
equivalent does it's very weak users
need to use strong credentials smart

434
00:40:47,990 --> 00:40:52,160
cards are good for chill smart cards are
good as well

435
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:56,290
devices need to support I am and of
course there are hardware requirements

436
00:40:56,290 --> 00:41:01,040
which we have documented Windows 10
support needs to be enabled the

437
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,340
credential Guard searched everything
needs to be enrolled all the

438
00:41:04,340 --> 00:41:10,700
documentation for the setup I demoed
here is online definitely I was hoping

439
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:13,549
to be online for black and it's not
there yet but you'll be able to find it

440
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:19,650
at microsoft.com / heheh and from there
you can download the documents and set

441
00:41:19,650 --> 00:41:24,930
this up yourself and it's ready to be
tested in RTM now when does 10 download

442
00:41:24,930 --> 00:41:31,100
it right up my little time for questions
before we get to that I went to give

443
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:36,350
thanks to some folks when is the
Microsoft TSN team lot of smart girl

444
00:41:36,350 --> 00:41:41,230
dies lot of smart hypervisor guys every
manager dudes worked really hard to make

445
00:41:41,230 --> 00:41:44,880
this platform and credentialed are just
something that we developed on top of it

446
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:52,450
and I'd like to think he'll be offered
many cats he was super helpful and even

447
00:41:52,450 --> 00:41:57,009
updated many cats when Windows 10 moods
and things around in memory so that it

448
00:41:57,010 --> 00:42:02,620
it actually recognizes as you can tell
the demo that we've got isolation on her

449
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:12,310
critics and on so thanks to those guys

450
00:42:12,310 --> 00:42:22,619
questions we have a microscope to shout

451
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:34,150
yes if you have a TPM

452
00:42:34,150 --> 00:42:37,880
the guidance is you really need a TPM
and if you've got it

453
00:42:37,880 --> 00:42:45,769
the route encryption key for secrets for
trust let's is bound inside a repeat the

454
00:42:45,769 --> 00:42:46,410
question

455
00:42:46,410 --> 00:42:50,029
oh I'm sorry to hear that he was asking
how do we prevent someone from just

456
00:42:50,029 --> 00:42:54,480
stealing the secret such as the machine
he offered advice and if you have a TV

457
00:42:54,480 --> 00:43:15,840
and we will we will use TPM to bind to
the device

458
00:43:15,840 --> 00:43:19,860
he says he understands that the keys
themselves 40 p.m. are actually stored

459
00:43:19,860 --> 00:43:25,690
on the disk and identity p.m. mighty
p.m. food is not super strong that I

460
00:43:25,690 --> 00:43:31,110
think you're right but what's on the
disc itself is actually encrypted so you

461
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:34,610
have to import the keys off the disc
into the TPN and you get a handle that

462
00:43:34,610 --> 00:43:40,150
key in and that's what you use so even
if you steal that the long-term storage

463
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:55,810
of the keys to the Jeep keys off the
discs they are encrypted that it is is

464
00:43:55,810 --> 00:44:00,890
it as credit card and every building
windows it's on enterprise builds in

465
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:06,710
education builds I know and I believe
all server builds the documentation

466
00:44:06,710 --> 00:44:20,510
trusted when it's always like more than
me I don't throw rocks at me as I can

467
00:44:20,510 --> 00:44:30,430
the question is if there's going to be
any sport or service scenarios yes

468
00:44:30,430 --> 00:44:36,669
there's going to be it is planned

469
00:44:36,670 --> 00:44:39,790
that's obvious I'm currently for
credentialed art it's it's primarily a

470
00:44:39,790 --> 00:44:55,320
client-focused mitigation so that's
awesome question you may need to be

471
00:44:55,320 --> 00:45:03,020
updated we do rely on features in 2012
are too so yes you do need to be new and

472
00:45:03,020 --> 00:45:08,850
that's newer than what many customers
are unfortunately it doesn't have to be

473
00:45:08,850 --> 00:45:18,529
when does it end though

474
00:45:18,530 --> 00:45:53,090
you're doing here it's going to be a
survey of these questions

475
00:45:53,090 --> 00:46:07,110
Microsoft's that's a good question I
don't know we we rely on certificate

476
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:13,100
templates which is a Microsoft isn't as
far as I understand but I am Not sure if

477
00:46:13,100 --> 00:46:26,319
you if you want to catch me later I can
follow up and find out for you

478
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:44,509
yes the question is since all this
depends on hard ground turmeric and

479
00:46:44,509 --> 00:46:49,569
since her various physical assault there
how much issues we can get from his

480
00:46:49,569 --> 00:46:54,239
entire system that's a good question

481
00:46:54,239 --> 00:47:00,410
responses to that rough time he might
resign from there is much smaller and

482
00:47:00,410 --> 00:47:07,440
easier to protect users to secure the
attack surface is incomparably smaller

483
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:12,609
than anything else but the true a cities
at the end of the day it will have on

484
00:47:12,609 --> 00:47:19,959
the movies and the system must do its
job to make sure that they are doing

485
00:47:19,959 --> 00:47:24,649
proper testing proper security assurance
before releasing and often do they

486
00:47:24,650 --> 00:47:29,940
should keep maintaining farmers in our
customers must install the updates as

487
00:47:29,940 --> 00:47:31,049
soon as possible

488
00:47:31,049 --> 00:47:35,449
agenda good businesses in 10 staff
windows update will keep you secure

489
00:47:35,449 --> 00:47:46,230
automatically I think we have time for
maybe one or two more questions

490
00:47:46,230 --> 00:47:54,950
the question is will it work on VMware
to require hyper-v I don't think so I

491
00:47:54,950 --> 00:48:10,368
don't know I'm sure buyers are
hypervisor Microsoft typewriter

492
00:48:10,369 --> 00:48:17,300
else thanks thanks for coming in today
and listen to us take care of thanks

493
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:17,450
very much
