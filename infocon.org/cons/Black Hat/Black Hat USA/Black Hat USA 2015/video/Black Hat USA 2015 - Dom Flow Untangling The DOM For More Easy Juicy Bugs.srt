1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,500
good afternoon everyone and welcome to
the final talk of day two of black hat

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:10,400
2015 just a quick reminder if you would
please remember to put your phone on

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:17,539
vibrate during the talk and you are now
located in the Jasmine problem for Tom

4
00:00:17,539 --> 00:00:35,910
flow untangling the DOM for easy bugs I
made a free see it's only scary to give

5
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:43,099
it all right after someone is giving a
talk on macbook using USB cables the

6
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:51,039
situation anyways I'm just using ICMI so
I think that happens so just to say the

7
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:57,649
expectation for today's stock for those
of you who doesn't understand the

8
00:00:57,649 --> 00:01:02,300
context of the dog here and I'm flow or
the number of standard talking about

9
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:07,100
today it's not going to be anything
about memory corruption bugs it's more

10
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:15,250
remote than roses JavaScript DOM API and
some interesting ones that only do so

11
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:22,970
with me and the fees I work as a
software engineer from stand-up in San

12
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:27,650
Francisco I mean speaking in few
conferences for some time

13
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:34,680
mostly a blog web app sync and I usually
like to play do you know the different

14
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:40,049
dole tried two different things I
believe that's much more harder with the

15
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:46,740
emerging attack trends that comes along
especially in the browser's

16
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:53,880
so no oral top today's gonna be
something about how the modern web apps

17
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:59,789
on your friend Dan and especially their
problems with respect to penetration

18
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:05,600
testing them and then talk about a
couple of schools that everything to

19
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,019
help understand and analyze those kind
too soon and buck said we gonna talk

20
00:02:10,019 --> 00:02:18,140
about and then and then of course a few
instances of scenarios where new kind of

21
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:26,950
months could emerge and how we can catch
them so you see most of the maps today

22
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:37,160
they're going to be more and more using
libraries like react media whose purpose

23
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,390
is to make things simple for the
developers declined in law and logic

24
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:48,238
within them and system integration
testing tools are again especially for

25
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:55,410
attacking maps the traditional web apps
but the modern-day badge are more and

26
00:02:55,410 --> 00:03:01,070
more using these libraries for instance
bday media they have their own protocol

27
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:08,130
which doesn't suck and communication and
do a bidirectional communication and if

28
00:03:08,130 --> 00:03:13,090
you need to write your own product if
you need to write your own tool to

29
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:17,760
understand what's the communication
which is going on between your server

30
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:24,679
and you claim you can become a little
harder with the existing tools so I'm

31
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:32,709
not going to talk specifically about any
of these but overall idea remote one

32
00:03:32,709 --> 00:03:40,220
weekend doing what we should be looking
forward in talking about so one thing as

33
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,870
I already mentioned like these
frameworks which is already complicated

34
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:51,609
and shouting analysis on them is pretty
hot if you study analysis on for example

35
00:03:51,609 --> 00:03:55,690
the Mughals friend and cord

36
00:03:55,690 --> 00:03:58,880
they won't understand anything even if
you beautify them intended to study

37
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:03,549
tonight versus its there's a lot of
stuff grown shows different kinds

38
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:08,680
complete come by most lot of things
happening there and again the complex

39
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,780
promotes which includes things like jets
like reactions from Facebook users

40
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:19,070
something if if you've been hearing
about eight assists the classical

41
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:23,849
exercises by which I mean the reflected
its axis was a problem that mean hunting

42
00:04:23,850 --> 00:04:31,790
us for the past two decades and which
one of these occur when you have

43
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:39,590
JavaScript injected into context and I'm
not so sure that we as a security

44
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:42,810
company to an older person completely
addressed them but now we have another

45
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:49,540
beast rare things like Jay sites where
you can inject I Schimmel scored inside

46
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:55,300
JavaScript right off that so things like
jets comes from an existing

47
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:58,870
technological assets which was using
Firefox

48
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:05,110
back with this things are going to meet
with their own dog man on parsing and

49
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:09,500
compilers which all these libraries
being brings in the picture things are

50
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:16,720
going to be much more complicated so
let's talk specifically more doughnuts

51
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:28,560
assess so just to give you an answer
senses which would do some failure in

52
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:34,760
input validation or output encoding you
could have attacker scored running audio

53
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:40,659
printing and as I would always like to
do fine cross site scripting is then

54
00:05:40,660 --> 00:05:45,130
someone knows runs scored on your web
app it's not about anymore especially

55
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:50,360
the friend thing with all these logics
know the specific aim of specific case

56
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:57,580
of damage to say we're good mostly or
completely due to your friend in court

57
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:02,159
where in Europe attack us be alone
doesn't even goes to the server side

58
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,590
everything is it secured on the client
side especially using the nom EP ice

59
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:15,280
Andy Roeser fun prints so you understand
more about says people usually referred

60
00:06:15,280 --> 00:06:22,099
to the classical thing of how data flows
using sources and sinks so they start

61
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,770
when they talk about social we are going
to talk about any entry point when

62
00:06:25,770 --> 00:06:32,760
attacker can inject Data Sync is where
the same interested it gets too late to

63
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:35,400
give directly or indirectly

64
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:46,299
so let's see very classical damage to
service its ample reward of its

65
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:51,350
government says most people would put
this as when they're trying to explain

66
00:06:51,350 --> 00:06:56,820
or deny it sisters here we have a
location where you too so much

67
00:06:56,820 --> 00:07:03,920
dot com slash something and then you
have and then the name something like

68
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:09,490
mark and you have a JavaScript code
which price to take a hash of to

69
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:16,260
continue our own and then tries to do
some reading on that date that and right

70
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:20,240
into your done using the document on
break so in this case as it's pretty

71
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,500
obvious he looked the document on
location or trash the location here

72
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:28,910
becomes a source which is the entry
point for the attacker as an attacker

73
00:07:28,910 --> 00:07:34,950
can directly control that but a document
our brain becomes the sink so this is a

74
00:07:34,950 --> 00:07:41,110
pretty easy way of having an armistice
and there of course you feel about today

75
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:47,670
which still have my movies like this
very pretty simple even if you have so

76
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:56,850
fast black at talks we have seen some
amazing researching don't wanna just

77
00:07:56,850 --> 00:08:03,700
says and how and how people in there and
kind of tools which are being used in

78
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:10,870
taming them so Sebastian band and martin
Dempsey on this research on 25 million

79
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:17,560
flaws later which made it to stop dozens
and dozens of sites and then they try to

80
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,390
run their own

81
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:22,860
instrumentation engine on that using
some crawling and they following the

82
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:32,120
most commonly use or sense things so
this is a pretty pretty issue and don't

83
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:38,590
even today when they tried to keep
moving fast with their friend in court

84
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:42,280
these kind of bugs can be easily
introduced wherein if you don't

85
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:46,819
understand what your sources and sinks
and you know maybe as a link then it can

86
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:56,770
be pretty back so why do these kind of
problems come into existence so it's

87
00:08:56,770 --> 00:09:01,890
it's it's a common software engineering
problems are our I would like to say

88
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:09,270
that bring defending background right so
when you say you tried to match code and

89
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:14,020
you try to meet record and strings
together and you end up in problems like

90
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:20,670
this so even frameworks for instance
angered years have somebody has a

91
00:09:20,670 --> 00:09:25,670
particular in court directly from a
strength even though evaluate can be

92
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:31,760
disabled losing streak JavaScript are
seeing things can still go wrong that is

93
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:36,700
specifically because the dawn
specification and or maybe ice are doing

94
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:42,110
this spring decor conscience in a data
coding DataQuick so when I mean the

95
00:09:42,110 --> 00:09:46,960
directories it's pretty obvious you have
been hearing JavaScript into this evil

96
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:52,320
for a long time people of kind of
stopped using that but we still have

97
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,220
other things like the function construct
their where to replace the screen here

98
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:02,760
would be an answer he could have any
kind of cord execute and it's a script

99
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:09,380
said I wanted in trouble a lot of other
APH directly execute code and the most

100
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:15,030
interesting once to me know the indirect
don't maybe I switch on what string into

101
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:20,890
court something like Jade Goody's select
a sonar off whatever spin you get

102
00:10:20,890 --> 00:10:26,810
trained to the document road right here
is the document itself is JavaScript

103
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:30,430
it's a dummy BH JavaScript but it can K

104
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:37,899
and put it does that mean that it can
push stuff into the non now at the same

105
00:10:37,899 --> 00:10:41,899
time the non-candidate JavaScript if you
give certain conditions so ultimately

106
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:47,209
this this is an indirect way of
integrating code JavaScript using

107
00:10:47,209 --> 00:10:52,520
javascript itself and various other
examples which which is pretty obvious

108
00:10:52,520 --> 00:11:00,779
being around on the GATT just doing a
few examples so the direct and indirect

109
00:11:00,779 --> 00:11:09,230
damages cases so especially get sample
of decrease selector

110
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:16,390
Morse the dictionary's most important
documentation for leniency stack

111
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:22,860
overflow or the the top age of jQuery
the one which is advertised store 24

112
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:27,260
selectors right so if you start
something that crash against the

113
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:32,939
eighties in the document document
containing by 83 do something the dog it

114
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:38,540
does look for any management class and
retention a day off any mention which

115
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:48,579
has those class as it's crashing but the
same character can also be used to

116
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:57,459
inject a shame if if your strength
doesn't start but dark ash and if it's

117
00:11:57,459 --> 00:12:02,060
something like a major source equals one
thing are some script SRC cook something

118
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:07,390
and just inject that can be done any
testing known for a long time but but

119
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:15,089
what I'm trying to say here is that
activation code which most people are

120
00:12:15,089 --> 00:12:19,500
not especially developers are not a bad
off

121
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:24,110
so with all this being said and with a
few doors are generally trying to find

122
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:31,030
all these bugs ways it especially hard
to find these kind of bugs and in

123
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:36,550
today's limits this is because usually
when you look at the source of Aegis

124
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:41,380
they're going to look something like
this which if you try google.com and see

125
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,320
them you so she's going to do something
like this

126
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:50,860
Facebook something like this and even if
companies CSP and then you have all your

127
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:58,980
scripts and bedding side script tags and
being properly loaded from Ikea status

128
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:05,140
even then the JavaScript is going to be
mean if I compressed and and we have a

129
00:13:05,140 --> 00:13:11,290
lot of lot of competition law of this so
I had this problem I i didnt want to

130
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:17,180
look at court like this that I wanted to
have an understanding of how the back

131
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:22,599
pass by just doing something right
rather than doing some static analysis

132
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:28,910
so I've been using few of these tools
especially denominator Pro for a long

133
00:13:28,910 --> 00:13:33,050
time but there have been a few
complexities and setting it up and doing

134
00:13:33,050 --> 00:13:42,430
things the Dominator Broadway but by far
today it is the best on exercise can add

135
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:49,290
that I am I know that can find one
release by doing some dynamic changing

136
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:55,339
and there's also this research by the
paper that he just showed some askin

137
00:13:55,339 --> 00:14:02,310
been Hawks where they they passed its
weird and the chromium and open source

138
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:10,310
the day bash the chromium web browser to
kind of black Harley social things and

139
00:14:10,310 --> 00:14:13,680
come up with those results but I'm not
sure sure whether they made it public

140
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:20,890
and it's not unusual for him so it's a
problem for paint Estes and even study

141
00:14:20,890 --> 00:14:24,260
analysis I said they can be useful in
some cases but I'm not a big fan of

142
00:14:24,260 --> 00:14:31,069
reggae acts and simple string matches
trying to find wonderful piece

143
00:14:31,070 --> 00:14:39,490
in complex maps so I don't know where so
what can we look for it just in in

144
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:44,540
addition to diameter says I iphone-like
ok it's not just the damages says the

145
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:49,230
source just sinks which prospective
problem there's also a very severe

146
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:55,450
problem speech which can be found on the
dog some logical bugs are people using

147
00:14:55,450 --> 00:15:05,300
methods where it was an appropriate
manner so as I said these are the kinds

148
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:09,310
of things that you can find with
injection you gonna have to have

149
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:13,380
something like damn beethoven
redirection where in December doesn't

150
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:19,290
even get to know where what kind of
corny injecting what kind of ridicule

151
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:26,069
trying to do especially useful then I
glanced opened an exchange where if

152
00:15:26,070 --> 00:15:30,030
someone is doing some specific spear
fishing and stuff like that

153
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:33,990
enormous demand reductions pretty good
thing to do because even if you have

154
00:15:33,990 --> 00:15:39,170
boxes or stuffs doing on your suicide
suicide they wouldn't get to know what's

155
00:15:39,170 --> 00:15:43,439
happening right and things like that
story's manipulation if we're going to

156
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:49,260
fight shaimaa Fayed p.m. and depletion a
local story age but it's things like

157
00:15:49,260 --> 00:15:55,280
that and specifically I wanted to talk
about the second ordered an injection so

158
00:15:55,280 --> 00:16:02,680
this is this is a common thing which is
mostly miss my the usual damages as

159
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:09,810
Canada's because of the fact the source
actually come sometimes will be delayed

160
00:16:09,810 --> 00:16:14,849
so by its economic second order dom
injection I mean it's more like a secret

161
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:21,280
injections we used to hear that don't so
rather than having a source and seeing

162
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:25,730
directly under your sources somewhat
delayed in the same time they're coming

163
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:31,780
from Justin story for example today you
register for upside down you go in

164
00:16:31,780 --> 00:16:39,089
studio using me and after a fight if
someone breaks record which uses think

165
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:43,580
and with the source here is an excerpt
hrs bonds which comes from a database

166
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:53,820
break so people have searched our
sponsors as possible i mean we know

167
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:59,510
that's a problem but like the 2009 being
so good at finding these kind of stuff

168
00:16:59,510 --> 00:17:06,569
so and also things like globally exposed
to be able to do you have been hearing

169
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:12,159
you shouldn't be actually doing global
export Trading Post that's a bad idea

170
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:19,530
agent bad practice but we have already
seen problems which can cross which can

171
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:23,660
cause which can have security issues
with that so I I recently came across an

172
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:29,330
issue that actually a global variable in
combination with Dom troubling can

173
00:17:29,330 --> 00:17:35,850
actually be an issue and usage of
sediment barracks which

174
00:17:35,850 --> 00:17:45,060
specification has some good behavior in
in how they define sudden urge so it's

175
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:51,530
and dog hope to find these choosing how
to find these functions using the tool

176
00:17:51,530 --> 00:17:57,020
so yeah of course the two have been
talking about this I'm reading a Chrome

177
00:17:57,020 --> 00:18:04,460
extension it's basically define and
analyze and determine how we are sharing

178
00:18:04,460 --> 00:18:10,500
web apps Thomas and what kind of things
can go wrong and basically it's like

179
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:17,940
reverse engineering so you kind of get
get to understand what's happening so if

180
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:22,480
you feel if you're from the oil spill if
you need to know what happened to us

181
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:30,480
without doing much study analysis you
going who can do all the registers are

182
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,330
all the ABA the dealer injections stuff
like that so I'm kind of trying to do

183
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:42,889
something similar in the world from
extensions and JavaScript to use to make

184
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:48,080
use of it and have dynamic analysis

185
00:18:48,080 --> 00:19:07,789
so let's take a look at it

186
00:19:07,789 --> 00:19:14,590
so it's a Chrome extension you getting
stronger from the store and have this

187
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:22,529
thing over here so this is like the
panel but I have her hawkish

188
00:19:22,529 --> 00:19:29,950
have all these different kinds of API
said he wanted to override and redefine

189
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:38,479
and her life so so let's say let's try
to look at it like Facebook right as I

190
00:19:38,479 --> 00:19:55,749
said so they should get so this is the
problem have been talking about so most

191
00:19:55,749 --> 00:19:59,210
of them about AC today we've been
testing they look like this which which

192
00:19:59,210 --> 00:20:09,149
is pretty annoying to me so are any been
tester for the matter so so I go here at

193
00:20:09,149 --> 00:20:15,899
your facebook so now what happens is you
get stops running on running on

194
00:20:15,899 --> 00:20:21,830
facebook.com right now and it starts
looking into all the different sources

195
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:28,389
and sinks and starts reporting back to
the acts so in this speech I just loaded

196
00:20:28,389 --> 00:20:37,330
Facebook just navigated through it all
these cases are actually not may not be

197
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:39,889
one notable cases of course I'm not
going to show you

198
00:20:39,889 --> 00:20:45,408
Facebook wanna be right now but the
thing which is which is interesting

199
00:20:45,409 --> 00:20:51,239
which I wanted to see was what what
other values being bashed two different

200
00:20:51,239 --> 00:20:55,599
API and ordered the school how the
sources and sinks being caught so far

201
00:20:55,599 --> 00:21:00,529
temple here as you can see this thing
called Domino its dominance in the

202
00:21:00,529 --> 00:21:08,220
context of hookah means anything like
that I thought all rights came out some

203
00:21:08,220 --> 00:21:09,470
ending which

204
00:21:09,470 --> 00:21:16,590
has to do with a DOM nodes propagate
which injects stuff into the not so in

205
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:25,000
this case as you can see and I steamboat
element div class sequel something the

206
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:31,470
gender from has been injected so this is
you sayin probably deserves because when

207
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:37,169
I updated libraries trying to do stuff
and insured bank trying to do stuff

208
00:21:37,169 --> 00:21:42,530
dynamically so far more stuff the case
you won't find these kind of things

209
00:21:42,530 --> 00:21:49,490
which are dynamically injected as part
of your so so so these other things I

210
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:55,549
was interested in looking like been
testing a nap and also things like what

211
00:21:55,549 --> 00:22:01,918
what can a value so returned to document
our cookie and and and from here if I

212
00:22:01,919 --> 00:22:05,539
see something is in pressing for a
channel ACOP the document our cookie is

213
00:22:05,539 --> 00:22:11,100
being sent to a certain value at this
point so I want annoyed what what what

214
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:19,059
5-2 seeing happening so here we have a
small stack trace which tries to show

215
00:22:19,059 --> 00:22:24,678
you ok Edward Lane and what is this
thing happening and if you just click on

216
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:30,919
Add you could

217
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:35,059
so this directly in the greater the
chromes console so if you just click on

218
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:43,259
it just statically takes you to that
page and you can finalize the words

219
00:22:43,259 --> 00:22:47,659
which are being called and get the
function call trace of how how are these

220
00:22:47,659 --> 00:22:57,499
medical and when so with that being said
I'd also like the dark and bowed out plz

221
00:22:57,499 --> 00:23:05,679
a pie made for specifically dishing
bucks a few of them being that I'm going

222
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:11,759
to talk about today so it's called a
minor bug me and it has different

223
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:18,059
samples social ideas so you if you have
been in testing damages for some time

224
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:23,739
you must be knowing things like me which

225
00:23:23,739 --> 00:23:33,580
Google+ public trading range it's it's a
publicly available social connection of

226
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:37,939
sources to seeing saying if you have
damaged scanner again just running

227
00:23:37,940 --> 00:23:44,109
against this and now we gave them your
comments US Canada is good if it can

228
00:23:44,109 --> 00:23:48,549
find all these issues so I'm taking a
few examples of that and then a few

229
00:23:48,549 --> 00:23:57,200
examples of my own about the different
combos that doctor so let's get to it

230
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:08,529
ordeal yeah that's damning remove ok so
I can explain how this works but by

231
00:24:08,529 --> 00:24:14,769
giving analog technology to how you
would reverse engineer native apps by

232
00:24:14,769 --> 00:24:20,139
doing girl injection so here in this
case I return a library card arm looks

233
00:24:20,139 --> 00:24:30,639
so which is which price to track all
different sources and sings it inject

234
00:24:30,639 --> 00:24:34,840
them into the page before so this is a
Chrome extension and integration inject

235
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:39,559
them into the beach for the patient load
and then you'd like the source and sing

236
00:24:39,559 --> 00:24:42,490
so this is that so

237
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:48,950
as you can see the hawkish Greensboro
here is attention and you have a map

238
00:24:48,950 --> 00:24:54,620
which with its own DOM and one of the
things that he should have been trying

239
00:24:54,620 --> 00:24:58,399
to do something like this is you should
be careful that you don't mess with the

240
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:03,900
already existing Dom other ways the
existing web app 12 are properly break

241
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:10,630
down chrome to extension gives you
exactly that due to some technical

242
00:25:10,630 --> 00:25:12,440
reasons they already do

243
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:19,309
extensions are really running nicely the
context so just takes all these damn

244
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:24,330
hopes and Jen registers all these hooks
or chamber document are great and ginger

245
00:25:24,330 --> 00:25:25,309
do that

246
00:25:25,309 --> 00:25:32,840
maps done and now what happens is the
web at JavaScript code runs after this

247
00:25:32,840 --> 00:25:38,270
so that's just like any other injection
everything that the back post would be

248
00:25:38,270 --> 00:25:47,960
shared by the already existing British
police also you could use something like

249
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:53,450
scripts ObjectDock priests which make
make sure that your rights are being

250
00:25:53,450 --> 00:26:03,740
maintained now you can also write so
honest about his load and the bathhouse

251
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:08,760
reach a certain state school she's like
ok give me the list of all global

252
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:14,000
variables that Thomas content keeps most
things and make sure they're interesting

253
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:21,880
questions like this so folks shares in
modern refreshing so if you like and

254
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:28,350
Preston inclined to do plus testing are
even writing down based IDS or you know

255
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:35,020
things like hawking their dog he can be
interesting to you so

256
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:39,690
in a few weeks of redefining how he
would be redefined our override and

257
00:26:39,690 --> 00:26:44,650
JavaScript so i'm used two basic
properties here and bring change so you

258
00:26:44,650 --> 00:26:52,520
have if you have like a load which is
emitted you were just had a popular

259
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:55,530
figure in redefining and what I did

260
00:26:55,530 --> 00:27:02,370
are also use for certain properties like
cookies so interesting properties you

261
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:08,709
can you can I just go and see you know
have a copy of the key and then create a

262
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:11,860
new cookie proxy out of it

263
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:18,439
you want to if you see document our
cookie was a close one to three you said

264
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:24,420
a quickie with the name and value on 23
the cookies center already has a logic

265
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:31,300
which tries to push the cookie jar so
you can have something like what you can

266
00:27:31,300 --> 00:27:37,399
use here is a look up get our look upset
there for cookie and then we define them

267
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:40,630
using defined and redefined center 315

268
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:48,330
JavaScript overriding distinguished
kinda familiar so interesting thing

269
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:54,360
happened so a couple of months back
while I was testing my to all of a

270
00:27:54,360 --> 00:28:02,080
sudden one of the greatest just stopped
working right just won't work because I

271
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,590
was not able to override it and then I
research and what happened and then I

272
00:28:06,590 --> 00:28:12,409
saw there was a bad game which disabled
registration off which disabled

273
00:28:12,410 --> 00:28:19,720
overriding of location and things like
document or domain so and I remembered

274
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:27,560
actually a near back both how you can
use this overriding itself for

275
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:38,500
insecurity break so just be loading dock
no domain and that time the CSI got the

276
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:38,860
job

277
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:45,270
CSI Liberty can be completely by bus
from across coming up so someone can

278
00:28:45,270 --> 00:28:46,160
send

279
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,990
draft up someone can read this year's
out of talking from across the main

280
00:28:49,990 --> 00:28:55,520
website by saying I am good domain.com
by spoofing document or domain so that

281
00:28:55,520 --> 00:29:02,110
they may find the bug on chromium bucks
people are not interested in fixing them

282
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:07,229
because it was more of a maps problem
that's what they thought at that time

283
00:29:07,230 --> 00:29:15,240
some body was only one which which had
that fits five Fortune Global air but if

284
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:18,560
you see it redefined redefinition has
been an interesting problem recently so

285
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:23,560
if you are being in cash and stock
issued a redefining at my script

286
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:32,679
properties and how she used the same
stuff in ActionScript as well so it's

287
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:37,310
been an increasing problem especially
for security but at the end of the day

288
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:42,000
of the Dead upper house to implement all
these things properly with keeping this

289
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:48,650
in mind so they don't break their
integrity so that was an ironic story

290
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:52,470
couple of years back I used the same
properties for insecurity but today I'm

291
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:57,370
trying to use them for security and it's
not what you know i mean part of it is

292
00:29:57,370 --> 00:30:08,370
not working so I I use a tool so this
this link basically gives you all the

293
00:30:08,370 --> 00:30:11,820
location properties which can be
overridden groundbreaking new and

294
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:20,020
different various different so that when
I'm done with his dance Tom so it has it

295
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:23,629
is a database so far

296
00:30:23,630 --> 00:30:28,750
interesting questions you can ask your
browser and click them across different

297
00:30:28,750 --> 00:30:33,660
across different versions of different
doses so for instance you might find a

298
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:40,490
bug in firefights and you have a POC for
that but you know the same time as this

299
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:45,530
point in time it doesn't work and you
can have a database for that and it just

300
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:51,090
keeps running the tests and tries to do
you and you know something goes wrong in

301
00:30:51,090 --> 00:30:54,918
different browsers so

302
00:30:54,919 --> 00:31:01,830
can see

303
00:31:01,830 --> 00:31:13,570
so let's take a look at the location
property

304
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:19,730
so and you're back just this column was
full of rage which means none of the

305
00:31:19,730 --> 00:31:24,680
location properties can be over in india
is configured to me was true in

306
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:29,870
delicious chromium browsers is different
so if you're on you're done chrome 42 I

307
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:36,820
believe this result will be different
and of course you can track this across

308
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:46,050
different poses and four different yet
so for certain properties and different

309
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:51,889
choices there was maybe so

310
00:31:51,890 --> 00:32:02,710
back here and I don't think I would like
to show is that so we're working with

311
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:08,250
bypassing food does exercise photos and
stuff so you might incent certain cases

312
00:32:08,250 --> 00:32:15,140
your dog propagation might be food for
example in one of the instances I was

313
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:25,080
not allowed to use the word like window
on top are any object refers to me so I

314
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:29,530
don't want your image I mean only one of
my good friends but they did last year

315
00:32:29,530 --> 00:32:42,170
in which mister construct a window
between bad and kisses so again so all

316
00:32:42,170 --> 00:32:49,050
these things in chrome would refer to a
window object but doesn't which you can

317
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:52,300
access without losing a parent loses so
that's so these kind of interesting

318
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:56,649
things can be dragged across different
browsers of course you have to post them

319
00:32:56,650 --> 00:33:02,080
on each other to get their souls

320
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:15,850
so that said let's see how it works so
we have this dog poops which are into

321
00:33:15,850 --> 00:33:22,230
every sources and sinks possible so
right now any source which gets data it

322
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:27,919
so so if it ever comes the source
distortion of my overriding function

323
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:33,750
takes note of it and acts especially
flag in different methods so when I

324
00:33:33,750 --> 00:33:40,169
noticed may just changing the value or a
pending depending upon the context in

325
00:33:40,169 --> 00:33:45,250
which the court is used so here I would
say okay so this location has been

326
00:33:45,250 --> 00:33:52,260
called and I'm just adding a black to it
so whoever stands for price to get this

327
00:33:52,260 --> 00:33:59,450
was my get the data so so one thing to
note here is of course this level of

328
00:33:59,450 --> 00:34:07,010
tracking tracking the sources to Singh's
is nowhere close to how you would be

329
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:12,849
doing in native level in a weird level
10 cracking so that's that's the most

330
00:34:12,849 --> 00:34:20,070
complete way of doing analyzing sources
to saint but this kind of helps you

331
00:34:20,070 --> 00:34:27,169
understand most cases of sources to sing
flows and then the day nato can go

332
00:34:27,168 --> 00:34:34,299
through different filters so which can
be a JSON string of five things like

333
00:34:34,300 --> 00:34:42,060
sunscreen many can go to a runoff logic
even the whole string can be lost and

334
00:34:42,060 --> 00:34:49,049
you can have a completely new string
from it so and then it goes into the

335
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:55,080
sink so when I think receives data are
single Sonos ok so if this has gone

336
00:34:55,080 --> 00:35:00,290
through a source which has already being
you know which has already had a flag

337
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:07,750
attached to it then you can kind of tell
whether this piece of data has taken to

338
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:10,160
spot on not so

339
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:16,609
thinking offers simple example so every
time for instance if you if you have a

340
00:35:16,609 --> 00:35:20,369
document our cookie which goes to a
different methods and I do make the end

341
00:35:20,369 --> 00:35:33,740
up in something so that specific data is
marked with are tagged with a flag which

342
00:35:33,740 --> 00:35:40,308
is okay cokie with certain flag and it
goes till four transformations and

343
00:35:40,309 --> 00:35:49,589
ultimately wind generation mouse thing
registers look at this they understand

344
00:35:49,589 --> 00:35:53,509
what's happening here so that's one way
of doing it

345
00:35:53,510 --> 00:35:57,180
entertainment thought you might you have
to do you have to make use of JavaScript

346
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:02,220
spotting property so and JavaScript if
you have an interest in like a scary

347
00:36:02,220 --> 00:36:06,578
'cause hello and see that type of its
yard that would be strange little

348
00:36:06,579 --> 00:36:13,700
JavaScript now you can add a property to
that extreme it's because we know

349
00:36:13,700 --> 00:36:21,710
everything in javascript is subject now
against to say okay like a ghost true

350
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:27,319
and if you still see type of a step that
would still be stream but you can access

351
00:36:27,319 --> 00:36:30,808
it stared directly that would be a
stream but if you say it started out

352
00:36:30,809 --> 00:36:41,910
some probably would have the flag yet so
let's see more about how I generated

353
00:36:41,910 --> 00:36:51,700
this source to seeing stacktrace so I
was able to make you so we h powerful

354
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:59,009
stack trace which is also available in
chrome so if you deliberately to an

355
00:36:59,010 --> 00:37:03,990
error at the given line of course then
it it actually gives you an air duct

356
00:37:03,990 --> 00:37:12,098
stack which don't you i dis line ok this
has happened to this line and here's to

357
00:37:12,099 --> 00:37:16,829
stack to which I have been called
hardest the lineup for me have been

358
00:37:16,829 --> 00:37:18,070
called

359
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:25,100
and he just gives you the staff and it
is the greater chrome dev tools as we

360
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:28,680
saw you can just click on the link and
going navigate want to find some and

361
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:33,940
also in music using it in complex
real-world applications you have to

362
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:39,700
blacklist a lot of things for example if
you just simply do this on all sources

363
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:44,279
sensing so on all web apps it would give
you a lot of strange formation that you

364
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:50,600
might not need for instance if at some
point is using Google Analytics then

365
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:55,810
jeered RGS scored just comes in and
takes into this stack so you need to

366
00:37:55,810 --> 00:38:04,670
look for all this stuff and blacklist so
that means I will go to for interesting

367
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:14,780
scenarios and used a tool to find a box
so so the first thing is something which

368
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:24,090
is which most most been testing tools
mess this you're such a harsh response

369
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:29,350
re website responds and how they are
being properly in the law so always used

370
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:36,250
to wonder when twin is using some API
API and features and content

371
00:38:36,250 --> 00:38:41,320
oK what's going to happen to this Jason
funding because regardless of what's

372
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,930
happening on the seller's site they
might be doing proper filtering an

373
00:38:44,930 --> 00:38:50,940
awkward including regardless of that I
can make choke point is what your

374
00:38:50,940 --> 00:39:01,650
javascript is doing before pushing it to
the dorm right so so anytime before that

375
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:05,870
would look something like this so you
get a response so this is a second order

376
00:39:05,870 --> 00:39:07,940
to get a response

377
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:12,800
you know just under cars he responds you
take a certain part of your response and

378
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:21,250
then pushed into the dark so this can
become interesting while dealing with

379
00:39:21,250 --> 00:39:27,340
hawkish especially because your
childhood response text is no more

380
00:39:27,340 --> 00:39:28,260
directly

381
00:39:28,260 --> 00:39:34,210
injected into the DOM but it doesn't
take into them but in most of the cases

382
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:41,400
when you deal with Jason content your
YouTube most most of the apps usually

383
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:47,310
used a standard bars so you have your
own dark wash it as a figure so if you

384
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:57,380
also look into JSON dark wash and kind
of have the data that you want to give

385
00:39:57,380 --> 00:40:03,810
so that companies can no ok this is
going to disclose then you can easily

386
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:21,630
identify these kind of want to do so

387
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:52,869
and

388
00:40:52,869 --> 00:41:08,400
so as you can see here it's it's kind of
like the same court so this is not a

389
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:19,970
movie script script is ready actually
damage suits takes place and so you can

390
00:41:19,970 --> 00:41:23,629
pretty much go from just by looking at
the court this is this is a proper

391
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:29,470
damage says so if you're looking to
hawkish things which are specifically

392
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:36,209
which we can find that ok this can be a
really interesting or serious issue or

393
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:41,930
can be bosnia comments issue is going to
give you a different look of it it just

394
00:41:41,930 --> 00:41:49,109
highlights that and daughter gives you
the line and its Indian art in India

395
00:41:49,109 --> 00:41:55,980
National Engineers online 16 israeli you
have to actually have to fix this so the

396
00:41:55,980 --> 00:42:01,230
interesting thing here is this mechanism
of testing for a rare mobs by you know

397
00:42:01,230 --> 00:42:05,529
doing all these things is it's not that
it's not just an excuse for it to the

398
00:42:05,529 --> 00:42:10,829
bank testers but it's technically it can
be directly used by developers as well

399
00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:18,390
so if you see a purse when they tried to
push some code before they do all this

400
00:42:18,390 --> 00:42:22,578
day they tried to do is a local changes
and they actually tried on their web app

401
00:42:22,579 --> 00:42:27,559
on their local site so when they do that
if you have if the debtor perhaps

402
00:42:27,559 --> 00:42:33,630
something like this enabled on the
flight and he can keep browsing his

403
00:42:33,630 --> 00:42:37,779
website he can keep testing his new
feature as in Wendy's wonderful

404
00:42:37,779 --> 00:42:40,739
compliments to the DOM

405
00:42:40,739 --> 00:42:45,180
alerts that don't offer those hit you
have something going on drunk because

406
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:52,078
fundamental problem it's scanning you
know finding the bugs is actually the

407
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:59,009
court but to take so if you give this if
you give to men tester and hey we're

408
00:42:59,009 --> 00:43:02,190
going to make it a try

409
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:09,240
natural way of doing things and he tries
to understand about looking at where you

410
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:16,299
can not get as much closer as a donate
button or so and he doesn't have to do

411
00:43:16,300 --> 00:43:21,440
anything extra just integrates with it
so this can be produced for the door

412
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:26,290
burst and you for dinner and integrating
tools like this into the duck boat

413
00:43:26,290 --> 00:43:35,110
people will actually help so yeah you
saw here it's so wonderful tea and also

414
00:43:35,110 --> 00:43:40,780
for bank information discussed were more
interested in finding these kind of bugs

415
00:43:40,780 --> 00:43:48,000
they can just use damn flu have a
different interface for that so ok this

416
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:52,830
this can be things like ok I want to
find sources like it should be a quick

417
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:58,819
trips okayed document name which leads
into

418
00:43:58,820 --> 00:44:07,620
so yeah I don't know what kind of just
use your knowledge and up-to-date finds

419
00:44:07,620 --> 00:44:12,200
everything and loves coming to the
console and he knows ready to be deeds

420
00:44:12,200 --> 00:44:21,990
from this so that's pretty used to so
yeah this is basically using standard

421
00:44:21,990 --> 00:44:26,970
parcels of food and giving double quiche
intelligence to that the second it's

422
00:44:26,970 --> 00:44:31,399
kind of interesting I'm not to just go
to this pretty quickly I have to be more

423
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:38,760
cases to show so yeah so much of a
friends and watching and watching us

424
00:44:38,760 --> 00:44:48,240
it's a shame 05 on serb in addition to
the normal iframe the sandwich it's a

425
00:44:48,240 --> 00:44:54,910
good in another large in and if you want
to run for us said Gordon in your your

426
00:44:54,910 --> 00:44:59,020
domain and you can just use this and
even if you want to enable scripting

427
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:05,759
disabled all these kind of controls are
available using III from China so as you

428
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:12,520
can see here you have a trusted websites
like jazz for dole endured a or things

429
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:13,090
like that

430
00:45:13,090 --> 00:45:18,110
and then you haven't understood a
sandboxed iframe child which by default

431
00:45:18,110 --> 00:45:25,040
would be no and you just say I just need
access to allow scripts so any script

432
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:29,160
that Desai frame would execute would
actually be executed but in the context

433
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:38,890
of a large so I have a Spanish French
and but it's not going through it but

434
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:54,750
yet I have this region as according to
that pretty quickly so so this is the

435
00:45:54,750 --> 00:45:59,870
pairing domain which is depression on
and then you can give up in order to the

436
00:45:59,870 --> 00:46:05,770
parent domain which should take that
data and execute a script in the iframe

437
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:15,450
sandbox so here's the code which does
that so so the actual bogus and this

438
00:46:15,450 --> 00:46:22,029
where you do a Windows unload and then
once the pages we know that you tried to

439
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:26,470
create an iframe sandwich on the fly and
then take this user input and then

440
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:31,930
injected into that a free and at the
same time your parents beach has a code

441
00:46:31,930 --> 00:46:38,990
which which executes secure for example
if if if someone is able to execute this

442
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:42,560
line of court and yes actually broke
into Sandy Cohen to bring this handbook

443
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:46,750
in this case because he's executing code

444
00:46:46,750 --> 00:46:51,300
the challenge here in the challenge his
treats acute cord on the A frame window

445
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:57,320
but it should affect something in your
parent window so if you see the global

446
00:46:57,320 --> 00:47:01,610
retailers of course secure and Scott
flag which is not beach doesn't have a

447
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:06,730
declaration or just made a mistake by
doing ok secure underscored flags equal

448
00:47:06,730 --> 00:47:11,369
to know if

449
00:47:11,369 --> 00:47:20,160
yeah yeah and this this this this this
condition can only be executed if the

450
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:26,019
offender matter can be caused by
discount because heard and unless you

451
00:47:26,019 --> 00:47:34,410
are in court in the same domain that
explanation helps so here the actual to

452
00:47:34,410 --> 00:47:38,450
be something like whatever they use it
gives here would be executed in these

453
00:47:38,450 --> 00:47:46,009
FBI friends and lots and yet he just
broke out of this and so so I was able

454
00:47:46,009 --> 00:47:50,009
to run script in this iframe which
actually affected this so let's see

455
00:47:50,009 --> 00:47:58,539
what's happening here so we have been
very interested

456
00:47:58,539 --> 00:48:07,480
child iframe and initially there was no
need for this I frame rate this post a

457
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:13,150
free now I was able to execute a script
in this context so I sent to name names

458
00:48:13,150 --> 00:48:15,920
equal secure underscore flat so by
default

459
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:22,230
everything in JavaScript on the DOM is
insecurity is on top of a dog so here it

460
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:30,589
would be taking a flat so there's a
French name now becomes now because

461
00:48:30,589 --> 00:48:37,739
there's a famous name is insecure flag
in the DOM usually you're usually the

462
00:48:37,739 --> 00:48:42,700
parent child windows the one thing one
of the things that being shared his name

463
00:48:42,700 --> 00:48:50,980
right so what actually happened here is
it done clubbing your child window was

464
00:48:50,980 --> 00:48:57,410
able to replace the actual secure
underscore flag will be able in the

465
00:48:57,410 --> 00:49:03,730
parent window by changing its name to
secure flag that which created a new

466
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:10,670
global variable depending

467
00:49:10,670 --> 00:49:19,640
so of course you can find these global
variables make it by using location just

468
00:49:19,640 --> 00:49:25,230
give me a global variables just as he
weathered will be leaving now

469
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:30,660
redirecting bearing window wide open
link in a new tab so sometime back

470
00:49:30,660 --> 00:49:40,899
someone called 911 and different other
web sites where you can you can have a

471
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:48,750
pin and window open a new tab under
blank then it can be malicious and if he

472
00:49:48,750 --> 00:49:54,600
doesn't open door open underdog a lot of
some fishing page and the ocean beach

473
00:49:54,600 --> 00:50:01,890
just change its changes its domain so
which can be produced in phishing

474
00:50:01,890 --> 00:50:10,670
attacks so here's the attack which guy
so I'm just so this is a page which has

475
00:50:10,670 --> 00:50:15,670
ok click me in this bitch has
underscored blank which opens a new tab

476
00:50:15,670 --> 00:50:21,750
so when someone clicks that as you can
see here does not deter us from this

477
00:50:21,750 --> 00:50:26,290
window which was a completely different
domains were able to change the audio

478
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:31,320
pages window so this can be used in
classical attacks like dad lobbying

479
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:34,820
which which is made if I tried to
prevent when you do an armored in order

480
00:50:34,820 --> 00:50:43,060
to open but this is a case in this is a
case in Chrome and Firefox when you do

481
00:50:43,060 --> 00:50:52,370
open tabs using underscore blank so yeah
haha so true and this would be to use to

482
00:50:52,370 --> 00:50:58,560
make sure before redirecting you said
the opener to now are to make sure that

483
00:50:58,560 --> 00:51:06,680
your new tab has a relic was not a
French add to it

484
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:12,629
any show so that's one of the things
around us right now is to send all these

485
00:51:12,630 --> 00:51:16,620
things you know said things to novel
before we dedicate two different pages

486
00:51:16,620 --> 00:51:22,790
so it can be interesting if you are
doing it again in the context of you

487
00:51:22,790 --> 00:51:27,720
know web apps like banking apps where if
someone at the gate I'll be and then

488
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:31,540
comes back comes back and he's a Long
Beach you might think okay this is the

489
00:51:31,540 --> 00:51:35,960
login page of the bank has already on
but in fact you are indifferent to me

490
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:43,280
classical phishing attack so so so why
is increasing so when I wanted to test

491
00:51:43,280 --> 00:51:48,640
for these kind of movies I was looking
into the task is basically looking to

492
00:51:48,640 --> 00:51:53,690
pay just give me the links which has
struggled to underscore blank and just

493
00:51:53,690 --> 00:52:00,920
have to fret but static analysis is
pretty bad at doing that because by

494
00:52:00,920 --> 00:52:04,850
default in most of the cases i've seen

495
00:52:04,850 --> 00:52:11,000
don't have the links are any pop you
know being operated a shame and then

496
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:16,950
they have some jQuery code which
launched on window loading outlawed and

497
00:52:16,950 --> 00:52:22,200
then tries to inject underscored blank
and really good order for on the lawn so

498
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:27,609
dynamically understand the dog bandana
clip art and armand any good deals so

499
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:33,990
this can be possible only by using some
dynamic analysis tools like okish ok

500
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:39,839
he's a fine one and a pretty interesting
one and the one of the problems that

501
00:52:39,840 --> 00:52:44,950
could face met their church I'm going to
talk about so so I iPhone just one

502
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:51,359
meeting went off in a couple of campaign
engines which are not sure but yet and

503
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:58,700
also I was in custom implementation of
completing engine so random bringing

504
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:03,819
engines so you have some data a custom
data and then you have a templating

505
00:53:03,820 --> 00:53:09,040
language something like okay . mark with
which opens like this which has stats

506
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:14,830
like this and the template compiler
understands the need to replace this

507
00:53:14,830 --> 00:53:19,310
would but this pretty simple right so if
you are

508
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:24,680
a templating engine developer and if
you're trying to do that in JavaScript

509
00:53:24,680 --> 00:53:29,930
in defending the National we would be to
direct tried to do a different thing an

510
00:53:29,930 --> 00:53:36,350
encoding and then you know the your
language is still being languages patent

511
00:53:36,350 --> 00:53:41,529
and do them to a simplest things are
deeply so bad and a matching donor so

512
00:53:41,530 --> 00:53:47,430
can simply embedding code which which
I'm going to talk about so I assume for

513
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:53,240
the sake of this demo that the actual
invitation malice the first lang

514
00:53:53,240 --> 00:53:59,729
the placeholder which is the templating
so me as a templating engine does dude

515
00:53:59,730 --> 00:54:03,820
I'm pleading is going to replace me know
what I say please hold her I'm going to

516
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:08,240
be pleased that with the sudden so in
this case I'm going to be placed at the

517
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:17,000
input so and before you know doing the
string degree place finish my degree

518
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:23,220
place of imported machinery place of
placeholder input I'm going to do a

519
00:54:23,220 --> 00:54:26,620
freight train and the feeling is a
pretty standard Schimmel filtering where

520
00:54:26,620 --> 00:54:32,100
you can take a single course W words
this time greater than stuff like that

521
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:41,880
let's take a look at the pool

522
00:54:41,880 --> 00:54:47,570
so put the templating engine so why
don't you give here so you face a estar

523
00:54:47,570 --> 00:54:52,890
sequels some smart and start london's
large pNG then yeah this is the actual

524
00:54:52,890 --> 00:55:00,080
number again court which was just got
right into the document art you know it

525
00:55:00,080 --> 00:55:05,610
just doesn't depend on trade and we're
starting to get involved so here we can

526
00:55:05,610 --> 00:55:10,120
actually causing it to assist in this
scenario by let's let's take a look at

527
00:55:10,120 --> 00:55:14,900
them so if you if you try to do things
like 123 single quotes trouble quotes

528
00:55:14,900 --> 00:55:21,950
level of all these are being treated
because the templating engine are

529
00:55:21,950 --> 00:55:27,140
definitely right so as you already know
to get out of this context you need to

530
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:31,569
have a single court to get out of this
context because your place holder into

531
00:55:31,570 --> 00:55:36,370
the single quote if you have a if you
can have a single coat you can get past

532
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:45,170
that and you know standard Texas law
declares war on terror Equus blah blah

533
00:55:45,170 --> 00:55:51,180
blah but we already have footing here so
the actual bill that can buy buses will

534
00:55:51,180 --> 00:56:04,410
be something like my daughter about kick
on error caused a look in this case I'm

535
00:56:04,410 --> 00:56:08,129
using a couple of interesting characters
and of course the first witness dollar

536
00:56:08,130 --> 00:56:12,500
which is pretty refreshing in this
context and then take it back mix in

537
00:56:12,500 --> 00:56:15,610
general are you know for a long time
have been considered bad buddy Franklin

538
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:20,530
templating engine and coatings you don't
usually see things like black dicks

539
00:56:20,530 --> 00:56:24,900
unglamorous if the temperature in jail
right there is a lot of things like

540
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:30,630
nutrition exercise and no stinks like a
Mexican costs different boats he's going

541
00:56:30,630 --> 00:56:36,350
to replace stuff like that but in a
British no you're not going to look at

542
00:56:36,350 --> 00:56:44,850
things like tactics $1 so if you do not
complaining of that not sure how many

543
00:56:44,850 --> 00:56:51,450
can see this but yeah it can actually
get body without using a single coat so

544
00:56:51,450 --> 00:56:52,710
let's see what happen here

545
00:56:52,710 --> 00:57:00,380
so of course the culprit serious danger
importation menagerie place and this was

546
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:08,339
the bus they be used so what's happening
here is my scripts definition as few

547
00:57:08,339 --> 00:57:13,270
interesting ways of doing stuff and one
of them is the street art part of a

548
00:57:13,270 --> 00:57:19,830
battery police so you should write a
string string got any place any language

549
00:57:19,830 --> 00:57:25,200
gives you ok don't mean a thing to
search for a replacement that there's no

550
00:57:25,200 --> 00:57:30,290
special conditions but in case of
JavaScript which is a script which is it

551
00:57:30,290 --> 00:57:35,810
a question standard you have something
like special guests with daughters of

552
00:57:35,810 --> 00:57:38,400
something if you're next to be replaced

553
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:43,430
starts with the daughter can take
different behaviors can do differently

554
00:57:43,430 --> 00:57:46,339
here's the interesting behavior may do
so

555
00:57:46,339 --> 00:57:51,310
daughter and a black dick so the Madonna
back dick would replace the current

556
00:57:51,310 --> 00:57:59,299
screen with their before before the
current context so here we may do so the

557
00:57:59,300 --> 00:58:04,099
single court which actually started the
context and we were in and we were able

558
00:58:04,099 --> 00:58:12,059
to use the same characters even though
they were being filter

559
00:58:12,059 --> 00:58:19,279
so and so yeah these kind of things can
be directly from using tools like okay

560
00:58:19,279 --> 00:58:25,349
so the whole idea here is we need to
start thinking in terms of you know I

561
00:58:25,349 --> 00:58:30,640
differing bug independent not just by
looking at pretty sure nonexistent total

562
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:32,890
different villages like this

563
00:58:32,890 --> 00:58:37,239
these are not just the simple new
anxious but there are tons of them there

564
00:58:37,239 --> 00:58:42,630
are tons of its members of the morning
view which can buy plus important

565
00:58:42,630 --> 00:58:53,150
security restrictions the way people do
so yeah so the next thing I'm working on

566
00:58:53,150 --> 00:58:58,410
with respect to hook issues of course
improving the track off you know how we

567
00:58:58,410 --> 00:59:01,670
track data between the source and sink
but I'm trying to back

568
00:59:01,670 --> 00:59:07,299
chromium to make sure that all these
properties which have been recently the

569
00:59:07,299 --> 00:59:11,869
location property can be over did not
gain and more things like most

570
00:59:11,869 --> 00:59:17,279
prestigious and easily and if I or have
a library to our framework land if I

571
00:59:17,279 --> 00:59:23,519
especially interesting case has dragged
on primary so yeah that's that's what I

572
00:59:23,519 --> 00:59:25,979
mean yeah

573
00:59:25,979 --> 00:59:35,538
makers of the stool was criticized as
you wish you have not gone / set its

574
00:59:35,539 --> 00:59:45,449
limitations are open source and I would
love it if someone comes out more about

575
00:59:45,449 --> 00:59:52,769
this n tools like this and stop
interesting looking for this kind of box

576
00:59:52,769 --> 00:59:55,799
you have any questions
