1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,730
good out in your heart just trying to do
my ex just let you hire all-stars yeah

2
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:35,460
we had an awesome but his research and
very little bit about the security fence

3
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:45,340
thi research into various banks and
mobile devices and Orlando today to see

4
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:59,109
what they did you see software security
bars bars bars are you are you don't

5
00:00:59,109 --> 00:01:03,960
have false hopes are sparse city lawyer
to prevent she was initially

6
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:13,180
exploitation of the site for example PC
but in our car exports or so they do

7
00:01:13,180 --> 00:01:19,970
anything you so they need to have paid
off if the pain is very simple it is

8
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:23,710
maybe just like a proof of concept but
if you actually want to do something

9
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:28,880
useful that they don't have to be
complex and already robust national

10
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,009
they're all they can use it is an
expectation things let's go after this

11
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:40,060
like more complex payload in their life
or attackers like they are by breaking

12
00:01:40,060 --> 00:01:52,259
rating 80 have exploded like post like
most of those stages and initial stage

13
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,390
and only have just like try to get
programming project control and

14
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:59,880
volunteer program called her control you
like directed me somewhere I think you

15
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:12,920
have like in 20 days here hold on a sec
you'll get used to the heat today

16
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:21,869
some halo that had only does it make
repairs like the state continues cold

17
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:31,650
and then of course you can have my car
only paid off but very complex layouts

18
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:40,200
are like unlike the operation as you
have some every teacher like making

19
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:44,280
sleeping every executable what often
happens with us like that the attacker

20
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:47,489
and just make note of you have a
possibility that logging mechanism just

21
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:50,060
like set like certain memory regions

22
00:02:50,060 --> 00:03:00,060
executable and they first explored the
use Lakes system functionality allows

23
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:05,660
multi function that is presented and get
it sorted by the target application for

24
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:10,170
example like any CD load but of course
it paid off and i was just make note

25
00:03:10,170 --> 00:03:15,869
additional system libraries had a new
functionality are functionally related

26
00:03:15,870 --> 00:03:27,489
applications of Use Policy assumption
that if you don't use director calls

27
00:03:27,489 --> 00:03:32,320
assault because they can hold if they
think I'm staying with her cross

28
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:39,540
different bindles versions and suspects
right as far so in the knowledge case

29
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:50,010
you have made your application through
all this presentation so other than at

30
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:57,630
some point for example of dogs they all
fell into the process either from the

31
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:10,489
great for him and her breaking that like
its cold front and here's why does not

32
00:04:10,489 --> 00:04:15,720
say if your goods and I guess it was
just took a look at us like this and

33
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:22,039
they actually use from very common DLL
so you can see for example of a second

34
00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:23,330
followed by Reed

35
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:29,688
220 additional paid off though that this
or that you have like almost all of them

36
00:04:29,689 --> 00:04:34,469
used by that up to the example allocate
additional executive the states like

37
00:04:34,469 --> 00:04:46,340
typical directionality yeah and then
does this talk to ya so obviously I'm

38
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:49,659
not the first to make walking to the
night partying applications and they

39
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:58,759
were mostly I would save working like a
charm I can so it's basically a little

40
00:04:58,759 --> 00:05:07,940
bit injected into the process of setting
the stage for executable vote prevented

41
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:18,180
a cloning fraud or overlay network
drives a bunch of other things basically

42
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:26,419
it's a DLL just either then those rare
talks a vis and you just need to make

43
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:36,639
all of this and they are they follow
along the banks are adding that he had

44
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:48,379
and uses the application process so they
really want to do is break break break

45
00:05:48,379 --> 00:05:58,139
the cato some specific functionality and
functionalities basically you need to

46
00:05:58,139 --> 00:06:04,680
call a few highly specific API all the
functionality that used by the failure

47
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:11,219
by John might not be used by the party
application but as soon as like a reason

48
00:06:11,219 --> 00:06:15,259
voted into the memory of process every
functionality with used by the

49
00:06:15,259 --> 00:06:21,400
application is just there are like the
equity exposure for their ticket to like

50
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:29,520
free to use as he wants this protocol
let's remove functionality that was used

51
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,310
by the application what's the

52
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:35,760
process very very very simple example

53
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:42,390
conservation like they're buying listen
to accept make new connections and

54
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:47,490
handle that but the food served the
haitian might not like they are they

55
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:56,840
never removed from that process Expo
Comdex much rights as they come back

56
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:03,619
come back there is no part in this
process and so like this like very basic

57
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:14,520
get a better connection backwards like
his control sera

58
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:26,620
you can do this very universal Lake
unused functionality and security so we

59
00:07:26,620 --> 00:07:31,970
thought had to be ready for this process
creation by rebuilding networking

60
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:46,710
applications that actually don't use it
to protect surface and I so take a look

61
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:54,280
at my ass off today so you have
occasions that actually has developed

62
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:59,640
you don't have to read meant to be if
you want to ask that he used to be a

63
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:04,580
cold and that whole usually comes in the
form of a dynamic link library just

64
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:14,430
basically a binary file that got into
the process not up yet out of the

65
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:20,000
program get loaded into the into the
process space that's very busy today

66
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:30,220
solution provides a couple faces get out
also nothing just askin be outfitted

67
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:36,880
independent from the axis Yukos that
display stuff that automatically going

68
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:42,080
to be so he should have thought about
the project that ok

69
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:53,230
going to use like Kabul basic system DLL
fly and TCL 32 deliveries actually going

70
00:08:53,230 --> 00:09:01,090
to see that's life because it turned out
to be exactly right because often

71
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:11,140
underestimate the actual thing is you
look at what it looks like this on a

72
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:21,810
softer and its modifications to the
number of hundreds of $160 mutual funds

73
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:30,140
that vacation even if the application to
just use one function all else is one

74
00:09:30,140 --> 00:09:34,660
likes this being exported to focus all
the air out and told the court that

75
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:39,890
comes with it and the process actually
do all the code of the doubt that it's

76
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:48,819
my fault you can actually took a look at
TV does not about to get it from the

77
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:59,730
main function of 232 w lol ok one of us
is that ok always about you have to

78
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:03,910
think that's just initial setup right
because

79
00:10:03,910 --> 00:10:17,790
themselves to get you still as soon as
ya ya ya mouth and this was using static

80
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:23,089
analysis is the actual number even
higher on the contrary when you look at

81
00:10:23,090 --> 00:10:29,210
what he actually uses all of this
picture looks like difference all the

82
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:37,900
topics explored it uses that though that
show you how many experts and then how

83
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:42,120
many of these functions like should be
used to it and you can see here that's

84
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,450
usually ok one man

85
00:10:46,450 --> 00:10:56,070
and even though the second graph shows
the cold actually dysfunctionality that

86
00:10:56,070 --> 00:11:01,490
there's actually more hope he used that
still is like Mexican this record a

87
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:11,170
video for example I don't want to think
about it winds up and so they could use

88
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:26,010
she's also took a look at it and that's
why it's a message via MSN to help like

89
00:11:26,010 --> 00:11:33,040
a slight increase in the cold winds out
of possible causes messages that said he

90
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:39,270
lost the picture and generators to their
fullest potential

91
00:11:39,270 --> 00:11:49,280
factual so now we talk a little bit of
all by the same problem all you want to

92
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:55,890
do all we saw that there is a potential
for hope and so he became obvious like

93
00:11:55,890 --> 00:12:02,760
the system between Lake named Cole
freeze its components and hear us like

94
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:07,880
the dynamic stripping and yet the second
column because I mean everything so

95
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:14,740
called stripping really is removing
unused code from the process a process

96
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:18,510
your application because we do
everything on the flight memory on it so

97
00:12:18,510 --> 00:12:28,180
we don't modify anything the application
on this and this is called me hope you

98
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:36,040
don't feel don't and I think she made
application system the other men she's

99
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:43,079
basically is my dear they want to
prevent loading you called into the

100
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:49,240
process address space specifically
actually do he just prevent phrasing

101
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:58,120
full pages which also prevent for
example code injection and I said before

102
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:11,140
we do all of this and rank so there's no
modification applications if you want to

103
00:13:11,140 --> 00:13:18,080
call it that is used it for a second
like find out what photo by Jason

104
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:23,110
educational you five so basically you
know how they can import able to save

105
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:26,830
the use like this action from the
library and thus far from the library

106
00:13:26,830 --> 00:13:38,880
and they export sales if they have at
this address the fight and if you look

107
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:44,170
at the basic things they appear
destruction that he that important buy

108
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:53,160
the item an executable file but of
course as dynamic presence oh and now

109
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:57,370
we're going to talk a little bit of
office later but you get the idea of

110
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:07,050
exports rose imports 2011 part of be
considered

111
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:15,550
body parts of the code use other parts
to use the program to control the floor

112
00:14:15,550 --> 00:14:24,010
wrap up today and tonight hope loss and
branches and Johnson achieve that

113
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:34,970
lasting just like an old receive gee we
had the edges are the control basically

114
00:14:34,970 --> 00:14:49,379
nice lake view of each that though this
is like our army pictures so

115
00:14:49,379 --> 00:14:59,209
just like the application it had no
detrimental to your health and then we

116
00:14:59,209 --> 00:15:03,069
generated this control program through
which we go talk about them a little bit

117
00:15:03,069 --> 00:15:07,988
late estimated for each other
applications used to generate

118
00:15:07,989 --> 00:15:15,859
regenerated control for Brown's raid
beginning of those are they could

119
00:15:15,859 --> 00:15:21,009
program experts and the other nodes and
other parts of the code it I used by the

120
00:15:21,009 --> 00:15:26,369
experts and the deal edit this arrest is
at the end of their independence from

121
00:15:26,369 --> 00:15:31,589
the application just like the generators
and he did out and so far so we have

122
00:15:31,589 --> 00:15:46,669
thus far has to be there as soon as our
security experts and go through the

123
00:15:46,669 --> 00:15:53,649
application imports importer table and
Mark all the different all the different

124
00:15:53,649 --> 00:16:10,039
nodes and functions but then the control
for brass who represent hope parts by

125
00:16:10,039 --> 00:16:16,979
the specific application since you never
know what is used you also know what

126
00:16:16,979 --> 00:16:21,279
does not use like everything to the
white and gray davis is not use this

127
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:28,509
information to go to the lake recalls
her even started the chain or removing

128
00:16:28,509 --> 00:16:35,559
unused told ya so since we find mister
peres first study to do it's like

129
00:16:35,559 --> 00:16:40,969
control only country that has been
basically use because of this and this

130
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:50,399
and this and that and we just all
transfers and Watson song and actually

131
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,949
not appalled at all as long as you have
the right to control fences know which

132
00:16:55,949 --> 00:16:56,589
address

133
00:16:56,590 --> 00:17:03,340
that the US is actually in the cold so
we will follow this doesn't care about

134
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:11,050
is in control transfers so this basic
block there's actually a member that has

135
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:16,280
been delivered from from the memories we
register and then be tempted to be

136
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,609
everything started addresses

137
00:17:18,609 --> 00:17:30,300
announces we so ya know when is he going
to point to direct control transfer that

138
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,790
can be trouble some reason in our
control

139
00:17:33,790 --> 00:17:40,030
chances are manifold on the tables
basically how the generated many have

140
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:45,560
switched statement tables and we with
all the callbacks so you just want to

141
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:52,310
register like that he has a function
pointer there is going to be used at

142
00:17:52,310 --> 00:18:01,260
runtime not function calls at their
tables couples code and post it Cody

143
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:07,900
thinks that he liked that part addressed
to result in action at this time for the

144
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:13,220
weather like internal cases abstract
interpretation can help of petition is

145
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:20,250
one of those nifty study data flow
analysis and industry uses founded at

146
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:30,650
which is able to determine like the
variables like this register based on

147
00:18:30,650 --> 00:18:40,030
the model and using a lot actually
executing the program whole setup of

148
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:51,320
control how did we have is so we felt
because the industry trade the whole

149
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:58,169
week of rain checks that checks the
business and economic retaliation for a

150
00:18:58,170 --> 00:18:59,590
book was really use it

151
00:18:59,590 --> 00:19:01,270
program houses

152
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:08,740
they thought victims patient for a
second I'll do you can use it like one

153
00:19:08,740 --> 00:19:20,060
of those types of difficulty lifting up
the assembly the targets result of those

154
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:27,290
two together and that include rules that
piece of different stuff together and

155
00:19:27,290 --> 00:19:32,409
also crosses this stuff like it was
actually if you have been introduced

156
00:19:32,410 --> 00:19:33,740
with the new site and so on

157
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:42,120
there is all the stuff you find actually
contained in use during the round temple

158
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:50,149
stripping containers a call you out no
smooth in those functions but

159
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:58,000
dependencies to the code which is fine
she said I imported by the hell out of

160
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:04,440
you and this is what such a magical
about looks like so we have a process 30

161
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:13,310
June next year that's the function that
the export video commentaries to reach

162
00:20:13,310 --> 00:20:25,179
that this function uses so that we can
strip over the details and dependencies

163
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:36,480
that we have so for example of this
process and tlio example here so this

164
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:42,760
with offices in that parking if those we
have duplicate

165
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:51,720
only have a small hope you all have in
this case you used within the within the

166
00:20:51,720 --> 00:21:02,590
deal out of this is one thing that
happens when we don't we cannot be very

167
00:21:02,590 --> 00:21:09,439
kind of assault and indirect control
transfer offers but they all times in

168
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,130
total

169
00:21:10,130 --> 00:21:21,470
cortisol response of the doubt they are
not friends any possible and troublesome

170
00:21:21,470 --> 00:21:30,110
because we basically need to 22 of 22
able to show how these because because

171
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:45,040
we don't we just used this is what we
need to do a little bit about the idea

172
00:21:45,040 --> 00:21:51,000
of some more details and i resent you
like our actual implementation and

173
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:56,330
you're also going to show you something
once debating about the basic

174
00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:04,820
implementation force majeure
declarations to it the process i resent

175
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:10,610
her teammates already like she does have
its noted that actually purchase a

176
00:22:10,610 --> 00:22:16,790
program manager apartment so that had
also are called exit routes before the

177
00:22:16,790 --> 00:22:19,570
application ever executes

178
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:25,800
you can do all of our IT operations and
that in the end you can just like that

179
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:29,350
the program executes nominee

180
00:22:29,350 --> 00:22:38,219
implemented fully endorse aids 32 bit
mode I know that experience 686 or over

181
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:44,290
those 32 bit cell phones just like easy
but there's no BC by 64 bit and

182
00:22:44,290 --> 00:22:51,560
limitations just like the Devils have
you heard about the other direction I W

183
00:22:51,560 --> 00:22:55,520
sat in a deal out of it seems like I
said he didn't get a chance to think

184
00:22:55,520 --> 00:23:02,410
that something the registry and active
but we can also use a PC very slick

185
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:10,280
quoted today and you have to have
occasion uses you can use either the

186
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:14,730
freemen so far

187
00:23:14,730 --> 00:23:17,770
you hope you are you can run an
application with the whole host of

188
00:23:17,770 --> 00:23:24,330
reason and you have to have to run the
application was basically it's like

189
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:31,350
another he allowed that to the program
and then which collects like nickname of

190
00:23:31,350 --> 00:23:39,469
get out so that they may close all the
functions that are used for congress

191
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:45,040
also check of the application ever like
Medicaid memory pages that executable

192
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:49,440
are changing some patients are basically
any modification executive both members

193
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:58,080
of the end of the dairy Flickr
configuration for the application they

194
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:02,510
think neil is another that needs to be
pre-loaded missile functions that are

195
00:24:02,510 --> 00:24:06,850
gonna be vital for example every
function to get all of you get proper

196
00:24:06,850 --> 00:24:14,399
dress need to buy this is the settings
for the memory permission first we have

197
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:20,460
to do you have to do in order to be able
to strip quote from the hammock he noted

198
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,410
the else

199
00:24:21,410 --> 00:24:28,220
pls go out on a date for the program

200
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:36,630
apartment home yet caught up to 32 and
33 just an ordinary application everyday

201
00:24:36,630 --> 00:24:44,720
lol using the library and that he had
200 operations L and as soon as the

202
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:51,049
actual application also married that all
night just returned to handle this via

203
00:24:51,049 --> 00:24:57,370
longest like the nitrates and very very
basic

204
00:24:57,370 --> 00:25:09,389
actually post ripping holes bongo
process memory and make it unusable so

205
00:25:09,390 --> 00:25:14,049
that you cannot fall that holding call
for this implementation

206
00:25:14,049 --> 00:25:23,139
movie DVD or write the code memory
discuss later he so that should be

207
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:25,560
overhauled with people like for example

208
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:29,810
there so we'll just take time to make
some hope from us and you could show a

209
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:34,240
phone call and say hey i'd like this
post

210
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:47,690
yeah but you could also take some other
Sunday 01 like not very interesting I

211
00:25:47,690 --> 00:25:56,950
don't know if you watch the TV show
basically it's a prevalent instruction

212
00:25:56,950 --> 00:26:03,180
on x86 or are you the space applications
all the basically kill the process I

213
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:12,320
like crap the fire and the nice thing to
buy instructions and just like that on

214
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:20,250
her dress radius you don't care if
you're overweight you can just buy the

215
00:26:20,250 --> 00:26:32,130
memory hole construction so much reading
so happy for that year's event the

216
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:36,720
process of adding hopes of the lake has
faced but it's actually just like

217
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:44,540
commenting on setting paychecks a fond
memory page that the whole process and

218
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:55,580
if you do manage to get directions and
life so I have met the fight and

219
00:26:55,580 --> 00:27:02,540
memories that we read section by hitting
allocate memory and of course you can

220
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:08,700
also make change predictions with all
the functionality though he basically

221
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:22,890
has right now those factions and use the
space which functionality for this

222
00:27:22,890 --> 00:27:29,570
application and not like more day having
previously had a very difficult to do

223
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:37,429
pages this is hoping it's really just
wanted to determine if

224
00:27:37,430 --> 00:27:44,880
replication or make it and you go into
creating exceed EUR 2500 pages in the

225
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:49,010
real world applications of this project
I worked out this enforcement partners

226
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:59,050
to say from long enough they create
pages with a secret but makes a really

227
00:27:59,050 --> 00:28:13,320
good to see you actually work talk to
Paul and dynamic a dynamic function but

228
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:21,750
so far there's like other other problems
might have taken by this study analysis

229
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:27,560
part in software is not sufficient
anymore so sometimes you have to find a

230
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:34,850
variety of functions and applications
using so what you have to say a special

231
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:43,840
occasion of a scope threesome and
parchment Earnhardt and they have a

232
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,209
small strips

233
00:28:46,210 --> 00:28:52,190
interact with those applications so they
cover as much functionality as possible

234
00:28:52,190 --> 00:29:01,510
and likely to show our test environment
that trigger like a fresh the whole

235
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:06,300
structure like ultimate fighters and we
start with something that we are playing

236
00:29:06,300 --> 00:29:12,440
a fully automated like just like run
application and like others and

237
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:19,640
Portsmouth just regulate calcium attic
automatic generation of my trusty

238
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:34,270
too extreme to better see I'm running
Adobe Reader select s about Sunday bTW

239
00:29:34,270 --> 00:29:42,850
step but actually happens when an
application was under protection so what

240
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:46,699
happened to focus on his head to head
home

241
00:29:46,700 --> 00:29:55,650
to the picture of the gang affiliation
starts along all the DL quality LLC and

242
00:29:55,650 --> 00:30:06,300
AP file gets injector and chop it all
off their applications entry points as

243
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:14,070
soon as the 360 to do it from the
programs and replying to be sorry for

244
00:30:14,070 --> 00:30:21,820
the long haul the DLC this application
will need during the cold stripping for

245
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:27,929
musical trophy around survey overriding
memories with quality instruction the

246
00:30:27,930 --> 00:30:35,290
memory of Paul's place hopes they can I
hope that they will remove the

247
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:47,260
executable bit from her memory
allocation for permission if we just let

248
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:51,890
the application executable long entry
point and from there on we could even

249
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:57,740
break lol Ivory Coast case you like our
heart attack he couldn't do that because

250
00:30:57,740 --> 00:31:01,780
you still haven't they been hoping but
if the user and hoping for the Patient

251
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:05,399
Protection for people to the car with no
just unload already led on the

252
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:18,810
application would be running late so
they won't be a very small demo service

253
00:31:18,810 --> 00:31:26,000
tonight so what happened before or
during exploration over an application

254
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:32,520
of this protective body or freeze and
since I'm not like super duper expert

255
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:39,800
right her or witnessed a car you got a
very simple program DEP and ASLR which

256
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:46,550
likes hard freeze system but just like a
few hours

257
00:31:46,550 --> 00:33:36,178
to create a chemistry

258
00:33:36,179 --> 00:35:16,600
control

259
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:48,520
instructions that there's like some
cardio for example you have some

260
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:53,300
fighting between different functions
that swallowed up by her beauty doll

261
00:35:53,300 --> 00:36:00,570
instruction by its this tall are like
this that effect but this trip and in

262
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:10,970
this case is strictly 300 megabytes in
size and age 75 57% off hold the view

263
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:19,919
from the deficit over into this
application and just like an overview of

264
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:25,150
the more interesting to see her stupid
his young told us they can take sick and

265
00:36:25,150 --> 00:36:34,050
other process creation function that at
each other's out with us like the the

266
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:39,910
more interesting by injury across an
entity that this trip will always better

267
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:45,180
on the day he doesn't have a dozen right
now I saw this is something they create

268
00:36:45,180 --> 00:36:55,750
file is not there anymore I just find
our system has like money by installing

269
00:36:55,750 --> 00:37:08,150
small drawback because demand paging so
if you're alive 35 percent of the cold

270
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:13,010
only 25 percent of the vote actually met
them to the address they say the other

271
00:37:13,010 --> 00:37:19,770
side of their job to the zoo when they
had this to a specific contract value

272
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:25,150
just thought about the ice but our case
we did have some military thing so their

273
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:26,940
memory footprint on the application

274
00:37:26,940 --> 00:37:34,460
group of right now get a little bit
higher but we have some of your support

275
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:41,569
culture fixes so damn modifications
could buy from you want to look at them

276
00:37:41,569 --> 00:37:46,660
they really happy occasion and o'leary
does take very popular just like

277
00:37:46,660 --> 00:37:51,299
renowned for this like high quality and
there's like never any justification

278
00:37:51,300 --> 00:38:00,770
that that's even begin to hear this case
later if we have been testing it looks

279
00:38:00,770 --> 00:38:04,810
like a bunch of different videos that
have different functionality they do

280
00:38:04,810 --> 00:38:11,230
manage to blow up Adobe doesn't take
action over 185 fieldhouse plenty of

281
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:20,030
those and I W out so that system
addresses likely 155 middle system and

282
00:38:20,030 --> 00:38:25,550
this is the only to the stripping off
clothes tripping on Thursday OK nothing

283
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:32,210
occasion dream of you just assume it
will use everything that makes our a

284
00:38:32,210 --> 00:38:37,869
top-notch easier to just like tripping
penalty on the system because you can't

285
00:38:37,869 --> 00:38:42,609
recall control for grabs if you
installed a new application you don't

286
00:38:42,609 --> 00:40:31,109
have to explain and ice

287
00:40:31,109 --> 00:40:56,390
the only takes up occasionally first
time there's a new beetle uses it all up

288
00:40:56,390 --> 00:41:09,098
memory because they called us $185.00
break the cycle takes a small

289
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:35,319
application start of the full 80 per
following the loss that's just next

290
00:41:35,319 --> 00:41:41,670
morning at the end part way so do you
think he's just a cold mistaken

291
00:41:41,670 --> 00:42:22,180
documentary and this argument is like
the northeast and size

292
00:42:22,180 --> 00:42:55,569
able to the extreme 28 vs nga tonight
but they 28 percent of votes from home

293
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:59,500
they'll be done

294
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:07,660
interesting the top that they create
Paul says or accept some more

295
00:43:07,660 --> 00:43:19,490
interesting functionalities yeah so lots
of just getting overheated watches all

296
00:43:19,490 --> 00:43:24,299
our system that is that our politics
just writing stuff all the expectation

297
00:43:24,300 --> 00:43:34,380
execute the BAC don't like you start to
the vacation obeys any theory also they

298
00:43:34,380 --> 00:43:47,680
like 99% practice a bit yeah we have a
bike lane causing a power pole display

299
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:52,529
case you're running during the
application runtime

300
00:43:52,530 --> 00:43:57,850
execute but the applications privileges
so you don't like crazy and he just

301
00:43:57,850 --> 00:44:05,700
called and he don't use any runtime
overhead we have a small performance it

302
00:44:05,700 --> 00:44:09,350
when you start the application for the
first time then takes a little bit

303
00:44:09,350 --> 00:44:13,460
longer but if you think about survey
pages long running processes those like

304
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:21,520
americans love to be limitations is that
we have right now because all my

305
00:44:21,520 --> 00:44:28,770
memories quality control so because the
car is really hard and be like

306
00:44:28,770 --> 00:44:38,200
compose routes to do hope stripping /
many users just answering so when he

307
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,490
said ok and thereby

308
00:44:40,490 --> 00:44:49,899
remove posts but I just have to certain
parts of that I heard it used but

309
00:44:49,900 --> 00:44:54,770
actually been though says not support
possible and mapping met like it and

310
00:44:54,770 --> 00:44:55,310
make of it

311
00:44:55,310 --> 00:45:00,860
file and then like to make a bite
somewhere in the middle that's just like

312
00:45:00,860 --> 00:45:08,380
not support it but if he had just like
instead of overwriting the quote you can

313
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:16,610
just like unmet readers that he also
have any memory overhead poles have

314
00:45:16,610 --> 00:45:24,980
plagued the lake met the paging yeah
there's also like to compile a little

315
00:45:24,980 --> 00:45:38,660
bit more likes using less assistance
would be nice to just give you right

316
00:45:38,660 --> 00:45:48,129
away with gets the cheese to begin with
need to like pull this is starting to

317
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:53,650
recover their losses with this will
require access to the jalapenos get out

318
00:45:53,650 --> 00:46:00,840
just not going to happen but one thing I
can do is just provide us with Justin

319
00:46:00,840 --> 00:46:06,500
themselves so he could have just a
systematic authority to do so stripping

320
00:46:06,500 --> 00:46:16,960
yeah actually do this thing that could
be done already I couldn't function

321
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:21,490
since I did hit out at compile time the
colossal belonging to the same call

322
00:46:21,490 --> 00:46:24,290
chain next to each other

323
00:46:24,290 --> 00:46:28,960
contingent could he has lots of court
that we could strip all that maybe the

324
00:46:28,960 --> 00:46:29,640
future

325
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:38,618
inhabit posh along that because I can
easy I also like Paula together also

326
00:46:38,619 --> 00:46:45,190
make sure they hoped would be like one
star and garter worries because that he

327
00:46:45,190 --> 00:46:50,750
can be just like also use the changes
that are makeover writing I'm not going

328
00:46:50,750 --> 00:46:55,549
to change the protection for this page

329
00:46:55,549 --> 00:47:09,299
executable like most notably system
dealers and our system more without a

330
00:47:09,299 --> 00:47:10,509
change

331
00:47:10,510 --> 00:47:19,859
applications that makes them so i dnt
have two more minutes

332
00:47:19,859 --> 00:47:30,288
like different things like mom Carla K
of the occasion they contain a large

333
00:47:30,289 --> 00:47:37,319
mobile homes and this folder is
available to the attacker and a nice to

334
00:47:37,319 --> 00:47:42,569
improve the security application
applications and I think he ever got

335
00:47:42,569 --> 00:47:47,430
there and then straight fairy tale that
they are ideal most recent stripping and

336
00:47:47,430 --> 00:47:50,890
unused code works at runtime

337
00:47:50,890 --> 00:48:13,019
applications like everything on your end
of things in life that race helmet

338
00:48:13,019 --> 00:48:53,490
you're going to update its night their
best

339
00:48:53,490 --> 00:49:30,100
the automatic

340
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:39,490
individual that has like automated thing
horace Norris and try to like them too

341
00:49:39,490 --> 00:49:45,560
long because they opened different PDF
small boats in the different maybe try

342
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:53,270
to get as much as possible tonight we
cannot find jobs have you rightly

343
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:58,680
agency you have it brought out a case
you don't have to do think that much but

344
00:49:58,680 --> 00:49:58,899
yet
