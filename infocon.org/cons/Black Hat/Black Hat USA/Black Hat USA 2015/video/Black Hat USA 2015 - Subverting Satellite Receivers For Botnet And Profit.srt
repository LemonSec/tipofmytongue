1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,960
greetings everyone welcome to Black Hat
2015 a couple quick announcements there

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:16,369
will be a reception tonight in the
business call at 5:30 so it's located

3
00:00:16,369 --> 00:00:23,310
not in those rooms so but it's in
Shoreline a second awards will take

4
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:29,848
place tonight Mandalay Bay BCD mandalay
babies Deepti room at 6:30 and I'm just

5
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:34,130
eight ish if you heard it announced that
it was at six has changed have been

6
00:00:34,130 --> 00:00:42,760
moved to 630 and you are currently in
Laguna K

7
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:49,718
witnessing the session with Sophie on
Tom at subverting satellite receivers

8
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:57,050
for a non-profit so I if everyone could
please ensure that you silence your cell

9
00:00:57,050 --> 00:01:04,839
phone and enjoy the fashion

10
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:14,439
in this presentation we will talk a
little bit about pay-tv subscriptions

11
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:22,059
how were the scrambling system works and
we will be much more focusing on some

12
00:01:22,060 --> 00:01:28,009
kind of a target is called capturing and
analyzing the risk

13
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:37,369
behind it I'm sorry I'm working for I
got it was hugely insulting are you know

14
00:01:37,369 --> 00:01:42,409
they're doing reverse engineering I like
playing with different architectures

15
00:01:42,409 --> 00:01:51,329
feel worse and worse and I am
independent

16
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:59,119
point that interests and your tacos into
decryption of control of such

17
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:03,399
communication is the control board is
controlled is the main key to

18
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:10,799
discovering the stream so we'll just
talk a little bit about how much they

19
00:02:10,799 --> 00:02:16,500
pay TV subscription wards and how is the
squirming in doing so we have we have a

20
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:21,889
small overview of what what we are
looking at so on the back and the

21
00:02:21,889 --> 00:02:27,389
screaming is basically based on CW's
what is called control war that is

22
00:02:27,389 --> 00:02:35,440
generated and use it to scramble TV
signal this controlled is then encrypted

23
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:42,069
with providers specifically within one
of the two entitlements missiles one is

24
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:46,649
called the first one is called ASEAN
this one will hold the encrypted control

25
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:52,209
war and then attaching it to the
scrambling system scurrilous stream and

26
00:02:52,209 --> 00:03:00,359
send it to the receiver on the client
side we have generally a smart car which

27
00:03:00,359 --> 00:03:05,680
will decrypt the controlled and
extracted from the ECM and then use it

28
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,480
to describe the system is in general

29
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,149
overview of how pay TV works with this
company is done and how these companies

30
00:03:14,150 --> 00:03:22,310
to know something is going wrong and
everything is going well as well talking

31
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:29,129
about a normal and legal way to watch
pay TV but is based on a provider that

32
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:35,340
is providing some screaming so I'm going
using US comedy and then decrypted on

33
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:44,030
the client side within an official smart
card things that made some changes over

34
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:51,010
the last used is the image or images of
open receivers what we call about

35
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:59,129
open-sided receivers are just some
boxers are no featured in Kleenex boxes

36
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:05,280
they should not only are based on
somebody box and they have the support

37
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:11,849
of money provider all the time every
provider used to have his own set of

38
00:04:11,849 --> 00:04:17,769
boxes that the crypt his own china sets
said I so know with often studied both

39
00:04:17,769 --> 00:04:25,419
such set-top boxes we have a possibility
to host our different providers and be

40
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:34,539
able to accept a lot of different jobs
this made a big evolution into attacking

41
00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:43,520
pay-tv subscriptions so in all times
some kind of artists with was was based

42
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:49,639
about cloning smart cards but no there
is no more usable so people are just

43
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:56,550
using what we call capturing the concept
of cautioning here is the is that a user

44
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:01,430
that has official card decryption card
for the China and he will be able to

45
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:06,870
share it with other users is why we call
it culture and from this concept we have

46
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:10,900
the emergency of some black market that
users are

47
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:17,169
sending torturing access so they sell
actually saw access to some several so

48
00:05:17,169 --> 00:05:19,258
you can decrypt

49
00:05:19,259 --> 00:05:29,979
China's below surface the shower concept
is based on two confidence we have Qatar

50
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:37,380
not is basically a server or not been
satellite receiver that work as a server

51
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:43,979
it has many many official cars that are
linked to connect to it and on the other

52
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:52,000
side we have declined set-top box this
is a general open satellite TV receiver

53
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,590
with our Linux on it you know generally
and it has some components and so what

54
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:04,979
we call against those planes are just a
piece of software that supports specific

55
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:10,270
protocols what happens is that when
they're still receives the satellite

56
00:06:10,270 --> 00:06:17,139
signal it will extract the SEM and TEM
and send them back to us over $3 are not

57
00:06:17,139 --> 00:06:22,289
other time the server will just use the
official cars extract the control world

58
00:06:22,289 --> 00:06:27,490
and send it back to their baby so that
way the city will be able to decrypt the

59
00:06:27,490 --> 00:06:36,490
discomfort of the signal and show the
clear PVC so the main components here

60
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:41,620
are what we call us play against those
are software started running on little

61
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:48,210
box we can list some of them the RCC can
and you can and then they support some

62
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:55,219
protocols in which they used to send the
entitlement messages and receive the

63
00:06:55,220 --> 00:07:00,830
courtroom were to decrypt the shining on
the other side we have some people that

64
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:02,859
are acting like

65
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:08,560
providers those guys you know you host
the show me those guys are just host the

66
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:15,310
server at home and they have official
subscription counts and they offer

67
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,909
access to the client's

68
00:07:17,909 --> 00:07:26,370
payment system or just and style or give
sometimes they even give it for free

69
00:07:26,370 --> 00:07:30,080
really give some plugins for those
problems will be installed on the set of

70
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:43,479
books so they will be able to talk about
those devices that are connected on

71
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:49,539
internet running some and trusted
software and connected to some unknown

72
00:07:49,539 --> 00:08:00,409
servers I mean what could go wrong
actually so this is a teardown also one

73
00:08:00,409 --> 00:08:05,569
of the receiver and I've been playing
with and you can see that they are

74
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:13,199
almost computers they are no more than
acceptable so this one for example has

75
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:19,680
taken it work on Utah's STI 7111 they
see I seventy one element is is a

76
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:26,229
process or not is mainly designed for
little boxes actually it features all

77
00:08:26,229 --> 00:08:31,440
they needed from the scrambling system
inputs and outputs experience actually

78
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:38,059
designed for being a processor for
set-top box within that process or we

79
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:43,448
have a CPU that actually are too far
four hundred and fifty megahertz its

80
00:08:43,448 --> 00:08:50,560
Ansh Ward 32 bit super large picture we
can see that we have all the companies

81
00:08:50,560 --> 00:09:01,859
that need my PC USB USB hard so we have
like two Gigabit costs and fees

82
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:09,420
so all this you can buck one of those
sodomy need computers that are almost

83
00:09:09,420 --> 00:09:20,120
stronger and better than 10 years ago up
fifteen years ago so what's the thing is

84
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:26,700
that there are no more they are not
simple setup just computers connected to

85
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:35,310
internet I think I have been working and
playing with superstar Shah Rukh Khan

86
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:41,609
and reversing some application I found a
lot of anonymity both into the design

87
00:09:41,610 --> 00:09:47,209
and onto the soft words themselves so
basically on the design on all the

88
00:09:47,209 --> 00:09:53,790
devices I've been running and playing
with I seen that for example everything

89
00:09:53,790 --> 00:09:57,649
rustles good there is no segregation
there's nothing there is no file in

90
00:09:57,649 --> 00:10:03,360
style cherry one of them had used to
have a firewall but I did Davis but was

91
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:07,230
not working because the system was
mounted as it is so actually they are

92
00:10:07,230 --> 00:10:11,560
not designed to be secure the software
that are running on them are mostly

93
00:10:11,560 --> 00:10:16,810
coming from a trusted sources and don't
people are running them and they are

94
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:25,359
mostly mostly focusing on just offering
social media access YouTube access and

95
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:35,829
live it takes part of it remotely yes I
build a small tune that had been me to

96
00:10:35,829 --> 00:10:41,420
scan some networking I'm just see you
just detect some

97
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:48,219
either settle some dark lines or
counselors have been able to find some

98
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:52,800
of them and they aren't directly
connected to internet so there are some

99
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:59,569
bugs like remote authenticated access to
some features like scheduled tasks like

100
00:10:59,570 --> 00:11:04,640
streaming you can stake someone's video
was what is he watching and streaming

101
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:10,020
remotely and there are some bugs that
literally or do something what I would

102
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:19,780
caution the other site he comes to the
wrong things actually we are just

103
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:26,850
getting closer as we can see that that
those devices like really are not

104
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:31,210
designed to be secure and and a hard
they are in the hands of the end user

105
00:11:31,210 --> 00:11:37,220
devices are not like ICS devices or
something like this I've been playing

106
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:43,520
with as the end user is unaware and has
no idea about the risk and no one of

107
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:52,470
those and user will set up and if I were
rules or anything to protect his house

108
00:11:52,470 --> 00:11:56,880
to work so generally we have the main
reseller that can do anything what he

109
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:02,670
wants with his current server he can she
nato's fungus just developers that

110
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:07,069
develop those players but no one knows
where they can actually those provided

111
00:12:07,070 --> 00:12:13,930
what they do they either through that on
forum on sharing forums or black hat

112
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:20,750
forums or something like that and just
promote some free TV they do also send

113
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:25,530
them to some receptors receptors are
just having a big i cant where they

114
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:32,970
create users and provide the end user
forum for substance in my country is

115
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:38,850
about if you pay for $3 monthly or the
China sticker over like thousands of

116
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:42,440
channels tickets for free you just need
internet connection and install Vikings

117
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:48,640
are downloaded from internet and put it
on your set-top box so

118
00:12:48,640 --> 00:12:54,530
the users generally just don't know this
and they are just seeking freedom me so

119
00:12:54,530 --> 00:13:00,430
they just don't know those plugging them
into a USB K and took place in the set

120
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:01,479
up a box

121
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:07,320
this is the general way office trying to
settle some of them are closed and they

122
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:14,020
need you to to take them to to the
recycler and that's a receiver we just

123
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:24,390
installed the software on your so what's
wrong with not that the thing is that my

124
00:13:24,390 --> 00:13:29,800
main concern was no software are
interested actually we don't know who

125
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:36,770
put them with the event who is behind I
did a little little bit of research and

126
00:13:36,770 --> 00:13:43,310
so did the same plugin for example for I
mean like 45 copies and I've been

127
00:13:43,310 --> 00:13:46,689
landing on some different harshest
different stuff so people are playing

128
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:51,950
with those are changing stuff in there
and are doing so that's a concern and we

129
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:58,310
cannot track who is doing this in my
contacts for example we have resellers

130
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:00,849
that acts in some way

131
00:14:00,850 --> 00:14:07,000
legal way because there is no law
enforcement against them so they just go

132
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:10,360
just go to the shop take your set-top
box and they are still the stuff on it

133
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:16,190
so it's totally legally but no one knows
what they are doing all the boxes for

134
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:22,130
the end user is seeking freedom is so
he's just running on the forums and just

135
00:14:22,130 --> 00:14:26,760
downloading some plugins put them in the
USB and it started I'm hoping that she

136
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:33,459
would have three did you actually

137
00:14:33,459 --> 00:14:39,018
so things we have the user that is lol
about what's happening in he said the

138
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:44,529
books he's just trying anything we don't
know those stuff without comment and

139
00:14:44,529 --> 00:14:51,069
something to go wrong that's I've been
talking with some people that are

140
00:14:51,069 --> 00:15:00,240
working on this coaching staff and they
have an estimation of for millions

141
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,910
device connected on capturing in my
country so basically you can't just

142
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:10,689
count like three to four set-top boxes
connected to internet powerhouse in

143
00:15:10,689 --> 00:15:17,540
general because this is the big case
into third world country also because

144
00:15:17,540 --> 00:15:23,219
they don't have you know satellite TV
provider services that it's so they just

145
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:34,329
seek capturing just keeps getting more
yes in my county for example every time

146
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:38,739
you buy a set top box they will offer
you when you stop solution for free so

147
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:46,089
they are just so they are just promoting
arrest and using it to sell more and

148
00:15:46,089 --> 00:15:54,980
more and more boxes so just us more
similar you're thinking about i mean if

149
00:15:54,980 --> 00:16:00,749
someone like a provider or seller are
any closer to ten just throw into the

150
00:16:00,749 --> 00:16:07,240
war and any those plugin if one of those
programs has anybody else or has any

151
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:16,290
malicious code on it this will lead to
share all it will be massive dick will

152
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:21,029
be able to build upon a true those
devices are those the slices are Linux

153
00:16:21,029 --> 00:16:30,249
boxes actually not out of just ruining
everything as we go through a couple of

154
00:16:30,249 --> 00:16:36,490
small demons the first one is just the
way I use generally to root those

155
00:16:36,490 --> 00:16:37,709
devices

156
00:16:37,709 --> 00:16:40,888
some of them will be were closed I
didn't have access to them

157
00:16:40,889 --> 00:16:50,109
so this is why I acted like a malicious
user and just put a small coordinate to

158
00:16:50,109 --> 00:16:59,189
throw me a river so let's stop and I
just have of CNN it's QEMU based as much

159
00:16:59,189 --> 00:17:06,589
for Debian so lest down is the window

160
00:17:06,589 --> 00:17:12,948
share I will just as a solution to the
box and use it just to create any

161
00:17:12,949 --> 00:17:19,659
finally I want in this case is just a
small piece of cord that acts as a

162
00:17:19,659 --> 00:17:27,519
reverse shell just connects back to my
IP on port 4444 and just drop me a

163
00:17:27,519 --> 00:17:32,740
certain that so this could be the case
of any software that is downloaded or

164
00:17:32,740 --> 00:17:49,270
installed on those boxes so we use gcc
just combine it

165
00:17:49,270 --> 00:17:51,120
so

166
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:59,270
the main idea is that this plugin has a
specific structure is it should have a

167
00:17:59,270 --> 00:18:04,110
plugin folder and then decided some
different all the supporters one of them

168
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:10,040
the most important is the big for that
child's heart binary itself to be start

169
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:20,700
so we can see that this is where the
research support US it's like a search

170
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:31,440
for a search for is the 32 bit version
so I just copy but fine into the USB

171
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,539
chain to plug in

172
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:38,680
midfielder

173
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:57,650
and just i plug the USB came into the
city bus

174
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:05,420
time the plugging it in stock and then
it will reboot so we'll skip a little

175
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:17,240
part of this video because the devices
just awaiting once rebooted

176
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:22,410
we will clearly see that our software is
just instructor and will be running

177
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:26,350
actually there's still a two-run it
either manually or automatically are

178
00:19:26,350 --> 00:19:35,379
terrible time every time you devote its
raining so so here is the list of

179
00:19:35,380 --> 00:19:39,320
targets that are installed on the device
I was being playing with them

180
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:44,919
those supports many kind of software and
we have the route me one but is there

181
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:52,780
really start if we just started with the
remote control we just really just have

182
00:19:52,780 --> 00:20:03,530
a reverse charity so this is easy way

183
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:09,840
simulating and pregnant standard use it
to get her cell and with the demise and

184
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:21,909
then this this device is actually
running everything else road so was

185
00:20:21,910 --> 00:20:27,360
routed we can go to the same video this
is a video that I used up again I just

186
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,149
inserted our back door into the plugin
that is called

187
00:20:31,150 --> 00:20:39,710
I got this will trigger a reversal
whenever you you are just jumping from

188
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:42,940
one Chinese one other child so just
you're switching from one china doll

189
00:20:42,940 --> 00:20:48,400
China tries to decrypt the channel you
have to go through this is a unique way

190
00:20:48,400 --> 00:21:01,490
to half a bottle into those suppliers
and the same

191
00:21:01,490 --> 00:21:10,170
so here we can still something that went
really so I actually we have people

192
00:21:10,170 --> 00:21:16,070
running things on those devices without
no large and in August when the user

193
00:21:16,070 --> 00:21:24,590
that he doesn't have any idea what I was
ecstatic easy anyone could easily with

194
00:21:24,590 --> 00:21:30,020
something promoted over the internet for
free that's a lot of people actually

195
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:34,610
promoting those kind of software over
the internet and there's tons of people

196
00:21:34,610 --> 00:21:39,678
are installing that so you can just
promote your software just throwing you

197
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:44,940
can just spend like a couple of hundred
boxes get official cars and you can do

198
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:50,030
whatever you want you can give people
for free tv and just opening the boxes

199
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:58,750
so the result that we talked about it
will be a botnet the best thing is that

200
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:03,770
you will be able to access land area
network you will be able to see the

201
00:22:03,770 --> 00:22:07,639
computers and everything that is
connected to the line

202
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:14,180
I've personally seen during some of this
some companies that are using culture

203
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:23,330
did this happen before actually 2012
even have a friend that working on ever

204
00:22:23,330 --> 00:22:30,399
seen one of those plugins he was one of
them that he found on internet that

205
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:37,290
actually was grabbing configuration
files from the city boxers and copying

206
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:42,129
those accounts and information about the
car but are shared and sending them to

207
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:49,230
some specific ideas so we don't know
actually if those we're just optical

208
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:55,130
stealing accounts to sell them again or
something like this all just maybe there

209
00:22:55,130 --> 00:23:00,850
was providers service providers that was
new clean to counterattack culturing and

210
00:23:00,850 --> 00:23:06,909
just doesn't information about the cars
and the people and just broken up the

211
00:23:06,910 --> 00:23:11,310
chance two minutes to get there and
fortunately I personally don't see I see

212
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:17,990
actually asked to do this because it's
not easy to educate and you actually

213
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:22,780
they are devices that are used in to the
secure identity or something like this

214
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:27,000
we will have people that care about this
kicks in and doing things but here we

215
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:31,890
are doing about the end user that mainly
don't have no idea and you just want to

216
00:23:31,890 --> 00:23:39,390
watch TV and the thing is that we are
not able to talk about piracy and go to

217
00:23:39,390 --> 00:23:45,450
those guys to put some standards and so
security rules we don't all sorts of

218
00:23:45,450 --> 00:23:53,160
that's a little little bit of work that
is being done in order to just think

219
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,830
it'd take control board between

220
00:23:55,830 --> 00:24:00,668
the transfer so so the articles will not
be able to intercept the quarter award

221
00:24:00,669 --> 00:24:10,039
and it will make things much more
difficult to do something like us on

222
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:16,750
price we have millions of devices that
are connected to internet and they are

223
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:23,200
not designed to be secure they are
between the hand of the end user that

224
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,309
has no idea on what's happening and we
can see that all the software that are

225
00:24:28,309 --> 00:24:33,510
running on them are coming from a
trusted source and no one is knowledge

226
00:24:33,510 --> 00:24:42,490
on what is happening inside and what
they are doing it was chance thank you
