1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,569
hi good morning thank you for coming to
the charge on my knees and lots of

2
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:11,889
problems to go to university damaged in
Germany and also collaborated Research

3
00:00:11,889 --> 00:00:17,279
Institute for a secure computing
Christopher and I are going to present

4
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:22,830
this dog is a joint work with our
colleagues from UC Irvine unit

5
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:30,679
incorporation to the title suggests that
this is a defensive work it's not to

6
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:37,760
worry about tax based on our experience
of several last year's on runtime I tax

7
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:49,610
general philippe son could use a tax
just motivates is amazing that after so

8
00:00:49,610 --> 00:00:57,280
many years you are still concerned with
many problems that are actually three

9
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:06,030
decades old legacy is actually the
problem is even more functionality we

10
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:15,880
sacrifice security for this is the more
complex nearly everybody has access to

11
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:22,560
smartphones and thousands and hundreds
thousands of applications and the

12
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,409
situation is not changing so we have
many developers developers with

13
00:01:27,409 --> 00:01:39,079
different ages and if not it's something
that seems to be very attractive to the

14
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:44,389
research community community not only
did he was also an industrial research

15
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:47,509
is that how can we

16
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:55,950
securities from insecure code it sounds
a bit thought somehow contradictory but

17
00:01:55,950 --> 00:02:01,090
it seems that this is a general
understanding that is currently we just

18
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:11,120
need to protect or LASIK and this is
actually one of the I would like to just

19
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:33,989
the fact that just protect the more
reason you are not going to end so I

20
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:41,640
just some of the attacks that have been
published at least we know about

21
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:52,849
interesting the many of these one-time
tax reviews the community you but not

22
00:02:52,849 --> 00:03:06,078
really just as they started to see my
colleague to get their tasks that regard

23
00:03:06,079 --> 00:03:14,709
software security so one of the due to
technical difficulties a portion of this

24
00:03:14,709 --> 00:03:19,019
presentation was not recorded we're
joining the program already in progress

25
00:03:19,019 --> 00:03:31,810
very short they return instruction and
when you put them together because

26
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:38,709
gadget because they realize they
implement a certain tasks like Lord

27
00:03:38,709 --> 00:03:50,790
store and gadgets and it's it's a
debatable but we generated program can

28
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:56,620
be seen as a generalization of return to
leave see ok how does it work just a

29
00:03:56,620 --> 00:04:02,690
simple example if you have a program
stack and let CDs are the gadgets that

30
00:04:02,690 --> 00:04:07,870
sequences of destruction that the
adversary wants to Jeju you there then

31
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:16,039
each of them is has kind of creature so
usually as she wants to change their

32
00:04:16,039 --> 00:04:25,130
content of registers so first and then
the attic of his or her stuff on this

33
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:33,020
and this is country consisting of return
addresses and also doing it wants to

34
00:04:33,020 --> 00:04:40,640
compute with this is stack pointer and
then the first return address when you

35
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:44,930
just go to the shares sequence which is
the first gadget for example and then

36
00:04:44,930 --> 00:04:55,469
moved to return a return to understand
second sequence where the register

37
00:04:55,469 --> 00:05:02,110
values are popped and change the content
of the register based on the values that

38
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:12,950
has already jews and then it goes again
so kind of that is just continuing until

39
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:21,219
the Yankees complete so this is the
principal of the basic problems also

40
00:05:21,219 --> 00:05:28,700
what's your solution is that when you
use your issue is how big should be

41
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:34,260
scheduled space that I can still run an
attack so I can put my gadgets to get it

42
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:40,950
and since it is shown that Robert acts
are actually completed means you can

43
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:47,500
generate the program so we can change
together whether you want you to either

44
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:53,310
one whatever malicious code you want
from that point of view there is

45
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:59,650
actually no point to say how big my
space could be the answer to that

46
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:07,729
because it has been shown that a very
small space called space you can run

47
00:06:07,729 --> 00:06:10,650
such a decision

48
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:15,448
what is the address in general you're
talking about and also the solution that

49
00:06:15,449 --> 00:06:23,259
you're going to prison where the
application codes you have data and yes

50
00:06:23,259 --> 00:06:32,720
he has also scripting capabilities
because most example this and we also

51
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:37,770
assume that protections of mothers
systems like all writable or executable

52
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:45,280
are already in place so we make this
work harder also be assumed that there

53
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:50,090
is an addition because most of the real
world systems they are using a cell are

54
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:59,510
in conventional sense so to say but we
ask you about the address disclosed

55
00:06:59,510 --> 00:07:07,060
memory formation again right to the
memory and you can also perform

56
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:20,479
arbitrary competition because inches is
working for the other topic currently

57
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:32,110
and security conference paper as attacks
on its going on so there are two main

58
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:38,870
defenses that have been in this area one
of them is called randomization

59
00:07:38,870 --> 00:07:42,210
general bir zeit she could visit you and
the other one is controlled through a

60
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:49,000
pic btw so in this talk we are going to
focus on core domination but let me just

61
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:52,539
give you a flavour of what is actually
in general the big picture

62
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:59,479
differences between them so they pros
and cons of randomization has no

63
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:08,719
performance because it just randomized
pick something in your memory because

64
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:14,460
you can use it for you can use it for
more complex software like your browser

65
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,659
for operating system

66
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:20,520
however if you have information
disclosure or you outlaw entropy

67
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:30,120
randomization and you can break gives
you some kind of formal assurance

68
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:35,890
because if you remember about the
control of the code and accords a

69
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:45,400
security check at every branch II the
best case would be if not what was

70
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:52,880
intended by the developer is if not you
just stop the execution so you can also

71
00:08:52,880 --> 00:09:03,260
do a formal night is on that in practice
beside the fact that you can't get a

72
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:11,460
complete control program a real precise
12 is also changed OPP performance and

73
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:14,830
security because when you do so many
chicks were or ban Chi it gets very

74
00:09:14,830 --> 00:09:19,920
inefficient and so you need to make
compromise and compromise compromise

75
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:28,490
security many times the last 34 years
challenging to use it for a complex

76
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:36,560
office so random isolation is in our
most of you know what is and isn't there

77
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:44,910
something which is called fire alarm so
you don't you join just you don't just

78
00:09:44,910 --> 00:09:53,189
push random upset your your moral your
memory just tried to make it more

79
00:09:53,190 --> 00:10:00,260
complicated what does it mean if you
structure returns you can do things you

80
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:10,770
can do not cease to function even go to
the structure to randomize instruction

81
00:10:10,770 --> 00:10:16,360
of buses and there have been lots of
everything this area

82
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:24,770
unfortunately fine on my session was
shown to be more about the so-called

83
00:10:24,770 --> 00:10:29,740
dropped just-in-time returns a program
presented by assets

84
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:39,400
blackout 2013 actually I mean come to
that so what did not sit on their minds

85
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:45,990
and you find the migration scheme it
shows that memory disclosure of which

86
00:10:45,990 --> 00:10:51,610
was for many people who are working in
in in cybersecurity that's created

87
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:58,280
memories realistic assumption that you
get from your memory is a function point

88
00:10:58,280 --> 00:11:08,010
to any other address something which is
there but it is not so crucial very

89
00:11:08,010 --> 00:11:18,080
crucial years and it has been shown that
you can do that real world explodes so

90
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:29,430
how does it work I just explained to you
shortly how does so we want to that

91
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:37,250
leads to the leak of the whole memory
page so you have like a function pointer

92
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:46,580
and you have a memory memory pages let
sit for cube Italian memory so we know

93
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:52,460
the app can simply computer starting and
ending point and then we know that this

94
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:54,450
page

95
00:11:54,450 --> 00:12:00,700
dysfunction you know the address so if
you see this page

96
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:06,690
maybe a call to another function
function be from dats we have another

97
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:13,970
point at another page that page as well
and that goes on at runtime through with

98
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:24,720
the engine off the money as you ok so in
that sense to generate enough gadgets

99
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:33,200
you can put them together and puts a
dent chaining together to achieve your

100
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:38,170
goals and these are just examples for
interrupt though the enforceability

101
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:46,370
movie and then you can also ultimate
eyes out by just using a high level

102
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:57,850
language so that we just don't have to
do everything manually it has been shown

103
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:08,120
that it's very crucial attack so all the
techniques need to add their defenses to

104
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:18,490
be so now this should show you all the
actually just summarize all there for

105
00:13:18,490 --> 00:13:29,070
the past two years on how to let's say
mitigates thanks like I was talking

106
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:34,550
about so we saw the game you summarize a
senior pointed pointed his career can

107
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:42,790
simply bypass is just around him off six
then you have finally begun to my

108
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:51,760
station Dr one was bypassed drop and we
have direct which is actually what did

109
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:59,240
properties is exploiting directly call
it if you have a point you have a direct

110
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:13,760
access to the whole code page so how can
we just meet record page only so you

111
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:19,020
have the point of the candidates however
it has been shown that this is a problem

112
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:23,590
itself because there is something that
should be called you find that they

113
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:28,720
could get the court appointed to the
cold but not the court itself is enough

114
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:39,820
information to put it just chain again
our guys it's what we do and this is why

115
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:43,050
it is talk is all about where to go

116
00:14:43,050 --> 00:14:48,479
it is called point of hiding in
christopher's going to explain that I

117
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,410
want that mean it means that if he
doesn't know where

118
00:14:52,410 --> 00:15:00,779
r the court . hurts like we chose
function tables or return addresses are

119
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:09,699
that is done by only one obvious and
this is using to good old idea of

120
00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:33,149
Chamblee jumps but there's no actually
of the codes ok no problem is the

121
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:41,310
address that he may have some of those
addresses which is in the list of

122
00:15:41,310 --> 00:15:49,420
trampling so for that we need to kind of
escape his view and this is done by

123
00:15:49,420 --> 00:15:55,240
prime-time isolation of the registers in
that case you want to break the gadget

124
00:15:55,240 --> 00:16:05,130
this crazy is the perfect solution
because you have a certain number of

125
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:15,240
limited number of registers and there
are ways to bypass that just think that

126
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:25,389
there's also a solution so this was the
community community but also them does

127
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:27,290
your research community

128
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:42,170
hiding and they raised the bar so this
is a very good news and explains you

129
00:16:42,170 --> 00:16:48,949
this dog is called read actor it's a
defensive system as I mention how to

130
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:57,079
resist memory disclosure with more
detail

131
00:16:57,080 --> 00:17:08,370
no yeah yeah yeah I'm going to explain
how it works

132
00:17:08,369 --> 00:17:17,379
would be implemented and what we
actually be first overview of our goals

133
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:23,500
is also essential to secure won't appear
and be called real attacks on just

134
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:25,490
mentioned and we do

135
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:35,980
memory disclosure is one of the biggest
read to you can read our two still runs

136
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:43,840
a secret you can do it we want to be
comprehensive that means we don't only

137
00:17:43,840 --> 00:17:56,139
want to protect but also jet boat it
should be we don't want to protect her

138
00:17:56,140 --> 00:18:04,800
what application although in this case
we want to protect itself so to really

139
00:18:04,800 --> 00:18:13,000
and of course we want to meet because
nobody's going to use also provides

140
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:26,730
perfect security over a hundred chart
100% prevent direct member who told you

141
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:32,190
just have to ensure that adversary
cannot reach a code pages however in

142
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:39,590
practice there are some challenges so
there was some previous on implementing

143
00:18:39,590 --> 00:18:56,500
solutions which are secure so it
automatically when we want to have a

144
00:18:56,500 --> 00:19:05,510
memory loss and of course it should run
on current so we don't want to

145
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:19,080
and the way we do this we first give you
a quick recap on how memory protection

146
00:19:19,080 --> 00:19:29,530
in general books on 86 so we have
addresses which gets translated hav two

147
00:19:29,530 --> 00:19:36,660
physical a person's physical after this
your new remember during the translation

148
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:43,890
memory management unit and for some
missions however the advantage

149
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:53,190
disadvantage is that as soon as your
code page executed it was also reading

150
00:19:53,190 --> 00:20:04,590
their sites short black which she only
wanted this basic but not readable H

151
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:15,100
wright also read a book also executed by
the way he enters this issue another bit

152
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:28,850
which it should not be executable only
however if we should lose Asian we

153
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:34,730
actually add another layer of
translation oor

154
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:54,090
which then to oppose physical really at
a loss to the permission it's

155
00:20:54,090 --> 00:21:02,389
individually weekends at page should
only be executed and the effective

156
00:21:02,390 --> 00:21:10,480
commission for page has been deter-
mined by Andy just and the sanitation we

157
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:22,060
can actually called pages is it only for
all the pages we basically

158
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:30,120
annotation to retry text so that if the
mission of the page is determined by the

159
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:38,840
commission said any patient because it
shows how we can achieve and memory

160
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:49,540
disclosure as mentioned before they're
still this thing called to order this

161
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:51,220
actually works

162
00:21:51,220 --> 00:21:58,900
location where we have only memory and
evidence and we have two functions fine

163
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:06,090
grained running as a sheen attach the
financial order can no longer know where

164
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:11,159
these functions are located at Eckerd
thats know that we only parry take

165
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:15,220
actions and that the content of it
functioned as though the same so the

166
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:21,730
only instructions remainders say and
what the attacker and pointers to these

167
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:28,320
functions she doesn't matter whether I
should point or points beginning of our

168
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:36,419
into the middle section 12 somewhere in
the function instructions within the

169
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:44,420
function and then get get those gadgets
that we do

170
00:22:44,420 --> 00:22:49,880
underwriting I don't know if you're
familiar with the matter was computer

171
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:55,010
scientist David he wants that all
programs in computer science

172
00:22:55,010 --> 00:23:05,680
another levitt let-up in direction and
added another layout erection problem

173
00:23:05,680 --> 00:23:13,150
basically just jump direct instruction
however since there is an excuse only

174
00:23:13,150 --> 00:23:14,659
memory

175
00:23:14,659 --> 00:23:22,450
not disclose the nation so why the
attacker do you know the address of the

176
00:23:22,450 --> 00:23:29,769
trampoline it up on a wedding chapel
train is going to an application where

177
00:23:29,769 --> 00:23:38,609
which do you think and just use a
trampoline and then go into the phone

178
00:23:38,609 --> 00:23:47,580
also permit hate the auto detect just
trampling address and then also on the

179
00:23:47,580 --> 00:24:08,070
others are designed so what we did it so
one of the most crucial things that are

180
00:24:08,070 --> 00:24:13,439
new compiler does not put her into the
code section of code section would be

181
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:24,070
marked as X program wants to use it was
just press Next we find something is a

182
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:33,529
shin and far more cheap way of a
performance to run in the nation and you

183
00:24:33,529 --> 00:24:40,340
also do just renovation which I could
come to nato again and of course we put

184
00:24:40,340 --> 00:24:53,428
on divergent views within the company
and we can do so at runtime basically

185
00:24:53,429 --> 00:25:00,369
looks like this we implemented very
there's really just a memory which is

186
00:25:00,369 --> 00:25:10,220
Asian and can be done in like it really
only a memory virtualization and sets up

187
00:25:10,220 --> 00:25:18,289
the extended page tables only memory of
the operating system Alabama system so

188
00:25:18,289 --> 00:25:24,499
that such action required anymore and I
we also did some modification to the

189
00:25:24,499 --> 00:25:26,100
operating system because

190
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:37,730
I mean there's only memory may 26
minutes we also had to change the

191
00:25:37,730 --> 00:25:42,020
operating system a bit to make use of
the future that we are providing the

192
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:48,639
iPod is up from there on we can run both
application like every decade

193
00:25:48,640 --> 00:25:53,110
applications which protected post which
would justify the operating system that

194
00:25:53,110 --> 00:25:59,610
every quote page only as well as legacy
applications web application will just

195
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:03,799
say ok I want to like okay just as
readable and executable so we don't

196
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:08,260
break anything we can have protected and
unprotected applications on the census

197
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:16,750
it might look not so good high-powered
in there and actually it's also not

198
00:26:16,750 --> 00:26:25,400
needed anymore we finish our work today
announced that protection which are

199
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:30,470
meant to be purchased at to protect his
memory however we can also exploit this

200
00:26:30,470 --> 00:26:45,450
featured memory so it depends on how we
can protect time compiled code is like

201
00:26:45,450 --> 00:26:56,179
sophisticated attacks a nominee not
launched against you want us to protect

202
00:26:56,179 --> 00:27:00,340
our

203
00:27:00,340 --> 00:27:10,760
which announced through respecting
engines so we want our document and they

204
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:19,890
have to post it both as a little bit
hard to protect our different because it

205
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:28,320
changes are needed at the code is
actually treated as coordinating the way

206
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:35,220
we solve this problem is that we
separate the two separate the place

207
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:39,690
where the compiler needs cheat because
as

208
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:51,389
later words can be treated as a code
ordering optimism optimization is

209
00:27:51,389 --> 00:28:09,000
applied as read and write as executable
so there's a solution and to compile the

210
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:24,990
next in the nation we want to see how
can we apply our solutions and we did

211
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:32,570
this during their pending so far we
actually took this I don't know if

212
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:39,450
you're from you with that connection
program which get some input and that

213
00:28:39,450 --> 00:28:49,889
you apply it on some occasions and it
measures are you set to be comparable

214
00:28:49,889 --> 00:28:59,850
because everybody is using it but we
also use the chromium benchmarks for

215
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:22,649
protecting the chromium and we also
wanted by the JavaScript engine only 80

216
00:29:22,649 --> 00:29:31,949
test everything so performance sunburns
are mostly in their early though we have

217
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:42,730
some sparks let's focus on the geometric
mean of our solution and you can see you

218
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:52,070
bet we reject or so every protection and
able to get roughly 60% overhead

219
00:29:52,070 --> 00:29:59,460
notice that enabling an excuse

220
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:05,820
already this introduces two-percent
overhead using two different way to

221
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:19,450
execute only memory into protecting our
rnd 16 at age table is only good captain

222
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:31,920
performance by another 2% 1% overhead
which is also did for me eighteen inches

223
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:34,130
and every day

224
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:41,920
number so between 62 and 7% over at and
actually the chromium browser for its

225
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:45,820
benchmarks we only get so which tests
may need the smoothness and

226
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:53,450
responsiveness of the web pages and we
only get 4% over if you use a chromium

227
00:30:53,450 --> 00:31:08,390
protection applied you you don't
actually know what is our yes we can

228
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:12,920
resilience against direct and indirect
memory disposer

229
00:31:12,920 --> 00:31:18,800
Dec attack a basic into dancing really
ensure that every

230
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:27,080
executable code resides in an unreadable
memory what we cannot prevent as an

231
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:37,810
attack are disclosed the following to
some renovation also there is a reminder

232
00:31:37,810 --> 00:31:44,090
we have to assume that sooner or later
you will get access to every time and

233
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:46,580
there are actually two types of

234
00:31:46,580 --> 00:31:53,530
we have trampoline which which dumped
into the coats and at function and

235
00:31:53,530 --> 00:32:01,639
usually 12 a.m. for champions with some
code one thing redundant program heavily

236
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:05,049
depends on his data individual

237
00:32:05,049 --> 00:32:13,029
so for example it wants to do another
programming to execute its system he

238
00:32:13,029 --> 00:32:20,119
wants to make sure that you that one
uses one gadget which note a specific

239
00:32:20,119 --> 00:32:30,009
value into US Pacific register and
randomization we can ensure that was

240
00:32:30,009 --> 00:32:36,889
used for example to resume will no
longer use it just a bit maybe BC or D

241
00:32:36,889 --> 00:32:44,418
and this will break the attacks are
there some kind of Japanese which ended

242
00:32:44,419 --> 00:32:51,989
a function beginning and actually this
doesn't make a difference me take a like

243
00:32:51,989 --> 00:32:59,629
if he has a trampoline with some sushi
function in case you would be he can

244
00:32:59,629 --> 00:33:05,009
execute function actually have shown
that we can also launched during

245
00:33:05,009 --> 00:33:13,090
computer text so there's anything as
basically using virtual functions and

246
00:33:13,090 --> 00:33:22,109
here's how we protect our retailers
Taylor functions action taken into two

247
00:33:22,109 --> 00:33:28,720
parts one heart resides in my memory and
only contains a pointer to the exit to

248
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:35,389
the part which is only memory and here
we began champions however we don't only

249
00:33:35,389 --> 00:33:42,029
have trampolines we should use some
entries which when executed just

250
00:33:42,029 --> 00:33:47,769
terminate the program and we do this
because let's face it we have a table

251
00:33:47,769 --> 00:33:55,359
which has only two entries on it and
just by using brute force attack which

252
00:33:55,359 --> 00:34:05,009
resided with snow patient but since we
first increase in entropy and also a bit

253
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:12,569
of resilience against executed
automatically shut down the program and

254
00:34:12,569 --> 00:34:17,929
possibly also maybe not as an intrusion
detection

255
00:34:17,929 --> 00:34:26,190
that we don't want to I don't know that
we make sure that specific webpage on

256
00:34:26,190 --> 00:34:36,970
specific documented this limits the
ability to boot for everything and again

257
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:42,638
at the next area so they never know
where the booby trap this entry is filed

258
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:47,559
the application which was compiled using
which is aware of the Jets and the

259
00:34:47,559 --> 00:35:05,450
opposite and use it without breaking our
R&D tax credit this is acknowledged by

260
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:12,069
the industry we have seen that Microsoft
and they've been up against these

261
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:24,290
attacks however they have to legacy
combined so there's always some way

262
00:35:24,290 --> 00:35:31,980
around it would protect the first opera
execute only memory memory organization

263
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:43,480
for current 86 up against both direct
and indirect disposer and we can protect

264
00:35:43,480 --> 00:36:02,470
its coat are the chromium browser coming
soon actually I don't know so we talk

265
00:36:02,470 --> 00:36:17,230
about reactor as a solution also be
called reactor plus plus which is as I

266
00:36:17,230 --> 00:36:24,589
was mentioning how you can protect
against hold function reuse is our new

267
00:36:24,589 --> 00:36:29,040
attacks that actually she said

268
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:36,600
are similar to return to live set
something many many years but still

269
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:42,040
challenging to

270
00:36:42,040 --> 00:36:52,009
currently is also to give us your
partner is how to use these techniques

271
00:36:52,010 --> 00:37:02,230
and migration techniques for my bad
forms and because they have another

272
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:12,250
world maybe did support for execute only
nothing all platforms and I don't know

273
00:37:12,250 --> 00:37:22,000
who you are familiar with embedded
systems security is a mess and embedded

274
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:30,330
systems are used in many states even
safety-critical applications from walt

275
00:37:30,330 --> 00:37:40,430
would have to stop these attacks I mean
the program maybe it is to advance but

276
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:45,850
there are enjoying the dramatics on
embedded systems and sees this this area

277
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:51,850
is not explored as as you see and
several area I'm sure that in future

278
00:37:51,850 --> 00:38:01,299
attacks and the buzzword is here are you
at ease things for me

279
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:07,190
connected to each other and that we have
an entire nation because once you take

280
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:14,100
one off then maybe you can cross over
that's a fiction to other devices

281
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:23,880
this is why I person beside aspect of my
vision because it is also for embedded

282
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:29,960
systems one thing that we are also
considering is approaches as I mentioned

283
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:37,650
at the beginning like country and
collaboration with Intel ver

284
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:43,279
at the base control for integrity as a
good option

285
00:38:43,279 --> 00:38:49,720
this is another touchdown run to my
