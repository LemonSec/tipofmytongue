1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,310
thank you very much for staying to the
end of this i know im what's between you

2
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:07,798
and a party I'm going to try to make it
entertaining hour by telling you some

3
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:12,719
creepy things so I sometimes known as
dr. creepy because there were two book

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,980
called techno Creek and then that I
identified lots of things that were

5
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,150
creepy one of them of course his
password and we all know that passwords

6
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:25,939
are vital but they didn't used to be
vital it was a time in fact when our

7
00:00:25,939 --> 00:00:30,000
passwords were very different from the
way they are now so one of the

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,930
possibilities to have for a password is
just the computer so if you have

9
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:38,629
physical and i'm having a physical
problem here

10
00:00:38,629 --> 00:00:44,968
ok I guess as to what you can learn to
learn why biometrics are about to become

11
00:00:44,969 --> 00:00:47,399
very important if you didn't know that
already

12
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:51,469
you're going to know how it's gonna have
some subtle consequences so what I like

13
00:00:51,469 --> 00:00:56,809
to do is think about the what-ifs how
things that might happen and might play

14
00:00:56,809 --> 00:01:00,780
out you're going to hear about some
creepy biometric ideas and made my skin

15
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,930
crawl will try to get you ready for the
biometric revolution and we have to

16
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:10,340
start by saying water biometrics the
solution to and as always suggesting

17
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:11,430
just now

18
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,869
password used to be unnecessary that was
my first computer that is the IBM 1620

19
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:22,220
at the Bronx High School of Science in
New York and then the 1960's I was

20
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:26,869
pretty unusual to have a computer in
high school my school is a special

21
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:31,500
magnet school and I have to tell you the
truth my classmates have gone on to a

22
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,700
certain amount of the station they both
have Nobel prizes in Physics C you are

23
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:40,530
looking at the front of the class of
1966 I am the guy who went into

24
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:46,250
computers and computer security instead
but it's fun and the IBM 1620 didn't

25
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:49,829
need a password because you own the home
machine he went out there and you just

26
00:01:49,829 --> 00:01:54,000
took the thing and signed up for half an
hour and ran your program and then the

27
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,840
next guy to clear the memory

28
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,579
well even that started to break down
they brought in this thing called a disk

29
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:04,779
drive and it had two million characters
a storage which is huge back then and

30
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:07,530
that they allowed you to keep files
around

31
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,709
and all of a sudden when you're able to
do that one guy could mess up another

32
00:02:11,709 --> 00:02:15,620
girls files and you just go on and on
like that of course now we need

33
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:21,480
passwords and become the stuff of comedy
so you probably all heard it's often

34
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:25,130
told us a blonde joke and I wouldn't
tell it that way of course but comedian

35
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:28,819
Nick helm said I need a password at
these told me it should be eight

36
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:33,579
characters so I picked Snow White and
the Seven doors and then there's this

37
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:37,000
wonderful dialogue to spend on the
Internet please enter a new password

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,370
catch sorry the password must be more
than 8 characters boiled cabbage sorry

39
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:46,870
the password must contain one number one
Boyle carriage sorry the password cannot

40
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:54,430
have blank spaces much time passes and
finally he goes I am now getting really

41
00:02:54,430 --> 00:03:01,060
get off FB boiled cabbages shoved up
your bleep bleep bleep if you don't give

42
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:05,620
me access immediately and of course the
punchline is sorry that password is in

43
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:10,350
use already so this indicates the level
of frustration that Joe Public Counsel

44
00:03:10,350 --> 00:03:14,450
crosswords and I know there are
solutions there was one password

45
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:18,690
password matches and things like that
but the reality is a lot of people are

46
00:03:18,690 --> 00:03:23,239
saying the password issues permanently
broken we need something else so what

47
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:27,500
could that something else be a lot of
people say biometrics

48
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:32,829
cartoons about it too so xkcd which if
you're not familiar with that you should

49
00:03:32,829 --> 00:03:37,120
be has a couple of things there about
passwords will just let you have a look

50
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,470
at them you know one of my favorite
assist laptops encrypted let's build a

51
00:03:41,470 --> 00:03:49,359
multimillion-dollar cluster to crack no
good it's 4096 bit RSA no draft when

52
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:53,359
actually what happened is that his
laptops encrypted here hit him with his

53
00:03:53,359 --> 00:03:58,140
$5 wrench actually told you the password
and if you think this is totally trip

54
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:03,358
he'll give you a little technical aside
I know a guy who's thinking of using the

55
00:04:03,359 --> 00:04:08,100
new Apple devices that are extremely
secure they have a debate in the number

56
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:12,320
this is the new iPad the new iPhone
that's so good they'd even Apple cannot

57
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:14,190
find that number its

58
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:18,540
fuel into the machine and my friend is
suggesting they were used to control

59
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:23,310
pipelines and we used to see control
power plants because it's so secure as

60
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:26,280
long as you don't let your children
could iTunes on it or something like

61
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,429
that and I should carry that's a
wonderful idea but it's just gonna turn

62
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:34,490
into the scenario where somebody put a
gun to the head of the operator and says

63
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:38,810
typing your password because somebody is
going to blow up a nuclear power plant

64
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:44,970
put a gun to the head of some operator
so sometimes we trade technical risk for

65
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:50,650
human risk in that would be an example
of that day there is certainly stupidity

66
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:57,099
in the world so there was recently a
study on password choices and the fact

67
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:01,830
that the most common password is
password 12345 and so on and also as we

68
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:06,859
know there's wholesale catching a pass
words so what should hackers reputed to

69
00:05:06,860 --> 00:05:11,960
catch 1.2 billion passwords so even if
you do everything right if you pick the

70
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:16,190
best password in the world with all the
different characters and the new every

71
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:20,169
hour for bed you still gonna have a
problem which is that the password file

72
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:24,880
has to live somewhere so all this leads
to the idea of biometrics which is

73
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,560
measuring something about your body it
is poised for huge growth a company that

74
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:34,630
tracks the industry says its global
market will grow to 15 billion dollars

75
00:05:34,630 --> 00:05:41,700
by 2015 and natural 2012 value of seven
billion dollars and this moving into

76
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:47,200
every sector so health care doctors are
starting to use an overhand print IDs to

77
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,560
access medical files certainly in
banking we've seen all kinds of

78
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,540
applications biometrics going to rule
the world for a lot of very good reasons

79
00:05:55,540 --> 00:05:59,960
one is that they're so convenient you're
not going to forget your hand you're not

80
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:03,500
going to forget your irish you always
got them with you and they're right

81
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:05,070
there and available

82
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:09,640
the technology is getting better and
they're more difficult to copy that

83
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:13,090
crash words people don't think about
that much blood in my password is

84
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:17,520
written down in my desk drawer somewhere
that somebody can make a copy to copy my

85
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,969
fingerprints yes it can be done

86
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:20,870
they have to

87
00:06:20,870 --> 00:06:25,730
drug me first they have to take a
plastic strip and get my finger they

88
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:30,130
have to put it on a plastic finger they
might have to give it a Poulsen soul on

89
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:34,460
soul it's a lot more work to copy
somebody's biometrics biometrics are

90
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:38,010
difficult to share one of the biggest
problems we have in the security

91
00:06:38,010 --> 00:06:41,830
industry is I need this favor ok tell me
your password

92
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:46,560
ok my password is so that type of
scenario is a little hard if you have to

93
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:51,130
cut your finger off and give it to you
coworker just not going to happen there

94
00:06:51,130 --> 00:06:54,880
is some attention being paid to privacy
should for example I suspect you'll know

95
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:59,610
when a finger scan is done they don't
actually capture whole fingerprint they

96
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:03,970
capture some points of interest on
funded enough to make a number a hash

97
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:09,100
and that has to then is used as the
number that's represented there are

98
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:16,180
legal and financial pressures for non
repudiated heidi is that they just idea

99
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:21,330
that since hey I did that and I can't
deny that I did that in the United

100
00:07:21,330 --> 00:07:27,340
States in October a new policy will come
into place with credit cards and I know

101
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:31,719
cause I made a purchase at the wonderful
books are here today and I said to the

102
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:37,490
guy who runs a chip and pin reader from
canada we've been using chip and pin for

103
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:41,150
a long time even though we know that
it's somewhat broken and has its

104
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:46,330
problems in the United States once
October 1st comes around if done doesn't

105
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:49,969
have a pin on there and my credit card
is stolen

106
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:54,240
he loses the money because the new
policy of the card issuers is going to

107
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,170
be merchant liability so they're pushing
us to some kind of idea that is non

108
00:07:59,170 --> 00:08:03,180
repudiated we had a very famous case in
Canada you may have heard

109
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:09,950
$88,000 we had a pretty heavy credit
card to do that he'd be very welcome

110
00:08:09,950 --> 00:08:15,090
here in Las Vegas and what happened was
he denied it and the bank the Canadian

111
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:21,440
Imperial Bank of Commerce said you must
have done it he said he didn't do it I

112
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,520
didn't do it and so bottom line I
actually do some journalism school and

113
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,248
work that story and I call the bank and
they should we can

114
00:08:29,249 --> 00:08:34,719
truly discussed this case but we know
this man and we know some things about

115
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:40,729
him so maybe it's not the simple story
that we were thinking where somebody's

116
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:46,930
pin number was entered by a fraud story
he's now out $88,000 plus interest is

117
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:47,939
growing every month

118
00:08:47,939 --> 00:08:52,310
well I just got word last week that this
gentleman has been arrested in Brazil so

119
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:58,508
apparently he does have some large in
this tendencies firefighters are going

120
00:08:58,509 --> 00:09:02,319
to creep people out as I said I spend a
lot of time worrying about how things

121
00:09:02,319 --> 00:09:07,800
can be creepy and it's just so you you
can't change your fingerprint you can

122
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:12,680
change your retro skin it's an intrinsic
part of you this note new revelations

123
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:17,000
have sent two times everybody to the
fact that lots of government agencies

124
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:23,050
private companies and so on are making
extensive use of tracking us and get

125
00:09:23,050 --> 00:09:27,309
much worse if they can track those
flawlessly if they can actually know

126
00:09:27,309 --> 00:09:31,550
that you are you because of your
biometric information

127
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:35,550
there's a wonderful yarn about target
knowing that Evo is pregnant before her

128
00:09:35,550 --> 00:09:40,309
dad and you can look that one up if you
want to block what's even more scary is

129
00:09:40,309 --> 00:09:44,420
an awful lot of companies out there
doing predictive analytics piece in The

130
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:48,979
Wall Street Journal this week but how
Apple and Google are racing to tell you

131
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:53,100
what you want before you even know you
want it how many of you know about the

132
00:09:53,100 --> 00:10:00,480
Amazon echo echo echo is like seriously
personal assistant that you put in your

133
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:05,329
living room and you can ask questions
you can go election what year did the

134
00:10:05,329 --> 00:10:08,199
American Civil War began and it will
look it up

135
00:10:08,199 --> 00:10:12,959
election where is very good pizza parlor
that's still open but the other thing

136
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:17,768
it's been pointed out it has 90 we saw
on microphones just sitting there

137
00:10:17,769 --> 00:10:22,579
waiting for the wakeup word well just
hypothetically if the NSA wanted to book

138
00:10:22,579 --> 00:10:26,750
every home in america and didn't have
the budget to do that some people have

139
00:10:26,750 --> 00:10:31,339
suggested they would send in this device
and it would use voice recognition maybe

140
00:10:31,339 --> 00:10:32,950
to figure out who

141
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:37,460
the family is asking the questions and
they could be pretty scary

142
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:42,490
the lot of tracking is being done as you
know by sites like Facebook there's a

143
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:48,920
real time auction if you look at a watch
on Amazon if you go on Facebook you are

144
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:54,469
sold in real-time on a system called FB
acts for the way to present an ad to you

145
00:10:54,470 --> 00:10:59,640
so people just generally have this idea
and one of the creeper ones is mom to

146
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:04,949
leave International which makes chips
ahoy oriole cookies things like that are

147
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:07,750
actually introducing smart shells

148
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:12,360
these will be shows with sensors and as
you walk along they will figure out your

149
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:18,540
gender your approximate age body mass
index and decide whether you should be

150
00:11:18,540 --> 00:11:23,500
served up with a coupon may be truthful
19 Orioles today so this awful at a

151
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:27,680
track and people are getting freaked out
by that so very brief history of

152
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,530
biometrics which I'm not going to go
through this and you know these slides

153
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:36,100
and sure made available and there's also
a white paper which I pointed it all out

154
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:40,450
but no pretty important ones is that it
goes back thirty one thousand years

155
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:45,360
because there was some people found
somewhere and the author had pride of

156
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:49,660
authorship so he put his hand print on
there for her hand print to show that in

157
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:53,010
fact that was the author of the King
painting where it gets really

158
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:58,170
interesting courses fingerprints and the
fact that the FBI developed in the

159
00:11:58,170 --> 00:12:02,290
nineteen nineties their automated
fingerprint analysis so that probably

160
00:12:02,290 --> 00:12:09,670
was the landmark in biometrics the other
thing was the TV show CSI so I got to

161
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:15,000
interview went to the creator of CSI I
said shut the door on television

162
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:20,920
scientifically accurate and he said Tom
everything we show is scientifically

163
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:25,719
true but we speeded up for television
they will the FBI speed things up for

164
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:31,100
television to by automating fingerprint
I D face recognition was tested at the

165
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:36,730
Super Bowl in Tampa by us- government
agency and machine-readable travel

166
00:12:36,730 --> 00:12:38,010
documents are becoming

167
00:12:38,010 --> 00:12:44,140
so there is no question that biometrics
is a happening thing yeah I am having a

168
00:12:44,140 --> 00:12:49,710
slip there i'm ok this is interesting
piece of technology if you are not a

169
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:55,260
citizen or a Canadian for example
because the UN slapped you will be

170
00:12:55,260 --> 00:13:00,670
subjected to something called the EUS
visit program so hypothetically in

171
00:13:00,670 --> 00:13:04,689
Australia and this so striking his
country in the United States they will

172
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:08,970
be asked for biometric identification
which means they take a picture of you

173
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:14,720
may take some fingerprints well I know a
person who's going through this and go

174
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,770
straight ahead very quick wit and she
had a bandage on the finger that they

175
00:13:18,770 --> 00:13:22,880
wanted to scan so of course she said
what should I do

176
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:31,330
the woman said take off the mandate and
she said what might please don't do that

177
00:13:31,330 --> 00:13:32,840
what should I do

178
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:37,800
will give us another trigger and what to
the Australian say will do

179
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:43,550
middle finger to which the Aus
government representative agent said as

180
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:47,530
long as you give us the same figure when
you leave the United States so the

181
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:53,209
reality is that there are some kind of
fun but they are indeed being captured

182
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:59,600
and I want to tell you about important
biometric system in Canada why is it

183
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,980
important because if you come into the
trial we reported a busy time might line

184
00:14:03,980 --> 00:14:07,490
up for two hours to go through customs
but if you have this thing called the

185
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:12,930
Nexus card to go right through you walk
into a kiosk card and everything is

186
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:18,140
hunky dory that's not always true a
certain percentage of time it's probably

187
00:14:18,140 --> 00:14:22,270
about three times I double hundred
you'll be sent for a second day we check

188
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:24,790
just to keep you honest and so on

189
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:28,569
97 times out of a hundred you going
right through and you can thumb your

190
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:32,670
nose at all the people standing in the
line there well things are interesting

191
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:36,199
happen to be able to dinner with the
software developers and I said you know

192
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:41,450
you guys saw a very difficult computer
science problem and I'm a computer

193
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:45,860
science professor and I want to praise
you and they said shut up

194
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:49,510
should don't talk about that

195
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:55,870
really you didn't just saw the Nexus
card and here's my eyeballs and I'm the

196
00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:00,870
holder of that card check you'll
actually solve the problem we I could

197
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:05,250
put my eyeballs in I didn't even have a
chord with me sometimes will be exposed

198
00:15:05,250 --> 00:15:11,530
to and they would actually I don't look
me up in a database and he said yes and

199
00:15:11,530 --> 00:15:13,760
that's the way it's supposed to work

200
00:15:13,760 --> 00:15:19,939
what do you mean it doesn't always find
one person will what happens this is

201
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:24,300
what we choose the first one on the list
so that led to the interesting

202
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:28,589
possibility of people entering and
leaving Canada who never knew that they

203
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:33,450
did and vice versa so I did ultimately
investigation hope I didn't quite go to

204
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:37,360
freedom of information act by had your
dog at least pursue the Canadian

205
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:42,230
government and I said so what did you do
in the case where there wasn't just one

206
00:15:42,230 --> 00:15:46,090
person who matched those eyeballs which
is an important part of biometrics

207
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:51,100
you'll find out who attends the person
in to talk to an actual live human

208
00:15:51,100 --> 00:15:53,820
beings so that's how they saw

209
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:59,820
did is the surplus told an extra
terminals and if they are selling them

210
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:04,770
for something like $125 online so if you
would like their own customs entry

211
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:10,270
terminal you can just go to gcc surplus
the Canadian government surplus site and

212
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:14,540
by want these things you pick it apart I
have suggested to them that maybe that's

213
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:18,040
a dumb thing to do then maybe they
should put them in a big crush or

214
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:22,250
something like that as opposed to trying
to recover a couple hundred dollars from

215
00:16:22,250 --> 00:16:28,730
oil was at one point secret technology
talk about hidden risk and one of them

216
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:34,120
is our perception of reliability of
course the deputy minister that these

217
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:38,640
guys didn't want me to show too loudly
in front of all they did a great job he

218
00:16:38,640 --> 00:16:44,470
thinks biometrics 2013 the identified
you cannot identify the realities of

219
00:16:44,470 --> 00:16:49,170
course it's a little bit on a scale so
you probably know that every time out

220
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:54,089
will brings out a new phone with touch I
D the Chaos Computer Club in Germany and

221
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:59,030
various other people flying waste and
duplicate the finger find ways to hack

222
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:03,760
that they look the guy who does that and
this is one of his articles here goes

223
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:09,390
why I had touched idea again this is
when the new iPhone 5s came out and I

224
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:14,520
still think it's awesome and he makes a
very good point that other ways to break

225
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:19,180
this technology but for the best
majority of the cases it's an excellent

226
00:17:19,180 --> 00:17:24,470
technology it serves most people's needs
and it's doing convenient so even the

227
00:17:24,470 --> 00:17:27,920
guy was out there showing the
vulnerability which will we all do it

228
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:33,360
black hat DEFCON besides all these
conferences they're also showing that

229
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,570
for most people it's probably a pretty
good thing I'm not gonna go until the

230
00:17:37,570 --> 00:17:42,580
technicalities of biometric risk but
there are two kinds of risks one of them

231
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:48,260
is a type one error which is a false
rejection rate so you're the doctor was

232
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:52,400
supposed to get to the medical records
and it doesn't let you in the other is a

233
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:57,100
false acceptance rate which is the
person who doesn't have authorized

234
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:01,689
access to the nuclear power plant but
let you in anyway my point for those

235
00:18:01,690 --> 00:18:07,130
examples is it all depends which kind of
reach you want you want it to be very

236
00:18:07,130 --> 00:18:12,070
strict and keep out people even some
legitimate people do you want it to be

237
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:17,020
very loops and there's no answer to that
question actually it depends on the

238
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:22,950
application there is however a crossover
point and which is equal that sometimes

239
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:29,330
called neutrality so without any further
information on the situation people

240
00:18:29,330 --> 00:18:33,370
often try to set up these systems so
they gonna have a false acceptance rate

241
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:38,989
of 3% it'll be a false rejection rate of
3% so they kind of tweaked it to be

242
00:18:38,990 --> 00:18:40,230
somewhere in the middle

243
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:46,950
the main point is to know that you can't
make them 08 no perfect system and what

244
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:50,740
are people trying in this area one of
the funniest ones is the idea of a

245
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:57,150
digital chance to go out there and you
going to have a password

246
00:18:57,150 --> 00:19:01,870
why not talk to it in magnetic ink on
your arm will all tell you why not

247
00:19:01,870 --> 00:19:06,459
people do not want their employer go
around tried to him so on the flying

248
00:19:06,460 --> 00:19:10,190
business floor here they're giving out
these wonderful child to sleep

249
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:15,090
and you can imagine if you had a whole
sequence viewer job hopper and you had

250
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:19,029
thirty different jobs you have a whole
sequence of pressure you know I love

251
00:19:19,029 --> 00:19:23,500
siskel I love this company I love IBM
all up and down your arm so the whole

252
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:27,629
idea that you have a magnetic ink tattoo
seems to me to be the kind of thing that

253
00:19:27,629 --> 00:19:31,320
you really want to treat as a last
resort

254
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:36,759
there's actually this is a specific
cotton that I looked up a magnetic

255
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:41,360
choose it is also a telephone because
built right into that has a microphone

256
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:45,750
so the reality is that one of things
that happen all kinds of technologies

257
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:51,080
being invented that's really very very
far out like a cell phone on your arm so

258
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:55,889
you talked into your arm is the actual
pattern is there and you can look it up

259
00:19:55,889 --> 00:20:00,158
in the white paper if you want who said
he was assigned to Motorola Motorola is

260
00:20:00,159 --> 00:20:04,850
now part of Google and for general dugan
last time I look was running technology

261
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:09,750
and she is one of the creeper people on
the planet and the reason is she

262
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:14,809
suggested we should take password pills
so every day you would swallow a panel

263
00:20:14,809 --> 00:20:19,029
it would broadcast radio waves from your
digestive tract it would come out the

264
00:20:19,029 --> 00:20:23,519
other end tomorrow and I will be your
password and of course does dumb

265
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:27,799
thinking because how do I still your
password now you know I go through your

266
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:31,950
desk drawer looking to see if you wrote
it down backwards then I may be torture

267
00:20:31,950 --> 00:20:36,730
you with the hammer now all I have to do
is break in June grab tomorrow's kill

268
00:20:36,730 --> 00:20:40,440
take it and I'm you sure my point is
that a lot of these things are not

269
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:43,710
thought through their cute ideas and
they're wonderful that people haven't

270
00:20:43,710 --> 00:20:48,039
really thought through how they would
actually work in reality and in fact

271
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:51,529
there's some great work at the
Polytechnic University of Madrid to

272
00:20:51,529 --> 00:20:56,370
identify as bi how we smell case of
everybody has a unique body odor

273
00:20:56,370 --> 00:21:01,178
after around than 80% reliability for
this thing where in fact they can find

274
00:21:01,179 --> 00:21:05,149
you by your body odor but you know what
if you just go jog or something like

275
00:21:05,149 --> 00:21:09,219
that your body odor is going to change
so all these things are worth talking

276
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:12,580
about and we're thinking about whether
they will be accepted is kind of

277
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:15,480
questionable his company in Canada

278
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:21,820
me that thinks that your heart rate is
your next password so I know when we all

279
00:21:21,820 --> 00:21:22,070
go

280
00:21:22,070 --> 00:21:26,000
to work every day or heart skips a beat
at the joy of logging onto our computers

281
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,790
and now they will record the way your
heart skips a beat your

282
00:21:29,790 --> 00:21:34,940
electrocardiogram is a possible digital
signature as are many other bodily

283
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:41,720
functions is OpenID electrocardiogram
maybe your electroencephalogram there

284
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:48,370
are now consumer devices by companies
like general sky and motive that we eat

285
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:53,820
G so the day may come when you think of
password so there's a wonderful image of

286
00:21:53,820 --> 00:21:59,389
hundred appear magically rejection or
the the wonderful beach in Australia or

287
00:21:59,390 --> 00:22:04,210
something like that and you are in fact
thinking of that and there's research is

288
00:22:04,210 --> 00:22:08,530
a guy named Jack O'Lantern California
who actually has it down to the point

289
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:13,520
with functional magnetic resonance
imaging that he can show you will film

290
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:19,840
and then measure your brain with fMRI
and do a reconstruction and it's not

291
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:25,110
perfect so maybe you're seeing a film of
a subway train and what comes out in her

292
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:29,179
brain looks more like a steam locomotive
and then a woman comes in which he looks

293
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:34,280
different the point is that we're near
the point of reading the human mind in

294
00:22:34,280 --> 00:22:37,990
certain ways and there would be a fun
way to do it so your brain may become

295
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:43,040
your password now to research all this
and that's my book techno creep and

296
00:22:43,040 --> 00:22:47,879
basically have this premise that people
have an uneasy feeling about this and

297
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:51,680
actually worked out because I'm a
professor and I had to have a chart and

298
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:55,410
worked out some dimensions of creepiness
and again there in the book there in my

299
00:22:55,410 --> 00:23:00,630
white paper but a lot of it has to do
with his mysterious ok so do you

300
00:23:00,630 --> 00:23:07,050
understand how it works so if biometric
password I would certainly suggest that

301
00:23:07,050 --> 00:23:11,350
they explain exactly how it works what
its limitations on and so on

302
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:15,090
because they don't it becomes a kind of
black magic that people become

303
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:19,709
suspicious up I don't have any remember
girls around me but that was a really

304
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:27,330
creepy happy that unified shut-ins on
Foursquare with facebook profiles should

305
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:31,810
walk into a bar you would push a button
you would see five girls there was only

306
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:33,030
about girls

307
00:23:33,030 --> 00:23:38,270
and the profiles on Facebook if they
were public came up she could walk in

308
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:43,310
because I see you're not their
relationship their number your favorite

309
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:48,190
band is the Barenaked Ladies well let's
have a drink together and this was cold

310
00:23:48,190 --> 00:23:52,710
taking creepy to a new level by the New
York Times reported that tilted and the

311
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:56,930
reality is it did take creepy to a new
level and it got shut down pretty

312
00:23:56,930 --> 00:23:57,540
quickly

313
00:23:57,540 --> 00:24:02,070
four square cut their data feature they
weren't able to use one of my points

314
00:24:02,070 --> 00:24:07,840
about that though is that their name was
creepy girls off liberals like new

315
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,590
friend flying to or something like that

316
00:24:10,590 --> 00:24:14,540
the naming of the technology may be
germane I have an example in the book

317
00:24:14,540 --> 00:24:19,300
called boyfriend tracker which you can
put on somebody's phone and it sends all

318
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:23,080
their message is true and join the
microphone on their phone is being used

319
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:27,530
by girls and Brazil to track their
boyfriends have you called it something

320
00:24:27,530 --> 00:24:31,720
like I left my phone in the taxi tracker
that would be an entirely different

321
00:24:31,720 --> 00:24:35,780
thing to some of the dimensions and I
thought about here are you know they

322
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:39,899
sound pretty silly the name of the
technology except that's what people

323
00:24:39,900 --> 00:24:43,660
think about so if you're ever in the
position we're trying to bring in

324
00:24:43,660 --> 00:24:45,190
technology

325
00:24:45,190 --> 00:24:49,970
Twitter or something like that call it
something that's nice and pretty and not

326
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:54,180
not offensive or take a little bit of a
trip here that's a very famous

327
00:24:54,180 --> 00:25:01,540
photograph was taken April 19 2013 show
Curzon the now convicted Boston Marathon

328
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:08,320
bomber coloring under a tarp ok and so
he was giving off a biometric signature

329
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:13,260
there he was actually detected by a
thermal imaging camera phone and

330
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:17,140
helicopter so I got that photo from the
Massachusetts State Police and the

331
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:22,130
camera that they took it with was a very
high quality camera but guess what

332
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:27,680
earlier which makes cameroon has brought
out a back for the iPhone with the price

333
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:34,130
of $349 that could do the same thing and
why do we care about this because a lot

334
00:25:34,130 --> 00:25:38,740
of technologies are moving to be widely
available like thermal imaging and

335
00:25:38,740 --> 00:25:42,260
here's the security aspect people have
already started

336
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:48,379
using the flare back to capture the pin
numbers on keeping it became pat is made

337
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:53,720
of rubber or plastic not metal there is
a nut heat left in it that you can

338
00:25:53,720 --> 00:25:57,500
actually see the last number of those
typed in so there's a great video on

339
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:01,740
youtube or somebody paula is a woman
into a Target store just snapped a

340
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:05,440
picture of the keyboard and then he
knows her pending of course and he asked

341
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:13,050
to steal her card or something but you
know that's in Canada were so

342
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:16,860
peace-loving that I had to put another
slide in order to ensure that you as

343
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:20,330
well because they go well nobody would
steal my card you know where Canadians

344
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:24,929
were friendly but what if you have a
eight-year-old latchkey child to consume

345
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:28,860
every day and you have her door locked
with one of these locks well guess what

346
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:34,100
the thermal imaging camera can watch out
there this is a project one of my

347
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:38,959
colleagues did at the University of
Calgary with this thermal camera and the

348
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:44,580
houses are giving off biometrics to
their giving off that they send out and

349
00:26:44,580 --> 00:26:49,230
he called your house based on how much
energy wasting I said Jeffrey you put

350
00:26:49,230 --> 00:26:53,090
yourself in a public web page did it
ever occur to you that it might be

351
00:26:53,090 --> 00:26:54,260
misused

352
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:58,800
homeowners to look at their house as I
said Jeffrey what if there was a equal

353
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:02,370
terrorist group and they want to find
the energy wasters and pick up their

354
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:07,399
houses or maybe there's a police
organization that wants to look for

355
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:12,680
houses that he met a lot of energy he
said well we have a solution to that if

356
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:16,750
somebody is worried about their
information getting out we all met their

357
00:27:16,750 --> 00:27:23,310
house and we put up privacy concerns and
we just said Jeffrey that's a bit like

358
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:27,080
saying here's what my basement looks
like this is a real marijuana grow up

359
00:27:27,080 --> 00:27:31,530
RCMP photo from Maple Creek British
Columbia in other words you're giving

360
00:27:31,530 --> 00:27:36,910
out that information and in the book i
quoted him saying how many I asked how

361
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:40,550
many people have asked for privacy
mister dole nobody's asked for and

362
00:27:40,550 --> 00:27:42,220
there's a very good reason

363
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:45,780
ok there's a little bit of an
interesting legal twist quickly tell you

364
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:48,050
about it was a great basin

365
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:52,580
the United States Supreme Court in 2001
the case I'll overseas United States

366
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:57,220
this guy was Boston with a grow-op show
again he was emitting eat the police

367
00:27:57,220 --> 00:28:02,070
used a thermal imaging camera he's very
smart defense lawyer said hey that's an

368
00:28:02,070 --> 00:28:08,000
illegal search under the Fourth
Amendment and Thompson the camera you

369
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,050
can only use technology to commonly
available you can use a regular Kodak

370
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:20,639
camera you can use a binocular but you
can use a $60,000 they will think about

371
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:28,110
it now just $60,000 $349 so this case
went back up to the Supreme Court ruled

372
00:28:28,110 --> 00:28:31,820
in favor of the guy he was acquitted it
would have gone the other way they would

373
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:36,879
have actually convicted him I think so
what I predicted in my book about kind

374
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:42,010
of future is that we're going to have a
situation where you walk into a store

375
00:28:42,010 --> 00:28:47,350
like Target and tried to pin number and
will still happen numbers but

376
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:52,370
immediately the pain perdu be swept away
and in case you haven't seen when there

377
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:55,800
were 12 what's that do that but I was
one of the show with toilet she did a

378
00:28:55,800 --> 00:29:01,620
major conference this is a special to
see we get a fresh one every time so why

379
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:08,080
would they take the PIN pad away because
they can now analyze your DNA real time

380
00:29:08,080 --> 00:29:13,330
but nearly real-time using a system
called touch DNA so there actually is a

381
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:19,580
system that's available and the small
amount of data that you left on that can

382
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:25,320
pass that biometric data viewers could
be used to get your DNA and what does

383
00:29:25,320 --> 00:29:30,520
that say well it says what diseases are
proven to what your credit to your

384
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:36,190
ancestry it also says things about your
blood relations so your siblings your

385
00:29:36,190 --> 00:29:40,960
mother your father so I predict your
comment to target a week later and up on

386
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,160
the screen you'll see a display that
says did you know that you are

387
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:50,720
pre-diabetic here's a 30% off coupon on
her special pre diabetic diet for you do

388
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:54,990
we want to do we really want to argue to
have her DNA I'm sure just let me know

389
00:29:54,990 --> 00:29:58,690
I'm not a lawyer disclaimer I'm not a
lawyer

390
00:29:58,690 --> 00:30:01,620
I don't think they would be anything
preventing them from doing that the

391
00:30:01,620 --> 00:30:05,739
public have to put up a sign this is
when you use this we're collecting your

392
00:30:05,740 --> 00:30:10,390
DNA but you know go watch and Target or
Walmart how many people would even read

393
00:30:10,390 --> 00:30:13,990
that sign how many people would
understand how many people would care

394
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:18,820
because you're here you're
technologically savvy so you need to

395
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:25,030
help explain to people what had me so
the reality is access to your DNA is

396
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:28,780
gonna provide all kinds of information
about Chu and there's even a nother

397
00:30:28,780 --> 00:30:34,910
level which is called epigenetics so
your DNA is a totally fixed your DNA can

398
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:39,960
be methylated and other transformations
can occur based on the environment and

399
00:30:39,960 --> 00:30:44,910
all of this can be measured just from a
few skin cells if you think I'm making

400
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,080
this up

401
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:52,270
Madonna has a staff member who goes
around every time she drinks water glass

402
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:57,070
and either takes away or clean chit
sterilizes it so that nobody has

403
00:30:57,070 --> 00:31:03,950
madonna's baby without her authorization
khou DNA getting out there with this is

404
00:31:03,950 --> 00:31:09,090
a wonderful setting examples one of them
is the Hoosier daddy truck which cruise

405
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:13,720
around the streets of New York a guy
named Jared set up a Mol Biol DNA

406
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:19,340
testing service he's actually now got a
reality TV show called tales should

407
00:31:19,340 --> 00:31:25,540
respond he basically is out there and he
share stories from his DNA truck show if

408
00:31:25,540 --> 00:31:28,530
you ever wondered who your daddy was a
very simple way to do it

409
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:33,470
there's also a great case of a young man
who found out he was fathered by sperm

410
00:31:33,470 --> 00:31:37,980
donation I won't ask if you put yourself
through college doing that but if you

411
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:42,720
don't you'll probably told it's totally
anonymous well guess what this kid found

412
00:31:42,720 --> 00:31:48,130
his father without the father and we're
giving up his DNA just by using his own

413
00:31:48,130 --> 00:31:52,550
DNA and some circumstantial evidence
where the father went to school and so

414
00:31:52,550 --> 00:31:57,810
on and of course you could have a lot of
kids coming out there asking to ask you

415
00:31:57,810 --> 00:32:01,770
to help in the chapter in the book I
read about sperm donation I think the

416
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:07,010
record us 589 children from the same
plotter and they actually have a club

417
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:08,940
and they go on picnics together

418
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:12,870
and it looks really weird because they
all look alike hundreds of kids who look

419
00:32:12,870 --> 00:32:18,409
alike can risk number three biometric
data is irreversible once you get out

420
00:32:18,410 --> 00:32:25,300
you ain't gonna get it back even a small
sample of your DNA is a possibility that

421
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:29,610
they can grab all the information and no
legal protection of this is very

422
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:35,139
variable as you might expect California
had the first set of DNA storage law but

423
00:32:35,140 --> 00:32:37,160
it varies quite a bit

424
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:41,810
the way like explain it if it's dynamite
for a company to head your credit card

425
00:32:41,810 --> 00:32:46,740
number because they might in fact be
sued because they lost your credit card

426
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:47,460
number

427
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:54,160
think of what would happen if they had
your DNA DNA they're really dealing with

428
00:32:54,160 --> 00:32:59,570
nuclear fuel there because it could
expose into huge risks gave the news

429
00:32:59,570 --> 00:33:02,649
walla boosts your face we all move
facial recognition is getting really

430
00:33:02,650 --> 00:33:07,500
good google has returned within a few
tenths of a percent of human ability if

431
00:33:07,500 --> 00:33:12,000
I think in some cases better than humans
and Alexandre Christie did a great

432
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:17,130
experiment at Carnegie Mellon he took a
pose dating site photos and he match

433
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:21,560
them up with their Facebook profiles so
you know what people going dating sites

434
00:33:21,560 --> 00:33:27,230
they don't put their real name up they
become sexy babe 235 were hung guy for

435
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:31,080
all four something like that and then if
they like you they tell you their real

436
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:36,860
name any significant number of cases
just using pat pat which is a facial

437
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:41,820
recognition program Alessandro could
figure out who sixty babe 235 really was

438
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:46,419
so your faces of vulnerability and
there's even an app called name child

439
00:33:46,420 --> 00:33:50,510
that looks up that stranger sitting next
to you in the bar and right now the

440
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:55,230
online database it has is the National
Register of sex offenders who just

441
00:33:55,230 --> 00:33:59,650
interesting but if I never got old
facebook and will lose tag pollution

442
00:33:59,650 --> 00:34:03,750
Facebook you have world we hold the
phone up to somebody and you instantly

443
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:09,730
know and there's probably coming even
how we walk is being study if you think

444
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:14,110
about 911 you probably know that there
were cameras in the airports Lincoln

445
00:34:14,110 --> 00:34:19,090
Logan Airport in Boston and what happen
they immediately started analyzing that

446
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:20,200
footage

447
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:25,029
they could find terrorist behavior do
they walk a certain way so I never

448
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:29,570
talked about him to the Economist wrote
about in October 2008 when at the

449
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:36,369
Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland tus
army has a whole analysis project and

450
00:34:36,369 --> 00:34:41,010
there's a terrorist walk to you because
if you do it in the airport you gonna be

451
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:47,960
a lot of trouble in risk number for
biometrics can be grabbed without our

452
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:48,889
consent

453
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:53,579
the whole idea of the touch DNA is one
example but you walk out on the street

454
00:34:53,579 --> 00:34:58,520
your faces in the public gave his public
your speech there's a company called in

455
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:03,940
cellist reach the high street lamps that
watch you analyze you and they also play

456
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:08,790
music and do things like that gave out
there they are those of the intelligent

457
00:35:08,790 --> 00:35:13,250
reach street lights which are creeping
out and there is a way of surveillance

458
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:17,460
cameras being installed in the BART
system in San Francisco so the hardware

459
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:21,430
is moving pretty quickly to grab this
data the question is what do we do when

460
00:35:21,430 --> 00:35:28,290
the back end in a few years ago a few
guys presented they were young

461
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:33,640
presenters on how this system that you
have Homeland Security thought would be

462
00:35:33,640 --> 00:35:38,490
really good I would be really bad it
attempted to find terrorists by

463
00:35:38,490 --> 00:35:44,569
physiological parameters heart rates
wedding you saw what happened is seven

464
00:35:44,569 --> 00:35:49,150
rhetoric on stood up and presented while
his partner ran around the room three

465
00:35:49,150 --> 00:35:53,490
times nearly killed him and at the end
of it they took his heart rate and of

466
00:35:53,490 --> 00:35:57,540
course he would have shown up as being
highly suspicious so the point is that

467
00:35:57,540 --> 00:36:01,060
biometrics can lead to wrong conclusions

468
00:36:01,060 --> 00:36:04,119
there is a company I will tell you a lot
about them but they're called photon

469
00:36:04,119 --> 00:36:08,190
acts and they can do things like read
your fingerprints of the distant reply

470
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:14,470
feet so they have a whole 3d modeling
and profoundly technology that is very

471
00:36:14,470 --> 00:36:17,480
very sophisticated

472
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:21,349
to our pool of course gave us the
Internet is also making some interesting

473
00:36:21,349 --> 00:36:21,870
use

474
00:36:21,870 --> 00:36:27,990
memory they had a project which to put
it bluntly had to do with implanting

475
00:36:27,990 --> 00:36:32,689
false memories he should they were
studied how narrative issues and there

476
00:36:32,690 --> 00:36:38,230
is actually research with rats that say
you can give the Red a false memory

477
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:42,840
there are rats that are afraid to walk
across a certain metal plate in the

478
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:48,130
floor even though they never had a shock
from it because they inherited the fear

479
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:58,850
from their grandfathers give me a
biometric in behavioral data may become

480
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:03,759
de facto mandatorily this is a pretty
interesting concept it is true that you

481
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,530
can rent a car without a credit card

482
00:37:06,530 --> 00:37:10,390
go in trying to do that we have to bring
water cash in your mother's birth

483
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:14,940
certificate whole bunch of other stuff
so you need a credit card to rent a car

484
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:19,970
well down at Walt Disney World now
there's a thing called the my magic risk

485
00:37:19,970 --> 00:37:26,230
and if you get one it's your passenger
the part and it also get you on rides

486
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:29,410
and so on and attraction we move you
make

487
00:37:29,410 --> 00:37:33,420
they know every way you stopped the know
when you went to the bathroom which

488
00:37:33,420 --> 00:37:38,300
bathroom and went into they have
spending limits on so many mouse can see

489
00:37:38,300 --> 00:37:43,420
your little six-year-old come along and
osama is coming and her favorite

490
00:37:43,420 --> 00:37:46,820
characters minnie mouse and her
remaining spending limit for today is

491
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:53,260
$32 so let's play up to 29 $95 minnie
mouse so the reality is you don't need

492
00:37:53,260 --> 00:37:59,310
these things you know I just want a
paper ticket getting the park with the

493
00:37:59,310 --> 00:38:05,549
kids and they all go OK Go in the park
when you lose all your privileges so

494
00:38:05,550 --> 00:38:07,620
madge explained to Sally

495
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:13,450
hour long line for Thunder Mountain but
that families going ahead with their

496
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:16,200
privacy but we buy your privacy

497
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:24,140
gonna get heat stroke out here in the
Sun by that crunch and we will give in

498
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:30,710
to the stuff another example is ensure
the snapshot that allows you to monitor

499
00:38:30,710 --> 00:38:33,440
your driving and maybe get a discount

500
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:40,420
John Hancock insurance is now allowing
you to worry this monitor 24 7 track

501
00:38:40,420 --> 00:38:45,000
your exercise and maybe get a discount
on your life insurance so they taken the

502
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:49,490
same countries that use in cars and
applied it to the human body is so

503
00:38:49,490 --> 00:38:54,419
there's actually the the John Hancock
muncher and people are doing this so

504
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:58,630
what are you giving up maybe you get a
5% discount or life insurance you're

505
00:38:58,630 --> 00:39:04,680
giving up extremely detailed information
about your life in fact you're giving up

506
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:08,350
information about when you have sex and
well-preserved historical not show

507
00:39:08,350 --> 00:39:12,839
anything offensive I hope this is not
offensive to you but your Nike FuelBand

508
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:15,160
and there's no 190 party tonight

509
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:19,330
your fuel band knows when you're having
sex and the reason is it's going to show

510
00:39:19,330 --> 00:39:25,270
my mother's it measures the motion it's
3:30 in the morning here just burned 250

511
00:39:25,270 --> 00:39:30,410
calories secure typical male and you
took 0 steps the FuelBand can come to a

512
00:39:30,410 --> 00:39:35,430
conclusion that she will ban can
communicate by bluetooth to another

513
00:39:35,430 --> 00:39:39,919
device which can call the person who was
supposed to be in bed with so the

514
00:39:39,920 --> 00:39:44,750
devices that are in fact coming up
around us to help us to measure of

515
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:50,260
biometrics can also be the ones that
take us down their workplace issues

516
00:39:50,260 --> 00:39:54,490
companies some companies writing giving
fit the smothers to employees to

517
00:39:54,490 --> 00:39:56,479
encourage fitness which is great

518
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,630
telling them to wear them twenty-four
seven so again I know when they have sex

519
00:40:00,630 --> 00:40:05,650
but they also know things like how much
sleep lay down your neck for a pilot and

520
00:40:05,650 --> 00:40:11,760
you show up having had sexual night no
sleep at all maybe the plane if you're a

521
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:16,100
check out person and Walmart maybe you
can do that job in your sleep anyway so

522
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:21,630
the reality is that the business will
know things about your life outside of

523
00:40:21,630 --> 00:40:24,040
the business if you wear this tracker

524
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:28,870
the other thing is that if you happen to
have it on let's say during an advanced

525
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:33,880
business negotiations you have a meeting
with your boss and I think the buses

526
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:40,190
slow to come up here and in that meeting
your boss has to fit this month or so as

527
00:40:40,190 --> 00:40:46,370
you are carrying on the conversation
with your boss who's the boss and who's

528
00:40:46,370 --> 00:40:51,450
the employee if one of those persons
nosy other persons pulses elevated and

529
00:40:51,450 --> 00:40:55,609
their perspiring so on they might know
that their blood there's all kinds of

530
00:40:55,610 --> 00:41:00,270
possibilities for the misuse of that
kind of information so the workplace is

531
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:07,590
gonna be a child feel for this these
people steal database to passwords I

532
00:41:07,590 --> 00:41:11,250
told you that the beginning they still
hope they do why wouldn't they steal

533
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:16,360
biometric data of course they will even
the legal ones could be a possible there

534
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:20,890
are companies the famous one used to be
choice point that just accumulated data

535
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:26,100
on people so everything that they could
you were financial records your health

536
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:30,270
records anything they could get they
would build files showing you well

537
00:41:30,270 --> 00:41:34,340
they'll go after biometric information
if they're allowed to do that as well so

538
00:41:34,340 --> 00:41:40,380
data aggregators mayo on you in the
sense of owning your biometrics so

539
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:44,160
what's a framework I'm done trying to
give you a little bit of takeaway here

540
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:48,000
and there may help with time to
questions even before you go about your

541
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,040
office should think about biometrics on
there any of these are you using already

542
00:41:52,040 --> 00:41:55,060
that maybe might cause you problems down
the line

543
00:41:55,060 --> 00:42:01,420
a plan that creepy went to get my book
on Amazon everything you can get the

544
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:05,410
diagram we can probably find it online
now and look at those different

545
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:09,879
dimensions and you may come up with
other dimensions of previous to and we

546
00:42:09,880 --> 00:42:15,270
can alternate jurors tracking thing and
alternative would be a sign in sheet of

547
00:42:15,270 --> 00:42:20,400
the company jam rights of the company
provides like Google and on premises jam

548
00:42:20,400 --> 00:42:25,030
you don't have to know exactly how
somebody worked out you just know they

549
00:42:25,030 --> 00:42:30,440
went to the gym for an hour they didn't
work out well it's not that important so

550
00:42:30,440 --> 00:42:35,990
maybe there's pretty good data that's
maybe not as invasive longer-term

551
00:42:35,990 --> 00:42:40,470
applications think about your data
retention policies so we often see for

552
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:43,189
example videotapes that are kept forever

553
00:42:43,190 --> 00:42:47,859
video surveillance good practice I'm
told is if you haven't needed them and

554
00:42:47,859 --> 00:42:52,319
seven days you probably should get rid
of them they are a liability than an

555
00:42:52,319 --> 00:42:56,430
asset consider whether some data should
be i'd be identified to be collecting

556
00:42:56,430 --> 00:43:00,750
certain biometric data you might want to
the identify it but I can tell you that

557
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:06,359
there are the anonymization techniques
that can counteract the identification

558
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:10,650
and look at every technologies was
creepy when should be gone by something

559
00:43:10,650 --> 00:43:15,710
think about the fact that he can be used
against you so again thank you very much

560
00:43:15,710 --> 00:43:19,079
a little bit of time for questions I
would be happy to take any questions

561
00:43:19,079 --> 00:43:38,280
thank you

562
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:56,360
policy which means I talked about stuff
like this and one of the things I tend

563
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,290
to talk about its culpability and
wondering if you could talk a little bit

564
00:43:59,290 --> 00:44:06,630
of that for example two things that we
didn't talk about vocal pattern analysis

565
00:44:06,630 --> 00:44:15,790
of speech recognition and fame patterns
in your hands you know those are two

566
00:44:15,790 --> 00:44:20,340
things that I've heard people say are
still extremely challenging to stand for

567
00:44:20,340 --> 00:44:24,330
steel or reproduce whereas now we see
like mark Rogers you know with the

568
00:44:24,330 --> 00:44:28,860
YouTube video showing how easy it is to
reproduce a fingerprint and facial stuff

569
00:44:28,860 --> 00:44:36,090
replaying and you have a power someone
is going to pay for stuff by taking a

570
00:44:36,090 --> 00:44:45,690
selfie and blinking when I challenge you
to actually my voice has changed the

571
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:51,180
beginning to now we can became portion
so I might depending on where the type 1

572
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:55,500
and type 2 error threshold you said I
might family Boca wet conditions test

573
00:44:55,500 --> 00:44:59,600
and I know where Canada for example with
their plan system has you save your

574
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:05,000
number and this probably not terrible
consequences to know letting somebody in

575
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:09,460
there so it comes down to it we said
those thresholds but Boko recognition

576
00:45:09,460 --> 00:45:13,320
it's it's in there kinda with I did some
work in nineteen eighties on typing

577
00:45:13,320 --> 00:45:17,580
cotton recognition and it turns out that
I could tell me but I'm built-in

578
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:21,890
software to a different person somebody
hit you in the head and they wouldn't

579
00:45:21,890 --> 00:45:25,980
start to type in your computer I could
detect a change I couldn't figure out

580
00:45:25,980 --> 00:45:30,310
with any great actresses who was typing
or if there were twenty people in the

581
00:45:30,310 --> 00:45:32,090
office which one it was

582
00:45:32,090 --> 00:45:36,640
and the other thing is if you type a
password let's say we tell people how

583
00:45:36,640 --> 00:45:41,730
long passwords complicated passwords
those are the ones that his hardest to

584
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:46,240
reproduce your typing rhythm simple word
that you know is flying big long

585
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:47,629
complicated one

586
00:45:47,630 --> 00:45:49,050
you stumble and so on

587
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:53,300
so there's a home clash of biometrics I
didn't talk about that are just kind of

588
00:45:53,300 --> 00:45:58,050
borderline gay the vein pattern public
repos into that as well I think these

589
00:45:58,050 --> 00:45:59,400
things will get better

590
00:45:59,400 --> 00:46:02,350
the important point I want to make is we
always have to think about the

591
00:46:02,350 --> 00:46:06,779
consequences so if you hear something
that is crucial

592
00:46:06,780 --> 00:46:11,350
access to nuclear power plant it should
be three factors five factors whatever

593
00:46:11,350 --> 00:46:17,450
provided no consequence to keeping the
guy lockdown so you always have to weigh

594
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:21,720
the the type 1 and type 2 whereas the
countervailing thing is convenient to

595
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:28,370
them as you said once used a soapy water
new laptop computer is let you log on

596
00:46:28,370 --> 00:46:32,370
with your smiling face so people are
going to offer convenience and there

597
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:34,779
will be consequences

598
00:46:34,780 --> 00:46:41,540
question yes seeing out I was just
taking it took us twenty to thirty years

599
00:46:41,540 --> 00:46:47,290
to get through this state of the red
mouse game on passwords and things like

600
00:46:47,290 --> 00:46:52,580
that but I hacking now biometrics so
there is a growing field of

601
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:57,900
biotechnology and therefore bio hacking
your brain images being transplanted and

602
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:01,700
influence or changing the way you
perspire

603
00:47:01,700 --> 00:47:07,250
emulation so they can you speak a little
bit about what is happening in terms of

604
00:47:07,250 --> 00:47:12,430
by hacking that will eventually be able
to emulate one human being

605
00:47:12,430 --> 00:47:19,049
another and also break whatever these
technologies ashes but it's really here

606
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:23,200
right that's a wonderful question
because a this can be a bio hacking

607
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:26,970
village at DEFCON for the first time
that you haven't been to DEFCON

608
00:47:26,970 --> 00:47:31,509
a lockpicking village right we can learn
to pick locks is a wifi hacking village

609
00:47:31,510 --> 00:47:36,830
for the first time this year there's a
bio and I like kind of helped with the

610
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:40,890
people showing I did a lot of the work
but it was inspired by the fact that I

611
00:47:40,890 --> 00:47:44,350
saw a guy speaking at the hackers on
planet earth conference in New York

612
00:47:44,350 --> 00:47:49,799
twenty year old graduate student and I
realize the same thing happened in

613
00:47:49,800 --> 00:47:53,470
nineteen eighties when computers went
from causing five million dollars to

614
00:47:53,470 --> 00:47:59,310
$500 is happening with biotechnology
because a lot of university labs and

615
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:04,500
drug company labs are solely their own
gear up on eBay so I asked this kid from

616
00:48:04,500 --> 00:48:09,250
the ghetto how did you get the equipment
to do DNA synthesis and make a new

617
00:48:09,250 --> 00:48:14,740
organism I bought it on eBay for $300 so
as not technology moves will get to see

618
00:48:14,740 --> 00:48:18,799
exactly the same thing and we saw with
computer hacking and I said to the

619
00:48:18,800 --> 00:48:23,940
school don't you worry something bad
will happen he said oh no I'm great I

620
00:48:23,940 --> 00:48:28,740
said when you also weighed on 94 pounds
someone could pick you up and carry you

621
00:48:28,740 --> 00:48:33,529
away and torture you and make you do bad
things with your knowledge so it's

622
00:48:33,530 --> 00:48:38,500
pretty well unregulated if we do my own
research at the University this fourteen

623
00:48:38,500 --> 00:48:43,420
different forms to fill out the safety
officer if we do in our basement not so

624
00:48:43,420 --> 00:48:47,380
much so natural question there is
certainly the possibility that so many

625
00:48:47,380 --> 00:48:53,430
will find a way to grow a finger that
has a certain fingerprint or chew spoofs

626
00:48:53,430 --> 00:48:59,040
the DNA testing there's a catch pooping
suddenly begin school for satellite

627
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:03,970
electronically very soon will be able to
do the same thing in biology and you'll

628
00:49:03,970 --> 00:49:06,060
to follow breakers whilst lead

629
00:49:06,060 --> 00:49:10,430
things are going to grow exponentially
so we can say now yeah well that's

630
00:49:10,430 --> 00:49:14,359
pretty for factual two years from now
it's less far-fetched and three years

631
00:49:14,360 --> 00:49:17,670
from now it's happening so everything
you said is true I think we need to

632
00:49:17,670 --> 00:49:23,730
worry about buying a questionnaire yes
please we're well into our second decade

633
00:49:23,730 --> 00:49:29,480
of parents doing neonatal testing in
it'll DNA testing for children so those

634
00:49:29,480 --> 00:49:32,730
kids are starting to reach age of
majority and the consensus duration

635
00:49:32,730 --> 00:49:38,340
changes radically can you speak about
what we can I had an epiphany when I was

636
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:42,450
researching the book which is down when
we were all born they took some blood

637
00:49:42,450 --> 00:49:47,879
from are here and they tested out for
certain inborn errors of metabolism Lake

638
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:52,540
Cree que you look this up if you're not
familiar with that if they catch that

639
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:58,779
soon after body baby is born they can
administer drugs to correcting but it

640
00:49:58,780 --> 00:50:03,800
occurred to me that all over the place
there are samples over blood which is

641
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:08,710
basically our DNA they can get DNA from
the Pharaohs you money why can't they

642
00:50:08,710 --> 00:50:14,000
get it from that and more and they're
actually been lawsuits in Texas notably

643
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:20,610
where whole treasure truce of DNA
records or blood or he'll stick records

644
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:25,220
have been destroyed by court order
because people are concerned about their

645
00:50:25,220 --> 00:50:29,540
children's privacy being invaded to
separate the Canadian sign for the

646
00:50:29,540 --> 00:50:34,850
American side it was a survey in Canada
that said do you consider creepy that we

647
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:38,450
might have your blood sample your
child's blood sample and Canadian said

648
00:50:38,450 --> 00:50:43,609
as long as you know me so the Canadians
were came down on the side of ya go

649
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:46,940
ahead the americans came down the side
we're going to show you where to take

650
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:52,130
your record I did have a more specific
question they're not really it's

651
00:50:52,130 --> 00:50:56,890
addressing you mentioned PKU I was back
when I was a reporter covering the stuff

652
00:50:56,890 --> 00:51:01,560
instead of a scary practitioner the
stuff I talked to the legislature who

653
00:51:01,560 --> 00:51:02,920
had been a nurse

654
00:51:02,920 --> 00:51:06,369
and was very concerned about getting all
children in the state which I live

655
00:51:06,369 --> 00:51:09,869
tested for you you know what birds
because you know she had some very

656
00:51:09,869 --> 00:51:15,619
specific benefits today obviously and
she had not at all consider the privacy

657
00:51:15,619 --> 00:51:19,089
implications and I know that there was
no mechanism I said will there be a

658
00:51:19,089 --> 00:51:23,740
mechanism in age 18 or they can call
their records and she looked at me like

659
00:51:23,740 --> 00:51:30,040
I'm falling out of the Moon so i was
just curious that's been a bit we've

660
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:33,910
evolved any thinking of the legislative
level that we're talking about on that

661
00:51:33,910 --> 00:51:38,770
front the answer is it's going to be a
policy and I guess the USB 51 policy

662
00:51:38,770 --> 00:51:42,640
reached at the federal one as well and
the US won the imagine we have

663
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:46,339
encountered that we do tend to have
unified policies frankly we normally

664
00:51:46,339 --> 00:51:50,200
copied you on a lot of things but I
think this is something we did have a

665
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:55,930
big controversy with the huntington's
Society of Canada night taking the task

666
00:51:55,930 --> 00:51:59,940
in the book because they weren't
commercials said getting tested put you

667
00:51:59,940 --> 00:52:04,390
at risk and you have to understand
huntington's disease that if you have

668
00:52:04,390 --> 00:52:09,089
the gym genetics for you will get it and
you'll get it published by the age of 35

669
00:52:09,089 --> 00:52:14,240
and you'll die a slow death and its
interim so there's ethical questions

670
00:52:14,240 --> 00:52:18,660
about you tell a ten year old child
you're gonna die that way though maybe

671
00:52:18,660 --> 00:52:23,368
not because it might be fixed by then
the other possibilities you know does

672
00:52:23,369 --> 00:52:28,390
that actually put you at risk we don't
have a genetic non-discrimination Act

673
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:33,118
account you do you have Gina in the us-
and so the society was pushing for that

674
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:40,329
and we should have that law might go
with them is that put you at risk what

675
00:52:40,329 --> 00:52:44,490
happens with the results and get the
task and never look at it never look at

676
00:52:44,490 --> 00:52:49,229
it to look childish 21 but you certainly
don't want to share with anybody and you

677
00:52:49,230 --> 00:52:52,309
certainly don't want to share with the
government and by the way if you're

678
00:52:52,309 --> 00:52:57,410
gonna send in your DNA 23 and me make
sure you do it anonymously

679
00:52:57,410 --> 00:53:02,140
the name of your dog in your cat and we
did that and we got confusing the family

680
00:53:02,140 --> 00:53:06,330
about which part was which person which
was pretty funny we had some twenty

681
00:53:06,330 --> 00:53:08,380
hysterical actually

682
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:12,880
genetic testing results but if you give
away your DNA would never give away my

683
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:18,450
DNA in a way that was tagging and of
course I tried an experiment I called 23

684
00:53:18,450 --> 00:53:23,960
me and I said oh I've lost the password
for the account what do I need to do and

685
00:53:23,960 --> 00:53:27,920
they said you have two factions
government-issued IDs passport or

686
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:31,380
driver's license which of course would
defeat the whole purpose of being a not

687
00:53:31,380 --> 00:53:40,510
so if you do 23 doing under the name her
pussy cat and don't forget the password

688
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:47,600
questions discussion Ranch neighborhood
that Khan

689
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:55,759
good country and retaining who went to
be sides to do I have missed that 1 I'm

690
00:53:55,760 --> 00:54:01,370
done are saved under done this and
decides on my list in the future

691
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:06,040
on that happy note I just saw sign me up
I messed up which means I'll give you

692
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:11,300
back five minutes of your life of the
party on time thank you so much for

693
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:16,040
coming out tonight please consider doing
my book my I was tickled to finance now

694
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:20,970
being sold on walmart.com that happens
to be the cheapest place to get it and I

695
00:54:20,970 --> 00:54:25,120
trigger well I must say really arrived
at the showing my booking 12 thank you

696
00:54:25,120 --> 00:54:25,450
very much
