1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,480
hello I am so what choice from those
career today I represent a story about a

2
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:09,990
few ideas for how to resolve

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:20,320
skidded a pay phone shown saying nothing
packets a PID opposition members

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:26,789
aristide functionalities by a
pro-prosecution lol writers use

5
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:36,010
commercial pickers the chance to protect
to stay there API's and some mo AR

6
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:43,390
riders use their skills and techniques
have been developed their own custom of

7
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:53,140
us cares so far there is no key office
kitchen tools for some pictures I mean

8
00:00:53,140 --> 00:01:03,390
the mother and the ladies purse on
previous sample regarding Bermuda many a

9
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:17,140
search on Google then we can find some
articles how to be a pro skate and some

10
00:01:17,140 --> 00:01:19,020
YouTube videos

11
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:28,270
technical details but they worked on
previous specials with the latest

12
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:38,939
version is 2.2 3.2 by the information on
how to unpack

13
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:42,258
2.1 and so on

14
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:53,630
there is no X 64 on pictures so I want
money to the office Katie so its latest

15
00:01:53,630 --> 00:02:00,770
version packed binary files and I will

16
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:12,890
first API pastiche own techniques how to
the office he now so it's a good idea

17
00:02:12,890 --> 00:02:17,980
propagation techniques and I will show
you some implementation and animal

18
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:31,738
crackers used various application
techniques they use empty devoting very

19
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:37,730
simple band preamp detection to borrow
detection and to do so Samui and

20
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:40,030
temporary and key

21
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:47,150
protests and they opened use
virtualization application to the length

22
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:54,030
in the dynamic insertion trace and they
use polymorphism and metamorphose in

23
00:02:54,030 --> 00:03:01,530
there is a 2002 optimization now they
lengthen by inserting IVs instructions

24
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:14,049
and API opposition to this or focus is a
key opposition and API obfuscation

25
00:03:14,049 --> 00:03:22,010
techniques can be equipped fighting to
the first city to host a show that the

26
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:29,358
bus station in the shower when used that
is taking time and there's a car news

27
00:03:29,359 --> 00:03:36,910
diane Amy aka position in buying a
prescription act executable file

28
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:42,700
contains run time of death

29
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:51,880
expands API you go to a payphone crude
into some memory area and you can find

30
00:03:51,880 --> 00:04:01,990
more on Apr posters and techniques on
our museum rapa opposition very true

31
00:04:01,990 --> 00:04:22,670
compile and run me load the binary video
poker the code is always the same so it

32
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:30,350
is relatively easy to analyze 38 I
prosecuted by another is bullish on the

33
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:34,860
instructions and all the rest he's out
there saying its excretion of those

34
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:41,790
addresses I'm moving because of a
sell-off in the picture you can see how

35
00:04:41,790 --> 00:04:51,720
a prosecution is applied at the regional
entry point into yeah yeah

36
00:04:51,720 --> 00:05:00,060
been unpacked yes properly then we can
find a resume LAPI equal these are

37
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:07,440
posted into action yourself call from
some other race is a post dated so it

38
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,469
redirects to other section of the Pinery

39
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:21,200
skated Colo code and skated color-coded
result deal plus Katie address or

40
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:29,349
something different and finally they go
to ATM machine code but some wineries

41
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:31,890
were overstated

42
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:39,349
escape perot they uncovered

43
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:47,600
for its Judy

44
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:55,720
2.3 per entry fact binary files now I
packed my own easiest sample code

45
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:05,480
address 1017 there is a whole
instruction to another section of the

46
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:14,440
reasons stated by there are hundreds of
instructions but most of them are copies

47
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:24,370
and they range in 2006 in an elapsed API
kohl is performed by returning to action

48
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:32,930
that allowed to return your throat and
direct their control 02 8810 Kurt

49
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:42,070
for Crim pro tect they use their their
address is not the top of the stack the

50
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:54,140
return of christie's so we are in the
stay in miami radio station 8800 stated

51
00:06:54,140 --> 00:07:03,050
during runtime now while unpacking both
eighty-eight construction and ATA from

52
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:12,120
Sean Cody skated so a point on the
receiving end the upper skated sometimes

53
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,410
and that of course Katie in 1964

54
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:26,510
HJ Mohd self is overstated runtime so
Randy obfuscated intervals on the rest

55
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:34,500
is called is directed to control theory
is directed to include addressed that is

56
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:39,689
run time allocated memory area

57
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:49,270
and here is another example I picked
this to me that she broke its

58
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:57,070
instruction in the future calls to
another area

59
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:03,740
newly allocated area don't have names
and executed some instructions for

60
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:12,180
instructions and now they've caused
something and you know they don't they

61
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:17,210
don't even call the phone itself to
produce a platform which is there but

62
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:27,520
they don't ask 82801 called inside the
office ki kote ou so we can sometimes

63
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,730
there you can check set breakpoints on
some other point over a game called

64
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:44,780
inside the opposite the quote from shows
then how can the office skated skate API

65
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:59,829
showed us pictures in this results I
didn't mean to develop some unpack were

66
00:08:59,830 --> 00:09:07,220
dumping some decent reputable I just
wanted to analyze their structural

67
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:17,640
buying by funds meant to symbolize and
compel us and so after the unification

68
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:26,350
original entry point not true that is
used for developers and now just a must

69
00:09:26,350 --> 00:09:33,889
and I want to recover a telephone calls
the original entry point

70
00:09:33,889 --> 00:09:44,609
finding original entry point is somewhat
easy in 2006 royal coal rail routes on

71
00:09:44,609 --> 00:09:51,109
paper called fully unpacked she opened
in his pool

72
00:09:51,109 --> 00:10:01,639
online so we can use it but it's very
slow and so I developed my horizontal my

73
00:10:01,639 --> 00:10:08,799
tools to find course no entry point it
records every memory right and you

74
00:10:08,799 --> 00:10:15,769
should too

75
00:10:15,769 --> 00:10:21,970
so long because it saves every return
the memory address is so I decided to

76
00:10:21,970 --> 00:10:30,699
save memory or the rest of us has a
memory or UPA's allowed to return to the

77
00:10:30,699 --> 00:10:42,628
rest there is extruded and terrifying
who we can resolve AP a former first

78
00:10:42,629 --> 00:10:50,540
lady station I saw its asked its ready
to run into a team effort to improve on

79
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:53,639
and dynamic

80
00:10:53,639 --> 00:11:02,889
a picture or station such as memory
access and i says so steady state is

81
00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:13,949
that include 64 and 32 and 64 and now
some other pictures and post some

82
00:11:13,949 --> 00:11:23,569
pictures do you still use some
techniques so first we need to find a

83
00:11:23,569 --> 00:11:27,189
court ended its use

84
00:11:27,189 --> 00:11:39,459
hope it turns 64 minor in call you or
talk to something change it into call

85
00:11:39,459 --> 00:11:47,399
well three through the end of the state
is that this is different from hers so

86
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:57,399
we need some prior knowledge on earth
find ya posted

87
00:11:57,399 --> 00:12:10,410
caller disruptions that is there not
this

88
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:20,160
where you can find many sorts for winter
module off holes in the Arboretum find

89
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:29,519
all posts case goes that doesn't have a
name and I did it help you so it's

90
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:36,129
supposed to go buy pet on Caldwell
authority to use a candidate and tech

91
00:12:36,129 --> 00:12:45,430
radar the other STDs in another section
of processing and we need to take the

92
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:51,779
whole targeted News December correctly
the core is photographed by the rest is

93
00:12:51,779 --> 00:13:00,639
approximation redundant addresses so we
need to try to call targeted to sell

94
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:07,930
some of the correctly

95
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:17,729
and finally wrong there now call
instruction instruction down the six

96
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:28,920
empath go into a pit road so yeah you
execute a bowl of ice skated call up and

97
00:13:28,920 --> 00:13:39,160
skated coco de sécurité finally got
going on Curry's rooted so you can use

98
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:49,240
some believe you situation techniques to
resolve this cause but some of heart and

99
00:13:49,240 --> 00:14:07,370
decided to use some chicken interests so
I change it and yeah being 30 tributes

100
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:16,910
is changing into candidate a typo
address it is and it should you feel AJ

101
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:22,420
promotion so their first insertion

102
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:30,920
cutie and branches and through other
section of quote and finally it go to

103
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:34,829
cruise to ya

104
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:49,350
a promotion code integrated check her
damn girl was used for automated can get

105
00:14:49,350 --> 00:15:07,140
all dressed so I checked stack pointer
techno study cell change it and I'm Dana

106
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:16,650
Dan until we check all ATI in court
ended its so at last we have you know

107
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:28,840
the address is that a guy calls it
already brought you a better method can

108
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:42,220
be applied to various pictures you can
unpack been protect us 64 mph but always

109
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:50,540
Asian of posted its execution traces
lengthy and thorough yeah it is

110
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:58,410
nonetheless he is being protected just a
mutated in OC I'm picker yeah it's a

111
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:04,939
little bit strange but first lady call
insertion yourself and also with our

112
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:06,510
first few instructions

113
00:16:06,510 --> 00:16:16,250
HIV prevention so compact binaries the
execution paths grow while they go to

114
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:24,150
and sometimes I analyze how some pic are
picked by an arrest you know they use

115
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:28,569
some tricky math or through on skating

116
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:39,059
simple they use encoding and decoding
using extremists but sometimes they use

117
00:16:39,059 --> 00:16:43,809
their key runtime generate

118
00:16:43,809 --> 00:16:51,069
so difficult in such cases about
eventually execution history today

119
00:16:51,069 --> 00:17:04,138
into reality competition so we can keep
our security for binary I used x64

120
00:17:04,138 --> 00:17:12,349
driver after deposition every order a
set of results to relocate from China

121
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:24,259
and it is running you can dump some
churches and temples and we can use

122
00:17:24,259 --> 00:17:36,280
either peru to compile and I recover

123
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:46,530
and there's a kinase TK devastation for
prosecutors will be complex down steady

124
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:56,870
ako position in dynamic composition
process that I breed AP abrams shows

125
00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:06,419
that the deal was created one by one so
runtime upscale are embedded in the

126
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:16,070
binaries al reves each function and
toasty each into construction and rides

127
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:23,510
the opposite case grew into newly
allocated memory its focus on his house

128
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:37,940
key in sequence in this picture put some
rain stopped by and look at the

129
00:18:37,940 --> 00:18:46,680
situation trace you can find some
findings are showing instructions are at

130
00:18:46,680 --> 00:18:58,970
the inception is extended to other area
and the region and next by and and

131
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:06,450
connect it is done automatically so

132
00:19:06,450 --> 00:19:18,110
and doing some I decided to use the
memory access so memory system nazis

133
00:19:18,110 --> 00:19:25,740
Mary Reeves AP a promotion code and
corresponding memory rights skated code

134
00:19:25,740 --> 00:19:36,390
addresses up skated 80 shown you some
mapped into a regional a function then

135
00:19:36,390 --> 00:19:42,440
after constructing a map then you can
recover relay the information by the

136
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:50,380
Associated Corp I get the addresses so
you first need to construct a map from

137
00:19:50,380 --> 00:20:01,370
custody but the rest to comment on this
picture right addresses before David

138
00:20:01,370 --> 00:20:09,840
comes on the reefs approximation is
bigger than her skating instruction

139
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:19,159
addresses so I was just a rat and
written there are some copies or rights

140
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:27,720
so now its content contained read or the
rest is contained in the right address

141
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:34,270
and I'll post dated check all tied up
the rest is contained in red read the

142
00:20:34,270 --> 00:20:39,560
rest is so we need to record every
memory rights before the next on the

143
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:48,100
world lol regarding really need to check
the memory read all the recipes is

144
00:20:48,100 --> 00:21:00,360
contained in the AP AR dresses I limited
number of memory ride for the los 80

145
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:07,540
by a prosecutor Col

146
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:17,360
I did it was a pattern matching method
patterns may contain false positives and

147
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:21,740
target the rest me so so pretty

148
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:32,490
insertions the sexiest by checking and
their direct call and direct calls so

149
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:40,620
you need other things you need to
director colby is always understand yeah

150
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:45,100
if their targets are in their
constructed map from the skater dress to

151
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:50,439
a paper mache yeah we need to modify
call i guess to the reason I feel I

152
00:21:50,440 --> 00:22:02,390
should be addressed and regarding
indirect call or a sick ones i text and

153
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:10,010
up to date on that contains approach to
address table into one segment ran the

154
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:19,220
binder is packed we need to identify
memory block contains excessive

155
00:22:19,220 --> 00:22:25,410
appreciation for much of the rest is
that their memory area is at first all

156
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:35,860
zeros in on some copies crude protect
and recheck check the weather here is

157
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:42,209
meaningless people or and it contains
the rest is it is a curious state so we

158
00:22:42,210 --> 00:22:43,760
need to improve

159
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:54,490
and you need to modify or ski gold dress
is the laity candidate

160
00:22:54,490 --> 00:23:11,760
definition so doing this weekend x86
priority over to your station and dump

161
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:21,620
it executable file and compile
disassembled to test the office and I

162
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:32,199
want to show you the most I prepare a
true fact simplest takes a long time

163
00:23:32,200 --> 00:23:41,660
percy stymie AP radio station on picking
over 64 bit simple and regarding steady

164
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:50,780
8 p.m. ideal situation now 2.3 point PI
I use commercial commercial pick up act

165
00:23:50,780 --> 00:24:03,800
32 bit mode yeah I don't think he
previously

166
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:36,039
made a simple code and packed 332 points
3.5 read i read your machine

167
00:24:36,039 --> 00:25:02,340
developed using helped him to trace
memory read write and extrusion

168
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:26,840
suggest some more AP or AP and the
fourth column is the code for the rest

169
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:38,559
of the second column indicates whether
it is cold and module and mouse model is

170
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:51,049
shown me so I used read this information
all the script I'm not that mean 664 I

171
00:25:51,049 --> 00:26:08,908
use and I newest I translated into the
Treaty of poor grip so it can be done

172
00:26:08,909 --> 00:26:13,370
manually can be done

173
00:26:13,370 --> 00:26:16,889
script

174
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:24,020
I use this to verify it is extremely
slow and party and I don't know whether

175
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:33,400
there is a better deal for perot brought
it was used by an uproar depending but

176
00:26:33,400 --> 00:26:45,690
it crashes alot and me and all I ask a
binder in so I used it and there is no

177
00:26:45,690 --> 00:27:03,470
script and me ten rounds creep tests
embarked so right takes very long time

178
00:27:03,470 --> 00:27:14,590
simple simple example just drop off some
mystery box

179
00:27:14,590 --> 00:27:21,399
so

180
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:39,600
simple and study the idea of downloaded
files from fires total five days overall

181
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:53,449
length in binary mode and is doing some
bad things is packed with our and

182
00:27:53,450 --> 00:28:05,290
generates drop by and make some changes
and doing bad things

183
00:28:05,290 --> 00:28:38,908
systems are races and shortcomings in
bed things so

184
00:28:38,909 --> 00:29:20,999
already

185
00:29:20,999 --> 00:29:46,159
plugins to borrow in school or did you
scraped and more of a different idea

186
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:55,149
about being used phantom dancer already
and made some configuration and I

187
00:29:55,149 --> 00:30:03,319
changed their original paul Bremer are
you showing this machine to avoid

188
00:30:03,319 --> 00:30:28,019
detection so what is the IP and I
started the sides over and get some

189
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:37,669
information on the module and to resolve
each API calls at those best kind of

190
00:30:37,669 --> 00:30:40,500
addresses

191
00:30:40,500 --> 00:30:50,440
so

192
00:30:50,440 --> 00:31:05,269
very slowly until the earlier and it is
packed so we need to be overstated by

193
00:31:05,269 --> 00:31:14,260
the script generated

194
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:29,990
in the other s table and are you just
change it and the rest is resolved

195
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:55,410
and research for

196
00:31:55,410 --> 00:32:16,790
result

197
00:32:16,790 --> 00:32:30,470
and I found some holes

198
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:48,700
excuse on the number I use similar to
Tom file and can be a comment by

199
00:32:48,700 --> 00:33:53,020
entering OUP and I T 030 S and size so

200
00:33:53,020 --> 00:34:20,370
now there are so many of us so we need
to manually correct days

201
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:32,810
unresolved address is so this is my demo

202
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:43,070
is why you askin cool to resolve APO
addresses it is developed under I mean

203
00:34:43,070 --> 00:34:51,380
there was a print 1736 to be on the
internet I used to be just 20 2013 in

204
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:58,750
helping to put into one for the ladies
and your spider script to Petra posted

205
00:34:58,750 --> 00:35:10,600
call reversing nearly tools were all the
deboers and I'll approach the opposition

206
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:17,580
processes follow Apr resolver
thirty-something tool

207
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:24,819
information and generate a text file and
a permission to text while it is used by

208
00:35:24,820 --> 00:35:33,080
a Python script tomorrow skirt so it
produces zero a script and Randy

209
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,069
tomorrow

210
00:35:34,070 --> 00:35:43,130
binary read the script and backed by an
irate and you can get your skin while

211
00:35:43,130 --> 00:35:51,890
renewed on profile than we do you tend
to a study on my sister either pro I

212
00:35:51,890 --> 00:36:00,790
should text file and the occasional
script

213
00:36:00,790 --> 00:36:12,390
so to wrap up I suggested to API the
investigation methods on his memory

214
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:18,500
access on those destroyed I know me a
question on his every it's already drawn

215
00:36:18,500 --> 00:36:27,560
to a city bus station as a result of
commercial pic are protected minority

216
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:34,480
can be analyzed using a kind of scare
using the Bogor and disassembler and

217
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:43,700
Decompiler but it has some limitations
and is demanding dynamic binary

218
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:53,950
instrumentation truth I used tested
dynamo Rio but the EPA Darius the PDA is

219
00:36:53,950 --> 00:37:01,540
almost as saying by some pictures can
detect 909 E minor instrumentation tools

220
00:37:01,540 --> 00:37:07,550
there are words that or I like it here

221
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:17,310
transparency feature or binary binary
instrumentation tools and the latest

222
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:27,630
version of obscene you detect and
helping your case I used to be paid to

223
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:36,000
such things it also delete how to
operate points so I need some patients

224
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:43,860
are doing great points that cannot be
detected through a break point on some

225
00:37:43,860 --> 00:37:56,040
and DLL biased and crash in some
applications for example ran I tried to

226
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,920
an alliance

227
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:07,130
day matching program damn maybe game
programs Hughes some applications and

228
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:11,410
they also have some protection
mechanisms so

229
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:20,450
they hit the gym so I took crash in some
applications and I don't know why

230
00:38:20,450 --> 00:38:32,689
discretion so far so far and manually do
some jobs you can set breakpoint all

231
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:40,410
memory read and ride at some point and
manually low where I develop some

232
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:49,190
awesome screen to unpack such bias that
but it takes to draw a baaaad party of

233
00:38:49,190 --> 00:38:57,710
state I developed require three or four
minutes read lots of file but when I use

234
00:38:57,710 --> 00:39:06,640
so to both scream you two hours to the
upper stage the office stated special

235
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:16,450
now packed application but it works but
was so there's a future where I wanted

236
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:27,470
to develop later just checking I
currently I have some anyway there is

237
00:39:27,470 --> 00:39:39,529
some extraction box and extraction 6:32
p.m. you by Chris single and it is

238
00:39:39,529 --> 00:39:45,049
working but it's a little bit tricky
because they doesn't support their

239
00:39:45,049 --> 00:39:56,799
threat than I expected the CPU only
yesterday I heard that or brutality

240
00:39:56,799 --> 00:39:57,970
unicorn

241
00:39:57,970 --> 00:40:05,368
days dream day says that dream emulator
but it doesn't support much shredding so

242
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:15,849
we cannot apply that in this case
because they are you use your around 220

243
00:40:15,849 --> 00:40:20,829
threads to check whether it is analyzed
who are not so

244
00:40:20,829 --> 00:40:32,099
I need so much press support emulator
Android takeover optimization in binary

245
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:37,839
different birds and sometimes

246
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:49,279
custom stickers use your station so I
any skater Joannie deal persecuting

247
00:40:49,279 --> 00:40:59,190
minorities and I knew they were the
kindest unnoticed for some pictures so

248
00:40:59,190 --> 00:41:21,020
many Christians

249
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:24,130
any tests on the IRA
