1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
without further ado elect introduced to
colleagues of mines and India friends

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,649
they're going to have to talk about
something really awesome fire crowding

3
00:00:06,649 --> 00:00:11,230
you ate of XXII so please get a warm
round of applause for his charm Juan and

4
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:26,880
surgical body thank you so much on the
last talked so we'll show you some 0

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:33,629
days will show you some cool demos but
first let me introduce myself

6
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:40,110
sergei body prosecuted engineer at
Salesforce I work on mobile and web apps

7
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,809
and my colleague

8
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:47,750
Sharan and both Angelo surgeon I am i
calling for sitting here we're all

9
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:51,699
working for Salesforce and my research
interests are web application security

10
00:00:51,699 --> 00:00:56,539
browser security and bunch of other
random stuff so we'll make it

11
00:00:56,539 --> 00:01:02,449
interesting we know we only talked to
stand between you and the party's gonna

12
00:01:02,449 --> 00:01:10,210
make it as interesting as possible so
blatant alright so what are we talking

13
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:18,679
about we're talking about XML right so
XML is an interesting animal it has a

14
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,570
bunch of cool features it allows you to
embed the doctype and when you embed

15
00:01:23,570 --> 00:01:28,189
deduct type you can specify an entity in
general or perimeter entity and and she

16
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:33,339
essentially just a symbolic link
symbolic link to a file or some data

17
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:38,079
anything that can be stored outside of
the current document and I really like

18
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:43,298
this court W W ABC put together that all
external entities are well formed by

19
00:01:43,299 --> 00:01:51,619
definition but let's look into that so
typical XXII 101 this was taken from the

20
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:56,420
black half of last year's talk and
essentially this is an example of how to

21
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:56,939
do

22
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:01,360
XML external HDD expansion that's what
the exercise stands for

23
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:08,360
so let's take a look we have an entity
called XXII and it basically means to

24
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,630
see password and when XML parser look so
this

25
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:18,500
it tries to resolve and gold and tries
to fetch the Nazi past her and see

26
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:23,950
what's inside of it and of course
there's no XML there so something will

27
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:25,290
happen

28
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,489
alright so this is not a new problem
will talk you know there's a talk this

29
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:33,540
morning there was about a sexy and
they're a bunch of talks from last year

30
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:39,220
so not really anything but why are we
still here you know what was the talk

31
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:44,560
about so we're going to talk about you
know the problem that not only your

32
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,090
applications that you use XAML parses
and you fix them but also the

33
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:55,070
application that you run on and the
applications like browsers that you use

34
00:02:55,070 --> 00:03:02,390
to look at your web apps are also
problematic invulnerable alright so with

35
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:09,959
this like dragged along didn't show you
so let's see I was working on a simple

36
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:15,810
web app that does nothing but pretty
much takes a file an XML file you

37
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:25,270
uploaded and it is a pretty print so
it's a simple file uploaded and you know

38
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:31,190
it is a work in progress just the demo
so they decided well hey you know XML

39
00:03:31,190 --> 00:03:36,329
the problematic maybe I should look into
defending against external entities so

40
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:45,230
the XML from last year's breakout talk
and i just uploaded and boom what do you

41
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:48,250
see it's my Etsy password

42
00:03:48,250 --> 00:03:54,500
okay missus alright so I decided well
let let's go fix it in a code let's go

43
00:03:54,500 --> 00:04:03,760
look at my basically XML parsing and
where I create the the factory you see

44
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,820
I'm just creating factories so let's
just make sure that you know we secure

45
00:04:07,820 --> 00:04:14,040
it ok so how do I secure this thing so I
was like ok I remember that all I had

46
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:19,120
some recommendations and we look at the
jobs section ok you have document

47
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:24,810
builder factory you have searched seas
ok X Factor the one that I'm using says

48
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:30,310
turned the TV off well that's not what I
need I really need to actually to make

49
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:34,610
it work cuz I wanted to throw an
exception when they used ed so I kept

50
00:04:34,610 --> 00:04:40,230
working and so we basically found a way
to turn off external entities

51
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:48,639
specifically alright so let's try this
going to turn off external entity safe

52
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:58,360
stop restart the server

53
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:08,470
we're still up or so

54
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:15,820
alright and upload the same factory and
see what happens

55
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:19,960
what's the problem

56
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:27,530
looks like my Etsy password you still
result even after I said the JDK please

57
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:33,390
don't touch my files and don't touch any
external entities it still resolved so

58
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:37,349
this looks like a problem you know and
you know Java is telling you how to do

59
00:05:37,350 --> 00:05:42,030
it but it's not working so we kept
looking inside it well hey there's

60
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:46,960
another future in XML parsers called
resolvers and you can passing your own

61
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:54,320
is over so let's try to do this too so
we have a factory

62
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:05,880
XML resolve her creating new over and
this basically creates a every time that

63
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:10,620
the XML asking us to result somebody
just the returns no ok so we should

64
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,860
totally work right

65
00:06:11,860 --> 00:06:22,640
XML is not supposed to resolve the
country trying to not let reagan back

66
00:06:22,640 --> 00:06:24,950
refresh

67
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:40,620
training load still the same problem so
what's going on

68
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:46,100
looks like we have an XML parser that
has a future you supporting external

69
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:50,490
ET's and I went to look at the docking
station and its default that is actually

70
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:57,690
unspecified that was interesting so with
the unspecified one I decided to well

71
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:03,940
you know if you said the proper feature
to false this should really not work but

72
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:10,710
as we just saw it doesn't work for the
militias case where you have external

73
00:07:10,710 --> 00:07:14,989
entity that expand inside another in
city makes it thrown exception

74
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:22,120
normal files worked so this made me
really where you working with XML and

75
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:27,139
Java you know especially if it taken
into account that you said don't resolve

76
00:07:27,139 --> 00:07:40,160
and the results so what is the effect so
baby I SAML SSO XML RPC all of those use

77
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:47,570
XML you can pass doctype they can pass
external entities and even if you're on

78
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:56,450
your server in JDK hate do not resolve
extremities still works so we we of

79
00:07:56,450 --> 00:08:01,460
course thought well this is a problem so
we contacted or more calls said yeah

80
00:08:01,460 --> 00:08:09,320
this is a zero day we're going to fix it
and so essentially like all of the JDK

81
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:16,860
was affected like every single version
this is cool so resolvers I thought well

82
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:21,610
passing now you know should have been
really fixing the problem but turns out

83
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:26,370
that the Eclipse auto-generated stuff is
not super helpful what you really should

84
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:31,910
do and it's slightly counterintuitive
need to return a completely new input

85
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:36,919
source that would actually fix it right
so

86
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:45,959
now you have a web server running an old
version of job are relatively old 78 65

87
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:52,779
it's not really that old so if you have
the service running and what you can do

88
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:59,019
you can still some data but how do you
get it you can get it using a couple of

89
00:08:59,019 --> 00:09:05,260
weeks you can use the XML printing of
the areas that I show it to you or

90
00:09:05,260 --> 00:09:11,740
actually you can use the DNS out of
bounds that was talked about in like a

91
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:18,589
2013 but dennis has kind of a few
disadvantages there's a limit on the

92
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:22,510
size there's some characters that can
support so we decided we're going to

93
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:28,760
just focus on the exceptions ok so if
you look at the exception that is

94
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:34,689
created if you try to resolve a file by
an XML that doesn't really exist like

95
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:40,579
Etsy passwords what happens is that
underneath its a nested exception that

96
00:09:40,579 --> 00:09:44,709
tells you that I just couldn't
understand what what what what is the

97
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:46,540
thing that you're trying to look at

98
00:09:46,540 --> 00:09:53,019
ok so that means that we really need to
do is just cause exceptions and if we're

99
00:09:53,019 --> 00:09:57,990
trying to reach filesystem you know what
Etsy content being can just pass you

100
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:05,220
know jar / like it seemed as if you get
to read it so when you got to that point

101
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:08,870
you're saying she looking at the
contents of the file system that is

102
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:18,410
exposed to the user as an exception so
you call a SAML you know API or like so

103
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:22,019
VPI and you get back an exception and he
gives you the content of these servers

104
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:26,540
file system that's critical

105
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:29,379
so this is how it looks alright so

106
00:10:29,379 --> 00:10:34,959
I thought this was interesting that
covers only three types of parsers

107
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:42,079
stacks and covers the sex partners and
two types of their sees the

108
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,839
recommendations don't cover a whole lot
more

109
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:51,629
JDK parsers on top of that you also have
popular parsers

110
00:10:51,629 --> 00:10:57,059
available out there and mind you those
parsers actually using you know those

111
00:10:57,059 --> 00:11:02,039
you know let's say a fight she and open
sample to use XML parser underneath the

112
00:11:02,039 --> 00:11:08,409
hood but they don't expose any way to
configure it so then you're using these

113
00:11:08,409 --> 00:11:16,939
features and you can secure them at all
right so what do we have left you know

114
00:11:16,939 --> 00:11:21,269
you know at this point where we have
some features that you can't turn off

115
00:11:21,269 --> 00:11:26,519
and so you have to just at least try to
fix what are called you own so with that

116
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:30,569
you trying to say what what what what
can we do we can disable external

117
00:11:30,569 --> 00:11:36,858
entities like you saw me try and you can
disable de tu support all together like

118
00:11:36,859 --> 00:11:40,489
a whisper commands but that may not be
what you want because you may need btw

119
00:11:40,489 --> 00:11:49,529
so then you can actually try to turn off
also ducked I pitching but the problem

120
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:55,019
is not the mitigation the problems the
parsers themselves one parsers not like

121
00:11:55,019 --> 00:12:01,409
the other they're a bunch of course is
that you can turn the features off and

122
00:12:01,409 --> 00:12:06,749
that's cool and if they work they work
and you can also try to sit and resolve

123
00:12:06,749 --> 00:12:12,569
her like I did in failed and they're
quite some some parcels like that but

124
00:12:12,569 --> 00:12:17,248
there is one person that I like him
particularly on Marshall it doesn't

125
00:12:17,249 --> 00:12:24,309
support any futures so you can't say
anything whatsoever she use it anywhere

126
00:12:24,309 --> 00:12:29,949
you pretty much using it at your own
risk in order to fix on my shoulder you

127
00:12:29,949 --> 00:12:36,620
actually have to create yet another
parser to parse your document

128
00:12:36,620 --> 00:12:41,160
and then you have to turn off course all
the electrics related to fishing and

129
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:49,500
then you create a document you pass the
documents to commercially if everything

130
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:54,920
fails you just have to pick an XML
parser that has a way to turn off

131
00:12:54,920 --> 00:13:00,930
protocol and disabled protocols
altogether so by using the said property

132
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:05,780
Expo constant access external DTD
insight into empty string that means

133
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:13,839
you're limiting the white list of
allowed protocols like HTTP FTP and

134
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:19,010
there's a hundred do it but this is all
cool which talked about a lot of you

135
00:13:19,010 --> 00:13:24,670
know server apps and using XML you know
that many apps use that we we kind of

136
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:31,380
need a bigger target so weird that I'm
gonna pass to my colleague chiron

137
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:45,460
alright thanks again so I switched to my
screen ok ok I guess that the drama

138
00:13:45,460 --> 00:13:49,830
partners are complicated and they all
have different ways that might work to

139
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:53,900
support disabled of different things and
be the bigger target and then to give

140
00:13:53,900 --> 00:14:00,829
another punch of Steve Ballmer so what
are targeted we talk about exes season

141
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:05,000
but we talked about in the context of
web applications we thought about the

142
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:10,340
way as to excluded as a using malicious
acts tomorrow to attack a server in

143
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:14,790
order to get the content of the server
out so saying the scenario you want to

144
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:18,480
attack a server that works but what
about other cases what about you when I

145
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:23,850
attack individual user we want to attack
millions of users who want to make the

146
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:29,630
biggest impact two different genre
products and we try to think about what

147
00:14:29,630 --> 00:14:34,290
are the products are used by bill is
appealing to users that are parsing XML

148
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:41,279
and answer is now that complicated
browsers

149
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:45,449
so we didn't go directly into twenty
browsers relating to the history of

150
00:14:45,449 --> 00:14:50,540
browser-based access fees if they could
take a look at the screen in Chrome or

151
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:57,050
Firefox Chrome Safari Dave were
vulnerable in before 2012 because they

152
00:14:57,050 --> 00:15:02,079
were using them on the reversion of the
maximal to but that was fixin 2012 and

153
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:07,508
they're fine afterwards same same thing
for Firefox also use a different library

154
00:15:07,509 --> 00:15:11,410
but also fixing same here you can see
the CBE actually is pretty much closed

155
00:15:11,410 --> 00:15:16,469
so they're actually reporting the same
time ie on the other hand is a different

156
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:26,059
beast the actually fixed fixed the
parser in 2006 but they're sick is to

157
00:15:26,059 --> 00:15:30,550
coming up with a new parser without
fixing the original one so that your

158
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:36,399
parcels convey 64 version 6 and the
original version 3 is still vulnerable

159
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:41,850
to our question is whether we can
trigger double-double the somewhere in

160
00:15:41,850 --> 00:15:48,670
version 3 so we checked out and version
3 strongly linked with IE six so we

161
00:15:48,670 --> 00:15:52,979
figure out nobody was an icicle we hope
nobody's using IE six hours have a

162
00:15:52,980 --> 00:15:59,480
bigger problems and how can we call each
other while we using newer version by

163
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:00,779
ease right

164
00:16:00,779 --> 00:16:05,949
kids who don't want just organized six
is like treating targeted disabled but

165
00:16:05,949 --> 00:16:12,420
we want to go with newer version like I
E 11 where people actually using so

166
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:16,870
quick smoke I think maybe a lot of you
really heard of this Court's most

167
00:16:16,870 --> 00:16:22,410
interesting featuring I you that you can
let the browser to run in the older

168
00:16:22,410 --> 00:16:26,879
versions of the ie to maintain
compatible only say have a new website

169
00:16:26,879 --> 00:16:32,850
and we have a website is not working
with IU 1110 you want to work without

170
00:16:32,850 --> 00:16:38,339
you 798 rely you six so I you give you
this convenient feature to rule your

171
00:16:38,339 --> 00:16:45,980
browser back to 10 years ago with the
security of ten years ago as well so you

172
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:52,759
can attack her inconvenience that the
HTML page to a page with ameritech say

173
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:54,819
going to branded content

174
00:16:54,819 --> 00:17:00,228
64 with other types of things like
nature HTTP response or through a jock

175
00:17:00,229 --> 00:17:04,259
type in many ways to go said the
Christmas by point takeaways that UK

176
00:17:04,259 --> 00:17:10,169
employers ie to force it to run in the
mode this was only used like 10 years

177
00:17:10,169 --> 00:17:19,049
ago and will see the proof here to see
it through a process explorer MSXML 3.0

178
00:17:19,049 --> 00:17:25,009
0 red here on the screen is linked to 11
this is the most

179
00:17:25,009 --> 00:17:29,820
this was the most recent version by 11
before they fixed it so that was

180
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:37,029
interesting so obviously the embalmer
over some MSS three was linked to ie so

181
00:17:37,029 --> 00:17:43,610
there must be a way to export it and
before going to the way very quick 101

182
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:48,350
how to parse XML JavaScript yeah you say
you just create ActiveX object and a

183
00:17:48,350 --> 00:17:55,360
loaded her browsers or I either version
of IE you to standards Tom Tom parser so

184
00:17:55,360 --> 00:18:00,379
how do we explain the Baltimore version
of MS X amount of three in the new

185
00:18:00,379 --> 00:18:05,289
regime ie another goal is to do two
things to break same origin policy

186
00:18:05,289 --> 00:18:10,460
completely where you can read counted
cross nominees and to actually treat

187
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:17,259
data on the disk and these are the two
goals and achieve with access C so very

188
00:18:17,259 --> 00:18:23,120
simple payload here's the first while we
wanted to we were doing but kind of lead

189
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:27,539
the way of the second one so if you see
them the one victim to come in rat

190
00:18:27,539 --> 00:18:33,700
that's the website we're going to actual
tree so very simple just point age 22

191
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:39,210
victims victims are calm and alone the
content of that page into your interview

192
00:18:39,210 --> 00:18:45,090
my speech so let's see what are the
works in a while and it works so I have

193
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,620
a page right here

194
00:18:47,620 --> 00:18:53,689
museum in basically the same same XML
and we're just trying to act retreated

195
00:18:53,690 --> 00:19:00,590
data from google.com while we are
attacker domain.com so we're trying to

196
00:19:00,590 --> 00:19:05,000
extricate across different domains saved
if this succeed we break same origin

197
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:07,980
policy so whatever we exit rate

198
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:13,290
is going to be in the box right here so
we click pars

199
00:19:13,290 --> 00:19:20,510
nothing happens that was we're supposed
to work right is a mess Expo 3 was used

200
00:19:20,510 --> 00:19:26,590
to parse this tomorrow and should be
able to access C but why didn't happen

201
00:19:26,590 --> 00:19:33,418
so let's try to the game with a console
exception throw anything parts again

202
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:38,730
access is denied and is tonight on the
line where we are trying to parse the

203
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:42,799
library using a low tax amount to less
interesting without his students to

204
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:47,918
succeed because as using a mobile
library so why it in the work let me

205
00:19:47,919 --> 00:19:54,770
show another example of exactly why it
did not work this is the exact same

206
00:19:54,770 --> 00:20:00,639
example with dilute or added to target
pointing to a document on the same

207
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:05,020
origin so remember we are on our job to
attack the dot-com we're also trying to

208
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:12,960
exit read the data on a technical so
what's the comp ours we got high out so

209
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:15,160
you can probably guess what is going on

210
00:20:15,160 --> 00:20:24,770
nothing that's going on is similar
policy is blocking us so how do I have

211
00:20:24,770 --> 00:20:30,480
similar policies already gave you a hint
that's not the way we we work for us but

212
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:35,720
we look at the sea bees in the past know
how similar fosse's bypassing IE Firefox

213
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:42,230
and Chrome in different on different
interests of our interests of others and

214
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:48,080
SVG saw one of them said timeouts one of
them time I checked my views and no

215
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:52,980
one's really rocks so Embarcadero RAD
you probably already know this works for

216
00:20:52,980 --> 00:21:00,650
us so how he works is basically is
trying to go to retreive accountant 2d

217
00:21:00,650 --> 00:21:04,960
targeted website but instead of going
there directly we go to a redirector on

218
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:11,720
a same origin to redirect to the second
region so particularly example here the

219
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:16,640
only thing that has changed is the
website is going to victims or come

220
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,490
directly going to attack of the com-

221
00:21:19,490 --> 00:21:24,820
with a redirector assuming the pages
hosted also on sacbee.com and yes we own

222
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:32,120
it to me so let's take a look at how we
can actually use the example to exploit

223
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:37,969
things so we're gonna show you two demos
one is to read a secret Google Doc

224
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:43,809
document of a victim the other wants to
read our retreat this content of the

225
00:21:43,809 --> 00:21:48,830
victim both of them do not need user
interaction only thing you need to do so

226
00:21:48,830 --> 00:21:56,000
click on the link and his compromise
let's see how that is done so let me

227
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:01,850
paint you a story let's say the victim
is a boss or manager in a company and

228
00:22:01,850 --> 00:22:07,010
has a secret dog the Google Drive
showing the salaries of different

229
00:22:07,010 --> 00:22:12,300
employees and reduce him and attacked
her on the last time citing chrome

230
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:19,210
employee it is trying to access
documented Casey that access to nine

231
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:27,090
right so detectors go is to actually
read this document through just like so

232
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:28,580
let's see how can do that

233
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:36,030
remembered the victim isn't I so now the
boss check email and got a email in the

234
00:22:36,030 --> 00:22:40,710
morning and afternoon says click me
pretty good that the boss like to click

235
00:22:40,710 --> 00:22:43,910
on links so I just click on a link

236
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:48,370
go there everything's alright nothing
can go wrong will go wrong right and

237
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:57,939
less refresh the page on the tanker say
every single thing in your document and

238
00:22:57,940 --> 00:23:08,390
explain how it happens in slow motion
have to race but this is the first demo

239
00:23:08,390 --> 00:23:13,390
just two extra treat content with a link
click OK

240
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:20,820
second demo same thing the boss also
have a habit of keeping his username

241
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:25,909
password information in a fire or txt
file so they can remember it he doesn't

242
00:23:25,910 --> 00:23:31,070
use LastPass password manager whatever
he doesn't trust us critics just put it

243
00:23:31,070 --> 00:23:39,000
in the tech txt file drive our Go is to
get that file just with a link like so

244
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,600
remember content and ponchos using
password of course those are not real

245
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:51,280
know where that is see those are the
things we're trying to extort ok same

246
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:57,080
thing the boss wake up in the morning
and go to check his email got another

247
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:03,389
link without realizing it was yesterday
you click the second link and we'll see

248
00:24:03,390 --> 00:24:07,830
what happens afterwards is still going
to go nothing happens I don't think

249
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:15,780
anything happen but on the attacker side
we're here to reload the page every

250
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:23,680
single thing in the file is a structured
it

251
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:30,850
so both of attack was leveraging ecstasy
and I would Tamil how just one of them

252
00:24:30,850 --> 00:24:36,330
worked in a slow motion and if you go
back to the page so this was basically

253
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:42,429
just just a page without the art of this
i really rocks and flash go into

254
00:24:42,430 --> 00:24:47,380
director of Google com everything just a
second page and remember what detector

255
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:53,440
needs just one thing to Euro of the
documents say the attacker those to

256
00:24:53,440 --> 00:25:01,960
Europe the document and save the euro is
right here this is the Euro remember

257
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:06,940
this is only a slow motion and all of
this can be just automatically detect it

258
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:12,380
doesn't have to ask users to typing a
link or anything just slow motion so now

259
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:18,690
you have to the Tegra has to laying and
a victim collection of you and

260
00:25:18,690 --> 00:25:24,500
everything is still in cross them in
particular the inspect element have to

261
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:28,480
page there's only one interesting line
you want to look at

262
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:34,180
actually two lines here

263
00:25:34,180 --> 00:25:40,800
first-line critics among parser second
line parsing XML done your opponent and

264
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,629
after that you just want to get the
economy and the context actually

265
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:49,500
extradited to report Sarah and explain
what is a parse error and why we're now

266
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:53,960
using just XML DOM later on but it's not
that's not important detail so the

267
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:58,760
important thing is that after just part
of the malicious acts tomorrow we can

268
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:04,020
just successfully excretory the action
and today's appointed by the XML and

269
00:26:04,020 --> 00:26:15,340
senator attackers CSE server and let's
go back to the slice after seeing a demo

270
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:19,909
we will of course reported on the relay
to Microsoft and to fix it and the

271
00:26:19,910 --> 00:26:25,210
library MSXML 3.0 or actual facts now
getting on the seven now it's actually

272
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:30,970
fix mp3 so but if you think about it it
wasn't I need of a small animal I

273
00:26:30,970 --> 00:26:34,730
actually was trying to protected from
being vulnerable

274
00:26:34,730 --> 00:26:40,179
delivery self was the baltimore won and
if you think about what I ardor

275
00:26:40,179 --> 00:26:46,730
softwares or orderly frameworks ordeal
house were binary CX season are using

276
00:26:46,730 --> 00:26:52,520
MSXML 3.0 0 click to it they were
vulnerable to you have to patch your

277
00:26:52,520 --> 00:26:56,918
cell mobile but they definitely were
Monroe too and just to give a hint of

278
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:04,370
the scale of the problem MS MS XML 3 was
introduced in 2001 exactly fifteen years

279
00:27:04,370 --> 00:27:08,520
ago so I don't think so complicated
exploit

280
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:13,470
suspecting it's probably ready to
explode in a while but that's just a

281
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:19,000
ballpark guess if you take a look at
what are linked to MSX 13 directly we

282
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:25,750
have found just 46 binary saxonhouse out
of the box there a link to MSXML those I

283
00:27:25,750 --> 00:27:32,559
just linked directly indirectly there
are 187 binaries Andy Lau StarLink tours

284
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:39,040
with MSXML 30 and those hurt those are
just the libraries and XML and the

285
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:42,928
wineries that available by default on
Windows god knows how many third-party

286
00:27:42,929 --> 00:27:49,010
libraries the link to MSXML 3.0 0 that
are still vulnerable so it's a pretty

287
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:54,150
big impact problem but it's good that
Microsoft Fix said and release a patch

288
00:27:54,150 --> 00:28:01,350
of April so there are few limitations
attack as whenever you're trying to

289
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,740
access to content

290
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:06,750
the axle parts are assuming the external
entity you're trying to actually treat

291
00:28:06,750 --> 00:28:11,620
this now contains some special
characters only conform to the exxon mo

292
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:16,949
grammer's were rules and special
characters with contain open close tax

293
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:22,580
percentage stein's no better software so
that means music in a web context that a

294
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:28,120
lot of HTML pages are not vulnerable
because they contain the open close tax

295
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:32,659
or HCl Tech's anything but with a second
I just show you can execute a Google

296
00:28:32,660 --> 00:28:37,400
Docs right because that's just a small
page nothing consistent

297
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:42,850
tax that has open close to everything
the first few hundred bias are not

298
00:28:42,850 --> 00:28:48,719
vulnerable Armando because they will
come out of a subpar Sarah so even

299
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:54,670
though the page contains open close tax
they figured error the parterre contains

300
00:28:54,670 --> 00:29:01,370
400 bias which is enough to actually go
to google.com tengo name and a lot of

301
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:06,399
websites content I think maybe box was
also notable not box itself but the

302
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:12,740
browser using box and Jason patients are
vulnerable because they do not mostly

303
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:15,560
most of them do not contain herman's
close taxes which is contained the

304
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:21,790
braces and something that those are
valid characters in XML files are

305
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:26,280
usually no more because they usually
contain no bites so things like registry

306
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:35,540
files or Outlook Backup BIOS or even the
house though sir binary file sequel

307
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:39,320
ideal for someone that those are not
vulnerable

308
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:45,179
interesting about I use cookie files are
just plain text files however there's

309
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:50,230
nice property that are there that were
not able to exploit the filename are not

310
00:29:50,230 --> 00:29:51,500
testable

311
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:56,660
in our attack we're not able to release
yet to enumerate files in the file

312
00:29:56,660 --> 00:30:01,790
system only if you know the filename and
path we can get a file out you guys

313
00:30:01,790 --> 00:30:06,159
doing manual labor forcing but there's
no way you can just get a directory

314
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:11,630
listing automatically three Xic so
because I E randomized the filename to

315
00:30:11,630 --> 00:30:17,590
cook if I was able to where we were able
to exercise but other files that you

316
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:21,449
know have deterministic path or file
name you were you know the 50 gonna

317
00:30:21,450 --> 00:30:25,180
actually treat you have targeted file
you can definitely leverage more ability

318
00:30:25,180 --> 00:30:32,700
to complete extracted and only attack
only works on IE window seven below but

319
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:41,290
all versions are vulnerable so we ate
and up are not a while but come on CNN

320
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:47,260
so as a defense is updating the most
recent version of IE 11 or actually

321
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:52,910
update desist apply the system security
update please update your library also

322
00:30:52,910 --> 00:31:03,040
use Windows 8 and I guess so yes we have
shown you know days in both drop in IE

323
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:07,770
and it's a big problem we think you
should deserve more and more attentions

324
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:15,450
pressure exerted mentioned services like
SOAP API samo single sign-on and a lot

325
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:19,420
of those are excellent parsing and if
you don't deal with XML seriously

326
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:24,450
they're gonna ruin your servers you
users your products and our language and

327
00:31:24,450 --> 00:31:28,330
product could potentially go to we
didn't have the time to investigating

328
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:34,949
the ruby 0 Python were all the fancy new
languages so they might as well be

329
00:31:34,950 --> 00:31:39,530
vulnerable but we don't know and we also
recommend XML parsers for the

330
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:43,540
elaboration to be secured by default
with those dangers functions and

331
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:49,540
functionality is turned off so we also
want to say a special thank you to our

332
00:31:49,540 --> 00:31:54,730
colleagues especially for Massa Johnson
was spent a lot of time on the research

333
00:31:54,730 --> 00:31:59,470
while they did a killer talked yesterday
on breaking SMB so you can have ten

334
00:31:59,470 --> 00:32:03,400
should check it out checking out on
their website should have to slice

335
00:32:03,400 --> 00:32:09,110
already so that is all of the content
they want to thank you for your

336
00:32:09,110 --> 00:32:16,269
attention

337
00:32:16,269 --> 00:32:21,359
and please leave feedback if you enjoy
our talk and we would love to hear your

338
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:27,309
feedback and any questions research
and/or come talk to us afterwards all

339
00:32:27,309 --> 00:32:31,539
welcome thank you

340
00:32:31,539 --> 00:32:38,529
question does this work there we go

341
00:32:38,529 --> 00:32:44,049
hey great job guys I just wondered on
the MSXML stuff if you had tried the

342
00:32:44,049 --> 00:32:49,940
CDATA wrapping trick or the out of band
URL tracks in order to get at HTML

343
00:32:49,940 --> 00:32:54,309
special characters instead of using the
exceptions to question so we tried

344
00:32:54,309 --> 00:32:59,168
posted at rapping and also I'm para
state entity and what's the other one

345
00:32:59,169 --> 00:33:04,259
the out of band attacks during the day
tomorrow

346
00:33:04,259 --> 00:33:09,809
yeah we we try to and unfortunately none
worked so good question

347
00:33:09,809 --> 00:33:22,459
thank you thank you thank you
