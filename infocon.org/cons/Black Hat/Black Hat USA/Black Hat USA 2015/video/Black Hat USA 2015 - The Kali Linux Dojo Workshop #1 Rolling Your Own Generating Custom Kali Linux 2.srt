1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,820
this is the challenge Linux total
workshop number one pulling your own

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:05:43,449
generating custom catholics 2.0 I says
speaker is everyone to be today

3
00:05:43,449 --> 00:06:21,969
there is there is more a look at these
beaches just because today is customized

4
00:06:21,969 --> 00:06:53,980
fuel bills because everybody make
everyone to meet all these guys

5
00:06:53,980 --> 00:07:22,660
know what what what we're saying I'm
somewhat of an imaginary try to which

6
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:37,360
has not designed and iterations that's
going in and that was not an easy quite

7
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:52,440
interesting like made out of the blocks
this is exactly the reason that we're

8
00:07:52,440 --> 00:08:02,060
running these features out that to make
a where we actually happened just give

9
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:23,160
you a quick heads up knocks novice who
struck out hard drive not destroy you

10
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:34,430
all this up one another possible about
the benefits of this nature

11
00:08:34,429 --> 00:08:44,390
so this is one of the many like to give
a very very possibly the most popular

12
00:08:44,390 --> 00:09:13,949
these days so right now the US night
night CD which is what we're going to be

13
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:28,980
looking at today this one so customizing
make why do we have a whole collection

14
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:33,470
devices the country's future

15
00:09:33,470 --> 00:09:52,720
350 joy pretty interesting images that
depict live usb this is something that

16
00:09:52,720 --> 00:10:19,010
will be quickly deployed

17
00:10:19,010 --> 00:10:33,980
you bet your bottom line

18
00:10:33,980 --> 00:11:15,050
blind users actually able to check that
online

19
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:51,099
about what you call a big big
differences so now we know based on

20
00:11:51,100 --> 00:12:02,820
Debian just that's all nice it's the end
of the day the real change and I think

21
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:13,800
at least one now we're running a
distribution and what that means is that

22
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:31,370
we shut up back at the rodeo
distribution what that does is it up

23
00:12:31,370 --> 00:12:40,990
Brady's ordered all of the pages to be
more updates ongoing basis not talking

24
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:58,279
about nine reason to the president sees
as well this is good news was too old

25
00:12:58,279 --> 00:13:06,920
for that because

26
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:30,329
immediate cross that's 13 monitoring the
update which helps us check as the other

27
00:13:30,329 --> 00:13:41,719
and ease up but you'll get a proposed
updated upstream checking system will

28
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:54,220
identify that note the update hope that
we're a team that's ongoing updates as

29
00:13:54,220 --> 00:14:03,720
they happen so that's probably the major
changes

30
00:14:03,720 --> 00:15:48,950
10 into the obvious and perhaps one of
the most visually all around

31
00:15:48,950 --> 00:16:30,290
bill on the dishes so hostile attracting
one of the factors that exist this is

32
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:40,839
also where you can make changes in the
siege by running condition and the last

33
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:48,240
stage by stage where everything that
we've done though the fight is that one

34
00:16:48,240 --> 00:17:01,140
files ready for us they note that it's
not that the eyes of is what's known as

35
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:24,500
what this means that I

36
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:31,230
the actual bill is through asset

37
00:17:31,230 --> 00:17:51,350
see this building that the ratio of the
different configuration files the actual

38
00:17:51,350 --> 00:18:10,199
build your you even most important one
day you can see for example recu ISO

39
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:37,770
which is a very common feature the
imagine that process up holes national

40
00:18:37,770 --> 00:19:05,080
filed a complaint packages that will be
doing

41
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:47,760
dies at 67 bill this is director of the
libel direct found floating back and you

42
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:58,730
have to follow up we use that you can
start configuring your stuff so here's

43
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:11,900
the secret so i'm talking to the site's
money once you get to know and I believe

44
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:21,120
this is how you build Isis now I'm not a
change we need to do is the ability to

45
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:47,000
live for example now goodnight kte you
just get my build building

46
00:20:47,000 --> 00:21:28,330
of course you can also specify which
essentially is about a month so this is

47
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:31,899
probably the easiest and quickest

48
00:21:31,900 --> 00:21:55,030
before we do this edition features so
just like water so that will manage to

49
00:21:55,030 --> 00:22:07,620
compete and perhaps

50
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:24,229
modifications are possible using another
feature by the way this is an official

51
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:46,400
part about 3.3 no one here which might
like

52
00:22:46,400 --> 00:23:01,990
ok so this building our own eyes will be
doing

53
00:23:01,990 --> 00:23:22,340
one of the customisation might be a
problem will be chosen will run across

54
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:51,750
unattended this is nice weather you
doing this with your family and other

55
00:23:51,750 --> 00:24:29,160
people will be doing maybe another case
now for doing this I will be made into

56
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:50,610
patties with this this demonstrates that
will be at this all over this again

57
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:59,729
PNG file called it in the right place
and then

58
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:16,730
what I do know is that she opened up in
brown sizes go to whatever network if

59
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:31,850
you change if you change your IP address
so you could just go to if not just

60
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:40,980
around your 02 02

61
00:25:40,980 --> 00:26:12,559
yes that should you should be used
against this bill with the modification

62
00:26:12,559 --> 00:27:32,550
so I'll try doing this year

63
00:27:32,550 --> 00:29:02,850
once and which is all we want to do this
this and this is how you can configure

64
00:29:02,850 --> 00:29:14,500
that I could have sold during the very
minimal he said just to build yeah the

65
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,720
Dutch

66
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:24,669
once we have that next week

67
00:29:24,669 --> 00:29:40,559
various 100 is mom

68
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:48,610
in the sea caso

69
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:57,909
directory that's all made that
highlights

70
00:29:57,910 --> 00:30:19,149
now is set up so when I fire which
actually be found

71
00:30:19,149 --> 00:30:49,560
yeah

72
00:30:49,560 --> 00:31:07,800
looks like this is this follows us ended
installation we just continue adding

73
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,629
this file

74
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:54,580
you are like

75
00:31:54,580 --> 00:32:28,539
raids what it is that we do when we
officially my education what we'd like

76
00:32:28,539 --> 00:33:02,908
to do this and our he too D

77
00:33:02,909 --> 00:33:18,400
integration

78
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:34,750
they will allow us on the pending
consideration what that looks like an

79
00:33:34,750 --> 00:33:35,390
answer

80
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:43,620
various questions asked during the
nation for example like what you want to

81
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:54,570
repost lets the 19 bridge would you like
these I would you like this

82
00:33:54,570 --> 00:34:12,529
the building itself and by doing this
you do it again once you figure ations

83
00:34:12,530 --> 00:34:38,419
and what's not build a stage again the
very light distribution anyone

84
00:34:38,418 --> 00:34:42,418
that should happen to get updates

85
00:34:42,418 --> 00:35:59,700
like well issues

86
00:35:59,700 --> 00:39:33,480
results

87
00:39:33,480 --> 00:41:13,440
on the path I can make holding your
bills

88
00:41:13,440 --> 00:44:48,079
nice e you'll be able to process the
processes involved in the night by

89
00:44:48,079 --> 00:44:59,469
so I'd like to like to show you

90
00:44:59,469 --> 00:46:03,390
101

91
00:46:03,390 --> 00:46:38,598
DBA and your bbm Paulo imagine somewhere
across the blue you said your class file

92
00:46:38,599 --> 00:46:57,269
this interview that is nothing that
needs to do other than just once then I

93
00:46:57,269 --> 00:47:21,089
do all the magic give you access to this
is what we call and then the message 5

94
00:47:21,089 --> 00:47:41,710
walls and bridges with amazing set up
recruit dress which again

95
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:43,240
match

96
00:47:43,240 --> 00:51:44,720
the job in about matching the right

97
00:51:44,720 --> 00:52:18,169
we finished officially ask around if you
come out what's going on those one
