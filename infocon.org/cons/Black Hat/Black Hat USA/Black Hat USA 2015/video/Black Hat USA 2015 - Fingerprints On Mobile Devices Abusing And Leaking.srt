1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,040
our presentation right now is
fingerprints on mobile devices abusing

2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:12,579
and leaking with our prisoners our way
and you longs on Thanksgiving

3
00:00:12,580 --> 00:00:21,960
introspection thank you for coming to
our talk at lunch time today be a

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:26,090
presenter work I enjoyed a fingerprint
security and this is the teamwork of

5
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:32,920
today's smartphones

6
00:00:32,920 --> 00:00:41,379
sensors this by plans as Aug listing on
the United States markets but in the new

7
00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:49,718
year features more than 50% of
smartphones have answer by nineteen by

8
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:57,449
2019 improve usability quite a lot
people can you thinking to Toro like

9
00:00:57,449 --> 00:00:59,440
their systems Dream Tour p

10
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:09,250
to authenticate and things are boring
and insecure as cold as the other risks

11
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:17,840
for endorsing the biggest one is making
you for your new password you can you

12
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:26,759
please get in print for the rest of your
life and you have only 10

13
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:38,049
conduct and violating our identity of
caught him into immigration history and

14
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:46,170
the banking pretentious if the church so
very dangerous and it will be even worse

15
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:58,990
even remotely however it brings you a
large scale from a polish the surface

16
00:01:58,990 --> 00:02:07,110
like a colossus are some Advil screen
can be even be ejected from a vending

17
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:15,860
photos so you should take a look at this
and by the attackers can poor thing

18
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:26,470
using electronic or conductive materials
and as he can you pick the store your

19
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:34,220
money from your mobile accounts and talk
about our system attacks against the

20
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:43,329
finger prints and we've fought back to
our first one to Disqus system

21
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:54,110
fingerprint authentication from works
today I enjoyed remarks including

22
00:02:54,110 --> 00:03:05,720
releasing and as a part of the data are
presented against the fingerprints talk

23
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:15,959
about the first thing i think is a very
complex includes a much more steps first

24
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:17,840
faces the Potters

25
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:24,180
actually system we r convert various
scale drawing matching towards a beastly

26
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:35,549
measure and identify those critical
issues in that system of values some

27
00:03:35,549 --> 00:03:36,900
magic organism

28
00:03:36,900 --> 00:03:48,690
matches against the database to identify
as a rather complex so in the vendor

29
00:03:48,690 --> 00:03:55,090
should have provided a framework to
support this and this framework is one

30
00:03:55,090 --> 00:03:57,130
thing

31
00:03:57,130 --> 00:04:07,450
printer from work and you know the
printer from work on the laptop is this

32
00:04:07,450 --> 00:04:14,899
so this is this is not only limited was
my home but you know we are attacked all

33
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:21,489
the devices sensors

34
00:04:21,488 --> 00:04:27,729
conducted the service and in 20 years

35
00:04:27,730 --> 00:04:31,750
kerner fingerprint sensor driver to
accept a hydro

36
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:40,420
readers after processing and Misha B is
thought that you can be printed at the

37
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:50,540
base this was a brutal attack you can do
that by Lizzie Castillo your thing

38
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:56,560
either from the memory are from the
start it was so hard to defend the

39
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:02,300
answer from the trans community uses
such as a separate system you too long

40
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:15,210
word and word and potentially
compromised by using fingerprint from

41
00:05:15,210 --> 00:05:23,010
work instead of excessive directly from
the contest based on your search of the

42
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:37,050
driver tore up to secure water and think
trouble it s that means you this week

43
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:42,139
even route even with Connor

44
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:54,740
cannot access the security date a live
interview only secure key successes on

45
00:05:54,740 --> 00:06:08,409
and numbered but due to a key step
there's not too much so now we have no

46
00:06:08,409 --> 00:06:27,409
sympathy from work so happy to provide a
stronger using including mobile area

47
00:06:27,409 --> 00:06:35,580
during this company likes this

48
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:46,900
telephony this components including
Exynos 5 with such as you sent us all

49
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:56,089
home from work and implementation as a
force for the fight or end of the paper

50
00:06:56,089 --> 00:07:13,089
money transaction service ok they are
presented for the introduction and I'm

51
00:07:13,089 --> 00:07:19,639
going to sell you for attacks targeting
mobile fingerprints framework and as a

52
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:27,259
quick sales pace in the first attack
will like try to deceive you think in WR

53
00:07:27,259 --> 00:07:30,589
swiping for something but actually we're
using fingerprint to do something else

54
00:07:30,589 --> 00:07:36,919
in the second and third attack when I
show you that the attacker can remotely

55
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:42,330
harvest finger prints in a large-scale
in the fourth attack but I show you that

56
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:47,330
the attacker can bad back door finger
prints in your eyes and it can use it to

57
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:53,630
access your phone so it's going to the
first attack

58
00:07:53,630 --> 00:08:06,140
before going to go to the details of the
attack we have to clarify to forums the

59
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:11,120
wine if identification and the other is
authorization authentication only means

60
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:17,150
who you are like a passport author
edition contains more context it means

61
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:23,729
what you can do like these are we the
stamp on your passport number here in

62
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:26,440
the past board

63
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:31,719
identity of yourself but the visa shows
for example here is to be one of you too

64
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:35,160
and there are other kinds of these are
that allows you to work

65
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:42,179
United States authentication system like
everyday that you're bad badgering into

66
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:49,520
the company card to authenticate
yourself well try this is like your

67
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:55,800
everyday activity using your credit card
to authorize the payment so what the

68
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:02,359
most important thing when you do
authorization is a contacts only with

69
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:09,190
the context you know what are you
authorize 40 facing this kind of

70
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:14,700
situation I'm not sure how many of you
guys dear to swipe a credit card with

71
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:20,370
other contacts 2 don't know what are you
doing

72
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:31,130
indication when the author edition here
wanna do a quick survey so how many

73
00:09:31,130 --> 00:09:36,720
other guys you bring a friend to unlock
your mobile phone

74
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,570
there are plenty of guys

75
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:44,830
good news or bad news for all of you
raise your hand

76
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:53,570
potentially have been depicting of this
attack ever have a second thought we use

77
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:56,010
a fingerprint lock your device

78
00:09:56,010 --> 00:10:02,660
well probably don't like me myself I
don't have a second thought so what if I

79
00:10:02,660 --> 00:10:07,270
tell you when you do the swiping the
attacker in the background can transfer

80
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:11,910
money away would you still like her
fingerprints without a second thought

81
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:18,670
I'm creek crossings

82
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:24,620
testify was happening behind us in the
princess' biting behavior

83
00:10:24,620 --> 00:10:28,900
well you cannot tell because the vendor
just so you are locked

84
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:37,290
image and his wife the lock disappeared
I don't know what's happening behind and

85
00:10:37,290 --> 00:10:41,390
what's the difference swiping to unlock
that arise with

86
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:45,740
authorizing mobile payment transactions

87
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:58,210
display but in the background cannot
tell you before doing that Tamil I want

88
00:10:58,210 --> 00:11:07,640
to show you how a fingerprint based
mobile payment works so here's so here

89
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:18,439
is the payment now I want to transfer
some money to make your friend so I

90
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:19,600
price

91
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:30,089
transfer of Christ and asking me for
authentication or authorization whatever

92
00:11:30,089 --> 00:11:33,569
it is it asking you to swap the finger
over the honky

93
00:11:33,569 --> 00:11:43,019
how you tell me what happening here it
is actually for authorization because

94
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:47,660
you're asking me to fewer details like
who to send the money to and how much

95
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:53,980
money I want to send sent to me if I
approved this transaction

96
00:11:53,980 --> 00:12:06,410
the money will be transferred away

97
00:12:06,410 --> 00:12:09,850
so in a sense in the normal

98
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:13,649
fingerprinting based mobile payment
framework for fingerprint access

99
00:12:13,649 --> 00:12:21,339
authorization but we can come to our
country's attack to lure the user the

100
00:12:21,339 --> 00:12:26,790
thing that is a lot indication but it is
used for authorization to hear that a

101
00:12:26,790 --> 00:12:34,250
camel to go see this is unlocking
interface that everyone can see on the

102
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:48,509
phone and tried to unlock the phone and
pull the money is transferred a way for

103
00:12:48,509 --> 00:12:53,079
the restoration of what's happening in
the background so in the real world

104
00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:58,920
without a colossal attack he will not
show the transaction process to you as

105
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,759
want to tell you what's happening behind
so I display them in the UI interface

106
00:13:02,759 --> 00:13:07,420
for the attacker with you also the
author edition is fielding all the

107
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:11,620
details on who to send money to wishes
that hackers account and how much money

108
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:17,319
you want to transfer of $1000 and you
can just do this automatically in the

109
00:13:17,319 --> 00:13:26,459
background without being noticed the
vulnerability

110
00:13:26,460 --> 00:13:31,320
applications often mistakenly treated
authorization and authentication and the

111
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:38,410
failed to provide contacts proofs for
authorization but even even though you

112
00:13:38,410 --> 00:13:40,120
can tell the difference between

113
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:46,010
authentication and authorization without
proper context to prove that I can still

114
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:50,100
mislead them victim to authorize
diminishes transaction by disguising it

115
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:54,210
as authentication or another transaction
for example he's tracked using memory

116
00:13:54,210 --> 00:13:58,820
King transfer money to President Obama
but actually transfer money to you along

117
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:06,060
this Tamil the attacker fix the lock
screen to for the other two things that

118
00:14:06,060 --> 00:14:10,819
he's swapping finger to a lock the
device but actually the fingerprint is

119
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:19,380
used to authorize a money transfer in
the background there are some solutions

120
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:24,840
for now to fight a lot lines provide the
specification that you have to implement

121
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:31,830
what you see is what you sign best
defenders in a vote users to display our

122
00:14:31,830 --> 00:14:36,880
contacts proof to the user to let the
user know what he is doing with his

123
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:42,520
fingerprint but there are some the
transit connection confirmation displays

124
00:14:42,520 --> 00:14:51,550
should be trusted and this is a strong
concern assumption for the North

125
00:14:51,550 --> 00:14:56,609
framework without trust there is simply
no reliable way to provide the

126
00:14:56,610 --> 00:15:02,570
authorization contacts proof because you
are just in command the UI and one more

127
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:08,980
word above the meanest colonel in the
normal android framework so attacker in

128
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:14,910
gaza Tampa privileges or even root
privilege is ready for the you are

129
00:15:14,910 --> 00:15:21,969
displayed to the framework where the
stresses on can be improved to achieve

130
00:15:21,970 --> 00:15:27,450
the scale to provide trusted contacts
proof but so far we haven't seen any

131
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:33,630
major vendor that implemented this
feature

132
00:15:33,630 --> 00:15:41,970
so let's go to the second attack I think
every one thing that your finger prints

133
00:15:41,970 --> 00:15:45,050
as well secured on your phone

134
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:50,650
imagine like this is the lock on your
finger friend but the reality is like

135
00:15:50,650 --> 00:15:57,439
this for those talons hackers sitting
down there can you want out what's going

136
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:01,390
wrong here

137
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:11,740
anyone exactly so this is worth a read
of any armed privilege processes or apps

138
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:18,380
Castillo the user's finger prints by
reading this image file format is

139
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:26,150
distorted without cover later is it easy
to recover we found this problem to see

140
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:34,480
one max STC has battered by working with
his mentor after a notification so we're

141
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:41,610
down to file in binary format and shows
two guys like this this is a long line

142
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:46,930
of the binary file so we can see that it
has multiple lines similar to this one

143
00:16:46,930 --> 00:16:57,109
so we got gas this is a bitmap and its
allies starter is these are all one its

144
00:16:57,110 --> 00:17:02,990
alliance not property for byte aligned
because as a bitmap image it has to be

145
00:17:02,990 --> 00:17:10,099
four byte aligned so we thought we can
fix it by pairing

146
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:16,639
looks like when we dump this image from
the device that at first glance it

147
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:21,620
doesn't look like anything so we do the
fall by selling padding bypass spending

148
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:29,530
some material in the end of his line it
will look like this job the thing is

149
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:32,580
it's definitely someone fingerprint

150
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:40,120
we don't know why they separated into
two part 2 last part is double the west

151
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:47,040
of the right power but clearly is a
fingerprint image for someone asked me

152
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:53,060
this is easy to fix problem we just had
the fingerprints in the choices down

153
00:17:53,060 --> 00:18:04,050
then you cannot access the true well not
breakable if lenders code is bugging so

154
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:11,710
we have plenty o works out there
attacking the trusses like this year the

155
00:18:11,710 --> 00:18:16,880
guy didn't make didn't have these are
passed so he didn't come here to give

156
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:21,950
give the tour talk so he find a bargain
prices down and got code execution in

157
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:32,050
this way that I can do you like dad the
fingerprint data from a second attack

158
00:18:32,050 --> 00:18:41,500
that's going to the fingerprint sensor
spying attack what it is

159
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:52,240
background so on mobile devices with
France's own eyes looks like this you

160
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,780
have userspace kernel space and there's
our weapon is and the word is separated

161
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:03,080
into two wins and one more word and wine
is protected about trust in the normal

162
00:19:03,080 --> 00:19:14,280
world that you cannot access anything
inside truck service in the normal

163
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:19,460
watered your the space the fingerprints
service will increment of fingerprint

164
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:25,600
database and it will contact with human
to do further communications with the

165
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:32,919
sensor will talk about the talk to the
driver in the corner space the truck

166
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:38,600
driver in the common space will forward
the request to monitor and Michael

167
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:44,100
colonel in the trust it will further
proxy to request to that

168
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:49,379
one of dark chocolate which is the
fingerprint handler

169
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:54,000
entrusted will further talk to their
schedule in the truck is owned and

170
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:03,549
communicate with the sensor device so
this looks pretty much everything is

171
00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:06,940
separate isolate while while isolated

172
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:11,630
operations are only performed in a
trusted zone and data is kept in a trust

173
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:23,390
problem is to have a path from the
normal word to access to sasser carried

174
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:33,700
away so normal work there in the driver
where they are at at the apt can talk to

175
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:41,870
so thats car driver can director talked
to the device in the normal word from

176
00:20:41,870 --> 00:20:47,229
our Animal Ark and abruptly talk to the
fingerprint sensor and the real thing a

177
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:56,710
friend by reverse-engineering Dr Robert
Horry minority driver and read the

178
00:20:56,710 --> 00:21:02,039
vendors open source code one can easily
obtain their operations in a boat like

179
00:21:02,039 --> 00:21:09,010
the idle control power on power off
device recess at Clark and initial how

180
00:21:09,010 --> 00:21:14,879
to initialize the device to stream
Reading Mode so that's easy to recover

181
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:19,100
but there's still some challenge because
when you do that I'll control

182
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:24,309
communications you have to carry some
protocol data to to communicate with

183
00:21:24,309 --> 00:21:29,309
this answer was it is a big challenge
but its feet about your gas because it

184
00:21:29,309 --> 00:21:36,570
can just who the aisle control matters
dropped a new product numbers so I can

185
00:21:36,570 --> 00:21:43,639
give you a quick demo of how I achieved
this attack so yes

186
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:47,930
farm using USB cable connecting to my
laptop

187
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:52,270
this is a pretty general problem shared
by many vendors so you don't have to a

188
00:21:52,270 --> 00:22:00,300
concern about which device I'm hoping
I'm using adb shell to connect to the

189
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:10,190
device so as a user you can also do this
before you just show you the attack so I

190
00:22:10,190 --> 00:22:18,600
brought a small program card FDR
fingerprint hack what it had us to open

191
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:23,459
the fingerprint scanner for reading and
the register at least now many of the

192
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:28,360
device up interrupts and they don't
initialize and caliber the device for

193
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,860
reading and then surrounded for swype

194
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:36,469
can do this in the background of the day
and all the year without being noticed

195
00:22:36,470 --> 00:22:42,080
about you but now I'm going to put my
finger home button which is also the

196
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:49,419
fingerprint sensor hopefully I can
succeed there you go once I talk to the

197
00:22:49,420 --> 00:22:59,220
home button you can see a lot of data
dumped out to the very beginning

198
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:06,400
so your thing that I looked quite a
simple platform either because I just

199
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:11,720
saw the day that to you is lying
starting reserve either one so this is

200
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:17,580
one line of the bitmap image to life
starting with second number as two and

201
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:27,230
the increasing by one voice line 345
socialized has a number of it so your

202
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:33,600
food group those lines into one big
bitmap got the idea of how it looks like

203
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,780
it's just my fingerprint and I'm not
that silly to show you my finger friends

204
00:23:38,780 --> 00:23:48,590
here so we have confirmed this
vulnerability on devices including HTC

205
00:23:48,590 --> 00:23:54,928
One Max and sometimes as high on Samsung
devices there is something to be so the

206
00:23:54,929 --> 00:24:00,760
attacker has to root the device and
loaded with carefully crafted to enable

207
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:04,840
some of the device operations but as
long as I can go the route you can do

208
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:11,389
this is only for both managers have
promptly passed a dismal ability for our

209
00:24:11,390 --> 00:24:17,020
notification and it should be a general
problem not only limited interest to see

210
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:24,510
so many of most of the vendors should be
concerned about this so why why they're

211
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:32,370
just kind of problem here so imagine a
user on to swipe the fingerprint to talk

212
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:35,270
to the fingerprint sensor

213
00:24:35,270 --> 00:24:40,740
you want to see some interaction from
the normal worrying you I love you want

214
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:45,360
to ratifying a praying for you I will
tell you that you're a step 13 stab your

215
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:50,689
finger for once it's not perfect thing
friend simply swept the floor another

216
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:58,270
time such kind of issue is handled by
normal were you I so the number were you

217
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:03,408
I has to further proxies that device
operation requires to the top of the

218
00:25:03,409 --> 00:25:10,820
device device is the one that actually
can operate with the device but

219
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:16,970
number what are you I will reflect
what's going on down there so he has to

220
00:25:16,970 --> 00:25:21,909
read that device stage like whether the
fingerprint has already been captured

221
00:25:21,909 --> 00:25:24,110
whether the device is ready

222
00:25:24,110 --> 00:25:34,779
exactly so it has to access the device
in a normal work its own voice so that's

223
00:25:34,779 --> 00:25:39,889
why it still needs direct control of the
device which also opened up for open

224
00:25:39,889 --> 00:25:47,820
access to them our so in this way the
attacker can you during break through

225
00:25:47,820 --> 00:25:53,689
this cast to steer the fingerprint from
the fingerprint sensor two OptOut

226
00:25:53,690 --> 00:25:58,980
notification is actively working on this
issue and here the house and talk aren't

227
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:03,950
a soft this problem so instead of a
rendering the thing about the

228
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:11,210
fingerprint of registering or logging on
interactions in normal water you i think

229
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:19,320
i render try to render the operations in
this way all the operations can be just

230
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:24,629
implemented interest without enabling
the normal work hackers to get away to

231
00:26:24,629 --> 00:26:29,809
excessive number of Ward sensor took us
through this to censor

232
00:26:29,809 --> 00:26:34,289
vendors coming to lock down the device
into the trusted zone only the trusted

233
00:26:34,289 --> 00:26:41,889
encode contest the driver ok excessive
device and here's how Apple software the

234
00:26:41,889 --> 00:26:47,178
right now so Apple still has the problem
of allowing the normal word code to

235
00:26:47,179 --> 00:26:52,100
access answer but it encrypts
fingerprint data rating out of this

236
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:57,928
answer to you this way it didn't break
the design of like using normal word

237
00:26:57,929 --> 00:27:06,230
2222 reflect the state of transition of
the fingerprint rating framework for

238
00:27:06,230 --> 00:27:10,139
bees attacker is adding obtained the
fingerprint data because it is today

239
00:27:10,139 --> 00:27:17,799
it's encrypted ok let's go to force
attack the back door of the premium

240
00:27:17,799 --> 00:27:20,908
bedding fingerprints

241
00:27:20,909 --> 00:27:27,009
obtained from I sent a farm is showing
that I have three fingerprints

242
00:27:27,009 --> 00:27:31,169
registered but does not a limited only
$0.02 on farms is a general problem

243
00:27:31,169 --> 00:27:39,609
somehow came out at only three
fingerprints are registered here so

244
00:27:39,609 --> 00:27:44,349
let's recap how the framework is
designed to the normal word framework

245
00:27:44,349 --> 00:27:49,479
and OS-two rendering of how many how
many fingerprints are registered in the

246
00:27:49,479 --> 00:27:56,179
system so the attacker can easily access
this day up to and he can temper temper

247
00:27:56,179 --> 00:28:03,259
it so even though the framework thing
there are three finger prints register

248
00:28:03,259 --> 00:28:08,460
their technical modified this and show
you the user there are lasting printed

249
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:11,889
registered so in this way for them up
there are three fingerprints register

250
00:28:11,889 --> 00:28:20,090
but you could be four or five or more
registered voters are just scan the

251
00:28:20,090 --> 00:28:24,158
fingerprint matches against the
encrypted fingerprints from the normal

252
00:28:24,159 --> 00:28:31,889
work it doesn't have any clue how many
fingerprints actually store for the

253
00:28:31,889 --> 00:28:37,029
attacker can temper the normal framework
to steal relief cream bad battle

254
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:41,279
fingerprint lock it doesn't have to be
the finger at the attackers on finger it

255
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:48,700
can be anything you something to use of
the back door finger to swap the device

256
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:57,669
through 2024 some fake finger to you to
unlock the device and doesn't even know

257
00:28:57,669 --> 00:29:06,239
explicit it races which is perfect to
use so how to achieve this

258
00:29:06,239 --> 00:29:11,919
enjoy it is usually do you see those
displays the register fingerprint number

259
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:19,759
to the users so third can count how many
fingers are registered and display on

260
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:27,090
the UI for the user at the attacker can
change the return value of this mattered

261
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:31,839
to be done minus am where n is the
actual registered fingerprints number

262
00:29:31,839 --> 00:29:33,810
and a mistake number of

263
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:41,560
fingerprints that's pretty bad so minus
10 minutes and is actually displayed

264
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:49,450
number from the attacker to the user one
thing to be noted is simply changed

265
00:29:49,450 --> 00:29:55,410
modified modifying the said he said it
will be have some problem because he's

266
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:56,550
signed by the system

267
00:29:56,550 --> 00:30:02,520
signature but this is easy to conquer
you can just change to services such are

268
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:07,680
we should which is itself it's not
signed you can change the star took to

269
00:30:07,680 --> 00:30:13,010
make make make the second set up to not
to be verified this sort of the

270
00:30:13,010 --> 00:30:18,410
deserters to signing certificate in this
way when I passes signing certificate

271
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:34,730
check to hear that

272
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:40,280
so I see I'm going to the settings enter
register so you can see that there's

273
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:48,470
only one fingerprints are rather serve
currently in the system I will mark my

274
00:30:48,470 --> 00:30:55,190
fingers as number one finger number two
finger and number three finger so I'm

275
00:30:55,190 --> 00:31:01,179
not shooting a come true for now I'm
like the demise and try to unlock the

276
00:31:01,179 --> 00:31:07,879
device with my first finger prints it
works

277
00:31:07,879 --> 00:31:25,260
and now I'm going to try the second one
he also works

278
00:31:25,260 --> 00:31:33,750
and gas was happening now X 231 also
works for the attacker can use it had a

279
00:31:33,750 --> 00:31:39,390
back door to unlock your device to
imagine that town has experienced a

280
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:44,920
hacker he has many 10 days his email
thread I guess so I just creamed on my

281
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:52,690
finger print his device so that every
time he has a new day I can get it so

282
00:31:52,690 --> 00:31:58,620
here's the final discussion about the
four attacks so mobile devices with

283
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:02,419
fingerprint sensor some more and more
popular and there are more and more

284
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:07,020
functionalities associated with finger
prints but there are still severe

285
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:12,280
security challengers for the vendors so
we have shown you all kinds of attacks

286
00:32:12,280 --> 00:32:18,980
here i text would be more out there this
is kind of security floor as co-lead

287
00:32:18,980 --> 00:32:24,540
fingerprint linkages for this is not
simply liquors its fingerprint luggage

288
00:32:24,540 --> 00:32:29,129
if you're looking forward to it just
changes if you lick finger prints this

289
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:35,650
lasts for your whole life that industry
should pay more attention to other

290
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:42,020
existing designs and implementations of
fingerprint frameworks

291
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:48,680
us into the mobile phone users to have
to stick to mobile device vendors with

292
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:54,810
timely patching and upgrading to the
latest resume for them to live apart so

293
00:32:54,810 --> 00:33:00,350
don't use some pre a sleek devices are
routed by

294
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:10,120
always keep your device up-to-date so
interesting I just saw the demo that he

295
00:33:10,120 --> 00:33:17,780
used fingerprints on Locust Hill eyes
are always popular apps from reliable

296
00:33:17,780 --> 00:33:25,100
sources such as Google Play and for
enterprise users you have to take

297
00:33:25,100 --> 00:33:30,110
special care you're not normal users
should seek for professional services to

298
00:33:30,110 --> 00:33:36,389
get to get away from the most persistent
attacks

299
00:33:36,390 --> 00:33:43,920
and provide a better level protection
end users just don't rotor device if

300
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:48,820
necessary and also just keep your device
up there because attackers were trying

301
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:55,439
to your phone to this number of
suggestions to mobile vendors so vendors

302
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:59,170
should also improve the Securities
design of the fingerprint alt framework

303
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:04,660
such as improve the recognition
algorithm to defend against fake

304
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:09,409
fingerprints attacks and the better
protection or both fingerprint data and

305
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:15,380
the device the sensor and have the
differentiating authorization with

306
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:24,070
authentication clearly also the existing
standards will be further improved to

307
00:34:24,070 --> 00:34:29,300
provide a more detailed as security
guidelines for developers to follow the

308
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:33,610
guidelines of said you have to implement
the trusted you I didn't tell you that

309
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:40,490
implemented as trusted the given a
security standard lenders still need

310
00:34:40,489 --> 00:34:44,850
professional security auditing to
enforce security implementations and

311
00:34:44,850 --> 00:34:52,469
Paswan about the latest time especially
those who the bottom bootys it's not

312
00:34:52,469 --> 00:34:58,439
done yet so in this time we only focus
focus on mobile phones but this also

313
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:04,950
applies to all the platforms with
fingerprints on a boat so many high-end

314
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:09,580
laptops also have fingerprint scanners
to authenticate and authorize users

315
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:17,450
operations for some of the laptops that
our future work will what will spend

316
00:35:17,450 --> 00:35:22,480
some time to investigate like other
platforms with fingerprint scanners so

317
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:28,060
far there are no fingerprint scanners
that that is not invaded an integrated

318
00:35:28,060 --> 00:35:34,270
with the device they also take special
care like a fingerprint scanners used

319
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:39,930
immigration office using the custom
house using the DMV their connecting to

320
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:46,980
sound like laptops are so in this way
the attackers to how to access an actor

321
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,790
to the fingerprint scanners so the
situation

322
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:55,880
some research suggests that all the
vendors should improve that comes to

323
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:00,260
time so that's all about our
presentation and we are open to

324
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:19,930
questions thank you

325
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:40,169
effects of the key whether the keys per
device is shared by common cause all the

326
00:36:40,170 --> 00:36:40,880
devices

327
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:50,360
right okay if the generated personalized
to gender is the key is the party of ice

328
00:36:50,360 --> 00:37:06,920
and the other is there any scope on the
iPhone for the sensors missing attack if

329
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:16,600
you have root so I'm the center has five
you said with a custom ROM it's possible

330
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:22,029
to sniff the fingerprint sensor Dada and
I'm just wondering if the same thing

331
00:37:22,030 --> 00:37:43,640
would be possible on the iPhone maybe we
can go there is a call here in a while

332
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:51,759
what is the encryption is used for
communicating with the actual sensor oh

333
00:37:51,760 --> 00:38:05,780
yeah we had too much time to reverse
engineering specifications AES 256 or

334
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:06,400
something

335
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:12,590
specification we have no way to access
documents to prep producer profiteering

336
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,590
in their ship
