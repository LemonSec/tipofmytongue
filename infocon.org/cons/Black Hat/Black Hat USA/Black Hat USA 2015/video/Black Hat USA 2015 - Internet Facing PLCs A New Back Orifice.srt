1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,420
you are currently in the Jasmine room
and this talk is internet facing PLC

2
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:11,570
Zanu back orifice thank you ladies and
gentlemen welcome to our targeted and

3
00:00:11,570 --> 00:00:17,119
facing PCs and your back orifice mine
and miss you and theres a step on now we

4
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:25,670
are from Sarah Palin visited Berlin and
our group is called static stands for a

5
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:30,269
scatter and computer security are
consisting of bachelors students must

6
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:35,769
unions kidney stones and one profesor
our topics are researching and attacks

7
00:00:35,770 --> 00:00:44,800
and also doing research in a new defense
mechanisms for industrial security and

8
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:53,000
now I would give you a small overview of
our talk today 31st we will give you a

9
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,670
comprehensive overview of traditional
take pictures in the past four years

10
00:00:57,670 --> 00:01:00,420
sees then we will show you

11
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:06,810
distribution of interfacing pues seized
in Europe and USA then we will explain

12
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,049
shortly

13
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:15,049
our integrity we are showing today and
then we will give you introduction to

14
00:01:15,049 --> 00:01:20,509
see conspiracies how was a very
understanding of them and then explained

15
00:01:20,509 --> 00:01:24,540
with this knowledge we can explain here
are attacked in detail how to inject

16
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:31,000
code into program literally logic
controllers and how to exactly inject

17
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:36,460
and S&P scanner or socks proxy in a POC
and in the end we are doing a variation

18
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:42,479
of our tech so let's start with the
traditional a tech director of people

19
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:49,340
cease so well we know as a possible
announced oxblood has compromised

20
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:55,210
Iranian nuclear facilities through the
supply chain that was a Siemens attached

21
00:01:55,210 --> 00:02:03,309
to a workstation and USB stick and this
compromise development environment of

22
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:08,259
Siemens for programming policies so this
means that if you have programs

23
00:02:08,258 --> 00:02:12,319
program to program a would you want to
do not weep you'll see

24
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:20,420
then stocks and has modified source code
and has uploaded could be used to cure

25
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:24,208
disease so the engineer was not able to
see that and sort of everything is

26
00:02:24,209 --> 00:02:29,840
running fine so this is an offline a
tech we also know that last year in

27
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:37,480
December German still got hacked so they
attacked the business I T Y are pushing

28
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:43,450
malicious phishing emails undertakers
way of the 22 gets a business idea and

29
00:02:43,450 --> 00:02:48,089
then they've worked from the business I
T to the production network and dad to

30
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:53,739
have many pledges industrial control
system which damage to produce so this

31
00:02:53,739 --> 00:03:00,620
is just an example picture of a still
broke and foreigners tradition in a

32
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:06,159
certain state and so it's just got cool
down if you have a huge furnace which

33
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,739
got schooled you can stroll to rate
right you have to completely refurbish

34
00:03:08,739 --> 00:03:16,780
and the damage as it is expected about
to several millions of tolerance and so

35
00:03:16,780 --> 00:03:23,509
here 10 see control room office to work
on the left side from the guy you can

36
00:03:23,509 --> 00:03:31,918
see it's got a system which controls ok
so we have now and offline attack and an

37
00:03:31,919 --> 00:03:37,530
online and take over the business I G
and the questions ok what if when one

38
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:41,709
system of Sir production at work is
maybe online like a few seats so we know

39
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:47,040
we searched on showdown for a lot of
industrial control systems and your

40
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,280
behavior have a map so we see it threats
red dots opulence sees green dots up

41
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:57,359
using network devices which make use
these internet capital or capital it's

42
00:03:57,359 --> 00:04:00,469
like converting their converting

43
00:04:00,469 --> 00:04:07,829
bus bus systems to listen at systems and
so we see there are a lot of a lot of

44
00:04:07,829 --> 00:04:12,289
control systems in Europe and we also
see that we have a lot of control

45
00:04:12,289 --> 00:04:13,739
systems in the USA

46
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:20,590
sheer yellow dots are more building
management systems so we are germans be

47
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:27,849
no image control systems are used in
germany you may not do not use so good

48
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:32,150
control systems using a but you have had
a lot of middle management systems but

49
00:04:32,150 --> 00:04:37,900
environmental systems are very dangerous
when you Hexham Franklin farmers see if

50
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:42,830
you increase your community of a process
of survival meant you could maybe

51
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:48,830
through a lot of pills so putting
management systems also very important

52
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:55,000
so we see that the NBC that Europe and
USA you have a lot of control systems

53
00:04:55,000 --> 00:05:02,170
online and here we have some numbers we
did this research then 2013 and you see

54
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:12,390
that the number of PCs program logic
controllers are increasing since 2000

55
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:22,060
charity so we had today and 2015 we have
over 30,000 appearance fees based on

56
00:05:22,060 --> 00:05:25,950
which are directly connected to the
Internet

57
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:31,120
YRC system connecting to the internet
well mostly it's for maintenance so

58
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,790
sometimes you have to adjust the program
something gets more hard two or more

59
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:40,480
cold environment changes and that's why
you need some maintenance guys are

60
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:44,770
putting these devices online are calling
their services and say ok is a side

61
00:05:44,770 --> 00:05:53,270
people's connectors Busey and reprogram
it right so ok so but the question is if

62
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:57,609
you have one interface in pure see your
fine on what is behind this and maybe a

63
00:05:57,610 --> 00:06:04,940
halt production at burg or are they a
lot of other people seized and bush oh

64
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:12,500
how we can use and one in 10 facing pues
si for detecting as a pure seized in the

65
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:19,550
local production it behind us internet
facing plz give you an hour of you so at

66
00:06:19,550 --> 00:06:25,640
first we have to production and burgundy
upstream pues si pues si 123 and you see

67
00:06:25,640 --> 00:06:29,390
someone is connected to the internet and
also an attacker is connected to the

68
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:31,110
Internet will

69
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:40,590
so their tech injects as get into Piercy
won we will explain later in detail how

70
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:48,190
to inject a scanner and pues si and to
appeal seemed so whether this is kind of

71
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:53,520
scanner especially be have done it was
S&P so it's a skimpy scanner the scatter

72
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,270
of superior service associates is gonna
running on the POC one and this can

73
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:02,940
announce cancel production at work right
so now we can seize it for scanner scans

74
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:08,830
you see to use these three and the rest
also production at four then the scanner

75
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:14,930
stores its data in the database and data
block and then air ticket window note

76
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:21,530
the results from the POC and has not a
rough few officer production network so

77
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:27,320
but well getting information on it for a
few thought is not enough that's why we

78
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:35,420
have implemented in STO as a SOCKS proxy
server which is which now is able to run

79
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:43,000
on a pues si so that economic injects
novel which which provides a proxy and

80
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,510
then there take a can usurp Roxas if you
see proxy for as a gateway for accessing

81
00:07:49,510 --> 00:07:54,960
all other devices into production at
four so rich so completely different be

82
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:02,599
a completely you attack vector we know
that Victor and Alana take her to a

83
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:07,240
business idea and we show how to
leverage one entrance facing cutesy for

84
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:13,330
compromises the whole production at work
behind and now stepping who gives you

85
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:18,469
some basic information about Siemens
pierce's thank you

86
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:23,720
in order to perform this attack
described we need to know some details

87
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:30,520
on Siemens peels he's in special 7 300
pills seized I will come into this

88
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:34,510
introduction by these conserved can be
applied to other business services

89
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:38,630
content can be applied to other people's
he says but

90
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:44,600
so at first I will tell you this if you
don't already know that then I will show

91
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:49,830
how the program is executed on the PLC
and how does it differ to a normal

92
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:55,800
program on the computer then we are
going to show you our program is

93
00:08:55,800 --> 00:09:01,449
structured and how a program on appeal
see looks like so what you'll see a

94
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:08,010
dozen programmable logic controller used
to control industrial processes and it

95
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:16,030
is a real-time industrial computer and
outputs this important connected to send

96
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:21,780
us which can get the state of siege of
the industrial process and its machines

97
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:29,709
and a program controls then with the
importance yard ports and controls the

98
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:36,040
machinery and industrial process so how
the program is executed and restore the

99
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:42,150
computer to PLC program is likely to be
executed at the beginning of the cycle

100
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:50,550
there is a snapshot taking office in and
out put off the PC to a memory is there

101
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:55,640
for the taking because you use a program
which is then executed a consistent

102
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:01,610
state of season and outputs after that
the operating system takes place and

103
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:07,940
execute some backbone function like
functions like network network

104
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:16,480
communication so the overall execution
time is money talked so if the cycle

105
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:23,760
takes too long which means the user
program does hang or something like that

106
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:31,170
then decide to the skill and endurance
race and appeals so

107
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:38,399
programs on a PLC Siemens PLC consists
of several blocks program has at least

108
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:42,529
an organization block which is the
problem and enter important and is

109
00:10:42,529 --> 00:10:51,000
comparable to the main function in C to
store any data the program can use data

110
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,040
blocks persisted additional do we have
of course functions which can have

111
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,839
arguments between values and there are
also special functions which can keep

112
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:09,040
the state which which would you say that
they keep the state in the data log in

113
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:16,050
or associated a book to perform special
tasks PCs have a system library where we

114
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,740
can do

115
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:25,250
communication and last there are some
special day blocks court system data

116
00:11:25,250 --> 00:11:29,910
blocks and they are simply used for PCs
configuration intent on reducing the

117
00:11:29,910 --> 00:11:37,810
program itself so let's see how program
looks like we have a simple brilliant we

118
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:42,319
said the first thought put off the POC
depending on the first three imports of

119
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:52,010
C PLC which means I'll put 200 is true
if the first to imports are true or is

120
00:11:52,010 --> 00:12:00,350
important strip this term looks looks in
statement list like you see there on a

121
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:07,920
slight definitely a symbolic language
and symbolic language and the basis of

122
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:15,180
all people see program sincere in the
Siemens world so when we compounds block

123
00:12:15,180 --> 00:12:21,239
and uploaded to the PRC and of course
taught by here is see all the by Mike

124
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:26,819
look like the Joker well we just need to
know that each file you block has an

125
00:12:26,819 --> 00:12:35,149
head up this all the first a lot of
roads there and then there follows the

126
00:12:35,149 --> 00:12:41,579
data which is m7 but the STR
representation or simply the date of a

127
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:43,969
deadlock and then we have a food

128
00:12:43,970 --> 00:12:49,459
which just not only contains a signature
but some other values which are not

129
00:12:49,459 --> 00:12:57,899
necessary for our tech so let's say we
have an OB one with the STL instruction

130
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:03,990
so in a previous lights and this is
compared to the spinal block we see here

131
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:09,730
and you have stopped so let's take a
look at the interesting values we can

132
00:13:09,730 --> 00:13:21,220
find here by by binary is the block type
and this case it's gonna be then we have

133
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:22,680
to bite of block number

134
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:32,508
began yet then they follow the total
blockade of 160 bytes then we have some

135
00:13:32,509 --> 00:13:37,300
other data which is not interesting but
then before the court right before the

136
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:42,449
code section we have the cord length of
10 bytes then we have the emcee 7

137
00:13:42,449 --> 00:13:52,479
opcodes of each instruction and at the
end and implicit block and return it so

138
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:57,589
hard to get these binary blocks onto a
PLC Siemens has proposed a proprietary

139
00:13:57,589 --> 00:14:02,939
protocol as seven com which is used to
manage the appeals here and also to

140
00:14:02,939 --> 00:14:10,709
upload programs program blogs at seven
calm as an RPC protocol telegrams crept

141
00:14:10,709 --> 00:14:17,849
into the interest is over TCP protocol
over to the people to call is used to

142
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:24,290
address several compliments in compass
it plz environmental mostly you don't

143
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:29,389
have one plz like we had there you have
a lot of beauties you can have a lot of

144
00:14:29,389 --> 00:14:34,170
policies would work with a lot of
football youth you can address them

145
00:14:34,170 --> 00:14:41,529
which is over disappear and then the old
pictures are wrapped into tcp/ip so when

146
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:45,819
we operate the program block it looks
like this

147
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:52,329
the engineer workstation negotiates a
method method size court picard data

148
00:14:52,329 --> 00:14:55,699
protocol data unit was repealed C

149
00:14:55,699 --> 00:15:00,998
then the journey workstation says I want
to download something you should

150
00:15:00,999 --> 00:15:08,839
download something that appeals these
thoughts on what job and the ups and the

151
00:15:08,839 --> 00:15:17,069
updater then repeatedly acknowledged the
download and and and the new workstation

152
00:15:17,069 --> 00:15:22,899
inserts block into the fire system which
activates the program blog on the PC so

153
00:15:22,899 --> 00:15:26,410
if you're interested in a seven come
open source community has done a great

154
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:33,350
job with engineers protocols and shocked
sector which is pretty good

155
00:15:33,350 --> 00:15:39,339
also you have implementation of the
seven come protocol available cold snap

156
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:48,429
7 yeah yeah so now you got some basic
information about the syrians policies

157
00:15:48,429 --> 00:15:56,419
and now we can explain your are a tech
details so as I told you before we will

158
00:15:56,419 --> 00:16:01,600
show you how to instrument alive PUC
programs are scanning mother and how we

159
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,499
have implemented

160
00:16:03,499 --> 00:16:08,369
scanner so we're doing S&P scanning
electron scanning results and then we

161
00:16:08,369 --> 00:16:12,249
are instrumental as abuse again as proxy
and then we are using that one doesn't

162
00:16:12,249 --> 00:16:19,289
visit pues si for taking these two guys
behind so again here we have few themed

163
00:16:19,289 --> 00:16:23,149
one which is connected to the Internet
and now they're taking us a fun-loving

164
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:32,209
Hedo nodes obi-wan the main function of
Appeals so here you have is an example

165
00:16:32,209 --> 00:16:37,518
obi-wan which looks like that and what
we're doing now as we we we know the

166
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:43,569
binary representation and 27 which has
resigned after compilation and now we

167
00:16:43,569 --> 00:16:49,089
are adding a call to a country which is
on our control and will be uploaded

168
00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:50,230
again later

169
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:57,289
so it is important to notice that
Stuxnet that to say if you want Stuxnet

170
00:16:57,289 --> 00:17:03,220
has also prepared their own code its own
code to the original control court

171
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:09,089
you're doing saying and here you can see
that we are heading

172
00:17:09,089 --> 00:17:13,928
call and then the function will be
executed as architect code and returns

173
00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:18,539
and then and normal control court gets
also executed this is very important

174
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:21,809
this means its normal control of the
process

175
00:17:21,809 --> 00:17:25,939
get not disturbed when we are doing our
tech people showed leader and

176
00:17:25,939 --> 00:17:31,529
demonstration to control called get not
disturbed the service status on and goes

177
00:17:31,529 --> 00:17:39,880
goes further so this makes take harder
to detect to detect oK now let's look

178
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:47,340
how looks at the binary indeed so here
we can see the problem on this coat so

179
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:54,059
you have about on top of your C code
written STL and here you can see he's

180
00:17:54,059 --> 00:18:00,299
the code in this binary representation
so you can hear it sees off coats R 88

181
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:08,100
bytes coat it's more so than bites so
what we're doing we want to insert a

182
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:13,020
call to our malicious country wedding
later so this means we have to get

183
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:21,020
further 85 so we just need adding a by
its for call that get executed first and

184
00:18:21,020 --> 00:18:25,090
then the normal control could get
executed so now we are adding our call

185
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:30,500
just only two bytes in a second step we
have to be increased to local block

186
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:36,700
length here you can see we have to add a
further bites and then we have two

187
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,740
entries or update

188
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:44,330
Co playing field so so we are just
heading eight parts and you called to a

189
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:51,860
fire under control and updating to link
fields this enables us to inject and S&P

190
00:18:51,860 --> 00:19:00,189
scanner or proxy or some other kind of
number to appeal to see so we are really

191
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:06,100
seeing here on black had a new code tool
called pure see inject and this tool

192
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:13,789
enables you to sort this tool is doing
the following downloads automatically be

193
00:19:13,789 --> 00:19:20,210
one sided and uploads only one again to
zap you see you have just to provide

194
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,460
your own mother

195
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:25,130
and reduce the magic for you

196
00:19:25,130 --> 00:19:35,809
ok so you can find fewer C&J can get her
right now and just to see again sees a

197
00:19:35,809 --> 00:19:41,480
man page we have just to provide the IP
address then meanest piece stents for

198
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:46,799
blocked you want to patch you can also
catch another broken and not just money

199
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:51,850
you cannot function block or just
another organization block for this

200
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:55,379
makes more sense through text I'll be
one because then you'll continue Melton

201
00:19:55,380 --> 00:20:02,100
Mowbray gets executed first and then you
have to say okay which one of which

202
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:09,580
number has your own so so in this
country said ok FB 1000 us our as our

203
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:15,799
function block which contains no malware
and Jeff just provide power to the US

204
00:20:15,799 --> 00:20:25,750
ok we will not showed so so here on the
left you can see this is a pure CT right

205
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:29,470
that's a seaman's pure CSS have a three
hundred and sent you see what's going to

206
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:35,090
take first exit so here is see a signal
column right and secure seats

207
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:39,270
controlling signal caller you see
switching from red to green to yellow

208
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:45,809
and backward so this sense for Sonoma
control call yes this could be a whole

209
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:47,309
production process

210
00:20:47,309 --> 00:20:52,600
leg kicking bottles are on don't know
just making some medal or something else

211
00:20:52,600 --> 00:21:03,949
for this represents a process which gets
controlled by the appeals ok now sure

212
00:21:03,950 --> 00:21:12,029
you inject reappears Collin Peterson
inject the IP address of superior Sears

213
00:21:12,029 --> 00:21:19,750
10001 like in our example then reception
want to pitch will be one and this is

214
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:26,120
our function which should be cold and
this is a path where r functions inside

215
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:31,979
ok so then we say okay that's only for
demonstration purposes only and so on

216
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:33,520
and so on

217
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:39,360
yes please Pichet and now the P&C got
patched and you see now we are executing

218
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:45,860
here a second so we are not executing
additional court right but not be called

219
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:51,820
God but district so this is a normal
controls process road so it's linking

220
00:21:51,820 --> 00:21:56,030
bleeding like before and now we are
executing additional coat so this could

221
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:58,060
be an SNMP is an error

222
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:03,600
a proxy for every else not you you're
thinking about you want to design so

223
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:09,899
this an MSU to inject into a PUC

224
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:18,730
out service disruption ok now we have
some new and explain to you how to

225
00:22:18,730 --> 00:22:24,750
inject your programs into interfacing
killed see so here we can see in our own

226
00:22:24,750 --> 00:22:25,350
tech

227
00:22:25,350 --> 00:22:32,000
done in our laboratory we are uploading
so we have downloaded all be done before

228
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,930
we have had said we have modified it and
I now uploading the modified obi-wan

229
00:22:36,930 --> 00:22:47,270
again and malicious punishment which
gets called by then the pure C-one runs

230
00:22:47,270 --> 00:22:51,300
are SNMP scanner addition it was a
normal control accordance cancelled the

231
00:22:51,300 --> 00:22:58,230
production of their ticker download the
data block has view of the production it

232
00:22:58,230 --> 00:23:04,130
you need to know that it's very funny
human systems had SNMP NMR by default

233
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:11,490
rate so this means I will detect every
fucking Siemens kills and look at

234
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:12,470
production it

235
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:20,039
so does not enough appears see as
talking a lot wire as an employee at SU

236
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:24,220
the serial number attached to his room
that revision and hardware revision so I

237
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:33,230
can look up for a fucking exploits ok so
now we have no longer deadlock and now

238
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:39,409
we are injecting or socks proxy which
enabled Sentech 20 Dec to use abusive

239
00:23:39,409 --> 00:23:44,320
one at the gate babe I was a SOCKS proxy
protocol sucks protocol for accessing

240
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:53,460
all those devices and so we will show
you later and our democrat you a CBE

241
00:23:53,460 --> 00:23:57,950
said we have just closed to Siemens in
March

242
00:23:57,950 --> 00:24:04,120
enough service exploit and tested in our
laboratories to be used if you see one

243
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:09,860
as a SOCKS proxy and have ton of our
explored through pues si one and have

244
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:16,719
driven a denial of service attack on PC
to using city sorts laboratory for

245
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:23,100
telling our extra traffic from houston
won so now the question is how to

246
00:24:23,100 --> 00:24:31,668
implement and SNMP scanner see you know
normally appears see is constructed for

247
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:36,240
doing control task and not tried
scanning the network or for doing

248
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:40,440
processing so there may be some
difficult to understand for you but we

249
00:24:40,440 --> 00:24:45,630
are presenting it for people who are
very close to the topics uses so at

250
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:52,210
first we need to say that thing is not
possible but human species because we

251
00:24:52,210 --> 00:24:56,309
have only access to the transportation
transportation later according to Zillow

252
00:24:56,309 --> 00:25:01,190
Z is obviously more though so it appears
that a creates a problem was we have

253
00:25:01,190 --> 00:25:05,669
only as a chance so we have only a
possibility to have eight concurrent

254
00:25:05,669 --> 00:25:10,940
connections and if he sees him as he
tries to connect to IP port combination

255
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,789
which is not available

256
00:25:12,789 --> 00:25:17,830
it keeps in busy mode right so at first
I tried to connect I G one and it's not

257
00:25:17,830 --> 00:25:22,080
there then I have ok I just 277

258
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,870
connections I tried to Protect IP to

259
00:25:24,870 --> 00:25:30,580
it's not there ok then it keeps also
busy sources means I can only skin up to

260
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:35,379
eight missing appears and then it's busy
and you cannot close the connection so

261
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:40,470
let's go stupid design from Siemens but
protect Siemens from using a TCP scanner

262
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:45,880
you know so well but that's why we
should have chosen GDP and UDP

263
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:50,910
connection that and does not need to
connect set up so we have unlimited

264
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:56,020
connections rate ok yes and as I told
you before as it appears na but many

265
00:25:56,020 --> 00:26:01,429
Siemens beauties and and a lot of
network devices have enabled me to write

266
00:26:01,429 --> 00:26:10,929
ok so here we see how how ok sir Trust
ya to think about one thing we are

267
00:26:10,929 --> 00:26:15,960
injecting S&P scanner internet broke we
are not looking we are not knowing how

268
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:19,750
it looks like right so at first we need
to get the IP address and then this

269
00:26:19,750 --> 00:26:23,380
happened it and then we can say okay
this is this is your IP address this is

270
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:30,940
a subnet please scan from 111 222 to
write ok for this the PRC has a kind of

271
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:38,390
global configuration database that cause
system stateless and we are calling the

272
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:47,000
rich system statement list function
called resist and I D 0:37 put in 2008

273
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:52,990
give you information about the local IP
address and use something and just get a

274
00:26:52,990 --> 00:27:00,050
database IP info so sometimes the
function sometimes expansionist some

275
00:27:00,050 --> 00:27:06,750
seconds then we are waiting until this
function is ready and then we are going

276
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:10,750
through other is setting a stage God
idea that we got that p.m. going to the

277
00:27:10,750 --> 00:27:15,410
next date so programming PCs quite
different it's like putting up huge

278
00:27:15,410 --> 00:27:22,040
state machine FAQ which state I am and
entering three times in the state so now

279
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:28,510
we have our IP address so we are loaded
IP address on the kind of cheese steak

280
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:35,970
and doing it twice and operation was a
subnet mask that gives us some first

281
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:37,040
appeared risk

282
00:27:37,040 --> 00:27:43,740
of Seleucus range and then we are
starring says there is a next

283
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:51,800
loading the subnet mask and doing a
bitwise XOR operation here what's up

284
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:56,320
next month that it's like converting the
subnet mask which gives us the number of

285
00:27:56,320 --> 00:28:01,950
holes inside the subnet so now we r
knows a local IP address subnet mask we

286
00:28:01,950 --> 00:28:07,390
know the beginning of the subnet and we
know how much hosts are inside to submit

287
00:28:07,390 --> 00:28:13,310
so we have now every information for a
scanning the production network so

288
00:28:13,310 --> 00:28:20,830
getting a connection so you have to call
to contact corners like a separate

289
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:26,100
operation see here since you're not
talking about soccer York you're talking

290
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:31,810
about so-called connections ideas so
here we have connection I D one just

291
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:37,409
gives us connection I D one and it's
quite crucial you have to call you have

292
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:42,060
to call this function two times because
this time Chinese rising edge this means

293
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:48,860
you have to value and if you're calling
it first has to be faults and calling it

294
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:53,860
a second time Zara cuba has to be true
if the function to Texas rising edge

295
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:59,050
then it will be executed we are doing
the talking about from false to true

296
00:28:59,050 --> 00:29:05,080
hero in this area so this gives us
providing us a connection I D one so and

297
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:11,939
then can call of the panchen tu cent
which enables us to send UDP packets and

298
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:16,970
here we can see that we just need to
provide a centipede get data fuelled

299
00:29:16,970 --> 00:29:21,980
bears S&P packages inside which one
percent and we just need to provide

300
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:30,430
further address which one to connect to
so and then now we can get to Pinterest

301
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:36,740
address information because I just saw
code and then we can send you the peace

302
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:45,830
accords and get weak list ok now step on
but explain you how r socks proxy is

303
00:29:45,830 --> 00:29:48,699
implemented in STO Siemens PLC

304
00:29:48,700 --> 00:29:54,490
right after the meeting and as a result
proxies seems to be pretty easy socks is

305
00:29:54,490 --> 00:30:00,740
pretty simple protocol you have simple
messages officers at Methodist you ought

306
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:06,260
to tunnel connection that seems pretty
easy why we chose a proxy or proxies

307
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:12,520
supported by all applications and it's
easy to it if you have an application

308
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:19,129
it's pretty easy to rock socks socks
proxy support later I will show you

309
00:30:19,130 --> 00:30:27,410
later in the attack review so we
implemented and we have a minimum

310
00:30:27,410 --> 00:30:31,540
feature set to keep it simple we
supported authentication and encryption

311
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:38,780
at all and also the only support a
connector addressed through it was a TCP

312
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:48,379
stream so he said most applications on
policies are modeled a state machines

313
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:53,270
here use the jobless to implement a
state machine of a source from

314
00:30:53,270 --> 00:31:01,430
subtropical in line you see the first
state where we simply use the check on

315
00:31:01,430 --> 00:31:07,770
the T CON function which harness shown
before to set up a connection but we use

316
00:31:07,770 --> 00:31:13,170
it in passive mode which means we simply
listen on the Stockport want to try and

317
00:31:13,170 --> 00:31:22,490
connect connects we go to negotiate
state lines sent us picard which with

318
00:31:22,490 --> 00:31:29,030
authentication methods you support but
we just ignored because I said you use

319
00:31:29,030 --> 00:31:35,260
we support no authentication so we sent
him and authentication offer of the euro

320
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:42,230
which means no indication at all then
declined has to send a connect repressed

321
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:48,590
which we received here to connect be
pressed into contains the IP and support

322
00:31:48,590 --> 00:31:56,389
of the destination Austin wants to
connect 213 received a record

323
00:31:56,390 --> 00:32:01,700
we simply takes a type II and prepare
the data structure for the two-point

324
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:08,430
function and copy the IPO and support
into it and then we go to the next stage

325
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:14,390
where we start connecting to the
destination host here we see again the

326
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:22,910
econ function as and Cronus function
quads you use in system and the system

327
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:29,200
librarian we also had to be have to
trigger rising edge on the record

328
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:36,290
parameter in line for online 12 and 13
we simply talking to connect from 42

329
00:32:36,290 --> 00:32:42,430
true jump to the beginning of the state
again and keep on again with connector

330
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:48,790
meadoff true and now we have our own
thing then we can wait several cycles

331
00:32:48,790 --> 00:32:53,970
until the Flex indicator to connection
has been established and then we stomp

332
00:32:53,970 --> 00:33:00,350
jump to the next state ya want to reach
the next state we have two connections

333
00:33:00,350 --> 00:33:04,610
one from the client with epoxy one from
the proxies with additional costs and we

334
00:33:04,610 --> 00:33:08,879
can simply start sending everyday done
received from the client to the

335
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:14,000
destination host and other and so we
partying

336
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,790
approaching once one partner closing
connections et receive function

337
00:33:18,790 --> 00:33:23,970
mentioned earlier indicates an overall
then we have simply to send Stephen

338
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:29,790
Manning daughter to the other partner
who did not disconnect and then we can

339
00:33:29,790 --> 00:33:37,080
use that to proxy and wait for the next
client so measure to measure the

340
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:41,550
performance of the SOCKS proxy
implementation alone on the socks proxy

341
00:33:41,550 --> 00:33:46,730
on its own is able to transfer up to 750
kilobits per second

342
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:54,610
100 megabit connection not pretty good
but it's ok kiddo by person

343
00:33:54,610 --> 00:33:58,879
when we when we have when we have
another program on the PC which is

344
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,600
pretty intensified has a psycho time of
around eighty five milliseconds and we

345
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:09,980
were just able to transfer up to 40
kilobytes per second

346
00:34:09,980 --> 00:34:14,649
now I'm going to god I'm gonna show you
the whole detects I could be described

347
00:34:14,649 --> 00:34:24,618
in a video so we have the same setup as
we've seen before we have people see one

348
00:34:24,619 --> 00:34:30,159
worse I P 10001 which is connected to
the Internet which will buy the attacker

349
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:35,340
we see it and the other people's he's
unavailable to find an appeals to you

350
00:34:35,340 --> 00:34:41,139
the attacker who uses it to appear see
scan which was released by the Scottish

351
00:34:41,139 --> 00:34:47,859
strangelove team so we can hear the
hallways upended of 10000 and we find

352
00:34:47,859 --> 00:34:57,680
one PC so after finding the PUC we use
our beauty and purity inject to list all

353
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:04,149
blocks this is also supported so we can
check whether the block number we want

354
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:11,070
to warehouse if it's already taking on
the POC and you don't want to overwrite

355
00:35:11,070 --> 00:35:14,990
existing concrete blocks so here we have
just a normal one and a lot of

356
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:31,540
population data blogs that the attacker
can inject it's Pete

357
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:45,620
251 and provide a pathway so during the
solar tech we had to shark instance

358
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:50,900
running in the background which we will
see right now the teashop simply kept us

359
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:55,760
all traffic or network packets on the
network and they were received after we

360
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,770
injected the S&P

361
00:36:00,770 --> 00:36:06,670
the last four lines we see is that
people see one immediately start sending

362
00:36:06,670 --> 00:36:12,600
us an empty get requests and purity to
view the free response to this request

363
00:36:12,600 --> 00:36:24,850
so now the attacker can download results
users appeals he dumped all which is not

364
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:30,370
publicly admit publicly available but
you can create since 2007 it's pretty

365
00:36:30,370 --> 00:36:39,410
easy so we use OD to display the
relevant part with the eyepiece with you

366
00:36:39,410 --> 00:36:46,490
is at PSC 2300 font now the attacker
knows which were on which I peace

367
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:49,939
appears he's are running on now we can
inject insults proxy and connect with

368
00:36:49,940 --> 00:37:00,810
these pills seized

369
00:37:00,810 --> 00:37:15,850
now he sucks to sources the so-called
proxifier it enables any application to

370
00:37:15,850 --> 00:37:23,700
use a pre-configured SOCKS proxy right
now we see there are a lot of blocks on

371
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:32,730
it but we can also done on two blocks
with CPSC dumped who used to download is

372
00:37:32,730 --> 00:37:40,080
getting results

373
00:37:40,080 --> 00:37:49,110
so we developed also this is for the
emcee 7 language in our group now we can

374
00:37:49,110 --> 00:38:03,480
see which which instructions are
included in 20 we want now also using

375
00:38:03,480 --> 00:38:10,450
Metasploit module module presented by
doing the asteroid for the blackhead

376
00:38:10,450 --> 00:38:15,040
2011 loading

377
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:20,900
just brought up was to start again to
reach a proxy PC number two we're

378
00:38:20,900 --> 00:38:30,030
loading the more you work on figuring it
starting to exploit had yet we see it's

379
00:38:30,030 --> 00:38:41,740
running tech was done over one person
attacked each other right to sort using

380
00:38:41,740 --> 00:38:48,160
T cells enables you to title your tech
over a SOCKS proxy server and we have

381
00:38:48,160 --> 00:38:53,279
done the right end the same way again we
can do this with our exploit you

382
00:38:53,280 --> 00:39:00,350
discovered in March we are trying to
exploit traffic to the apt 112 plz to

383
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:06,770
receive a lot of these over TCP packets
which are transferred via socks proxy

384
00:39:06,770 --> 00:39:13,890
protocol to the beauty number two we are
sending a lot of pickups and then dies

385
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:26,308
and we can't transfer some tickets and
what was PLC Ord simply answer

386
00:39:26,309 --> 00:39:32,369
exploit and the possibility to use or
socks proxy server this means we caught

387
00:39:32,369 --> 00:39:38,959
completely run a huge turnout service
and take on the whole production network

388
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:46,719
and disabling affect to rewrite right
now let's get to the evaluation of our

389
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:52,650
attack because the problem is when we
add additional code to almost exiting

390
00:39:52,650 --> 00:39:58,269
quote we increase the execution time and
the problem is if you increase the

391
00:39:58,269 --> 00:40:04,839
execution time too much then we are
going to hit the configured maximum

392
00:40:04,839 --> 00:40:10,759
cycle time and he will simply stop
always a narrow condition something like

393
00:40:10,759 --> 00:40:15,939
that but differed Siemens PLC have a
maximum psychodrama 150 milliseconds

394
00:40:15,939 --> 00:40:24,609
value then it is usually stop or start
another we're handling program though

395
00:40:24,609 --> 00:40:30,229
about how to measure of this like a time
I could time measuring is pretty simple

396
00:40:30,229 --> 00:40:34,999
obi-wan has a special variable where
he's taught us he lost as a review of

397
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:41,229
psycho time to take some value is stored
in a data block then we can upload

398
00:40:41,229 --> 00:40:48,558
download the data block from the POC and
have serious of test values which we can

399
00:40:48,559 --> 00:40:52,349
analyze when you test the three
different scenarios used to baseline

400
00:40:52,349 --> 00:40:57,949
program which does a lot of memory
intensive info operations and then we

401
00:40:57,949 --> 00:41:02,289
uploaded to we have two scenarios where
he applauded the proxy and when he was

402
00:41:02,289 --> 00:41:09,739
idle and the other one we ordered a huge
program through this process so as we

403
00:41:09,739 --> 00:41:15,019
can see we have a box lunch here was the
measured cycle times the baseline and to

404
00:41:15,019 --> 00:41:24,758
proxy idled seems pretty cool but we did
and statistical significance analyzes

405
00:41:24,759 --> 00:41:31,369
whether these tests serious differ and
yes indeed the different you see it was

406
00:41:31,369 --> 00:41:34,810
a bar above ancestry stars

407
00:41:34,810 --> 00:41:40,450
and when we put the proxy under loads of
cyber time increased a lot of course

408
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:51,180
there was no statistical difference to
the measured you can see that your proxy

409
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:57,399
under load at around 1.30 milliseconds
to the average cycle time but if we take

410
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:04,730
the maximum default psycho time of 150
milliseconds freshness only one percent

411
00:42:04,730 --> 00:42:10,040
and in this case it's not very likely
that we will hit these Mexicans like

412
00:42:10,040 --> 00:42:17,060
retirement when does he peal see
portability and two in a row moment yeah

413
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:22,240
and if you have internet facing PCs how
can you how can you protect yourself

414
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:30,069
against these kinds of it take it easy
they secure USB end use firewalls don't

415
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:33,860
connect them directly to the intended to
protect them

416
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:42,360
there's another way to protect human
species have a future to perform due to

417
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:51,180
read and write protection on these
people see but it's only you can upload

418
00:42:51,180 --> 00:42:56,410
and download the program but you can
still manipulate the memory of the PUC

419
00:42:56,410 --> 00:43:02,210
you can still runs east exit these
middle spot module and stop the PLC and

420
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:07,270
that's not a pretty good protection
otherwise against state connected to the

421
00:43:07,270 --> 00:43:09,560
Internet and hope nothing bad happens

422
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:18,730
yeah we were able to inject malware to
appeal to see and do not disturb its

423
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:24,480
operation also we can use an Internet
facing people see it as a gateway into

424
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:32,550
local network and can of course in
compromising devices behind their peers

425
00:43:32,550 --> 00:43:41,920
and when we take this into account the
attack surface on the internet of

426
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:46,690
interfacing beauties can be pretty
bigger than we already saw with or short

427
00:43:46,690 --> 00:43:47,109
indeed

428
00:43:47,109 --> 00:44:07,089
okay thank you ladies for attention now
time for Q&A yes yes yes you can call

429
00:44:07,089 --> 00:44:15,430
the question was is maximum cycle time
of 150 milliseconds program will yes it

430
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:21,839
is your coat programs of time and we can
be called also increases time including

431
00:44:21,839 --> 00:44:28,970
our medical stuff it's it's it's
possible yes yes yes yeah yeah that the

432
00:44:28,970 --> 00:44:56,839
truth you can do the brakes yet

433
00:44:56,839 --> 00:45:11,930
so so very hard perhaps a disassembler
of which makes it possible to see the

434
00:45:11,930 --> 00:45:16,839
STL colds we know as a result in
academia are some projects which are

435
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:22,710
trying to do the same building execution
to do which states are possible and able

436
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:27,729
to say abuses may be traffic light
control but well it's it's really hard

437
00:45:27,729 --> 00:45:31,618
to but this topic of our talk to you
just want to show how to use a PC

438
00:45:31,619 --> 00:45:36,539
protective devices behind so just if you
just want to her on the denial of

439
00:45:36,539 --> 00:45:41,269
service explored a really bad guy so you
don't care but in fact it would be cool

440
00:45:41,269 --> 00:45:46,899
to know this and imagine Europe
Germany's building could cost right so

441
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:51,960
but if you are going hiking BMW and you
would be trees is a millimeter of

442
00:45:51,960 --> 00:45:58,259
thickness of your car could you know you
could throw up a lot of German cars and

443
00:45:58,259 --> 00:46:02,059
so is kind of slide into tech would be
really really hot and for this would be

444
00:46:02,059 --> 00:46:09,759
really cool to know what you're right ok
over there did you ever break any of

445
00:46:09,759 --> 00:46:15,529
these devices and is it possible to how
hard would it be to break the DLCs break

446
00:46:15,529 --> 00:46:16,339
what

447
00:46:16,339 --> 00:46:25,640
yes so we have not bricked one we have
just a bit too as we have just gone to

448
00:46:25,640 --> 00:46:30,390
deny service explode and if you're
running has denied service explode you

449
00:46:30,390 --> 00:46:36,229
just to go there and switch to PUC all
and switch tubuz on but you have to do

450
00:46:36,229 --> 00:46:41,299
it manually and you have to be in front
of Securency so but we have not bridged

451
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:53,930
already so no

452
00:46:53,930 --> 00:47:14,799
terrorists are you sorry yes very good
question no yes no interruption so we

453
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:19,849
have shown in Denver right so there was
this column was lightning was controlled

454
00:47:19,849 --> 00:47:23,790
by the PRC and we have patched it will
be one and then the second one votes

455
00:47:23,790 --> 00:47:28,270
active but this was working fine views
he doesn't like the photos we have to

456
00:47:28,270 --> 00:47:33,359
only one and then you get a new OB one
and then just use seat on the next I

457
00:47:33,359 --> 00:47:39,009
puts on the next cycle which gets
executed just switched over ok and so

458
00:47:39,010 --> 00:47:44,309
the PUC get not disturbed by patching
and that's very important that's a

459
00:47:44,309 --> 00:47:48,750
that's a very good picture of you see
because if you want to do in life patch

460
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:54,160
for electrical engineer you have to do
some reprogramming it would be really

461
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:58,118
uncool if your system will stop because
it would distribute controlled process

462
00:47:58,119 --> 00:48:04,410
so that really good future Siemens PLC
sits at KFC switchover possibility for

463
00:48:04,410 --> 00:48:09,879
changing the old code to new code and
even if you sent a large block to the

464
00:48:09,880 --> 00:48:14,990
appeal see as we see in the sequence
diagram it does not override actual use

465
00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:22,629
the original block just when you cause
hes insert function then the actual blog

466
00:48:22,630 --> 00:48:27,829
well-written so it's a pretty fast
operation and you probably do not

467
00:48:27,829 --> 00:48:35,550
disturb the PUC ok neck stretching over
there

468
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:44,470
yeah it's a point of time and money but
yes it would be very cool and we have

469
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:48,910
now a German research project we have
your scanning or in Germany for

470
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:53,850
industrial control systems and get some
new PCs also from other vendors

471
00:48:53,850 --> 00:49:00,290
electrical or a BB or Phoenix and then
tried to apply as a tech yes people do

472
00:49:00,290 --> 00:49:16,759
some research I hope ok yes what she
does unlocking well I don't know so I

473
00:49:16,760 --> 00:49:21,090
think no I have not seen any kind of
looks to have seen some kind of looks

474
00:49:21,090 --> 00:49:25,670
known on the PCs are no locks but maybe
if you have some kind of firewood simply

475
00:49:25,670 --> 00:49:31,980
opens the party and captures traffic and
it will be possible but the POC itself

476
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:36,870
doesn't block as these program
modifications and these systems are

477
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:41,770
really alright so it's simply a similar
period see you're putting on a

478
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:47,790
production the life cycle of accuracy of
this type of surprise about twenty-five

479
00:49:47,790 --> 00:49:50,650
years so we are talking about

480
00:49:50,650 --> 00:49:57,520
devices which are set up in the nineties
and that's why be a problem of something

481
00:49:57,520 --> 00:50:05,140
right so ok there's a christmas deals

482
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:14,879
does not expect applauding for
durability

483
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:21,099
well this device is at all because it
just protection as cooperative protocol

484
00:50:21,099 --> 00:50:25,390
if you know the protocol you can
download and upload caused you are using

485
00:50:25,390 --> 00:50:29,038
their normal function provided by the
pool see we are now able to understand

486
00:50:29,039 --> 00:50:32,799
the protocol and that's why we can do
this it's like a nineties we have no

487
00:50:32,799 --> 00:50:37,609
authentication or no corruption and it's
the same here so it's no wonder ability

488
00:50:37,609 --> 00:50:45,140
it's a future

489
00:50:45,140 --> 00:50:54,930
denounced arms export 30 pounds and we
have not this closest because to every

490
00:50:54,930 --> 00:50:59,609
electrical engineer we have talked to a
show and I'm just kind of take they said

491
00:50:59,609 --> 00:51:03,970
well what the fuck yeah right i doing
programs if you see this all the time

492
00:51:03,970 --> 00:51:10,569
and now I would think like you I could
use also so this should be also known to

493
00:51:10,569 --> 00:51:14,940
seaman said you can do that we are not
doing something hidden or so it's just

494
00:51:14,940 --> 00:51:21,000
you idea how to compromise systems so we
have not contacted Siemens well they're

495
00:51:21,000 --> 00:51:32,990
not contact now here back at ya

496
00:51:32,990 --> 00:51:42,600
well 450 1515 your protocol and we have
not investigated its protocol very much

497
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:49,540
it's open source community is trying to
reverse it and there is some yeah well

498
00:51:49,540 --> 00:51:53,770
you know some knowledge about it we have
also found a flaw in the protocol last

499
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:59,259
year but it also wasn't enough service
explode so as as I know there is some

500
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:04,360
kind of authentication scheme now in
your protocol for over 1,200 and 1,500

501
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:14,420
we have to do some further research
question times over

502
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:19,110
okay thank you very much

503
00:52:19,110 --> 00:52:20,400
great audience
