1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,330
good morning everybody welcome to Black
Hat USA 2015 a good morning so far

2
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:13,830
welcome to internet coming for security
professionals a presentation about BDP

3
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:19,070
security your speaker today is the
manager strategic services for rapid

4
00:00:19,070 --> 00:00:25,250
seven and Europe he is the organizer of
the Groupon conference co-developer of

5
00:00:25,250 --> 00:00:30,859
the penetration testing execution
standard or pts and former board member

6
00:00:30,859 --> 00:00:42,900
of I S E squared without further ado
maglis present you Mr Webb

7
00:00:42,900 --> 00:01:00,989
first time in India spaghetti last night
so that's ok I've never had a keynote

8
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:05,280
thats agreed that that they're willing
to my presentation the reason why I

9
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,280
started looking into BGP security or BJP
in general is because I believe it's a

10
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:16,360
foundational element of the Internet as
we know it and securing BGP is important

11
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:22,070
to build the trust in their security
professionals and as I T professionals

12
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:27,899
we tend to use simplicity

13
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,940
abstract way of the complex things about
the applications that we try to secure

14
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:37,850
without we tried talking to general
terms I think it's Adam points we need

15
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:42,830
to be aware of the complexity that
constitutes our networks how insecure

16
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:47,789
I'm busy how we can provide our users
with secure and reliable internet and

17
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:55,240
that's basically what my presentation
will talk about Ed in short the agenda

18
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,720
for today I've tried to keep it simple
and straight we're gonna go to the

19
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:06,210
history of PHP security democrat talk a
little bit about the BGP triple to put

20
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:12,079
everything I'm doing about the European
how to security in in perspective I

21
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:17,810
tried to document why do we actually
care security professionals as network

22
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:24,720
owners as some of you and the audience
our network network owners and then how

23
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,310
do we get better we're different another
point would be to be security right now

24
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:37,690
where we are in the States so there is a
construction zone how do you how to get

25
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:41,780
better and how we are skilled
professionals can force network owners

26
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:49,370
to be better I'm also trying to avoid
any but words like cyber or

27
00:02:49,370 --> 00:02:56,440
there is no life hacks of of the girls
or whatever on the on the stage later in

28
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:04,239
the other presentations the one word I
would use the Internet of Things because

29
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:05,349
that for me

30
00:03:05,349 --> 00:03:12,569
clearly illustrates what I or
professionals call we really want

31
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:17,540
application stuff that people want to
buy soon as possible but we forget about

32
00:03:17,540 --> 00:03:23,099
the underlying plumbing business reason
why I can't comment on interest plumbing

33
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:29,640
plumbing for the Internet of Things is
the same plumbing as it existed back in

34
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:32,970
the day when the internet was born right

35
00:03:32,970 --> 00:03:41,379
the problem is that today everybody uses
the Internet has expectation of security

36
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:45,569
it is basically it's all the Internet of
Things the interests of your things

37
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:53,450
however there are different stakeholders
the things you've done it only that run

38
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:59,690
the network application developers your
first service providers be commercial

39
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:09,560
organizations dnt users secure are not
properly allows the people that actually

40
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,639
have the power to make the network
reliable

41
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:20,440
incentive to invest in it right so I
wanted to the Internet of our things

42
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:26,680
into the internet of doing the right
things it's not about about doing things

43
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:32,660
right it's often also without sufficient
incentives to just do the right thing to

44
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:39,789
make sure that the internet use is
actually a reliable security and that

45
00:04:39,789 --> 00:04:45,380
possibly out of the introduction into
the meat of the presentation first of

46
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:50,409
all talk a bit about how beach P
actually works so BP's board gateway

47
00:04:50,410 --> 00:04:51,860
protocol

48
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:59,520
I refer to owners of the system owners
of my speech in the past there was

49
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:06,719
almost 10 much one-on-one match between
I these owners but nowadays big

50
00:05:06,719 --> 00:05:11,780
corporations own their own systems and
they're not specifically I space so we

51
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:18,169
talked about it is an owner's built
relationships with other is in order to

52
00:05:18,169 --> 00:05:25,099
information in BGP in its essence is
very simple protocol once that the

53
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:29,479
relationship is there the road
information is sent to the beer and the

54
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:37,229
accepted given certain policies so in
this example you have for autonomous

55
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:51,210
systems and specifically is 101 we'll
see how do I get to the 1070 writes it

56
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:56,448
will get routes from its peers and right
now the preferred route and just because

57
00:05:56,449 --> 00:06:01,969
the parts is shortest that's the only
thing that concerns about they are not

58
00:06:01,969 --> 00:06:06,900
concerned about people not concerned
about bandwidth or any other technical

59
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,888
parameter of the link its airspace
decides which which i think is taking

60
00:06:11,889 --> 00:06:24,479
first so in this sense is is 101 knows
that it's going to get to the owner of

61
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:33,099
the 1070 network but there is one
hundred and 470 network and decides that

62
00:06:33,099 --> 00:06:37,849
the link to one or two is too expensive
European from both links they're paying

63
00:06:37,849 --> 00:06:43,169
more for the link to want to do what it
do is free pending and you'll see

64
00:06:43,169 --> 00:06:50,310
something like this to just add their
own air sander several times to the

65
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:55,800
parts and then it appears longer
heritages see ok despite his long as I'm

66
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:01,529
not going to use that 1 I'm gonna use
the short one and then the real security

67
00:07:01,529 --> 00:07:07,389
about BGP is built into writing policies
and this is where autonomous system

68
00:07:07,389 --> 00:07:15,149
owners decide what to do with rubbing
analysis prices appear could be allowed

69
00:07:15,149 --> 00:07:26,810
to do but when they use the same IP
resource especially for us or / too

70
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:32,349
early they will not be allowed to do
that there can be no reserve prefixes

71
00:07:32,349 --> 00:07:39,199
the game before spring on attribute of
prefixes or packages 622 specific

72
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:45,440
prefixes is very important to remember
was the relationship between the

73
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:51,330
autonomous systems is established they
will definitely accept this from the

74
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:56,479
pier there is inherent trust in pairs
and that's one of the main things about

75
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:04,180
BGP dresses everyday stress each other
anything can happen and we've seen that

76
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:10,599
witnessed in several examples throughout
our history and it started back in 1997

77
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:18,690
one of the first events that happened
was the 7700 what's important to note if

78
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:26,659
you look into BGP incidence it's very
hard to see the difference between an

79
00:08:26,659 --> 00:08:35,328
accidental this conflagration its it all
looks like in the prefixes and I was my

80
00:08:35,328 --> 00:08:41,838
baby and that propagates through the
network so we both can only look at

81
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,060
religious motivation based on the

82
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:49,339
the kind of a kind of traffic there is
free rather than what is essentially

83
00:08:49,340 --> 00:08:54,520
done with it on the BJP event itself
it's very hard to tell whether it was

84
00:08:54,520 --> 00:09:04,720
malicious or intentional in 2008 there
was Pakistan that try to limit YouTube

85
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:11,730
access on their network but accidentally
they started announcing YouTube prefixes

86
00:09:11,730 --> 00:09:17,660
attracted traffic from from YouTube to
generate that would have been an example

87
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:27,160
of an oven on malicious roughly also
seeing china juicy and China was my

88
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:35,130
first book I try not to do it again so
Jack China in 2010 also announced a lot

89
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:41,230
of resources they were not authorized
for and the basic attracted traffic to

90
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:49,400
Facebook and other websites that people
use regularly most recently in earlier

91
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:57,530
this year there was a Malaysian I say
that a lot of 36 is too little treat as

92
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:01,650
an interpreter and level 3 propagated
their information to the rest of their

93
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:09,670
network which basically told a lot of
the Internet traffic at major nice be

94
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:15,870
added complexity there was at least I
speak and I was so many prefixes that

95
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:22,150
they were basically running people off
of the level three runners to those

96
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:27,579
riders started to reboot and that's
created a lot of bad news on the

97
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:33,000
internet because latency and tragic was
going through because drugs are we

98
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:39,200
building and then most recently I think
about a month ago there was evidence of

99
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:47,320
commercial organization that lost access
to a server or network that was owned by

100
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:53,070
and is in that one out of business and
they decided to collaborate with I speak

101
00:10:53,070 --> 00:11:04,900
in country to announce the prefix of
that of that is in the end that's why

102
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:11,530
she decided to work with them if we see
more and more of that type of events and

103
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:17,770
I think of surveillance and really
addressed internet I don't think we can

104
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:21,630
benefit from seeing more of the type of
offense and that's why we're gonna talk

105
00:11:21,630 --> 00:11:30,560
more about BJP security and how to
secure p2p networks so in essence we

106
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,709
look at beach P it's a very real and
very simple protocol but it's also very

107
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:43,120
simple my intention simple by design
because if you ever have a problem

108
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,540
reaching the backbone of the internet
you don't want it to be too complex and

109
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:52,920
too complicated

110
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:58,819
wanted to be simple and flexible design
simple flexible you don't designed for

111
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:05,330
security and the reason for that if you
look at recently as security

112
00:12:05,330 --> 00:12:09,050
professionals we look at worst case
scenario look at BDP is he's not

113
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:11,339
authenticated and is able

114
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:22,570
we are able to manage the middle it but
in essence really very limited

115
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:28,630
denial of service attack against the BGP
router is possible that most is in order

116
00:12:28,630 --> 00:12:31,030
to have multiple BGP routers

117
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:37,279
multiple assistance to create

118
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:51,839
over a network issue but most of the
organizations that phone systems have

119
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:59,249
already built controls in it and need to
be in BGP itself then your product

120
00:12:59,249 --> 00:13:04,430
presentation which is also possible is
very easy to download and open source

121
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:11,769
PHP router instead of your own but it's
still difficult to get in is in to get

122
00:13:11,769 --> 00:13:17,110
access to link that basically allows you
to comment on our series against rather

123
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:21,899
you want to wait and then create a
pre-release relationship using the same

124
00:13:21,899 --> 00:13:27,139
IP address as an original router to
connect its regional peers there is a

125
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:34,149
lot of complexity and prerequisites to
exclude attack then there's a

126
00:13:34,149 --> 00:13:38,999
possibility of whatever you want to see
as a big service whether that's

127
00:13:38,999 --> 00:13:44,480
WS or Google or or is your or whatever

128
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:51,379
valuable service for an organization
using BGP hijacking now we have to know

129
00:13:51,379 --> 00:14:01,800
that everything is possible but not
everything is broken so I think there

130
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,359
should be another talk about how we
define risk you know how we work

131
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:11,120
risk but right now the most popular it
is still time for probability equals

132
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:17,939
risk there is

133
00:14:17,939 --> 00:14:23,329
probability of the attack saddam
describing but the impact was they

134
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:28,149
happen is huge not only in the short
term to directly involved parties which

135
00:14:28,149 --> 00:14:34,629
could be your employer and another party
or several since the ice piece that

136
00:14:34,629 --> 00:14:39,720
basically have to rebuild trust with
their with their peers but in general

137
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:47,739
the long-term testing testing the
internet mean a text that we're talking

138
00:14:47,739 --> 00:14:55,409
about when we talk about BGP route
hijacking wrote a jackie is where it is

139
00:14:55,409 --> 00:15:05,639
an honor analysis and I people if they
are not authorized for possible to do

140
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:12,209
that you could get their extra router
there definitely are rather securities

141
00:15:12,209 --> 00:15:17,429
or rather can get hacked at a certain
point most of the time when we see

142
00:15:17,429 --> 00:15:21,279
somebody getting getting access to a
rather is mostly true

143
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:28,739
management computer by collusion with
somebody at work said there is a little

144
00:15:28,739 --> 00:15:36,959
corner or by using it to compromise one
of those computers and then their access

145
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:45,098
to get access to router in injector out
there but like we saw with Italian

146
00:15:45,099 --> 00:15:51,579
example during my presentation collusion
is a very big thing there and i think is

147
00:15:51,579 --> 00:16:00,059
an owners should should be given to the
defined trust between the beer with

148
00:16:00,059 --> 00:16:07,728
writing this possible with the
technology I'm talking about labor

149
00:16:07,729 --> 00:16:12,229
exactly why we as an audience here in
this room today why do we care

150
00:16:12,229 --> 00:16:20,430
BGP I remember when I was starting in
network security back in

151
00:16:20,430 --> 00:16:28,620
in the late nineties I was supposed to
be people most of the network with the

152
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:33,850
GOP was it was based PC that the
territory of the CIA's of this world and

153
00:16:33,850 --> 00:16:40,390
nobody nobody would care but the truth
is that BGP foundational technology it's

154
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:47,560
equal to four me too generous as a
result ellis et you know technology that

155
00:16:47,560 --> 00:16:50,050
allows to use the internet as it is
today

156
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:57,709
problem is that we are expected to just
work for us but we have no liability

157
00:16:57,709 --> 00:17:02,939
with within the truck owners and just
workin depends on those is an honor sore

158
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:13,309
so we need to be able to to build an
internet that we can trust the most

159
00:17:13,309 --> 00:17:16,500
mind-boggling think that I discovered
when I was looking into BGP iBGP

160
00:17:16,500 --> 00:17:21,589
security in general is that there is
security technology that exists right

161
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:26,428
now and it's actually very easy to
implement but you don't see it's just

162
00:17:26,429 --> 00:17:31,350
that much one of the things that could
be considered is rather a publication we

163
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:39,790
talk about representation earlier and we
are strictly professional will simplify

164
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:46,510
simplify has been acting but it's better
than nothing right of drugs that are not

165
00:17:46,510 --> 00:17:51,840
keeping with each other it's much easier
to appreciate them then when they are

166
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:56,510
actually authenticating and it's very
complex to do a man in the military to

167
00:17:56,510 --> 00:18:05,280
get in the 55 dash so it's better than
doing nothing and then there is

168
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:06,889
something called

169
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:16,030
resource public infrastructure is
anybody familiar with our PK so we

170
00:18:16,030 --> 00:18:21,678
should we sort of structure basically is
technology that you very similar to is

171
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,330
jealous so yes yes in this case to see a
sword

172
00:18:25,330 --> 00:18:31,750
the regional internet registries we
provide certificates which allow owners

173
00:18:31,750 --> 00:18:39,260
to sign that people should they want to
announce the local or regional internet

174
00:18:39,260 --> 00:18:46,190
registries are ready to use to
technology all modern rugby technologies

175
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:54,390
are able to use archive edition in their
in their decision workflow there are

176
00:18:54,390 --> 00:19:01,120
open source and free for children are
PCI validators problem is a luxury and I

177
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:05,570
will have some states later for some
reason the network owners don't think

178
00:19:05,570 --> 00:19:16,360
almost always don't think there is
incentive to actually do this now for

179
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:22,189
security professionals and organizations
it's not only about your own

180
00:19:22,190 --> 00:19:27,870
infrastructure that is hosted on IP
networks it's also about third-party how

181
00:19:27,870 --> 00:19:35,570
ru services you wanna know that those
seasons are more like a cloud

182
00:19:35,570 --> 00:19:40,530
infrastructure is hosted on the duties
are not being hijacked I think

183
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:45,430
information and there are some examples
leader of tools that have been developed

184
00:19:45,430 --> 00:19:49,960
using BGP formation I think BJP
information is very valuable for a

185
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:59,070
perspective view 22 to rate in the
transit or connecting to to to know if

186
00:19:59,070 --> 00:20:04,139
the two parties are working with are
actually posted on reliable trusted

187
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:10,000
networks and then using BGP information
to see when hijackers appearing to be

188
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:18,090
able to react swiftly is very important
to know we can't do stats are sobering

189
00:20:18,090 --> 00:20:25,320
there is an RPI dashboards that is
freely available you see that less than

190
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,840
seven percent of the current ipv4 space
which is schiphol of

191
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:39,320
IP address is currently signed or has a
validation status there are three

192
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:49,370
possible for a tradition status can be
valid and invalid and no thanks peace

193
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:55,189
global level 77 percent of adoption of
the technology that is established that

194
00:20:55,190 --> 00:21:03,440
is known that can be used right now is
poor and she did my presentation i think

195
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:12,390
is owners can do more to adopt RPI much
faster now on a regional level you see

196
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:16,899
that it's still bored and I don't trust
the states in this light that much

197
00:21:16,899 --> 00:21:22,049
because you'll see for instance that
latin america is supposed to be the

198
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:25,570
leader in when it comes to tell about
the highest percentage appellate rights

199
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:33,590
but it also doesn't have that many
appearances right there on a per country

200
00:21:33,590 --> 00:21:42,449
level we're still in the top 24 but it
is preceded by who knows what the hell

201
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:55,539
DPD is no its Bangladesh so the leader
when it comes to implementation is

202
00:21:55,539 --> 00:22:00,700
Bangladesh's the moment followed by
France Holland and us' nobody below that

203
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:08,570
what is interesting to see when we look
at the top 500 which are basically the

204
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:14,820
top 500 used websites on the internet
only one of the top 10 most likely

205
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:19,809
addresses in science space at the moment
and as Facebook has nothing to do with

206
00:22:19,809 --> 00:22:24,120
Alex Thomas whose mission to secure
Internet but it's probably something

207
00:22:24,120 --> 00:22:25,030
he's

208
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:30,330
thankful for that he doesn't have a
dress that will be great then there's

209
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:37,270
the top 500 only sixteen of the top 500
websites are hosted in science space at

210
00:22:37,270 --> 00:22:49,629
the moment that is if you look at PGP as
the bombing of the internet that most

211
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:56,150
most of the top 500 websites are hosted
in untrusted on Science space photo of

212
00:22:56,150 --> 00:23:00,440
the sixty are owned by Facebook their
main site and their CD for all the

213
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:07,450
videos and pictures as you watch all the
pictures that some people here post on

214
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:14,550
my time so most most of the websites
that are inside space outside of the

215
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:23,710
space and you remember from decided when
we see it most of the assumption is that

216
00:23:23,710 --> 00:23:30,220
the Eagles us' there there's no real way
to see it to say what you will

217
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:39,650
constitute on the internet so we come
back to the Internet is doing the right

218
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:48,330
things however our device owners and
service owners to adopt RPI first thing

219
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:58,330
is to understand RPA RPU I like I said
the regional registries will assign

220
00:23:58,330 --> 00:24:05,689
certificates to network owners and allow
them to sign the IP prefixes that they

221
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:07,520
are allowed to

222
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:15,000
to announce that includes not just a
prefix also the maximum length for

223
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:27,270
optimizing business briefings are often
but in smaller chunks right and our way

224
00:24:27,270 --> 00:24:36,820
toward perot original at the station
says that this is it or I can proceed

225
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:43,060
said I want to announce and this is the
maximum length between there will be

226
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:50,540
allowed so is as is an owner's request
of those are always from the regional

227
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:55,000
internet registries and then something
like this goes on so you see in this

228
00:24:55,000 --> 00:25:01,830
picture that s 10 tree certainly
announces they're not end of 10 / 24

229
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:10,350
which is a more specific subsets of the
1000 1000 / 16 and I'm gonna switch

230
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:16,020
between the state and the next light a
lil bit so this are very good or owners

231
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:25,700
is what we will see I ever out to 10 of
10 / 24 because there is a trust

232
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:34,650
relationship between 13 and 10 2012 will
be court that recorded announcements and

233
00:25:34,650 --> 00:25:42,530
start driving traffic to is one of three
however when RBIs implemented are one or

234
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:46,480
two will talk to its internal validator
or public validated that is available

235
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:51,250
and we'll ask if one reason for the rise
to another prison city just-announced

236
00:25:51,250 --> 00:25:56,360
the validated will see no it isn't

237
00:25:56,360 --> 00:26:03,120
and then is still do whatever they want
they will know the validation state and

238
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:07,139
introduce the validation state as an
additional decision in the routing

239
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:13,630
policies and that's where r PCI allows
is to create different levels of trust

240
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:17,940
with their peers you can appears that
you have a longstanding relationship

241
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:26,200
with shared a sentence with that where
you see an accidental validated route

242
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:30,580
that you can still accept it but when
you start working within New he's in may

243
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:35,449
be out of region that you you're not
familiar with trusting you can restrict

244
00:26:35,450 --> 00:26:40,700
rugged policies and basically see if
they are no longer bro I will I will

245
00:26:40,700 --> 00:26:51,790
drop it in years so we talk about our
plans elevator and for once and have

246
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:57,320
worked in different areas insecurity
that have the same problem but for once

247
00:26:57,320 --> 00:27:02,299
we're not looking at different vendors
trying to set different standards for a

248
00:27:02,299 --> 00:27:07,059
certain technology there is an open
source are credited is available right

249
00:27:07,059 --> 00:27:12,549
now we're not looking at the big winner
its people the people that run the

250
00:27:12,549 --> 00:27:18,250
internets game came with solution and it
was very well if you actually

251
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:24,240
implemented it's obviously a district in
less than 15 minutes the only downside

252
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:33,150
is required of us you can do about it
since it opened for the invite anybody

253
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:39,100
that's interested to collaborate on
reading or not banja versions and happy

254
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:44,889
to work on that as well but for the time
being we have to live with

255
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:50,140
Java said they would probably rather to
use of elevator and they are basically

256
00:27:50,140 --> 00:27:58,490
done from their own just configuring
routing policies no monetary

257
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:06,250
weirder out the commercial solutions
from BJP monitoring tools that are

258
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:14,000
commercial where you basically enter the
IP prefixes that you want to monitor

259
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,120
cambiaron but they can also be

260
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:21,860
IP prefixes of services that you are
depending on when they will get a ritual

261
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:27,159
get an you'll get a BGP does port will
be scheduled Patricia each from a

262
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:31,280
commercial organization but during my
research I stumbled across the

263
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:38,450
University of Colorado and I was very
confusing the best commercial technology

264
00:28:38,450 --> 00:28:44,490
for b2b monetary also called but people
in which you're not very creative people

265
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:54,250
so the best open source solution is also
hope to the people at the University of

266
00:28:54,250 --> 00:29:00,660
Colorado DPM with different reasons and
basic get running a bit from from from

267
00:29:00,660 --> 00:29:09,380
those from those days since they provide
the support they also provide open

268
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:14,870
source PHP monitoring software download
install your own infrastructure to do

269
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:17,870
analysis of relying on

270
00:29:17,870 --> 00:29:27,659
on the service and then there is like
BGP service where you basically get in

271
00:29:27,660 --> 00:29:29,100
real time

272
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:34,919
external feeds that the extract from
drugging of these days i think is very

273
00:29:34,920 --> 00:29:41,200
good service assurance is that is
interested in creating an open source or

274
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:48,960
collaborating with an open source and
active PHP monitoring service then I

275
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:52,410
would strongly suggest you get in touch
with the people at University of

276
00:29:52,410 --> 00:30:03,740
Colorado to do that now from both
commercial organizations don't don't

277
00:30:03,740 --> 00:30:13,730
have and how they can use technology but
a very good example that I've come

278
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:19,200
across is initiative by bicycle and I
didn't know I had a long history with

279
00:30:19,200 --> 00:30:24,650
circle but I think that for for a second
recession certainly basically the

280
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:28,360
computer incident response center of
Luxembourg and he created the page

281
00:30:28,360 --> 00:30:35,870
ranking it's also desperate you can
consult on their websites can also be

282
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:40,489
downloaded even use it at your own risk
intelligence needs what initially do is

283
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:46,500
take information basically which is and
so on which prefixes and they correlated

284
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:53,650
with permission from for instance the
sensual public service then older

285
00:30:53,650 --> 00:30:59,340
Association blackness and they look at
all the banners ads on the internet

286
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:04,470
co-leader IP addresses that are they
drive from those indicators of

287
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:09,700
compromise and then basically ready two
different seasons and David different

288
00:31:09,700 --> 00:31:11,410
interesting pictures

289
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:18,930
like this one so you know for the past
year we've all been yelling China China

290
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:26,650
China whenever something happens if you
look purely at PGP ranking data the most

291
00:31:26,650 --> 00:31:33,380
of any countries on the on the internet
or Russia you see Poland as well

292
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:39,330
the USA and Brazil China purity in a
number of the host and the madness that

293
00:31:39,330 --> 00:31:44,679
is trying to on those publicly known on
those networks they are not doing that

294
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:54,870
bad one caveat is that the two top two
of Asia's top two are two agency is in a

295
00:31:54,870 --> 00:32:06,159
sense to win when we asked you and not
improper operation might not be looking

296
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:10,740
at the right data so in this map China
looks good and that's funny because we

297
00:32:10,740 --> 00:32:19,370
always talk about China being the bad
actor but you can basically used to do

298
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:27,870
other things that are very before you
write again that would be writing 232

299
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:33,500
complement that with IP or be repeated
at you have actually create intelligence

300
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:39,220
for yourself to me maybe a big thing is
don't don't rely on somebody telling you

301
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:42,760
which date is important you try to get
as much data as you can in the right

302
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:50,500
foot is calling for you from there the
other day technology services that

303
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:55,880
positions can use to monitor BGP

304
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:56,880
hurricane electric

305
00:32:56,880 --> 00:33:07,470
provides research which allows you to
look at the relationship between which

306
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:15,020
which IP prefixes the use and which is
very useful then there are like I'm

307
00:33:15,020 --> 00:33:22,330
single and I don't know any rights but
they are an independent survey of

308
00:33:22,330 --> 00:33:28,080
scooper officials basically that also
provide more information about BGP

309
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:33,120
on their websites and then obviously I
think there is one one valuable

310
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:44,250
commercial solution that that you could
which is now in conclusion

311
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:51,740
again i think is important for everybody
it's not just let reporters it's about

312
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:57,510
us as professionals to create trust in
the internets and we should look at BJP

313
00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:03,590
on a much deeper level instead of
extracting it away we have to look

314
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:09,049
beyond directing centers in any system
that has multiple players incentives

315
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:14,120
will not always be nice but it is also
doing the right thing if we want to

316
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:19,668
create a trusted internet we look beyond
those direct incentives and look at

317
00:34:19,668 --> 00:34:24,299
doing the right thing and doing it at
the most efficient motion efficient way

318
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:29,149
together so we don't but RPI how it
works

319
00:34:29,149 --> 00:34:34,460
technology is available from is that
we're not using it so we should

320
00:34:34,460 --> 00:34:42,020
definitely try to see more RPG adoption
in the next few months years right

321
00:34:42,020 --> 00:34:50,739
currently estimates about 7 percent
reduction in space right now

322
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:57,879
they are projecting 50% adoption of RPI
by 2020 I'm an ideal is but I think we

323
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:03,960
can do better than it so I'm I will be
monitoring for adoption after the start

324
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:13,200
I don't hold much hope but I need
something to lift her husband police

325
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:20,970
let's work together to make this happen
I hope I never britain at the station

326
00:35:20,970 --> 00:35:26,270
talk about something that's the end of
things like to think that be standing on

327
00:35:26,270 --> 00:35:31,550
C talk about something is beginning of
something and actually do this together

328
00:35:31,550 --> 00:35:37,740
to make a better and more reliable
internet thank you very much for your

329
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:57,490
attention and if there are any questions

330
00:35:57,490 --> 00:37:01,419
hers to talk to one goes down

331
00:37:01,420 --> 00:37:31,180
available

332
00:37:31,180 --> 00:37:56,140
so everything's all these additional
metrics to how you doing your writing

333
00:37:56,140 --> 00:38:10,118
and writing papers written as both left
and then there was no direct impact on

334
00:38:10,119 --> 00:38:15,660
the identity should do about that
addition is that it's an additional step

335
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,848
that people can whistle

336
00:38:17,849 --> 00:38:20,930
point of information people can use in
their running towards him from the

337
00:38:20,930 --> 00:38:32,109
digits are applicable when when you look
into the policies in itself will not

338
00:38:32,109 --> 00:38:39,098
change anything about but it allows us
to be more specific in their policies

339
00:38:39,099 --> 00:38:51,279
and in this work with important and once
the adoption starts to race over 148

340
00:38:51,279 --> 00:39:04,229
television information into their so
it's my understanding our PJs has kind

341
00:39:04,229 --> 00:39:08,939
of led to the top of PGT security
solutions seems to have the bigger bang

342
00:39:08,939 --> 00:39:15,928
for the buck but I know a several years
ago there was the GPC is that just

343
00:39:15,929 --> 00:39:21,429
moving along more slowly or as effect
that are PKI provides more security

344
00:39:21,429 --> 00:39:28,319
benefits or easier implementation i
think is if he did he's in addition and

345
00:39:28,319 --> 00:39:36,869
the fact that it provides more US goods
in the BBC which they did there has been

346
00:39:36,869 --> 00:39:44,279
a competition between different centers
like to see BGC carpet you I only have

347
00:39:44,279 --> 00:39:52,439
ourselves is that we have seen four aces
in what we look at clock management

348
00:39:52,439 --> 00:39:58,439
different vendors have been badly on the
standard for performance we have not

349
00:39:58,439 --> 00:40:08,899
seen that in an open source validator
for RPI how many of the commercial tools

350
00:40:08,900 --> 00:40:12,949
have their have implemented validators
like solar wind or other network

351
00:40:12,949 --> 00:40:22,380
management tools actually I'm aware of
the right people are getting ready to

352
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:24,230
but I'm not aware of any

353
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:31,580
commercial

354
00:40:31,580 --> 00:40:39,480
extra level of complexity for doing a
solution for LEP problem so the best

355
00:40:39,480 --> 00:40:44,350
practice on security should be keep it
stupid and simple adding became a

356
00:40:44,350 --> 00:40:51,190
structure that couldn't be possible to
open an extra tax office on IP services

357
00:40:51,190 --> 00:40:56,100
reputation services taking over the lead
a task injecting mob exploiting this

358
00:40:56,100 --> 00:41:04,859
stuff and complexity to need to be
solved because it's good if you block

359
00:41:04,859 --> 00:41:10,400
Morgan hoppy GDP and you're running and
take care of your photo lists and you

360
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:20,119
are accepted so 221 a strictly GP's up
so that's a very good question and I'm

361
00:41:20,119 --> 00:41:32,320
very very much for example every city
right now there is no network liability

362
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:37,950
it's very hard to play somebody for
something that was wrong on the BJP

363
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:40,520
level that says

364
00:41:40,520 --> 00:42:02,890
RBI for BP's to the standard issues key
management rollover exploration private

365
00:42:02,890 --> 00:42:07,700
keys or its get stolen to reset it I
have the whole issue of distributing its

366
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:17,189
organizing across entire Internet has
been thought through a true solutions

367
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:21,820
that are available right now is that the
keys are not set to metropolitan cells

368
00:42:21,820 --> 00:42:29,130
originally registries managing the keys
and providing an interface to the

369
00:42:29,130 --> 00:42:38,570
network owners to design their design
your perfect its benefit of over

370
00:42:38,570 --> 00:42:48,840
France's you're not dealing with a bunch
of 11 hundreds of commercial

371
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:55,360
we're just looking at the regional
interests as

372
00:42:55,360 --> 00:43:10,540
so managed by the regional internet
registries a rule I'm thinking I can get

373
00:43:10,540 --> 00:43:15,310
a new generator new private keys

374
00:43:15,310 --> 00:43:30,660
propagate that to the rest of the
problem he never gives partition the old

375
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:56,420
ones with our competitiveness so I don't
have his purpose of minor issues still

376
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:02,330
where I mentioned earlier that you can
read different levels of trust so if you

377
00:44:02,330 --> 00:44:08,420
have to depend on or is it already to
depend on other high-level drug policies

378
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:23,050
so very vicious latest is not an offer
of securities that russia now says he

379
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:26,119
can still allowed us to prepare based on
your own

380
00:44:26,119 --> 00:44:36,390
wrote in this issue for the YouTube
hijacking example was the attacker able

381
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:42,990
to compromise credentials or what's the
extent of the compromise today very very

382
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:51,519
difficult to estimate the announcement
we have to delete this was a number of

383
00:44:51,519 --> 00:44:52,118
issues

384
00:44:52,119 --> 00:44:59,289
hijacking situation we were looking to
to limit access to YouTube on the

385
00:44:59,289 --> 00:45:08,559
Pakistani right at the time that they
started announcing the precious they had

386
00:45:08,559 --> 00:45:13,329
access to all the traffic to do sweet
success in whatever they did with this

387
00:45:13,329 --> 00:45:19,390
anybody gets very very difficult to
determine what it was but it's assumed

388
00:45:19,390 --> 00:45:32,020
it was not intentional

389
00:45:32,020 --> 00:45:52,810
the latest one china was tight because
the traffic will go further eroding

390
00:45:52,810 --> 00:45:56,549
China example the garage addressed to
today

391
00:45:56,550 --> 00:46:09,240
destination so there was a full men in
the middle with the implementation

392
00:46:09,240 --> 00:46:15,830
talking about is there a way to
determine that either whatever route

393
00:46:15,830 --> 00:46:22,040
you're taking is fully supporting our
PKI or

394
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:28,470
and make a determination on that within
the software no snow

395
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:36,259
validated Europe amputees and parties
are kept by 1 person is not doing it did

396
00:46:36,260 --> 00:46:49,380
you know they're vulnerable to this

397
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:52,090
thank you very much and I hope you enjoy
decision
