anything and a lot of people they

16
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:33,400
couldn't go in there so you could
actually left down there now this is the

17
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:42,440
first year thirty years ago inside the
doors open it up and let people see you

18
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:57,069

with two black or navy and black people

20
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:24,830

21
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:33,099
ok we're not gonna do anything different

22
00:04:33,099 --> 00:04:37,020

23
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:56,378

24
00:04:56,379 --> 00:05:34,990

actual the network D winning 13 we

25
00:05:34,990 --> 00:05:41,930
actually have oc- are all the companies
they volunteer their time their all in

26
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:42,969
tears

27
00:05:42,969 --> 00:05:54,360
volunteering where is one of the most
part in the World Series guy and I think

28
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:00,840
you should just go to a change in the
leash somebody teaches you something

29
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:12,849
really cool media in China Christmas
afternoon they had all those nuclear and

30
00:06:12,849 --> 00:06:24,719
so we see that in mind we walk to figure
out why not

31
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:34,740
for the most part we just need we don't
go in there and start doing things you

32
00:06:34,740 --> 00:06:38,400
know that a major

33
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:44,419
free to do whatever you want to do on a
network within reason we also can say

34
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:51,640
that it is malicious is actually
delicious I don't want to be the guy who

35
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,830
decided I guess I see something
happening I'm gonna shut it down

36
00:06:55,830 --> 00:07:00,440
perpetuating the demo somebody's up on
stage

37
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:21,340
well you know it worked before now all
of these 21 individuals they they come

38
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:30,150
from all over the country and help a man
who it is yet to come here

39
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:45,150
health at work match heated up you guys
understand that

40
00:07:45,150 --> 00:08:03,609
how much these people helping out there
taking personal they come here and they

41
00:08:03,610 --> 00:08:30,460
say in a dark room and listen to too
much while she's a pretty cool

42
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:47,329
each other with duct tape wire

43
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:59,710
we're talking to Travis remember when I
used to run the whole release

44
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:15,480
well we should do it for three years or
so that doesn't really do something

45
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:27,209
different he wrote these where he would
be running

46
00:09:27,209 --> 00:09:34,779
lets the ability to partner with us help
us out of our day jobs Malaysia for

47
00:09:34,779 --> 00:09:54,189
enhancing the year there will be renewed
year wow yeah they did you say like to

48
00:09:54,189 --> 00:10:07,540
hear how their movies both sit with us
in the exact figures out how is he going

49
00:10:07,540 --> 00:10:33,529
down there we go through their board
while providing all the wire page is all

50
00:10:33,529 --> 00:10:48,319
this with our first century 21 game
engine and leave a residual everything

51
00:10:48,319 --> 00:10:51,680
dander

52
00:10:51,680 --> 00:11:04,250
initially bility so we've got you know
based on their terrible but imagine

53
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:27,720
active you guys ok held up to you I
think you're doing all we know that

54
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:56,640
there they just come forward it that's a
no no we don't know what it is that they

55
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:12,370
like and so we were getting him out of
there is why I was looking to go over

56
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:21,850
over around this room who is this

57
00:12:21,850 --> 00:12:36,220
yes ok I know you know

58
00:12:36,220 --> 00:13:03,100
they do now about what goes on there
next time so as you see here to see what

59
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:17,390
he deserves to do this again next year
so that might be used along with all the

60
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:41,020
things we are both

61
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:54,360
they did so we service our beautiful in
the service that we use our game June 12

62
00:13:54,360 --> 00:14:00,360
century under the door one goes to
Sunnyvale totally redundant so on and he

63
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:09,150
said too much traffic out there I still
gotta get down when we go in there we

64
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:14,600
got a fifteen hundred be so this is a
decent sized boxes had any enterprise

65
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:25,530
Greek white box that you can use we have
one here or accession throughput

66
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:26,530
etcetera

67
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:32,949
we go to an area that we obviously
segmentation segmentation segmentation

68
00:14:32,950 --> 00:14:41,370
made a date you know that's a patient
may provide the backbone across all the

69
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:45,830
fires basically what they're doing is
just passing through those rooms in

70
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:49,580
their recent things that may change
going forward I won't give away those

71
00:14:49,580 --> 00:15:02,530
secret because as you can see here we
got the registration at one that sets my

72
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:09,500
heart you're looking at me and it's
really bad they're so protect

73
00:15:09,500 --> 00:15:13,230
registration as much as possible for
other reasons as well you're going to

74
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:16,080
get there who've been here

75
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:25,130
news stories about people losing data so
we protect registration to put that on

76
00:15:25,130 --> 00:15:36,990
the registration hour to complete
everything happens there you guys think

77
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:39,529
that bad

78
00:15:39,529 --> 00:15:50,749
have on-site registration and that they
were here comes up we got there so it

79
00:15:50,749 --> 00:15:57,569
may be noted that I've got attacked me
when I say that I may pull out the

80
00:15:57,569 --> 00:16:02,579
wizard hax years trying to another
provider to have you seen that there is

81
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:09,870
an architect is with even more from so
harsh I but we got to the lab they get

82
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:17,050
all their eighties there between ever we
also have a SPAN port out there so we

83
00:16:17,050 --> 00:16:24,589
can see all the traffic flow and then we
also have connected to their device the

84
00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:27,449
wireless controller so we can see how
you doing

85
00:16:27,449 --> 00:16:41,079
attractive etcetera over the middle
range their minds to get another 1,500

86
00:16:41,079 --> 00:16:43,589
you get sacked and Justin the wireless
controller

87
00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:50,720
1500 be the top of the gateway to the
two hundred feet down just makes me hate

88
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,819
organized during the raucous again

89
00:16:56,819 --> 00:17:10,839
Wireless PCs and may show show and then
we're going to rate we have

90
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:18,790
that we can push all the trash tuned for
our tools that are just some of the

91
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:53,250
tools now so many people on this plane
but this is he open source software was

92
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:58,070
created by the way to showing a crack
house

93
00:17:58,070 --> 00:18:06,270
what's going on ABC some of those areas
white house dance track in there and

94
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:24,090
when we see that it's here where are
really like ok you know why do something

95
00:18:24,090 --> 00:18:31,100
and so when I will look at all of our
other visuals and that that figure out

96
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:52,310
what it is that were also we like a
street gang and we'll set up a lead for

97
00:18:52,310 --> 00:19:01,450
each one of those 35 or bigger rooms
registration show all of those things so

98
00:19:01,450 --> 00:19:06,290
we can watch everything going on
throughout the convention space all in

99
00:19:06,290 --> 00:19:18,600
one place and see how things would be
very bad for their processes so what

100
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:24,219
we're doing is we're keeping an eye on
it we're looking for at least there's no

101
00:19:24,220 --> 00:19:31,700
yellow orange and ok we're running out
and there are some of the pain that out

102
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:46,910
to drop by drop whatever it is that why
when we get 553

103
00:19:46,910 --> 00:19:57,710
be on the weekend and weekdays and they
all require this way for them to make

104
00:19:57,710 --> 00:20:04,150
sure they said all that stuff

105
00:20:04,150 --> 00:20:12,780
so we take all of those foreigners and
we put them all together you know

106
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:17,460
exactly what everybody'd so we do have
to go out there and do additional place

107
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:39,000
you know what it means for you so bad
memory bandwidth sessions this is for

108
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:44,460
the past seven nation army said that the
beginning and we didn't have much looks

109
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:54,680
like you guys pay down so that was
Monday that was new training courses so

110
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:59,620
when you see that a go at this release
friday was a new name trainings we had

111
00:20:59,620 --> 00:21:11,399
people downloading the tools down so
that's not a big surprise today to

112
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:18,920
announce I would say so they're just a
quick view of the nation's is for you

113
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:25,360
but i wanna say this is this is very
important role in somebody else's

114
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:32,189
question when it happens at the end

115
00:21:32,190 --> 00:21:59,809
so I don't think that this was all
volunteers we have so that our team that

116
00:21:59,809 --> 00:22:05,678
matters see directing traffic

117
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:12,320
they're going to put everything in your
beautiful banks were you have an xbox

118
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:29,019
live next door to knock and the show so
we had to get xbox live there in 2010

119
00:22:29,019 --> 00:22:35,690
came down the day before I'm sure people
just connecting it is that the next day

120
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:57,639
it is so bad weather here to show you
this one of the things that you didn't

121
00:22:57,639 --> 00:22:58,809
always happen

122
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:06,210
packages surprise for you probably 80%
the track at this hour show you and the

123
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:11,600
other side we were doing what they're
supposed to do

124
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:20,600
everybody your pat yourself a pat on the
back

125
00:23:20,600 --> 00:23:44,219
down so obviously DNS DNS requests like
i shd i say this is an interesting

126
00:23:44,220 --> 00:23:57,480
things or our or our website where our
request for advertising sites so that

127
00:23:57,480 --> 00:24:04,850
says something about today doing it
correctly during the day Mr this but

128
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:18,129
four of the top five sites there were so
many by patsy Cline through here the

129
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:30,330
interesting thing about this right now
for trainees so it was taken yes there's

130
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:40,139
nobody that I see so little surprise for
everybody is infected it seems like a

131
00:24:40,140 --> 00:25:05,260
sluggish 34 things like that where you
are either going down

132
00:25:05,260 --> 00:25:17,170
so we actually opened up a DVD system
this year made for the transfer to other

133
00:25:17,170 --> 00:25:22,110
people here that we use it internally as
well

134
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:28,729
the actual innocence and trainers this
was trying to take out the middleman so

135
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:35,080
in the past to go out the Holy find
somebody you just post up a volunteer

136
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:39,830
outside every room basically you
gradually really quick thoughts on the

137
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:44,870
radio and we've used much as possible if
I am going obviously that way we try to

138
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:50,060
speed things up a little bit I wouldn't
commit to this point but we're

139
00:25:50,060 --> 00:25:54,290
definitely trying to speed things up and
make this process a lot smoother

140
00:25:54,290 --> 00:26:00,340
pressured by me because it only affects
you guys as well as the trainers are

141
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:17,010
really involved that I'm just sitting
there so the city held out for a

142
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:30,320
stranger that is right out of this state
back down there's a bunch of old

143
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:40,629
everywhere we want to get the death we
got him back so anybody or email us out

144
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:56,680
so easy it's all to the side and the
package is determined by earth he

145
00:26:56,680 --> 00:27:02,600
decided I'd determined by the size of
the package and then the color red

146
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:07,580
yellow RTC ICMP etcetera

147
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:10,960
so that it was terrible

148
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:21,539
just somebody artifact from down there
so that's going on there but it's just a

149
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:25,470
quick visual indicator you can see when
something was up you can see my post

150
00:27:25,470 --> 00:27:39,559
start scanning everybody everybody so
it's just a quick video but we're not in

151
00:27:39,559 --> 00:28:04,080
the morning and all the stuff is nothing
going on in this he just like what is

152
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,870
that where they're coming from

153
00:28:05,870 --> 00:28:24,719
look it up this one I go into the air
and there's a deuce in their lives

154
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:30,370
around

155
00:28:30,370 --> 00:28:55,919
from your house is like having too much
stuff class alright so it's just visited

156
00:28:55,920 --> 00:29:00,400
immediate visual indicator that
something is going on and we say oK

157
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:09,179
what's happening here this year more
everybody seems to be ok with that as

158
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:17,470
far as for worked out in the past just
like somebody you know a good chunk of

159
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:20,330
the man we go hunting down please

160
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:40,590
even this year on certain things you
don't really care about their just helps

161
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:59,300
us on the Mandalay Bay wifi that seem to
be brought about ya so they still runs

162
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:07,340
there were there when sorting out where
he would see some of us the raucous

163
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:16,110
2015 Xavier's us and any training
courses so they don't want anything out

164
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:22,360
there these ordinary stuff telling us
that we give you free

165
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:47,199
be over here anywhere you it would lend
you the city is just flying around in a

166
00:30:47,200 --> 00:31:02,890
way I know how we should say that the
man died here even when he drops Erie

167
00:31:02,890 --> 00:31:13,290
drop there are no use for now but you
never know what's gonna happen and you

168
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:24,250
know this is going on in this is gone
and so so we had to talk about alleged

169
00:31:24,250 --> 00:31:35,130
in the description I am trying to talk
to people about you know what we're

170
00:31:35,130 --> 00:31:39,540
doing the network security

171
00:31:39,540 --> 00:31:49,060
lot of people in this room are doing a
lot of doing it because he's so you know

172
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:52,899
it here

173
00:31:52,899 --> 00:32:40,738
learn something new here so here we are
working with those years there so we had

174
00:32:40,739 --> 00:32:47,320
a relationship there or it will
understand what we're doing to

175
00:32:47,320 --> 00:33:04,100
accomplish their security how about
learning things in there yet

176
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:14,809
we so that the year

177
00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:39,460
yes so they have to be like the top of
their thing they also do the network

178
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:52,320
that Utah Salt Lake City and that's
where we're probably have and then yes

179
00:33:52,320 --> 00:34:11,060
he says that's where we're also city so
we know that these other folks who

180
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:37,149
joined the team over time those students
the others are just came up there

181
00:34:37,149 --> 00:35:26,660
we have work but mostly on the nation's
so that that's a tricky thing because

182
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:34,020
the train was a solution so you're
sitting next to the guy who did the

183
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:38,079
human interaction in our future much
grief so we had to be done over

184
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:45,770
obviously the tree because the trainers
way there I so whenever you doin

185
00:35:45,770 --> 00:35:49,200
wireless network

186
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:58,788
reaction host isolation raucous actually
got a large taxes are necessary cool

187
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:12,809
stuff but they can do i isolate users
into and so does reduce attack surface

188
00:36:12,809 --> 00:36:23,240
but made on the wireless just got social
and other crazy training courses there's

189
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:38,118
no posts isolation in the classroom but

190
00:36:38,119 --> 00:36:47,759
so wanted the network between tap for
spam ports now flow or just regular old

191
00:36:47,759 --> 00:36:53,749
S&P they all have their place absolutely
everything every true deserves a

192
00:36:53,749 --> 00:37:15,439
different perspective we have we have
all that we're using a spare one brings

193
00:37:15,440 --> 00:38:14,960
knowledge of the network or on the time
we start we got here Thursday that he

194
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:17,500
say when

195
00:38:17,500 --> 00:38:40,930
myself everybody empower you don't know
who I can't see everybody but we

196
00:38:40,930 --> 00:39:08,529
wouldn't be sitting here for those guys
all say that they are so many women also

197
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:18,070
boxes we started two months in advance
clean your hands full so Fox helping

198
00:39:18,070 --> 00:39:27,160
cases this year we started about a month
out a little shorter than I wanted to

199
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:32,009
there's some things that we we have
reported that they had to do their thing

200
00:39:32,010 --> 00:39:39,400
issues can you tell me my wife is very
happy about that are driving down to the

201
00:39:39,400 --> 00:40:03,910
hackerspace you must get together we

style I just waiting and then get on

203

morning it they set up so that we can

204
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:33,150
start Friday morning but I would say
that takes a good month or two before

205
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:48,599
the show star design and everything for
the show so sorry for doing the network

206
00:40:48,599 --> 00:41:00,920
show or we go we're at where we were
going to partner with who was you know

207
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:09,400
or I would have made you missing your
all of that started before the ages show

208
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:41,289
so where we have no water or power call
so we could not rest of our life is

209
00:41:41,289 --> 00:41:49,020
already happened call this Jeremy yeah

210
00:41:49,020 --> 00:42:24,200
guys they need to know where you got the
company you know why people are getting

211
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:29,759
Thursday early days of the afternoon and
then we start staging everything out

212
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:43,610
soon morning we go to sleep down here

213
00:42:43,610 --> 00:44:05,110
so right now there are ppl you know so
community-wide huge black with black

214
00:44:05,110 --> 00:44:22,960
guys are also

215
00:44:22,960 --> 00:45:03,330
it still costs a lot to organize and
collectively have in mind it's a busy at

216
00:45:03,330 --> 00:45:12,420
the end of the day we all started over
this but there is a significant helps

217
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:14,140
keep me going

218
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:30,529
contact going well United are you know
thanks

219
00:45:30,530 --> 00:45:39,940
out today this was a really weird year
volume attacks against each other was

220
00:45:39,940 --> 00:45:47,000
really high heat transfer people
dropping you at ease around the space

221
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:55,910
was high activity taking shots at our
registration at work again like we had

222
00:45:55,910 --> 00:45:58,910
everything you could possibly imagine

223
00:45:58,910 --> 00:46:20,160
was going on this during the show and
it's just where literally every way

224
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:30,170
they come hard so I think the biggest
thing is like people want to lie I know

225
00:46:30,170 --> 00:46:43,339
we had a bunch of people who want even
prices or security you stand there

226
00:46:43,339 --> 00:46:59,119
looking down right here so worried the
day I'm not just anybody who was a party

227
00:46:59,119 --> 00:47:25,029
or whatever is easier to manage to do
something really we wouldn't be here

228
00:47:25,029 --> 00:47:31,069
would you define really bad job you see
will take reaction my biggest concern is

229
00:47:31,069 --> 00:47:36,299
keeping a network of something really
bad happened that I couldn't work out

230
00:47:36,299 --> 00:47:50,940
right button to you guys say we
obviously know what they're doing a lot

231
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:56,339
of cases like something

232
00:47:56,339 --> 00:48:09,380
I was dropping you and you know it was
just a very again we see each other like

233
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:16,249
they were watching these things happen
where what happens is you know there's

234
00:48:16,249 --> 00:48:23,118
only so much he knew about that you know
that are in the lab Jamie delicious will

235
00:48:23,119 --> 00:49:02,069
know where you go you know and then go
back fast you're not using it wasn't

236
00:49:02,069 --> 00:49:07,400
because it was the early class the gym
and sending payloads into their work

237
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:16,660
they did they laughed after they were
sending payloads are difficult and we

238
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:18,078
just had enough

239
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:30,119
somebody's train now we have something
we just let it go well

240
00:49:30,119 --> 00:49:52,599
go out there so we had to do was so that
it was an attack but obviously be four

241
00:49:52,599 --> 00:50:08,460
say I get one example if there had been
no where else network that these not

242
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:18,499
like any way shape or form including
they're really good so when you try to

243
00:50:18,499 --> 00:50:30,359
go tell her you think you're gonna leave
you know some guy leaders dragging out

244
00:50:30,359 --> 00:50:38,940
the death never to be heard from again
so yeah there they have good you know

245
00:50:38,940 --> 00:51:07,809
they're hardly what can happen tell you
know what I say I think that because

246
00:51:07,809 --> 00:51:28,549
they're here again there are 16
different contests where you can go and

247
00:51:28,549 --> 00:51:31,980
take the skills you have fired and
something to maybe get it

248
00:51:31,980 --> 00:51:37,980
like who are you something shiny

249
00:51:37,980 --> 00:51:45,160
dollar and so you there there's a war
going and doing things here you have

250
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:52,200
each other we're we're not we don't have
a way to contact here

251
00:51:52,200 --> 00:52:03,399
lack of focus those new tricks and our
profession so this is your very good at

252
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:23,500
getting better at it every day so do we
have any special considerations for

253
00:52:23,500 --> 00:52:32,109
white so we have this conversation with
both for that because providing wireless

254
00:52:32,109 --> 00:52:48,950
so we had chatted for a little bit you
can use on your wireless network at 408

255
00:52:48,950 --> 00:52:50,299
you should stand out

256
00:52:50,300 --> 00:52:54,730
push use in a soda

257
00:52:54,730 --> 00:53:04,970
that way but gotta push to get some of
these machines like a shower just now to

258
00:53:04,970 --> 00:53:19,790
find out about it on Twitter so so we
certainly have whether I wanted to use

259
00:53:19,790 --> 00:53:28,700
all that kind of stuff but we didn't
want to piss you guys know we think

260
00:53:28,700 --> 00:53:37,129
about all of this and we're working on
this thinking about how so

261
00:53:37,130 --> 00:53:52,490
so we actually a little bit or do you
appreciate the most secure the most

262
00:53:52,490 --> 00:53:58,979
secure way about that kind of stuff so
it's so that one that we had to come up

263
00:53:58,980 --> 00:54:15,890
with and we work around that he said
yeah I know why should I buy you should

264
00:54:15,890 --> 00:54:23,720
consider that your Starbucks so

265
00:54:23,720 --> 00:54:37,459
so it all depends on what we've had
conversations we talk about what to do

266
00:54:37,460 --> 00:54:45,040
and what kind of person you can do there
were two other chefs user experience and

267
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:55,980
so that everybody has had a city get
pushed around with genes and we were

268
00:54:55,980 --> 00:55:22,510
happy we are releasing certain
situations but we have any protection so

269
00:55:22,510 --> 00:55:34,170
we've got a few things that we could do
that but it's not as simple as you're

270
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:39,619
staying overnight in paradise in a week
later I feel like going there is room

271
00:55:39,619 --> 00:55:43,790
each inning I will tell you that mandate
does as well

272
00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:49,119
to protect their network and we do some
of well but didn't see too much that is

273
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:53,970
the access point from the Florida guy

274
00:55:53,970 --> 00:56:25,209
so I said it's just the amount of you
guys are you really are we were both you

275
00:56:25,210 --> 00:56:32,470
know we've been telling people about
what we're doing and I was really

276
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:41,000
surprised to get this far and that you
see you know he's looking towards guys

277
00:56:41,000 --> 00:57:10,180
up there or not yeah I wouldn't want
them there we use it to protect you guys

278
00:57:10,180 --> 00:57:24,839
you have other than all the other stuff
and when we dated like three or four or

279
00:57:24,839 --> 00:57:40,830
430 there there were no who is your
guide
