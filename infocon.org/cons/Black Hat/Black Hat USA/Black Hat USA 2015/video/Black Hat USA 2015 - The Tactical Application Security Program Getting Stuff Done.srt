1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,640
our time together today about talking
about the inspiration for this talk

2
00:00:08,640 --> 00:00:12,650
be back so last year

3
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:18,779
LinkedIn Jeff Weiner halogen article and
title thirty people that I most enjoy

4
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:23,310
working with you can see the core
message distilled down and to avoid and

5
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:41,108
we want to work with people who are
dreamers and get people to its people

6
00:00:41,109 --> 00:01:05,980
industry we have dreamed big thing we
are eternally securing their unsecured

7
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:10,130
and he would have been made thereunder
whore

8
00:01:10,130 --> 00:01:21,280
feel they're getting colder around
security people on Twitter wrote general

9
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:26,299
things we do I'm pretty sure we know how
to how am i right

10
00:01:26,299 --> 00:01:37,729
not going to a party for drinks in Syria
you can change your mind however were

11
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:43,229
not as effective as we could be I think
we need to work more on this get stuff

12
00:01:43,229 --> 00:01:48,369
done bubble it's not about working
harder or even put in more hours than we

13
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:52,659
already do instead we need to evaluate
what we're doing with a more critical

14
00:01:52,659 --> 00:01:59,619
eye and make sure we're as effective as
we could be so let's get to it I'm

15
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:04,829
Coruscant orkut LinkedIn director of
security responsible for our application

16
00:02:04,829 --> 00:02:10,250
security programs incident response and
this is David sense Senior Technical

17
00:02:10,250 --> 00:02:17,590
Program Manager he is our bloggers and
are one of our instant response folks on

18
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:22,470
the applications so while the talks were
giving today described some of the work

19
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:26,010
that we've done it linked and it's also
filled with our own opinions and biases

20
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:30,940
so it's going to end up being a mix of
details and case studies and sharing a

21
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,840
result that definitely belong to
LinkedIn but our opinions and

22
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:40,450
interpretations of the work are
definitely our own alright I think we've

23
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:46,540
jumped off the platform into the high
water portion of iraq we're not talking

24
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:50,160
about the plight of this current
security organization allied strategy

25
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:56,290
won't save you but tactical success
might just work will talk about how we

26
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:59,459
build our assessment for rounds and some
of those results

27
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:03,680
a bit of a sneak preview and the last
year LinkedIn's assessment team

28
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,579
performed 440 assessment and over 900
books and we'll get into all we did that

29
00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:10,380
later

30
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:14,890
will look into a rapidly evolving
specially we like to call tactical

31
00:03:14,890 --> 00:03:19,149
application and send response and it's
it's own unique hybrid of traditional

32
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:29,150
application security and traditional
information and value for us to do so

33
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:36,880
here's the thing about strategy is this
is a good entire ground from a security

34
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:41,960
check Cecil playbook where you to focus
on building some things in the

35
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:46,210
foundational side but at the end of the
day you want to be that executive

36
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:53,280
strategic see so and this approach does
not work for application security at my

37
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,530
work for things like us and so the
problem that we find here is that

38
00:03:57,530 --> 00:04:02,820
traditional security programs focus on
strategic vision and stuff tactical

39
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:08,090
success application security it's one of
the most dynamic disciplines in the

40
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:12,550
field and ask her to approach takes time
and is less forgiving for rapid

41
00:04:12,550 --> 00:04:16,460
iteration and it's not even a line with
your car parts and application

42
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:21,079
development and engineering undergo
frequent forays into outsourcing cloud

43
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:24,289
application and options and seemed to
introduce a new framework to secure

44
00:04:24,290 --> 00:04:32,000
every year long-term strategies suffer
from a lack of agility and that is for

45
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,260
application security so

46
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:39,409
initiatives consumed budget and time for
the eventual promise of reward down the

47
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:44,160
line tack gorgeous return value
immediately and connect out so why would

48
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,500
we fought the strategy and the first
place because management strategy and

49
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:54,010
management psychology focuses on
planning and measurement to achieve

50
00:04:54,010 --> 00:04:58,860
strategic goals the middle manager in
most organizations can survive for

51
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:04,240
longer executing against an outdated
irrelevant strategy as long as you keep

52
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,150
hearing those artificial milestones
won't survive long however if you commit

53
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:11,159
to execute in short-term tactical

54
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,260
in the process of killing her and some
minutes complexes application security

55
00:05:16,260 --> 00:05:21,940
is causing people to steer diving and
here's another thing is that your

56
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,540
non-security pure love it when you talk
about strategy because it means two

57
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:32,420
things to them first strategy that
sounds like it's not my budget and so

58
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:37,220
the second security conversation wrapped
around the budget we're going to go

59
00:05:37,220 --> 00:05:42,360
nowhere fast and he's not to the next
budget planning session and second but

60
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:46,100
the other thing that i think is I don't
have to do anything right now ensconced

61
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:50,390
on my and generally agree and that
brings me to the side of the point of

62
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:55,580
immediacy we need to do a better job
pushing the pace into our security and

63
00:05:55,580 --> 00:06:02,000
our organization's strategy does not
include real time improvements and

64
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,740
assessment and response you can't figure
out how to add out today or tomorrow the

65
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:11,110
attackers as Wayne Gretzky's dad Walter
used to say skate to where the puck is

66
00:06:11,110 --> 00:06:17,770
going not a word which means you have to
take the ice so enough pursuing a

67
00:06:17,770 --> 00:06:22,099
strategic approach may not be the best
idea let's talk about what the technical

68
00:06:22,100 --> 00:06:25,970
applications are dirty program is about
one thing that I thought that was

69
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:31,060
interesting and as as you build a strong
side of your program actually be

70
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:36,580
perceived as strategic light successful
execution rather than my road map so the

71
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:41,849
first thing to note about a nap tactical
program is this lightweight a narrative

72
00:06:41,850 --> 00:06:46,840
and let me give you an example so let's
say that you need to do an APO I review

73
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,250
and you're getting on fire was a request
for this is overwhelming your existing

74
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:56,650
staff so what's on the ability to
experiment so the first generation of

75
00:06:56,650 --> 00:07:02,070
your view may simply be just a catalog
that request three questions the three

76
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:07,440
most important questions and then do
some can't advise the next generation

77
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,660
you could actually add some conditional
around and reducing the designer of you

78
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:16,480
in the third generation you could add
automated scanning the idea is to build

79
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:17,930
a great

80
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:22,389
rather than try to make the perfect
solution right away and so what will

81
00:07:22,389 --> 00:07:28,130
happen there is is that you want to have
a uniform interface into the process you

82
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:32,870
want people to know that they always can
go to you for this type of review but

83
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:37,060
what might happen in the back in my
actually change depending on what your

84
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:43,509
capability that given quarter so the
second is akin to monster really reduce

85
00:07:43,509 --> 00:07:47,750
risk for each action taken so one
question I asked myself frequently

86
00:07:47,750 --> 00:07:53,130
sometimes every day and also I asked my
staff enough times to the right up to

87
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:56,469
the point of annoyance is my work today

88
00:07:56,470 --> 00:08:00,900
prevent it from happening in the future
let us know about something bad happened

89
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:04,409
that we didn't know about already are
produced on a clear line power the

90
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:10,259
stopping in the existing bad thing from
happening anymore and so you see here is

91
00:08:10,259 --> 00:08:16,460
is when we take a look at those she set
of questions we look at every spring

92
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:21,289
plan that we have and if we don't feel
good about the Sprint plan answering

93
00:08:21,289 --> 00:08:26,000
those questions we we do it because at
the end of the day that's what being

94
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:30,780
tactical is about you do the same for
your team every quarter we look and

95
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:35,189
document the results and answer those
questions and bubble those things up to

96
00:08:35,190 --> 00:08:41,180
our management so they understand
exactly how are executing the next is

97
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:46,560
that we focus on operational excellence
and less on authorities have got to see

98
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:49,920
the inner workings a lot of security
programs over the years and I've done

99
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:56,219
the best want a consultancy and best
thing about these when they're working

100
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:01,579
well as a day drive operational
excellence and so what we do at LinkedIn

101
00:09:01,579 --> 00:09:08,319
as we measure our assessment team on the
set of core Metrix so we look at the

102
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,470
types of assessments that we've
completed in the bugs and we filed and

103
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:15,059
how many times we were able to complete
an assessment for product

104
00:09:15,059 --> 00:09:21,348
and then on the ecosystems we look at
and are bugs and how those bugs were

105
00:09:21,349 --> 00:09:27,059
discovered and how the current status
and and how they impacted our members

106
00:09:27,059 --> 00:09:31,988
and the dark or things that we look at
and measure because our operational

107
00:09:31,989 --> 00:09:40,319
excellence to do a quick digression
about authority and by so terrible

108
00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:45,319
security teams operate best when they
are a consultancy you and a girl and

109
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:48,939
they have a government commission that
the key kind of well concealed your back

110
00:09:48,939 --> 00:09:53,549
if you drag that thing out too many
times you're going to people are going

111
00:09:53,549 --> 00:09:57,239
to tune you out because the idea is that
if you're insulting you're actually

112
00:09:57,239 --> 00:10:03,739
helping someone stole a particular need
now on the matter of this doesn't

113
00:10:03,739 --> 00:10:07,159
necessarily mean that you need everyone
to agree with you all the time or only

114
00:10:07,159 --> 00:10:10,399
perceived when you have a hundred
percent by an across the organization

115
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,819
the traditional advice about your
primary job as an empathic men Jersey

116
00:10:14,819 --> 00:10:20,049
get buy-in from everyone else to a
consensus as opposed to a parent what's

117
00:10:20,049 --> 00:10:23,579
going to happen is when you start to
execute tactically you're gonna find

118
00:10:23,579 --> 00:10:29,459
people that will fit into one of three
camps is your supporters appreciate what

119
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:33,039
you do they are important to the
security mission and frankly they're the

120
00:10:33,039 --> 00:10:37,169
people that you go to work every day for
you want to make them succeed and make

121
00:10:37,169 --> 00:10:43,669
them build secure products and you have
a group of people who follow you and

122
00:10:43,669 --> 00:10:50,119
those are the ones that rely on reliable
sustainable and predictable execution

123
00:10:50,119 --> 00:10:54,459
whether be giving them an assessment
done or doing an answer or sports though

124
00:10:54,459 --> 00:10:58,598
isn't if you do these things well people
will call you if you don't feel you can

125
00:10:58,599 --> 00:11:03,549
execute them they're gonna go off the
rails the third is a group that will be

126
00:11:03,549 --> 00:11:08,050
resistant to you no matter what you do
and the idea here is that you give them

127
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:12,819
no excuse it's no excuse to resist by
the fact that you continue to execute

128
00:11:12,820 --> 00:11:20,470
and provide value by the analysis that
you're doing so remember how I talked

129
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:26,700
about those had not in my budget earlier
we need to get them to move and so one

130
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:30,610
of the first things I did when I joined
LinkedIn as I saw that we were about

131
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:35,290
significant gaps and component component
of our internal network security and so

132
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:41,800
what we did was we called a code yellow
and gave a small amount of work to each

133
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:46,189
team like system administration
administration I T help desk all these

134
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:51,850
different groups and a small little
chunks and rather than coming up with

135
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:56,980
big strategic plan then we would have to
wait to get by and for six months to one

136
00:11:56,980 --> 00:12:02,910
year plan and so that's the example of
how you can do that by making people

137
00:12:02,910 --> 00:12:09,439
move rather than wait so let's talk
about program so that you can see here

138
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,709
is a pie chart of breakdown of the work
that we did and so as you can see the

139
00:12:14,709 --> 00:12:18,949
majority of them are penetration test
but we also spend quality time with a

140
00:12:18,950 --> 00:12:22,670
product designs and third-party
applications hosted in the cloud for

141
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:27,250
both internal and product use all those
cloud assessments and I'd like to share

142
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:32,680
with you how he did that from a
technical perspective so first off it's

143
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:36,959
important to conceptualize assessment
activity as a fellow it starts with

144
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:42,410
intake moves execution and then ends
with a deliver all it can be as formal

145
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:46,540
as a certified audit process for an
informal and a two minute phone call

146
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:51,020
during intake you could be giving ad hoc
requests from colleagues are seeking

147
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:56,560
your guidance could be driven by process
driven checkpoints we call this external

148
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,910
demand the alternative of course is
self-generated intake where you're out

149
00:13:01,910 --> 00:13:04,380
there and finding things to look at

150
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:08,780
we call that internal demand and it's
important to have those in your program

151
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:13,750
so the ideal intake process is one where
people willingly come to you for

152
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:20,180
assistance of their own volition I mean
something way is happening so strong

153
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:25,500
consultancy house a set of operating
principles and here's ours first is that

154
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:29,210
we should be easy to find and engage
should really feel like you're speaking

155
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:32,880
with an advisor who is always available
to give you guidance and we use our

156
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:37,830
office hours process as a as a way to do
that the second I would look into it

157
00:13:37,830 --> 00:13:44,200
with the second we should not be too
demanding on their time and flexible on

158
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,760
documentation and preparation as long as
we have the information to determine

159
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:53,060
next steps we strive to be and all I
can't tell you how many times we've

160
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:57,069
actually help the teams build their own
data flow diagrams illogical dire around

161
00:13:57,070 --> 00:14:01,960
to help build some of their
documentation must be clear

162
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:06,930
understandable and have a reasonable
likelihood of being executed if you give

163
00:14:06,930 --> 00:14:12,010
people here in schemes in order to
secure their products are going to the

164
00:14:12,010 --> 00:14:16,830
fourth is you must assist your customers
and giving solutions and then include

165
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:19,850
getting guidance from other parts
blasting you want

166
00:14:19,850 --> 00:14:23,600
organization last thing you want to do
is have them play pinball where they

167
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:27,700
don't you then I gotta go and talk to
legal then they gotta go into a customer

168
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:31,460
support and they gotta go and talk to
someone in engineering that's going to

169
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,440
frustrate them through the entire
process and if you were the first person

170
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,710
they talk to the person they're going to
blame

171
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:41,450
so the idea is to bring all these people
together I can't say tell you how many

172
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:44,880
times we played matchmaker a pretty
different people together

173
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:51,630
talk about the security impacts the
organization is that we must be

174
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:57,689
passionate and working with us to not be
like drugs or punishment sometimes you

175
00:14:57,690 --> 00:15:03,190
feel like you really want to come to lay
the hammer down it really is and current

176
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:08,970
counter to the tactical approach so one
of the secret weapons that we use to

177
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:12,540
consulting friendly approach and to
handle demand generation is the use of

178
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:17,930
office hours so that is available to our
entire product line engineering group

179
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:23,380
twice a week but can be scheduled on the
man and we have a signup sheet which is

180
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:28,550
the document of record that's where we
start in the office hours you meet with

181
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:33,050
our house security team as well as our
trust and safety team and product legal

182
00:15:33,050 --> 00:15:39,380
all in one place and so it starts with a
brief presentation that you give us a

183
00:15:39,380 --> 00:15:43,750
product and then will document
requirements as we go

184
00:15:43,750 --> 00:15:48,060
will give them product requirements as
well as for security anti abuse and

185
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:48,510
legal

186
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:53,180
all right there and then we'll also do
the scope of an assessment just like if

187
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:56,709
I was a consulting sales person and I
would go into identified the threat

188
00:15:56,710 --> 00:16:01,120
model and what type of assessment I want
to perform do I want to do a designer of

189
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,370
you do I wanna do a code review do I
want to a penthouse and so when they

190
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:09,700
leave those office hours they have a set
of requirements and a set up next steps

191
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:17,190
of what they need to get from our
program so this is an entry level 20 so

192
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:23,810
we did and we do on every each month we
do 230 product consultations 25 general

193
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:28,359
office hours I'm or speed around and
that doesn't even count and 400

194
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:32,490
assessment number that we have in fact
there's no way we deal execute that

195
00:16:32,490 --> 00:16:37,760
number of assessment and less we have
this type of office hour consultation

196
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,230
the other thing is that they want to
consider building a service catalog you

197
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:45,080
can see here what we currently have on
LinkedIn

198
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:49,520
each service should have a dog
documented and to find methodology worth

199
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:52,360
of things to look for in your testing
team

200
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:57,380
generally follow it and publishes the
team knows what theyre Venus us but we

201
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:01,380
also want to do some scope and we want
to figure out what the game overs are

202
00:17:01,380 --> 00:17:06,579
poor that give an assessment and
documentos as part of a test plan and

203
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:12,698
then finally the idea is is is to
determine what your methodology you can

204
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:17,300
keep and which party controls way in
order to get that number assessments

205
00:17:17,300 --> 00:17:25,129
done so one of the things that happens
when you get some support it is that

206
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:30,620
they all say things like our products
need to be reviewed before launch when I

207
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:35,330
first heard this my marching orders are
clear and I was happy to have such

208
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:39,790
strong executive support while I'm still
in tremendous gratitude for the support

209
00:17:39,790 --> 00:17:44,110
that I have every day I quickly realized
that this stuff in the policy discussion

210
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:47,729
here actually left me with more
questions than answers

211
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:53,110
what does it mean to be reviewed and was
like incremental improvements that

212
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:58,429
happen every day ends and another one
begins and how do you know when you're

213
00:17:58,430 --> 00:18:04,820
done so what we did was as we started to
break these questions down and so we

214
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:09,439
used office hours at the entry point and
then we had to have the latitude to

215
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,800
determine what types of review were
necessary so we think a lot about member

216
00:18:13,800 --> 00:18:18,740
privacy and expectations first and so
and then from there we would have seen

217
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:22,940
how the application can be abused then
we go on to think about how the product

218
00:18:22,940 --> 00:18:27,150
can be internally secure and then
finally we rely on our expertise to do

219
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:31,690
that custom school and then the answer
the question below even mean or what is

220
00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:36,700
it more important when we can do a lot
of a/b testing slow ramps economy and

221
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:38,160
thence to small percentages

222
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,600
customers review too early the chances
of you having good powered by the time

223
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:46,199
the product makes it to a larger
population as slim without significant

224
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,970
repeated over and we review too late you
may have a vulnerability in production

225
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:55,010
impacts only some members is important
to do a couple things here to make

226
00:18:55,010 --> 00:19:00,000
doubly sure no Tripoli sure that when
you have a B testing of them in a

227
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,820
trampoline capability that it can be
overridden and controlled by an attacker

228
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:08,169
second is defined features the most
meaningful from a security perspective

229
00:19:08,170 --> 00:19:16,240
in our case anything that touches
confidential financial member data so we

230
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,210
talk about them and talk about internal
demand for a little bit so you want to

231
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:24,160
be part of the product launch 2008
LinkedIn we have a product review

232
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,850
process and we sit there and monitor
what's going on in those and then

233
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:34,590
determine where it's best to insert
ourselves into this weekend starts with

234
00:19:34,590 --> 00:19:39,580
the office hours but all also end up
being things like how we're doing

235
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:45,030
ramps for products and looking at the
road maps there to determine how best to

236
00:19:45,030 --> 00:19:48,940
do the reviews but the other thing you
want to try to do you want to look for

237
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:53,150
opportunities to contribute security
guidance outside of testing and code

238
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:58,060
review to do white papers on how the
product to secure and reducing

239
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:03,000
third-party assessments or doing abuse
detection and monitoring these

240
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,090
definitions

241
00:20:04,090 --> 00:20:07,379
the other thing we do is we look for
changes and staging and production we

242
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:13,530
actually monitor how people are using
the site show up we take a look and and

243
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:18,980
figure out how best to those
applications and cialis through our

244
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:23,060
price and then the other major thing you
want to do is befriend the gatekeepers

245
00:20:23,060 --> 00:20:26,690
these are the people who are registering
your domains the people who are

246
00:20:26,690 --> 00:20:31,710
maintained DNS and those that are
responsible for fun in traffic because

247
00:20:31,710 --> 00:20:33,190
when a new endpoint shows up

248
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:41,740
you don't want to be surprised so there
are some people that could trap your

249
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:46,850
tactical maneuvers as you increasing
number of mandated or get more

250
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:52,360
interesting things to reviews these are
projects or products you need to go

251
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:57,889
through you quickly realize that will
result in little value to me very quick

252
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:02,240
to identify these early in the final
usually through office hours and quickly

253
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:07,370
and ruthlessly out of us otherwise
you're gonna get caught in your own

254
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:10,889
here's your assessment team will be
unmotivated there are questions will be

255
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:15,080
annoyed and you simply won't be
delivering as much value as you think

256
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:20,050
you could the other question we get is
about standards so clear standards about

257
00:21:20,050 --> 00:21:23,530
how to deal with common security issues
and what to avoid will definitely help

258
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:28,590
along with sharing your application
specific test plans but don't allow cell

259
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:33,860
certification is a good idea instead to
keep an open book on how people will be

260
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:38,810
assessed tree in the assessment like
some type of magical black box create

261
00:21:38,810 --> 00:21:44,690
unnecessary uncertainty and anxiety the
project team testing methodology and/or

262
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:48,680
pre-release checklist for webinar iOS
and Android applications all document

263
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:53,250
engineering we point the team to these
pages as part of the engagement process

264
00:21:53,250 --> 00:22:00,290
there was a bit of a car via air about
the tackle susman approach and that is

265
00:22:00,290 --> 00:22:05,480
in strong consistency your goals
exclusive you make your client which is

266
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:09,730
the product you are working with
internal security TV you have to balance

267
00:22:09,730 --> 00:22:14,420
other things the satisfaction of courses
of the team they're working with but

268
00:22:14,420 --> 00:22:17,990
there's also the overarching company's
governance and security and the

269
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:24,210
president same behavior that you execute
and of course and most importantly as

270
00:22:24,210 --> 00:22:28,670
customer remember safety so if we take a
look at the case on LinkedIn and roll

271
00:22:28,670 --> 00:22:34,980
where we had some challenges with that
product we actually did everything right

272
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:38,179
from a technical application security
perspective

273
00:22:38,179 --> 00:22:43,919
we worked very hard to secure this
product tactical tell us so we performed

274
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:47,149
a client with a product team was happy

275
00:22:47,149 --> 00:22:53,360
well as happy as a heavy security
presence like project we as a scary team

276
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:58,918
failed to identify the impact of the
design and the broader perspective of

277
00:22:58,919 --> 00:23:03,200
the product and how the products
approach could be perceived as less than

278
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:14,279
untrustworthy right show that response
so there are spots so the effectiveness

279
00:23:14,279 --> 00:23:17,860
and reputation with security
organization is most frequently judged

280
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:22,100
by how they respond to incidents and
security bugs if you do things well

281
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:25,850
people will rarely see your assessment
program and how it works

282
00:23:25,850 --> 00:23:30,449
however the spotlight critical bug being
exposed into production

283
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:36,169
gather as many interested parties
LinkedIn we handled 77 critical

284
00:23:36,169 --> 00:23:40,899
vulnerabilities in the last year twenty
one of them were extremely discovered or

285
00:23:40,899 --> 00:23:45,580
reported to us thirteen of those were
from our private look around and fifty

286
00:23:45,580 --> 00:23:49,230
six of them were discovered internally
either by our own team or by other

287
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:54,379
engineers know how I talk about that
generating your internal demand your

288
00:23:54,379 --> 00:24:01,230
tactical approach to actually encourage
exploration just staying in a given 1900

289
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:06,080
pretty aggressive what constitutes a
critical bugs and in almost every case

290
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,860
these books were handled and close
before any member data impacted in any

291
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:14,330
way I will start with a case study

292
00:24:14,330 --> 00:24:16,330
David

293
00:24:16,330 --> 00:24:28,240
loud so before we get into the fun stuff
and disclose a few critical that we have

294
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:34,929
seen recently reports coming from the
outside world like many companies we

295
00:24:34,929 --> 00:24:39,309
receive reports from external security
researchers are fairly regular basis

296
00:24:39,309 --> 00:24:42,918
multiple reports coming to us through
our security alias security at

297
00:24:42,919 --> 00:24:47,789
linkedin.com however they also come to
us through social media customer service

298
00:24:47,789 --> 00:24:52,039
tickets and of course executive
escalations now for some reason people

299
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:55,059
in the community sometimes like to write
to our executives thinking they'll get

300
00:24:55,059 --> 00:24:58,389
some sort of special attention however
doesn't always work out the way they had

301
00:24:58,389 --> 00:25:04,010
hoped for and usually end up talking
with me to handle the incoming reports

302
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:08,580
we have implemented an on-call system
for our assessment team that are penned

303
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:13,620
testers and is a one-week rotation the
main mission for this individual on call

304
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:17,709
is to quickly triage any incoming buck
during the normal business day within

305
00:25:17,710 --> 00:25:22,460
four hours if it is a time such as
nights or weekends we do a lot of

306
00:25:22,460 --> 00:25:26,720
investors to sleep so we just es la
accordingly out to eight hours

307
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:31,529
note that after hours only following up
on critical this will help reduce the

308
00:25:31,529 --> 00:25:37,580
on-call burnout while some may question
having an experienced pen tester triage

309
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:41,860
incoming bugs we viewed here is a
necessity having someone who has the

310
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:45,870
experience with the products
architectures and existing issues can

311
00:25:45,870 --> 00:25:49,090
quickly triage any incoming bug that
comes in

312
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:54,090
regardless in addition it's also very
important that we respond to the

313
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:57,918
researchers in a very short period of
time even if just a simple

314
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:01,750
acknowledgment that we have received the
report and are starting to investigate

315
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:06,040
again we want to do this as a human this
is not an automated response

316
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:10,720
the on call is responsible for triaging
the incoming bug establish a working

317
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:15,220
proof of concept only appropriate
tickets and of course responding back to

318
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:18,960
the researcher again we want to respond
to the researcher that very short period

319
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:23,790
of time and like I said it's again just
an acknowledgement that we're working on

320
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:28,060
it and are investigating if it is
determined to be a critical and we'll go

321
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:33,740
through what determines or what makes a
critical need then responsibility ship

322
00:26:33,740 --> 00:26:37,910
store ecosystem team which are then take
over responsibility for coordinating

323
00:26:37,910 --> 00:26:42,630
response and we'll talk more about the
responsibilities here shortly so now the

324
00:26:42,630 --> 00:26:48,570
fun stuff but she will realize critical
now this report came to us from the

325
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:54,330
external world and what this show runs
you could change any profile picture for

326
00:26:54,330 --> 00:27:02,600
any member across all pretty scary and
so let's treat this one last note is the

327
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:07,439
original reporter to us was not actually
the original finder of this and we found

328
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:12,740
the original as a YouTube video already
online in spreading wild place so much

329
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:16,460
demonstrate the vulnerability here so
first one to pick a profile of a

330
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:20,650
colleague of mine Tony tremor he's in
the back here the rain was I could go

331
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:29,500
ahead and faces profile of you just talk
show after a difficult to do not want to

332
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:35,600
face that send message we that we come
up with some blocker report we didn't go

333
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,230
click over to the next one which is
Marcus inappropriately is ready for the

334
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:40,410
fun technical stuff now

335
00:27:40,410 --> 00:27:45,270
great we click the Done button that was
it his

336
00:27:45,270 --> 00:27:51,540
is now me now argue this is a much
improved proper him it's much more

337
00:27:51,540 --> 00:27:56,889
handsome I bet his profile views just
went skyrocketing have a bit more fun

338
00:27:56,890 --> 00:28:01,970
with this and play with him I can do the
same steps to change my profile picture

339
00:28:01,970 --> 00:28:06,320
and I change into Tony the Tiger's
across all just like that

340
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:11,060
pretty scary right now know my lawyer
lawyers and PR one me to emphasize this

341
00:28:11,060 --> 00:28:14,659
this is now fixed so please don't go
clicking through this like thinking your

342
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:19,650
friends are gonna change profile picture
to something which I can imagine it

343
00:28:19,650 --> 00:28:26,530
would do so this report came to us after
hours and as discussed earlier we tried

344
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:31,649
triage bugs as soon as they come it was
able triage this blog and respond to the

345
00:28:31,650 --> 00:28:36,670
researcher in about an hour again this
is not an automated response this is our

346
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:41,690
on-call pen tester confirming that there
is a bug and that we are working towards

347
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:45,290
an immediate checks now the next
question I usually get from people is

348
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:49,379
David what makes this a critical why do
I have to work right now now in this

349
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:53,450
case it's pretty straightforward if I'm
able to change anybody's profile picture

350
00:28:53,450 --> 00:28:57,540
across all of the platform pretty
straightforward and doesn't require much

351
00:28:57,540 --> 00:29:02,270
arguments what we found those works
really well for all the other times that

352
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:07,110
we have to have this discussion is a
clearly defined bug classification table

353
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:11,850
and this bug classification table has a
list of blogs the related severity

354
00:29:11,850 --> 00:29:18,120
critical high medium low and established
SLA for resolution this gives clear

355
00:29:18,120 --> 00:29:22,139
guidance to our testers who are triaging
the incoming bugs and makes it easy for

356
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:26,100
them to diagnose them but also gives
clear guidance to the teams that we are

357
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:30,600
working with and have to fix these
things after triaging which we handle

358
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:35,350
the focus immediately ships to alerting
the specific team and get them working

359
00:29:35,350 --> 00:29:39,090
towards effects now we're more than
happy to help them identify with the

360
00:29:39,090 --> 00:29:43,800
root cause is and review their fix
however we put the responsibility on to

361
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:47,909
them to design the fixed and pushed to
production now the great thing about

362
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:52,480
being on my company like us as we have
the ability to push code to production

363
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:56,190
very quickly usually within a few hours
of identifying an issue

364
00:29:56,190 --> 00:30:00,110
however this isn't fast enough sometimes
when you find a YouTube video already

365
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:04,490
online and people changing profile
pictures you have to implement a stopgap

366
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:09,419
solution so in this case we did we had
to implement an upstream filter which

367
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:14,059
broke member functionality but remove
the vulnerability from our site

368
00:30:14,059 --> 00:30:18,549
this was definitely not the best member
experience however it was a necessity to

369
00:30:18,549 --> 00:30:22,330
protect the site in the members and
we'll talk more about how these upstream

370
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:27,899
filters and other stop-gap solutions can
be use so within next hour to go after

371
00:30:27,899 --> 00:30:32,008
working with the right teams and the
on-call pen tester we are able to push

372
00:30:32,009 --> 00:30:37,450
optics to production and closed at the
bug and restore member functionality now

373
00:30:37,450 --> 00:30:44,309
as many of you know the incident isn't
over yet this is my profile but that's

374
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:45,269
definitely not me

375
00:30:45,269 --> 00:30:50,750
released I can hope you can tell that's
not me up there my picture that evening

376
00:30:50,750 --> 00:30:54,639
as we work to this incident problem
change at least a dozen times as my oh

377
00:30:54,639 --> 00:30:58,428
so funny colleagues change it to animals
and other objects throughout the evening

378
00:30:58,429 --> 00:31:04,279
as they tested out this new feature is
pretty funny I got my profile views one

379
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:07,340
of my mom called me to issues like I
noticed your profile picture change you

380
00:31:07,340 --> 00:31:08,470
look different

381
00:31:08,470 --> 00:31:14,169
alright so does seem like the next
logical step your right but obviously we

382
00:31:14,169 --> 00:31:18,529
have to determine the scope first how
many members have been affected how long

383
00:31:18,529 --> 00:31:22,559
has this been in production and has
anyone been abusing the flaw other than

384
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:27,019
my own so funny colleagues wait until
the fix is in production you're gonna

385
00:31:27,019 --> 00:31:32,299
inevitably delay closing out the
incident until much later in the night

386
00:31:32,299 --> 00:31:33,980
without fail

387
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:38,889
most of what you wanna answer is buried
deep in some log files and need someone

388
00:31:38,889 --> 00:31:40,559
specific to analyze it

389
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:45,178
the application response team needs
access to this member data log data

390
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:49,750
state changes and other valuable
application information these systems

391
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:55,679
will be a combination if you're lucky I
do HDFS elasticsearch and other

392
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:00,350
structured query identities as a result
your tactical response team needs to be

393
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:04,519
able to parse through large amounts of
data very quickly now when an engine

394
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:08,440
kicks off one of my first calls the
store security data science team

395
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:12,630
we're lucky enough to have a dedicated
data science team who can help me answer

396
00:32:12,630 --> 00:32:16,150
these questions however this is not
necessary and you don't have to

397
00:32:16,150 --> 00:32:20,550
establish this in your org can be done
with members of your own team with

398
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:22,629
access to this information

399
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:26,600
ideally though this data is being
shipped it through in parallel to the

400
00:32:26,600 --> 00:32:28,310
fix being built

401
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:32,629
you don't want to wait until the end
this one hour and speed things up but I

402
00:32:32,630 --> 00:32:35,570
guarantee management lawyers

403
00:32:35,570 --> 00:32:38,899
NPR's are gonna start asking you
questions and you're not going to have

404
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:39,840
the answers

405
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:44,639
better start looking right away now like
the spare tire on your car though if the

406
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,560
first time you check it is when you're
on the side of the road on a dark and

407
00:32:48,560 --> 00:32:53,480
stormy night I guarantee you you will
find it flattering missing don't wait

408
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:57,040
until you're in the midst of an incident
to find out that you don't have proper

409
00:32:57,040 --> 00:33:01,780
logs or that the IP address being
captured is that of your own CD and it

410
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:02,710
happened

411
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:09,420
alright checkin out check him ahead of
time it's worth it so let's take a look

412
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:13,350
at another case study here this report
came to us via our private bug bounty

413
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:15,080
program which will discuss in a moment

414
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:19,610
interest in going up this person had
committed after only being the program

415
00:33:19,610 --> 00:33:23,830
for a short period of time what this
person discovered was that they could

416
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:29,850
upload sorry this was to delete my bad
they could delete any slight chair or

417
00:33:29,850 --> 00:33:34,080
any YouTube video from any SlideShare
presentation for any member across the

418
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:38,870
entire platform pretty scary so
following standard procedures of

419
00:33:38,870 --> 00:33:42,760
triaging above on-call pen tester
started looking at this upon further

420
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:46,760
investigation and following the path
that the researcher the external

421
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:51,020
researcher had laid out we also found
that videos could be added now this is

422
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:55,139
another great reason have a season pen
tester here if we'd only focused on the

423
00:33:55,140 --> 00:34:01,060
initial report of the deletion we might
have missed this bug completely this is

424
00:34:01,060 --> 00:34:04,909
a pretty straightforward critical
imagine all of our SlideShare

425
00:34:04,910 --> 00:34:09,800
presentations in bed with an NSFW video
I imagine our users would be to policed

426
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:15,500
so during the last case study we focused
on remediation cleanup in communication

427
00:34:15,500 --> 00:34:17,980
with the researcher and

428
00:34:17,980 --> 00:34:21,918
that's pretty much it so now pieces we
didn't cover were communication

429
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:26,199
processes internally why we chose to
implement that both classification table

430
00:34:26,199 --> 00:34:31,759
and some stop-gap solutions so any
reason will engineer designer paint

431
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:35,310
tester understands the impact of
uploading or deleting YouTube videos

432
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:40,009
from anybody SlideShare pretty easy to
see how this is a critical and doesn't

433
00:34:40,010 --> 00:34:46,810
require much discussion however we
ensure security professionals often find

434
00:34:46,810 --> 00:34:50,509
ourselves trying to convince someone
else an organization why something is

435
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:55,520
important needs to be fixed now and now
usually leads to them labeling us things

436
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:02,700
like argumentative or my favorite just a
jerk and it's true that label all of

437
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:07,220
those now is it because I can share a
moment ago we're trying to convince

438
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:11,459
someone else within our own organization
why something has to be fixed now and

439
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:16,020
that discussion typically devolves into
the other person arguing things like

440
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:22,800
impact more mobility accessibility and
my absolute favorite it existed like

441
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,369
this for years why do I have to fix it
now

442
00:35:25,369 --> 00:35:30,720
ok why can't I get to next next month
next year next quarter right when you

443
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:35,060
have to fix it now and constantly having
these discussions and debates in the

444
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:39,029
midst of an incident especially if it's
two o'clock in the morning will turn you

445
00:35:39,030 --> 00:35:43,990
into a curmudgeon it will turn you into
that juror I guarantee it

446
00:35:43,990 --> 00:35:48,750
we found that helps really well the curb
these conversations is a well-defined

447
00:35:48,750 --> 00:35:54,619
bug classification table which I
mentioned just a minute ago this is

448
00:35:54,619 --> 00:35:58,790
implementing the clear and concise
easy-to-understand bug severity table

449
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:03,060
negates these conversations a store
cross-site scripting introduction to

450
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:07,230
your members is a critical and requires
an all hands on deck approach to fix it

451
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:12,890
right now and I said not now and get it
right there might not so the industry

452
00:36:12,890 --> 00:36:17,600
would argue though that we should be
using a CVSS approach here however as

453
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:22,299
mentioned we found that this release to
our own engineers and developers arguing

454
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:26,280
and trying to game the system to lower
their score so they can go back to bed

455
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:31,320
and in all honesty I can't blame them I
wanna go back to bed to so many teams

456
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:35,820
can do the technical work and many of us
are graded solving technical

457
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:40,420
vulnerability and it's great we can
smash vulnerabilities however what

458
00:36:40,420 --> 00:36:45,370
separates a great incident ones that are
run smoothly versus those are run poorly

459
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:50,150
in the eyes of the outsider to you or
security or is communication

460
00:36:50,150 --> 00:36:53,700
one of the key roles that are ecosystem
team place is coordination and

461
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:57,970
communication during any incident
there's gonna be many individuals if not

462
00:36:57,970 --> 00:37:02,950
teams involved and everyone needs to be
aware of what's going on in a

463
00:37:02,950 --> 00:37:06,759
centralized person to gather this
information and spread that knowledge

464
00:37:06,760 --> 00:37:12,210
becomes imperative ecosystem team as air
traffic controllers asking for updates

465
00:37:12,210 --> 00:37:16,770
and disturbing that information the
communication doesn't stop at just the

466
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:21,140
teams working on the issue this has to
flow up to your management and to your

467
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:26,970
lawyers and PR alright and none of those
teams should learn about the incident

468
00:37:26,970 --> 00:37:30,629
through back channels or word of mouth I
guarantee you it will make them question

469
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:33,910
what you as a security professional are
doing and how you're running the

470
00:37:33,910 --> 00:37:39,040
incident all you need to do is give them
a brief summary of where the years she

471
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:43,920
currently stance what your plan
remediation is next step and next time

472
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:47,530
you're going to be given an update we
believe so much in this methodology that

473
00:37:47,530 --> 00:37:51,600
for every one of those 77 more critical
that began last year one of these

474
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:55,960
communications went out so here's a
quick example as you can see an example

475
00:37:55,960 --> 00:38:00,410
here we have a deadline given a quick
executive summary fall by more in-depth

476
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:04,990
explanation and a link to the ticket and
disclosure and pulled know what that

477
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:08,890
this disclosure and bold it's over here
on the other side is on the bottom of

478
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:12,710
every single email that I sent out the
two critical really all I started

479
00:38:12,710 --> 00:38:16,670
sending out these communications at the
request of Management I was escalated on

480
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:22,960
and also read out by colleagues saying
that I was writing them out or title

481
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:23,920
team lean on them

482
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:28,680
ok idea here is not to rattle your
colleagues from making a mistake the

483
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:33,839
idea is to inform all involved parties
adding this communication to the bottom

484
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:37,330
of the email as well as making sure I
pre briefed the teams and what the

485
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:38,569
process was

486
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:44,330
escalations and complaints about me well
most of the complaints about me away so

487
00:38:44,330 --> 00:38:49,130
the other point here is not the tone of
his email again it's a very positive

488
00:38:49,130 --> 00:38:54,180
email I even have a think you like here
the ideas a lot of your college price

489
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:58,399
probably are not super motivated to be
working late nights weekends or drop all

490
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:02,280
the other projects to work on your
critical incident adding this positive

491
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:07,060
spin will help keep keep the team morale
high no one last more one last thing

492
00:39:07,060 --> 00:39:10,500
before we move on with the YouTube issue
we were able to fix it within a couple

493
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:14,740
hours only one of these went out pretty
straight forward now

494
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:18,990
other incidents that many of you might
encounter the incident could last hours

495
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:20,569
for could last days

496
00:39:20,570 --> 00:39:25,200
management PR or lawyer should never be
reaching out to you for aspirin update

497
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:28,950
you waited too long at that point the
idea here is you want to beat them to

498
00:39:28,950 --> 00:39:32,890
the punch you need to make sure they go
out on a regular basis if you don't have

499
00:39:32,890 --> 00:39:36,770
someone like an ecosystem team or
someone like me to do it that's ok to

500
00:39:36,770 --> 00:39:41,140
you just need to set the expectation my
personal model here when I run these

501
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:46,879
incidents is beat them to the punch down
both cases we follow a standard playbook

502
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:51,440
which gave us a framework it is not a
100 page document that no one ever read

503
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:55,980
your updates the idea here is that the
PlayBook that's practical predictable

504
00:39:55,980 --> 00:40:00,140
and consistent team to have been
assigned a critical call from us and

505
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:04,910
know what to expect that this comes with
time and exposure but also comes with

506
00:40:04,910 --> 00:40:08,950
transparency we believe so much in this
methodology that we're releasing public

507
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:14,270
version do this after our talk will
provide a link you want to go back and

508
00:40:14,270 --> 00:40:18,020
took one second collaboration
unfortunate immediate all hands on deck

509
00:40:18,020 --> 00:40:21,880
approach to critical so there is a
reality that certain things aren't going

510
00:40:21,880 --> 00:40:23,510
to change immediately

511
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:28,640
products cannot always be redesigned a
framework redone or new functionality

512
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:33,830
built overnight while you can't allow
the long-term fix discussions to happen

513
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:37,710
and I guarantee you'd that's where the
team wanna go all 11 of this framework

514
00:40:37,710 --> 00:40:41,930
in three months that's gonna fix this
and didn't know we need to focus on

515
00:40:41,930 --> 00:40:46,669
fixing the vulnerability now we have
found that many times we can implement a

516
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:50,530
block an additional control or break
functionality in

517
00:40:50,530 --> 00:40:54,620
order to reduce the severity of the
threat know that I'm not saying we're

518
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:58,380
closing out the threat completely we are
reducing the threat surface by

519
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:02,070
implementing an additional control
remember though uses security

520
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:06,160
professional or the consultant and need
to come ready to talk to these teams

521
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:11,120
offer up some of these countermeasures
that they might not be aware of all

522
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:15,220
right now the fun stuff and now there's
a lot of people probably interested in

523
00:41:15,220 --> 00:41:21,089
this bug bounty programs so I think we
can all agree why bug bounty programs

524
00:41:21,090 --> 00:41:25,170
have been implemented across the
industry we want to receive quality

525
00:41:25,170 --> 00:41:29,640
reports establish good relationship with
the security community stay out of the

526
00:41:29,640 --> 00:41:34,540
media of course and you could use of
resources of money and contrary these

527
00:41:34,540 --> 00:41:38,640
programs have fostered an influx of bad
reports from researchers simply

528
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:43,029
attempting to gain abounding we've seen
the signal-to-noise ratio of the public

529
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:46,960
but bounty programs continue to degrade
requiring companies to hire dedicated

530
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:52,780
resources engage consultancies and used
to sift through all the junk and ordered

531
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:58,320
find actionable reports before it
launched into the specifics about how we

532
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:01,450
built our program I want to share
another case study here which I believe

533
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:05,069
will help set the tone going back the
other year to the intro product which

534
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:10,150
Corey discussed it was getting a fair
amount of negative attention a blog post

535
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:14,350
surfaced showing how our internal
product could potentially be used to

536
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:19,230
social engineer picked up the researcher
had not reached out to us or had not

537
00:42:19,230 --> 00:42:23,880
attempted to contact us in any way but
had just written a blog post now many

538
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:27,960
companies at this point I'm which starts
licking their large legal or PR arms and

539
00:42:27,960 --> 00:42:32,500
tried to smash the vulnerability smash
the author or the block we decided to

540
00:42:32,500 --> 00:42:36,280
take a different approach year we
decided to reach out to the author and

541
00:42:36,280 --> 00:42:40,130
bite him to check unsurprisingly he was
more than willing to work with us and

542
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:43,980
share what he had found using the same
methodology as we discussed earlier in

543
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:48,860
the talk we were able to close out that
vulnerability that same day as a result

544
00:42:48,860 --> 00:42:53,640
his follow post the next day what about
how greatly didn't was and how great it

545
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:57,540
was to work with our security team I'm
sure this case study with you guys for a

546
00:42:57,540 --> 00:43:02,950
few reasons the first is collaboration
this is not and should not be an

547
00:43:02,950 --> 00:43:07,000
adversarial relationship the researcher
was willing to work with us and

548
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:11,980
collaborate the change in attitude on
both sides of that fence changes he

549
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:16,960
outcome amenable party's win the second
reason I shared this does availability

550
00:43:16,960 --> 00:43:21,060
due to the fact that we were not dealing
with hundreds or thousands of reports

551
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:25,328
they were coming in we had the
availability to reach out and personally

552
00:43:25,329 --> 00:43:29,380
talked with this member and learn what
they had found this personal touch

553
00:43:29,380 --> 00:43:34,200
communication and understanding with the
researcher truly born changes the

554
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:39,649
outcome we believe that every researcher
should be treated right regardless if

555
00:43:39,650 --> 00:43:44,000
there's a bug bounty program in place or
not this is the spirit of how bug bounty

556
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:49,700
program should be run and how we run our
program so how did we get to our program

557
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:54,609
well before we launched we received a
number of emails to our security alias

558
00:43:54,609 --> 00:43:59,920
most of which were on actionable and not
meaningful however a small group of

559
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:03,829
people emerged who always provided
excellent write-ups there were

560
00:44:03,829 --> 00:44:08,710
meaningful and well thought out and a
pleasure to work with so we thought geez

561
00:44:08,710 --> 00:44:13,220
we like working with these people
they're providing excellent bugs that

562
00:44:13,220 --> 00:44:17,040
were willing to work with us in a
collaborative fashion why not get them

563
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:21,540
into a program that rewards them for
doing their research moving for and this

564
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:25,480
is the spirit of how be regional bug
bounty program started and I believe

565
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:29,290
this is how we bring it back to its
original intent the advantage of making

566
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:34,089
a private invitation only allows us to
having more meaningful relationship with

567
00:44:34,089 --> 00:44:38,000
the researchers by eliminating the
distractions a poorly researched or

568
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,540
relevant reports providing response
analysis to the researchers on their

569
00:44:42,540 --> 00:44:48,319
reports and actually fixing the bugs
takes considerable resources if you want

570
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:54,460
to do this right so we did in October
2014 we formalize the partnership with

571
00:44:54,460 --> 00:44:58,690
the creation of LinkedIn's private bug
bounty program the participants in our

572
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:04,829
program have submitted over 65 bugs of
which we've closed each one of those in

573
00:45:04,829 --> 00:45:09,339
too many to fix the participants have
given us great feedback about the

574
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:13,640
program and in return for all their hard
work we paid over $65,000 and counties

575
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,859
we've had a significant reduction

576
00:45:15,859 --> 00:45:19,400
in the authorization related issues in a
recruit product thanks to the

577
00:45:19,400 --> 00:45:25,950
researchers we've also been using the
researchers to identify bugs in order

578
00:45:25,950 --> 00:45:29,288
code that didn't go through the same
level security diligence that Corey

579
00:45:29,289 --> 00:45:33,589
discussed earlier we've been able to get
out bonuses in certain types of awards

580
00:45:33,589 --> 00:45:37,960
that show creativity or persistence due
to the availability to reduce noise

581
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:43,150
another advantage here is we're not need
to deal with the gamesmanship present in

582
00:45:43,150 --> 00:45:47,119
many public bug bounty programs where
you end up paying out for about me for

583
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:51,410
something that's not meaningful yet
still somehow within your rules might

584
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:56,230
miss that one so the thing is our
researchers tend not to go down this

585
00:45:56,230 --> 00:46:01,239
path they're usually interested in much
more meaningful or impactful budget

586
00:46:01,239 --> 00:46:04,950
actually mean something to the
organization into our members the

587
00:46:04,950 --> 00:46:09,930
researchers have the ability to invest
time into their research the problem

588
00:46:09,930 --> 00:46:13,640
with the bounty programs in the public's
sense is your recent against the clock

589
00:46:13,640 --> 00:46:18,328
most likely there's another researcher
out there working on the same bugs you

590
00:46:18,329 --> 00:46:22,509
why do you want to spend time
investigating doing a thorough analysis

591
00:46:22,509 --> 00:46:27,269
if someone else is gonna beat you to the
punch and claimed the balcony it doesn't

592
00:46:27,269 --> 00:46:32,089
work what you need to do is simply take
a screenshot make a submission with a

593
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:37,239
really cool sounding are scary title k
public bug bounty programs don't

594
00:46:37,239 --> 00:46:41,809
incentivizes in-depth are thoughtful
analysis the incentive ice quickly

595
00:46:41,809 --> 00:46:47,630
poorly written submissions in contrast
our program has seen an influx of great

596
00:46:47,630 --> 00:46:51,950
thoroughly done investigations are right
after my researchers they know the

597
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:57,689
competition is limited and most likely
if they invested time into research and

598
00:46:57,690 --> 00:47:03,710
finding the bug there will be a reward
so we've spoken about our bug bounty

599
00:47:03,710 --> 00:47:07,180
program is different from the others in
its advantages so let's talk about the

600
00:47:07,180 --> 00:47:10,669
impact here for a second I can spot a
free shows here and tell you that we

601
00:47:10,670 --> 00:47:14,960
have an awesome signal-to-noise ratio of
723 and that the industry averages

602
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:20,180
training towards one in 2000 in less
you're probably involved in a program or

603
00:47:20,180 --> 00:47:23,910
you're running one or you're looking at
running one I probably just alikum

604
00:47:23,910 --> 00:47:27,670
spouting off numbers here and playing a
bit too much of inside baseball

605
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:32,160
so very simply put if you have a 120
ratio this means for everyone good bug

606
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:36,220
you get you get twenty back reports
pretty simple but companies don't

607
00:47:36,220 --> 00:47:40,910
realize though is the impact this will
have on their organization every one of

608
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:43,299
those reports regardless if it's good or
bad

609
00:47:43,299 --> 00:47:47,230
has to be triaged because what if it is
a critical bug and you simply put in the

610
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:51,990
pileup 0 will follow up on it later I
guarantee you the researcher is more

611
00:47:51,990 --> 00:47:55,930
than happy to take it to the media and
the headline will read company nor

612
00:47:55,930 --> 00:48:01,640
security researchers zeroed a imposing
sad for all it will happen so ever

613
00:48:01,640 --> 00:48:06,259
report and we can agree has to be
triaged and communication sent back to

614
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:10,880
the researcher this can easily take an
average of one hour per report without

615
00:48:10,880 --> 00:48:15,710
doing any math it's easy to see how your
workload significantly increases if you

616
00:48:15,710 --> 00:48:19,940
don't have the proper processes for
handling reports pre-made templates for

617
00:48:19,940 --> 00:48:24,309
responses ticketing systems agreements
with your engineering endeavor teens on

618
00:48:24,309 --> 00:48:28,599
a salacious for fixing these things this
can grow out of control very quickly

619
00:48:28,599 --> 00:48:32,839
the industry is experiencing a costly
degrading signal noise ratio as we

620
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:34,770
continue to operate these programs

621
00:48:34,770 --> 00:48:38,960
check out the latest research from both
hacker 1 I'm proud they support this the

622
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:42,650
days of launching a public bug bounty
program just because everyone else is

623
00:48:42,650 --> 00:48:44,210
doing it is over

624
00:48:44,210 --> 00:48:47,569
think about what your mother said if
your friends jump off the bridge would

625
00:48:47,569 --> 00:48:53,869
you this is a complex endeavor you must
prepare for our suggestion here is to

626
00:48:53,869 --> 00:48:58,500
start small with a group of researchers
or people you trust at the end of the

627
00:48:58,500 --> 00:49:03,740
day what really matters is protecting
our members employees and products we

628
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:07,828
know how we can assemble an amazing team
that will help mitigate the threat and

629
00:49:07,829 --> 00:49:13,099
reduce it will always need help from the
outside our strategy is not to throw a

630
00:49:13,099 --> 00:49:17,000
bug bounty programs completely is to
better connect with the researchers who

631
00:49:17,000 --> 00:49:25,930
will help us achieve that goal of
securing our data thank you

632
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:37,480
and if you're interested in the slides

633
00:49:37,480 --> 00:50:24,600
updated slides are at the URL below it
so the LinkedIn get stuff done shortener

634
00:50:24,600 --> 00:50:38,660
reports and that ratio increased sounds
wonderful but if you've got a community

635
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:42,410
and that's the only place you're
listening for reports for what's to stop

636
00:50:42,410 --> 00:50:48,109
someone who's poking around on LinkedIn
who has no idea about how your body

637
00:50:48,110 --> 00:50:53,350
program works from approaching you with
a real dog and you be able to react as

638
00:50:53,350 --> 00:50:57,770
you increase the chances of ignoring
people on the outside now so we still

639
00:50:57,770 --> 00:51:03,910
responding to reports their treat them
just as we would if they were in the

640
00:51:03,910 --> 00:51:05,129
program

641
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:12,090
exactly so we've actually people are
processed into the program for its

642
00:51:12,090 --> 00:51:18,289
almost like a two tier system

643
00:51:18,289 --> 00:51:25,099
high school reform the first part of the
talk I was really interested in the

644
00:51:25,099 --> 00:51:29,779
service catalog and the frameworks
methodologies are developing I can see

645
00:51:29,779 --> 00:51:33,279
great applications of sharing these kind
of events on way to join organizations

646
00:51:33,279 --> 00:51:41,669
open source elaborate on this i think
there's a set of methodology is or

647
00:51:41,669 --> 00:51:46,598
should be sure the industry's so that we
can understand what the different types

648
00:51:46,599 --> 00:51:53,039
of attacks could be like him afterwards
streetcars and talk about that

649
00:51:53,039 --> 00:51:53,739
opportunity

650
00:51:53,739 --> 00:51:59,320
think he just say you can't she played

651
00:51:59,320 --> 00:52:10,110
he said you know that over to the slides
and then later on it's accurate on

652
00:52:10,110 --> 00:52:16,390
linkedin.com will be publishing the
PlayBook this week but what is the size

653
00:52:16,390 --> 00:52:21,960
and composition of your security team so
we have approximately 20 people in this

654
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:25,790
in this part of our security team
focuses on the program so we talked

655
00:52:25,790 --> 00:52:29,070
about today and can you talk a little
bit about the skillset areas obviously

656
00:52:29,070 --> 00:52:33,380
you have been testers what other sorts
of skill sets do you try to employ

657
00:52:33,380 --> 00:52:40,510
observed penetration testers are acts
controls we also have a program enters

658
00:52:40,510 --> 00:52:46,770
off like David execute some of the
technical aspects of over and we also

659
00:52:46,770 --> 00:52:52,820
how to respond more tourism information
security engineers deal with things like

660
00:52:52,820 --> 00:52:59,030
how we secure our production networks
and operations and we also have incident

661
00:52:59,030 --> 00:53:03,610
responders and people with experience
and and forensics and incident response

662
00:53:03,610 --> 00:53:12,030
and security monitor and developers do
you support I'm not sure sure we have

663
00:53:12,030 --> 00:53:17,770
that number gets roughly not sure I have
it

664
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:26,080
career yes here do you get a lot of
acquisitions and how do you feel as the

665
00:53:26,080 --> 00:53:31,920
new acquisitions into the pool so one of
the things that we try to do right off

666
00:53:31,920 --> 00:53:38,070
the bat is essentially officer offer or
service catalog to that position so we

667
00:53:38,070 --> 00:53:42,850
only 10 some regard we treat them like a
new client those poor organization so

668
00:53:42,850 --> 00:53:47,000
immediately though they get all the
incident response to offer free trade

669
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:50,850
they get all you know it is a security
we take over the security out we handle

670
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:55,110
all that from that side so right away we
get to know them up close and personal

671
00:53:55,110 --> 00:54:00,200
in a position to LinkedIn there's a lot
more attention I get paid to them and

672
00:54:00,200 --> 00:54:05,299
then on the assessment side what we do
is that service catalog start looking at

673
00:54:05,300 --> 00:54:13,090
points of generation and and more from
there ok we are going to be with me

674
00:54:13,090 --> 00:54:16,480
right outside if you have questions
