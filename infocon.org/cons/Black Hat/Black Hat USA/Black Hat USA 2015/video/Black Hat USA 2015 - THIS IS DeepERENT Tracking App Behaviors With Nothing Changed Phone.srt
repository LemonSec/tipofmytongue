1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,919
no word about it then they stalk what I
want to talk about is how we can analyze

2
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,740
the best and the best rebounder in a
model wears we reach employing some

3
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:16,029
challenges standard analysis and eye
protection techniques are in very

4
00:00:16,029 --> 00:00:19,820
improved their worries that under the
mother various are employing some

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:26,189
techniques to impede analysis shows that
what challenges they are best go then

6
00:00:26,189 --> 00:00:30,660
there is this environment protection
there are various challenges so now I

7
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,300
will introduce techniques we devised to
analyze it was abandoned them all we're

8
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:43,260
still getting over these challenges to
prove the effectiveness of technical

9
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,199
ability to talk and work on the emulator
and one by Dondria image and even

10
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:55,489
changed rapidly and it doesn't require
with people but a lot of existing to be

11
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:59,430
caught in it of course if you have heard
a rumor that you can do some functions

12
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:04,339
in more convenient way but there is no
problem if you don't have coverage also

13
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:08,470
distal can monitor not only specific
behaviors of target Android application

14
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:14,720
selectively such as DirecTV Dish Network
activities but also defined functions

15
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:24,020
and even the happiest in this feature is
very effective in the analysis of the

16
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:26,048
key technical this story

17
00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:30,770
eccentric inventor says Tripoli
implemented a tracer PC there are some

18
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:39,009
several reports to traitor tracing
functions and its argument but it is not

19
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:43,360
easy because the file format like Yelp
and PETM provide sufficient information

20
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:50,079
about each function arguments on various
topics is capable of providing

21
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:55,130
information to trace actual execution of
a unified message

22
00:01:55,130 --> 00:02:02,479
it argument but a lot of information to
execute that text fire due to the

23
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:06,950
structure characteristics of the Rings
temple that's why many sporting bet

24
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:11,590
though that argument structure and
external mesoderm formation studies in

25
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:17,390
both inside up with the classes of that
and then and then DMV supporting TDWP

26
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,518

27
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:25,569
protocol get used to the Android
application when we implement our center

28
00:02:25,569 --> 00:02:32,540
code analysis due to the GDP was
excellent racer with WP you can do

29
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:41,410
getting information getting hosed a
message below so we can know various and

30
00:02:41,410 --> 00:02:44,780
details about the skinny permission they
don't be silly and even under the

31
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:51,900
runtime in under a lollipop it always
and also we didn't raise exception of

32
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:57,860
the method and the various third-party
libraries that has custom ki hastam

33
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:02,840
network and we are delighted for
technological relations between called

34
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:07,090
medical weed hierarchical structure
analysis of course you can trade

35
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:11,389
protected coded by some of his kitchen
techniques such a distinction between

36
00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:14,329
the implication hiding and blessing for
action

37
00:03:14,329 --> 00:03:17,560
money comes to protect his 400th
application are using the application

38
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:25,239
techniques to hold and also I'm going to
tell you can get over again

39
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:32,230
loading a town until their system that's
injection techniques but now I'm going

40
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:37,489
to trace behave yourself with some real
Melissa stempel there

41
00:03:37,490 --> 00:03:42,670
is discovered in South Dakota State
University information such as phone

42
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:48,709
number and address IP address and it
sends the information to have important

43
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:54,130
person it is serious and iPad first
iteration step out and put corrected

44
00:03:54,130 --> 00:04:02,680
information into Jason objective with
this slideshow and lie low of this as

45
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:07,960
you can see or code is the same we
called him previously I so you can live

46
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:17,329
code very festive their destiny as you
can see anything and that each of us

47
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:21,089
three Christian three griffin et
well-known technique 400 court

48
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:21,950
protection

49
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:27,479
this is also supported by the most of
under the application 232 makes almost a

50
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:35,420
street in court fees in slide artists
assembly and compiled code of example

51
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:40,310
protected by three correction of discard
the red line but every year in slide

52
00:04:40,310 --> 00:04:45,780
highlights kodaline which is calling in
some cases this form of obligation can

53
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:52,849
be analyzed easily because though the
upstream is a simple standalone complex

54
00:04:52,850 --> 00:05:01,130
and so it takes a lot of time to analyze
the logic statically now again and the

55
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:05,510
live stream groups an example with the
pros entry analysis generally

56
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:08,120
obfuscation techniques are sold by
dynamic

57
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:12,310
analysis in our approach the three on
the station installed by trickling

58
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:16,850
stream object a combination of attacking
creation of string object and cost

59
00:05:16,850 --> 00:05:22,380
analysis can help that is on the list
because we we can see where

60
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:28,729
imposed by analyzing caused a good
position in technique is used for poor

61
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:33,099
static analysis in other words you can
analyze the code is protected by spring

62
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:41,900
trip with a static analysis tools like
baby and we can always throw trekking

63
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:48,570
member of this case of this example that
the trip this during what has lowered

64
00:05:48,570 --> 00:05:53,849
the most extreme techniques can be
analyzed with this approach and we can

65
00:05:53,850 --> 00:05:58,410
selectively trace almost all day we want
to monitor so even if the application to

66
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:03,130
create encrypted stream in a delay here
because she gripped his dream easily

67
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:12,219
because it has to create a dummy and
this example or hiding technique is also

68
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:17,810
very well known and the country to hide
my location if the app is protected by

69
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:22,630
this application we cannot see you want
me to import so this is one of the pic

70
00:06:22,630 --> 00:06:29,190
Hato 400 analysis of the only method
invocation heidi is implemented the

71
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:32,700
combination of and general election

72
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:38,070
first of all it has to be Christian
history and imposed tough re-election

73
00:06:38,070 --> 00:06:45,820
pleaded guilty to stream to involve him
so if we can trace and Java API is gonna

74
00:06:45,820 --> 00:06:55,390
be so easily this picture shows about
nada cities it is the same thing with

75
00:06:55,390 --> 00:06:59,860
this in effect in previous if you see a
red line but if you go to class method

76
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:04,340
would be on the system when it expires
class that he's involved it to load the

77
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:10,060
specific Claire run some tests and you
can also see the opposite expire is

78
00:07:10,060 --> 00:07:16,310
located in its package private territory
that he tries to load some classes from

79
00:07:16,310 --> 00:07:22,130
the dynamic know they did that so as you
can see that method invocation hired

80
00:07:22,130 --> 00:07:26,400
could be solved easily by low setting
and the list this moreover this approach

81
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,789
can help setting on us as I mentioned
people were so we can analyze this

82
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:35,130
application today that the cali we did
these laws therefore we can understand

83
00:07:35,130 --> 00:07:43,370
me happier overstated code anymore today
now I'm going to analyze attempt to

84
00:07:43,370 --> 00:07:52,130
disassemble sometime protection you have
your ass and it is almost Katie using an

85
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:57,440
amazing location Heidi of text for this
video part of temperature data sample if

86
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:04,640
you see this you can see all my
application by the way it is see the

87
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:10,099
code below you can obviously this thing
you speak happiest of the cold December

88
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:15,870
loaded expired license and immediately
and this means that class and loaded the

89
00:08:15,870 --> 00:08:20,000
class and then he performed a self
integrity checking if you see that

90
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,550
things are taking with him calling
method in which operates election and if

91
00:08:24,550 --> 00:08:26,220
you see the entries of law

92
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,420
December 1st catcher

93
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:34,920
deprecated by using kept a cash cost per
se que and then opened fire and get

94
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:43,079
along so the fire after that it created
in this subject in this point you can

95
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:51,520
pretty that populated by and compare it
with the CAW therefore you can know that

96
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:58,410
imported objects card checks and keep up
security you gene regulation of it is

97
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,969
easy

98
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:05,400
this is also checking their application
it is calling over the team SOTW

99
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:11,250
protection of the laws were still trying
to get taxed imports from Turkey manager

100
00:09:11,250 --> 00:09:17,580
and then it gets her signature object if
you try to get a vital ready for

101
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:22,070
signature value and then compare it with
the prepared by proper object using

102
00:09:22,070 --> 00:09:29,510
because now we can analyze skated code
and publication we be surprised and

103
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:39,230
honored and grateful that this approach
and now I'm going to talk about dynamic

104
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:44,030
loading we can implement steinem
according to age birthplace that you can

105
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:50,670
use a PID were supported functions of
the PBM and second ways that you can pad

106
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:54,229
for their contact over already loaded
access memory or most underrated

107
00:09:54,230 --> 00:09:57,459
protectors are using these two ways to
utilize that

108
00:09:57,459 --> 00:10:02,439
first of all if we have analyzed data
p.m. you can know that there are some

109
00:10:02,439 --> 00:10:07,319
functions and the time that slow the
growth of double layer and they do

110
00:10:07,319 --> 00:10:12,800
believe if you analyze the higher
correlation between this and you can

111
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:19,819
know that are calling the function after
all so therefore if we hope to function

112
00:10:19,819 --> 00:10:24,378
you can get a specific point of time
when it tried to Lowes desperate

113
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:33,999
dynamically approach you can you can
intervene and get many per information

114
00:10:33,999 --> 00:10:38,959
using GWT command and conquer Mount
implemented in index injected it

115
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:43,429
injected a testimonial have a privilege
of target area so we can do anything

116
00:10:43,429 --> 00:10:48,759
what a person can do so when our to the
taxonomic clothing items that cool down

117
00:10:48,759 --> 00:10:57,149
by this pastime as titanium cloning
technique this technique patches a

118
00:10:57,149 --> 00:11:01,899
partir every hour already loaded attacks
on memory using nature library normally

119
00:11:01,899 --> 00:11:06,829
that's a meeting area is memory in
memory is we don't need every are so

120
00:11:06,829 --> 00:11:11,998
protective steps are using dynamic touch
these together right permissions for a

121
00:11:11,999 --> 00:11:17,129
memory area that which he tried to pet
and getting write permission they can

122
00:11:17,129 --> 00:11:22,790
protect so I went to their staff to
protect function and counted because

123
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:30,449
memory permission to return to catch for
permission but it actually doesn't apply

124
00:11:30,449 --> 00:11:34,179
invite premature therefore a court
battle between tried to pass certain

125
00:11:34,179 --> 00:11:39,769
content that's in memory and in depth
I'm patient portal will be and then over

126
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:46,519
600 candidacy and it is trapped some
useful information is not addressed at

127
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:48,390
Codys destino

128
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:54,220
access memory address and contact with
these informations we can see that what

129
00:11:54,220 --> 00:12:04,330
content that is patchy and the beach
called try to pad and read it we don't

130
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:13,320
have time enough so I think I have to
skip it and this night is about

131
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:23,140
countries tension tension that made
actually just plug in premarket using

132
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:29,480
that injection Lexington is already
well-known technique to paying attention

133
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:35,310
system we implemented commander system
combination of GWB and attacks injection

134
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:41,869
with WP you can send the command and
receive a majority of the command this

135
00:12:41,870 --> 00:12:47,340
is like a dynamic digital extension with
the montana attention you can do

136
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:53,060
anything which a person can do with your
creative example you can correct and

137
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:57,219
monitor some informations inside of a
process or you can explore picture

138
00:12:57,220 --> 00:13:02,940
privately factory without external
support I had presented a package for

139
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:08,270
Android application at the occasion 2015
and ethically also used in wanting

140
00:13:08,270 --> 00:13:13,480
attention now we had developed a very
special functions and i cant int

141
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:18,810
analysis by restriction and various
detection using wanting to danger and

142
00:13:18,810 --> 00:13:23,189
next to each other about native recorded
racing from now my colleagues in young

143
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:33,660
children talk about it

144
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:45,430
Mario is easy but the nature is hot on
that let's see if a cuckold

145
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:58,469
for example you can find the sample bias
in the beginning of on create massive

146
00:13:58,470 --> 00:14:08,750
you can be handled create and meet the
team but there is no information that

147
00:14:08,750 --> 00:14:16,960
could identify just you can see on the
ATP were looking at the table for 10 sec

148
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:24,500
over the actual cause you can see dat
and setting I V function very sound

149
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:26,200
great

150
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:33,580
you have to work hard for finding
hand-drawn create function did also

151
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:40,390
difficult to find a job in nature with
this increased his screen is more

152
00:14:40,390 --> 00:14:49,720
difficult to analyze combined stop by we
are tracking three-way chain I see and

153
00:14:49,720 --> 00:15:01,020
find a nine being dominated in the pace
AP you cannot you can you can no native

154
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:10,220
called from at a bar code government
should call from a lady called lips e's

155
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:16,390

handling mathematical computation ru

156
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:23,240
processing mega million other operating
systems Targus keep you can literally

157
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:34,230
see you can know what to do in an $89
use communication process so if you can

158
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:45,790
find you can no communication with him
and so now I say how to travel native

159
00:15:45,790 --> 00:15:47,079
behavior

160
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:54,880
first time I said Karunanidhi from Sean
Darby put machine EVM call Jane I mess

161

arguments and we didn't tell you and

162
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:06,260
miss lewis structure as part of the meso
structure has on eighty function own

163
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:14,350
name and address that is caused by top
and DPM called animus saudis use its own

164
00:16:14,350 --> 00:16:21,769
eighty function so he's needed to trace
the space you know

165
00:16:21,769 --> 00:16:27,089
domicile in Haiti from john Payne I V
structure is required

166
00:16:27,089 --> 00:17:20,000
Dana infrastructure has a function table
top amidst the name is a nice place and

167
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:27,619
responsible top job and so on

168
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:33,500
used to mess old you can see be seen
these applesauce contract and at least

169
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:40,830
three simple no memory of arrests or
behind their own create his display

170
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:47,899
these addresses distracted from muscle
structure at TVM court in a message if

171
00:17:47,899 --> 00:17:52,850
you cut rate on a dress and high you can
easily find the actual cause such as

finalists do I stand by these
communication and report and reprocess

180
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:49,070
this diagram shows how to actual
communication is made if you want to

181

call be intrusive ABC's castle you can
call food provided by Sotheby's process

and call and talk with tribal I have
control by the driver who's obviously

183
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:09,760
over and persistent data and it goes up
to some ass their menu a track despite

184
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:16,350
the communication control and fool I'm
not too keen

185
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:24,980
controversial because he's also you talk
other purpose than stories she likes it

186
00:19:24,980 --> 00:19:32,630
is not easy because every drop ship on
Sunday so I choose the IPC Media it is

187
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:37,070
easy to obtain and many fluid
communication date because all

188
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:43,570
communications office using things so he
can we talk costume shops as shown there

189
00:19:43,570 --> 00:19:50,330
are no posts issue to track only stops
when who can protest at PPP and go and

190
00:19:50,330 --> 00:19:53,570
be buying dog you can see old to stand

reply ms turnberry over our policy we
are not abused or GDP as you can see a

198
00:20:37,470 --> 00:20:44,800
GPS state to provide a top or received
it is depending on where the GPS to use

199
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:54,010

pain or put my aunt restored push ups at

201
00:21:04,450 --> 00:21:09,660
this time a replay the data transmitted
through the bank of it is possible to

202
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:16,620
protect the information so slight change
active for storing of BDO change simple

203
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:22,659
8214 recording voice changed GPS data
and also you can change the bus

204
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:34,620
information number IMEI this easy P you
remember we usually apply now

205
00:21:34,620 --> 00:22:19,049
demonstrating out

206
00:22:19,049 --> 00:22:41,789
protect protector and if you see me baby

207
00:22:41,789 --> 00:22:50,749
there may be a blessing corruption and
decoding katydid biomedical operation

208
00:22:50,749 --> 00:23:01,499
but it was kitchen technique and its
application hiding so when you analyze

209
00:23:01,499 --> 00:23:12,830
this code it will take a lot of time so
I'm going to analyze this code to select

210
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:22,960
the trigger point he want to monitor and
enable extension this stage of play for

211
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:41,799
detection of dynamic loading and by
destruction and this one

212
00:23:41,799 --> 00:23:49,940
generating five with the repackaging so
it will install and learns the

213
00:23:49,940 --> 00:24:06,690
application automatically so you don't
have to do anything after lunch

214
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:14,580
this is about dynamic detection of
downloading so if you click this button

215
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:30,189
you can track the text into your desk
and and again that address point you

216
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:46,279
want to monitor and in this state by
click this button will be resumed

217
00:24:46,279 --> 00:24:57,309
and incapable of method is called
peripheral countries skip it and try to

218
00:24:57,309 --> 00:25:05,009
load additional tax they came so I was
doing it again in this time if you see

219
00:25:05,009 --> 00:25:21,489
that it took it with this is not
productive there is no magic of textile

220
00:25:21,489 --> 00:25:37,289
export it it's because they have their
first loaded X matter what did it matter

221
00:25:37,289 --> 00:25:42,158
has taught math class is called

222
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:54,400
very suspicious point if you see his
coat and TV

223
00:25:54,400 --> 00:26:02,580
get either there is no protection right
like a vacation this is a better mood

224
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:06,040
and authorities here

225
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:11,310
37 has value if you see below

226
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:20,889
receptions below the 710 has good value
he used and decrypt the message and

227
00:26:20,890 --> 00:26:30,690
integrate them at 02 incapable of
incredible anger so he's used to using

228
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:38,830
it and what the perot dismantling
operation so protectors menu this

229
00:26:38,830 --> 00:26:44,710
particular you'd is dynamic portal
engine and in this point you can realize

230
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:49,170
that each other better of damage

231
00:26:49,170 --> 00:27:03,890
protector so our to the repackaging so I
could evaluate different from so if you

232
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:09,910
if you if we can modify this file you
you can get complete to the impending

233
00:27:09,910 --> 00:27:12,160
death in this point

234
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:23,290
Eugene text each very well-known taken
it and you can get related coding in

235
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:31,870
Internet and you say it is open source
so I so far we can mean that's put it

236
00:27:31,870 --> 00:27:34,439
there some packing the tent and now you
can

237
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:46,350
make this protectors

238
00:27:46,350 --> 00:27:54,530
we have no time so please keep them
making called

239
00:27:54,530 --> 00:28:06,830
easily quickly and deeply so thankful
