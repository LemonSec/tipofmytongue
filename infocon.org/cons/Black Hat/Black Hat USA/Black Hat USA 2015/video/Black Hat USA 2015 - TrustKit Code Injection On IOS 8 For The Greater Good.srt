1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,279
for the session trust kit code injection
on Iowa State for the greater good with

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:14,059
our speakers are banda que era castro
and Angela jail here on thanks for

3
00:00:14,059 --> 00:00:18,470
coming this early on a presentation
about something we're very excited to

4
00:00:18,470 --> 00:00:26,038
release called trust get together we
looking at this company called

5
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,109
authorities when we build a tool to
automatically find security and privacy

6
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:37,000
issues in mobile applications and Angela
here is part of the security team at

7
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:44,309
Yahoo today we are using a new library
for I was in western it's called risky

8
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:49,649
so we're gonna have described this is
where you may want to use in your abs

9
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:55,300
and then we won't go into the details of
how it actually works its way the

10
00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:00,519
implementation is interesting and all
the things that grow in all this happens

11
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:07,820
behind the scenes as you're using it but
possible trust kids are going to surely

12
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:14,279
which is really simple is degrading
yourself meaning every file as soon as

13
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:19,520
we started working on that we really
really wanted to make sure that that was

14
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,979
going to be usable in real ants with
lots of user requirements like that

15
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:31,020
without an overall make sure that this
is something I've ever be able to use

16
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:38,600
and now some idea of how to get there we
had the opportunity to work with the

17
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:44,809
Yahoo Mobile Security games and angela
is gonna talk about health challenges

18
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:49,400
when trying to do by nine thousand

19
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:57,000
a self-cleaning it's been talked about
for years

20
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,330
pretty much everyone in the security
community agrees that it's a good thing

21
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:08,329
to do and I mean who wants to trust
hundreds of CA's where some of them are

22
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:15,140
compromised others government-owned and
yet others do BS the mobile app while

23
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,109
it's the perfect place to do

24
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:21,200
pending because he owned both declined
Sizewell service side of the

25
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:28,359
communication so i thought well this is
a great project to do and when I first

26
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,620
started to do self and then for Yahoo
Mobile apps I thought it'll be easy

27
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:38,890
street for a project maybe just had a
few lines of code to check for the right

28
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:45,559
sort of a kid then that's it all right
so I thought until I hit into some

29
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:52,850
technical challenges and operational
challenges as we shall see the first of

30
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:59,980
all what should we put in a ticket or
the public key certificate as we all

31
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:05,859
know certificate often reissued with
different extensions or expiration date

32
00:03:05,860 --> 00:03:12,440
so that there but rather to print and
public is better because not going to be

33
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:18,190
changed much but even just the public he
bids are not enough as we also need to

34
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:23,160
know the algorithm that the public is
associated with

35
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,709
together as well as the public he bids

36
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:33,370
SPK I on the subject public info and
that's what we should really be pinning

37
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:42,209
to however unfortunately yes there's no
API to in the extract at PKI certificate

38
00:03:42,209 --> 00:03:46,570
so I started looking all over the web

39
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:51,900
examples libraries and just to see how
other people are doing

40
00:03:51,900 --> 00:03:58,420
mobile pinning and i couldnt find one
that used to speak at all but most of

41
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:04,730
them are just comparing the host
certificate so and then another

42
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:13,319
challenge I am I gonna do implement this
I'm not like I don't want to go into

43
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:17,899
line and modify every single instance
and its yard connection and a nasty

44
00:04:17,899 --> 00:04:24,060
recession in all of the mobile apps that
we have and so I thought I'd be smart

45
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:29,340
and use methods whistling while I need
to do it once I'm about to get a

46
00:04:29,340 --> 00:04:36,119
transplanting that is until I hit upon
not a problem which is in you I feel

47
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:44,039
it's not using your connection or and
this year's session and so therefore

48
00:04:44,039 --> 00:04:49,820
methods whistling would not work and so
we need to intercept the color even

49
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:57,409
lower level and finally the operational
challenge thighs how they get buy-in

50
00:04:57,410 --> 00:05:04,360
from the product team looking at factors
that could cause we do want to protect

51
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:11,610
the user's data but when you say you
have this great idea that you can block

52
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:18,280
user connections they are understandably
a little nervous and say which users how

53
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:24,940
many users are we talking about and I
don't know what if we blood to run

54
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:33,830
connections and so at that solution
which is to have a report only mode that

55
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:39,370
we can gather today the first to see
what we would have been blocking before

56
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:46,320
we actually enforce the blocking and so
business can decide with the data

57
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:56,260
whether this is not so there's no
existing library that as these three

58
00:05:56,260 --> 00:06:01,570
requirements that they need and I
thought I probably have to MyLibrary

59
00:06:01,570 --> 00:06:02,880
from scratch

60
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,520
until I met up with data theorem and
they start telling them my challenges

61
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:13,440
and how we need to start this project
and he got interested and so why not

62
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:21,650
start the collaboration project and so
we are still like to thank you so we

63
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:26,789
started collaborating and only know
basically sold all these challenges

64
00:06:26,789 --> 00:06:35,840
wanting having all your network
connection and all the guys and we had

65
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:42,810
that because the way we did it up on the
back there's a lot of different if you

66
00:06:42,810 --> 00:06:48,760
can use data network connections ideas
like gets too high level in association

67
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:54,700
with you can do is to be what's
interesting about that is for anything

68
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:58,500
SSL HTTPS they're all you secure
transport to get involved she's the one

69
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,760
on the bottom right

70
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:06,430
is apples and apples addition to all
these appear in all the areas you can

71
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:10,690
use day or you support as possible it's
a cell so what we've done is we've

72
00:07:10,690 --> 00:07:17,900
extended to comply with all every
quarter and so we decided that I

73
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:22,530
something for charity to secure
transport and once you do that basically

74
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:31,239
all you hear is can take advantage of
all the conditions are predicted to

75
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:36,220
basically it works on all kind of
trouble you don't have to do anything to

76
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:41,530
find all the instances of an asshole
connection then the other thing is it's

77
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:46,320
very easy to deploy you just said you're
planning policy in the Absa manifest

78
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:56,200
just the main you want to be in your SBJ
shoes some other settings and it's all

79
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:01,670
based on the issue to be bookkeeping
which is a specification fall so if

80
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:07,140
you've done the same thing but unless
you have all these sayings and once you

81
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:12,340
put that in the manifest you're done
that's been invented we have its

82
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:20,469
beginning in July said there's no way to
get so we just have to ask what the

83
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:25,470
killers that means there's no way around
that unless you wanna write your own

84
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:34,479
so that was the best social and actually
we have a report so just like also the

85
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:38,849
fact if you're up somewhere on the
device

86
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:46,920
season unexpected safety chain will send
you reports that with which will tell

87
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:51,930
you what's going on the subject to
change it was seen and so it'll give you

88
00:08:51,930 --> 00:09:01,079
a global verge of saying are you saying
that a change in the world so we've sold

89
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:10,410
all these things the right way to really
see that is so we have a team of that

90
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:19,569
it's basically on the left have a real
phone with pre-installed quality trust

91
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:25,570
in honor of you have a broad set of 2
proxy or different connections to your

92
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:33,589
kind of minimal setup and I have an
Xcode and I was very simple over

93
00:09:33,589 --> 00:09:40,920
so-called cold out there I'm just gonna
be in store and when it does it's just a

94
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:45,680
way of you when you can connect to it
until I know when you connect to it you

95
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:50,380
can see all the traffic because the
whole setup rocking in the rough CA

96
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:53,550
strutted India

97
00:09:53,550 --> 00:10:01,339
expected and now I'm gonna do and you'll
see it pretty quick

98
00:10:01,339 --> 00:10:10,680
surfacing I'm gonna do is drag and drop
the Xcode project and then I have to

99
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:16,219
tell it's cool that I want actually been
just getting to you so you have to add a

100
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:22,020
framework and end is just setting up
your planning policy in the UPS managers

101
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:28,290
are already set it up so I'm just gonna
paste it into

102
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:34,370
my first has to go and their calculation
and inside a key you can configure

103
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:40,339
pinning and in that case something for
dinner and I'm pinning all the

104
00:10:40,339 --> 00:10:46,940
subdomains and a third of all the ashes
to ashes and also the report your eyes

105
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:59,449
report sent to the server if something
so I'm gonna rebuild the historian and

106
00:10:59,449 --> 00:11:06,439
I'm going to try to get a look at it
again and I try that you get them and

107
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:10,509
you can see anything involving then in
the logs you can see that trust these

108
00:11:10,509 --> 00:11:15,009
tickets picking up tickets trying to
find the spins and didn't find them so

109
00:11:15,009 --> 00:11:21,730
the only thing you can see the actual
report was sent as it was an issue of

110
00:11:21,730 --> 00:11:28,339
your own story bolts into myself to let
me know that something and that's pretty

111
00:11:28,339 --> 00:11:34,149
much it so that and I have it's
something you're up for all of your eyes

112
00:11:34,149 --> 00:11:45,190
and you can use it now we opened this
morning and it's also works in western

113
00:11:45,190 --> 00:11:51,550
US will talk about more than just get at
the end but for now

114
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:56,260
will give more details about how it
actually works behind the scenes and

115
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:00,260
what's interesting about it is that we
used techniques that are used on

116
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:06,430
jailbroken devices as well the exact
same function who came into cattle bones

117
00:12:06,430 --> 00:12:11,399
and other things interesting is it could
be applied to other problems in this

118
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:21,740
whole this whole idea started was when I
was released won't change we noticed was

119
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:29,000
that Apple started slowing down any
celebrities to be and there again I have

120
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:34,190
a lot of experience working on two
schools serious after eight weeks which

121
00:12:34,190 --> 00:12:39,690
also adding employees to modify on the
job device so it's used to customize

122
00:12:39,690 --> 00:12:46,730
your phone and also using security
security tools that are based on to the

123
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:51,370
substrate to have rocked on services
like a circus which tools to make it

124
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:57,459
easy to reverse engineer and Jennifer
try to understand bob's work so we gotta

125
00:12:57,459 --> 00:13:02,930
make that connection with ok no worries
I so would be able to use the same

126
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:12,170
techniques on a non jailbroken device in
a normal and now eric is gonna talk

127
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:20,969
about what it really means to have
dinner with everyone

128
00:13:20,970 --> 00:13:27,750
so before I S eight de only way that
applications interacted with dynamic

129
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:32,279
libraries with the windows that we're
installing the system like the Apple

130
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:38,540
frameworks like you were a kid or a
confrontation some few units libraries

131
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:44,149
like see collide or so you want to
create our own libraries the only thing

132
00:13:44,149 --> 00:13:48,250
that we can do would be steadily and
this was enforced by the App Store

133
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:53,759
review process because of that time
Apple leading really have a reason to

134
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:57,879
allow dynamic libraries because
application of word consists only one

135
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:02,620
single executable and because of the
sandbox there would be no way that

136
00:14:02,620 --> 00:14:07,779
applications could interact with other
applications through shared goat through

137
00:14:07,779 --> 00:14:14,319
a dynamic library so now that has
changed because Apple introduced app

138
00:14:14,319 --> 00:14:19,949
extensions which allow developers to
create functionality that it's outside

139
00:14:19,949 --> 00:14:25,250
of the application context so you can
create these things like widgets for

140
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:28,519
notification center or custom key wards

141
00:14:28,519 --> 00:14:33,879
extensions or photo 59 of these are part
of the main executable these are

142
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:38,259
separate extinct animals so made total
sense that Apple would start allowing

143
00:14:38,259 --> 00:14:43,040
dynamic libraries because especially now
that there is so much about the

144
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,399
application site on this and you can see
that as well with a las nine with

145
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:54,759
features like obtaining a slicing so
dynamic libraries help reduce the

146
00:14:54,759 --> 00:15:01,059
application site when you have signal
and what we saw that is not really

147
00:15:01,059 --> 00:15:05,839
necessary to implement an extension if
we want to use a dynamic library in our

148
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:11,500
inner project so that's what we did with
trust get so you could see if you just

149
00:15:11,500 --> 00:15:15,910
drag-and-drop our framework for project
and what's happening behind the scenes

150
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:22,069
is so I don't have already been and
she's been created in the magical binary

151
00:15:22,069 --> 00:15:28,050
that we're building that's a wrap and
it's raining a lot command structure so

152
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:31,819
if you've done some reverse engineering
or security research in iOS four hours

153
00:15:31,819 --> 00:15:32,780
then you're probably from you

154
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:42,650
we make 054 met with just the one for
iOS and stand out and so the executives

155
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:46,600
are going to interact with the dynamic
linker which is called ald which is

156
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:53,010
gonna be responsible for loading our
labor at runtime and then because we're

157
00:15:53,010 --> 00:15:58,640
in a sandbox environment Xcode gonna
package are dynamic libraries within the

158
00:15:58,640 --> 00:16:07,150
apps bundle and Wade dialed is gonna
find them is gonna use couple prefixes

159
00:16:07,150 --> 00:16:11,959
in the local structure one defense for
example the signal path with points to

160
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:19,490
the full path in the in the tabs in
within the device inside the sandbox and

161
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:24,970
then there see our path prefix that
allows for multiple applications for

162
00:16:24,970 --> 00:16:29,210
libraries but then again because we're
in a sandbox in iOS this is limited to

163
00:16:29,210 --> 00:16:33,470
only one single location which is
frameworks folder that it's created by

164
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:40,990
Xcode when will we be lower app and so
if we if we check our our application in

165
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:44,970
in a tool like macro view which allows
us to inspect the microstructure of

166
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:49,920
binary we can see that in there we have
our load command are low delivery man

167
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:57,209
referencing our trust in library and so
we see the path so it's located in the

168
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:02,700
typical that framework folder and then
if we see if we replace the value of our

169
00:17:02,700 --> 00:17:09,350
path prefix with the contents of the
loan command we can see that indeed

170
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:12,969
there is a framework for learned that
it's inside the executable path again

171
00:17:12,970 --> 00:17:19,650
that's the databse folder that its and
advise the full path to so-called we now

172
00:17:19,650 --> 00:17:23,840
know how libraries are loaded in ISA
which is no different from OS 10 but

173
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:31,610
this is kind of knew it and then we
needed something to initialize are our

174
00:17:31,610 --> 00:17:37,379
library so we can make use of something
that it's called the constructors series

175
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:42,520
can have constructors which is basically
a C function that it's called when the

176
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:43,440
lady

177
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:49,659
gets loaded by dialed in memory so and
and because this function can still get

178
00:17:49,659 --> 00:17:55,049
executed before the app starts is the
perfect place to initialize or hook's or

179
00:17:55,049 --> 00:18:00,250
or patches or replacement and if we had
any settings we can use this to to to

180
00:18:00,250 --> 00:18:04,700
initialize are settings so she see if
you look at the you four point that's

181
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:08,809
what it looks like it's again it's just
a static function with the constructor

182
00:18:08,809 --> 00:18:15,620
attribute that to make a quick recap we
when we added this dependency on a

183
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:20,840
project we were creating this load
command that will basically allows the

184
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,939
daily begin to get automatically loaded
when the app starts and then there's

185
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:32,759
gonna be constructed its gonna get cold
right after that and so basically this

186
00:18:32,759 --> 00:18:36,769
whole think it tastes garrity injection
process of our library which is

187
00:18:36,769 --> 00:18:42,990
different from what we were used to in
an environment but for now we can solve

188
00:18:42,990 --> 00:18:46,679
it with with the just a dependency
mechanism and then the only thing that

189
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:51,649
was left as ok so we need to look into
functions in to see functions which

190
00:18:51,649 --> 00:18:56,580
again is different from methods
whistling because we're trusting we're

191
00:18:56,580 --> 00:19:03,039
trying to make modifications insecure
attachment which is a CPA ca va so now

192
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:06,730
always going to tell you about a couple
of challenges that we are using the

193
00:19:06,730 --> 00:19:20,029
problems we have and how we solve it I
said yes so nice again see the first

194
00:19:20,029 --> 00:19:25,649
attempt was to just try to make a jazz
great week into an ad pages using

195
00:19:25,649 --> 00:19:34,439
existing to use which you can have to
make some modifications and trade could

196
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:38,759
sign of forcing does some said that then
you can get an A that's learning that

197
00:19:38,759 --> 00:19:44,750
week but once you try to study a crash

198
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:49,490
secure code signing and if you look at
the stack trace for the crash it's a

199
00:19:49,490 --> 00:19:56,030
very big tries to get to that it was
actually in a sec series you have

200
00:19:56,030 --> 00:20:02,950
basically the first thing is the daily
construct all the trees constructing and

201
00:20:02,950 --> 00:20:09,000
then it's going ms function and it
crashes when you call this function is

202
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:15,670
used to read before any action is used
to replace you want to replace it with

203
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:18,040
your own nation

204
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:25,220
ok with this but when you go in on a
knowledgeable converted crushes and the

205
00:20:25,220 --> 00:20:30,740
reason for that and we are going to be
detailed is basically the way substrate

206
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:35,210
function is actually modifying the very
beginning of the function in memory

207
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:39,880
replaces instructions so that when the
fishing at school they actually jumps to

208
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:42,230
your own implementation

209
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:47,910
basically itself anything which is not
something you can you not because you

210
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:53,630
can write code and executed and as a
safety mechanism that you do that

211
00:20:53,630 --> 00:21:00,770
knowledge do that unless you're just so
you know if you ever need to run a great

212
00:21:00,770 --> 00:21:01,730
week

213
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:08,630
best you can but you need to be running
a debugger but for a normal lifestyle

214
00:21:08,630 --> 00:21:15,470
it's not going to go up people don't
think I'm gonna go running it in a

215
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:18,910
debugger so there's just no way and I
trusted him failed

216
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:25,180
there's no way to make it into a normal
life story something else we tried it's

217
00:21:25,180 --> 00:21:30,100
kind of a well-known technique deleon
celebrities such an environment variable

218
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:37,830
just when you look at your library to do
it and say ok I want to replace this

219
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:44,830
again with my own function said symbol
remaining it only works with text

220
00:21:44,830 --> 00:21:51,139
palette options so you cannot modify a
private that since idea but any of the

221
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,110
dependencies

222
00:21:52,110 --> 00:22:00,939
where their sex symbols you can replace
them with a technique and an environment

223
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:05,520
environment variables is that you cannot
set an environment variable universal

224
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:15,120
next good when your listing on the App
Store there's no way you can set an

225
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:25,689
environment able to get in the way to
use that and in the last attempt is that

226
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:30,730
it turns out there have been some new
memories that also do simple remaining

227
00:22:30,730 --> 00:22:38,669
just telling celebrities but it's done
anything goes on from Chemical city to

228
00:22:38,669 --> 00:22:45,290
city does many different things it can
function just like substrate may

229
00:22:45,290 --> 00:22:51,020
actually touching also has one specific
function to do that in deposition which

230
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:56,610
gonna work on an auto mechanic and the
other one is from face book and it's the

231
00:22:56,610 --> 00:23:05,439
same thing and if you actually try to
use these works are you able to repay

232
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:14,390
symbols and make changes to going back
to just now it's going to recover how it

233
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:20,350
really works when you address key to
your ex to your school library into the

234
00:23:20,350 --> 00:23:26,409
UPS package and then a log in to your
appt so that when you add starts just

235
00:23:26,410 --> 00:23:33,040
get it also loading it is loaded and
construct or define and so that concert

236
00:23:33,040 --> 00:23:37,980
targets and when he does it gets to
being policy from the money first and

237
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:43,160
then set up some hoops and specifically
it's extending

238
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:52,830
SSL handshake which obviously they
scaled it extended to you for watching

239
00:23:52,830 --> 00:24:00,240
when using Facebook and its way as you
saw in the gym or on the only thing I

240
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:06,730
had to do was just drag and drop it
actually change the absolute this was

241
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:13,450
just all they can you tell us how it
works so you should try it out it's open

242
00:24:13,450 --> 00:24:22,890
source today very diverse in the western
and it's already on the App Store it's

243
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:30,140
not an idea it's live on the store right
now in one of the Yahoo have another and

244
00:24:30,140 --> 00:24:36,480
we're working with all the companies
interested in using as well the more

245
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,740
people use it to but also you should
check it out and let us know what you

246
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:51,870
think and hope will be useful to you as
well thanks everyone

247
00:24:51,870 --> 00:25:07,530
that's I have 15 seconds there's one
less thing if you need to do security

248
00:25:07,530 --> 00:25:13,220
research on an advertising also released
a tool to divulge asleep on the job

249
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:22,240
converse Surgical Associates which too
so don't spend days range against our

250
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:28,850
job base so it's not a threat model of
stopping in that maybe this was all

251
00:25:28,850 --> 00:25:29,840
right this wrong
