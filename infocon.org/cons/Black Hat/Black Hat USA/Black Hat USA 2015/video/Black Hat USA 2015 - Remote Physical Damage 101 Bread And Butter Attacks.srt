1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,380
so I'm gonna start off with the bad news
the bad news is that we got delayed

2
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:09,719
moving all the stuff into and missing
some parts so you're not going to get a

3
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,860
really awesome visual so you guys are
going to get the the video version so

4
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:19,039
hopefully a little bit afterwards will
set this demo demo up someplace else and

5
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:27,260
will let you guys are you guys see you
see some physical damage firsthand so so

6
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:31,269
first with the bad news and the warning
that we don't need the original morning

7
00:00:31,269 --> 00:00:35,370
was this will be a presentation on
physical damage that it was going to be

8
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:40,739
loud bangs and stuff but but now you'll
get loud bangs and stuff instead of

9
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:50,789
actual loud bangs so I just just briefly
then lately I've had a few comments that

10
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:56,480
have been doing a lot of presentations
on chemical processes and that steps up

11
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,199
and I really been neglecting the actual
power case and so I'm this one's

12
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:04,479
actually is going to be mostly geared
towards chemical and manufacturing

13
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:11,460
systems but if you like power type stuff
then over the ICS village later this

14
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,669
weekend then chocolates and then we'll
have a model of the of the West Coast

15
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:19,710
power grid they can sit down there and
trying to take out stations and trying

16
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:22,990
to destabilize the West Coast power grid
so that will be really fun if you're

17
00:01:22,990 --> 00:01:31,089
actually in the power and so he brought
us talks a lot about exploitation and he

18
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:35,689
talks about software exploitation he
says that exploitation can be described

19
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:41,820
as unexpected computation you throw
stuff in there and then goes so when you

20
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,398
start studying physical damage then
summer physical exploitation can be

21
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,810
described as unexpected physics is a
process that supposed to do something

22
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:53,710
and you the attacker are attempting to
run over there

23
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:57,229
up the process and make it do something
entirely different usually doesn't

24
00:01:57,229 --> 00:02:02,170
happen out towards anybody else so we're
we're falling in this presentation and

25
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:06,020
kinda stages of things so for those of
you that haven't seen any of my other

26
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:07,920
presentations so

27
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,400
packing process control system generally
falls during the stages of the axis

28
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,819
stage where you have to go back into the
process so you're sitting in your coffee

29
00:02:15,819 --> 00:02:20,230
shop over in france and you really
really hate some companies some wire and

30
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:23,920
you've got to actually happened across
it I'm so next go through this discovery

31
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,760
face that's where you grab all the
screenshots one-line diagrams everything

32
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:32,310
you can find this place and try to
figure out how it's physically laid out

33
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:37,590
a plan is a series of pipes valves pumps
and you need to know that when we had

34
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:43,019
the control face I'm so a process is
actually a dynamic thing so if you come

35
00:02:43,019 --> 00:02:48,540
over there and and look at it like who
hears a boiler and there is a there is a

36
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:51,700
burner and I'm just gonna create the
burner all the way up and I'm going to

37
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:55,780
make the boiler explode and all things
will will be bad that usually isn't what

38
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,970
happens usually when you crank up the
tender happens and all the pieces of

39
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:03,100
this process related in the physics
relationship so if you increase the

40
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:08,540
temperature you also increase will also
increase the pressure increased flows

41
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:12,679
etcetera and that's kinda cascaded down
through the process and set off alarms

42
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,410
shutdown refusing to kick in and all
that type of stuff so and this person

43
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:21,720
presentation your soon to do I so then
we're hitting the damage base which is

44
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,010
mostly what this is about

45
00:03:23,010 --> 00:03:27,540
and so back at black hat in 2008 I
described damage in a bunch of different

46
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,380
ways and personal attacks we spend
things exclusion attacks those types of

47
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:37,470
things but I haven't talked a lot about
the mechanism physical damage and so

48
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:42,910
we're going to be talking about that
today so this is pretty typical and and

49
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:46,980
and my day so I'm I come over there and
I like across all the things I get

50
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:50,530
through all the microcontrollers and
take some form or implants and and and

51
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:54,019
tell the people that are hardly high
full control the process and they like

52
00:03:54,019 --> 00:03:59,090
ok show me and survival thing here you
know if maybe I want you to try and make

53
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:04,920
the screw come up the back of the boat
or I'm I want you to to run one car into

54
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:09,130
another car or something like that so I
said ok Apple damage they say okay show

55
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:12,859
me the evil thing I like give me a
couple weeks and I like I thought you

56
00:04:12,859 --> 00:04:16,700
had full control and so the problem is
hollywood has

57
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:22,890
has conditioned us that once we get into
a control there's a big red button mash

58
00:04:22,890 --> 00:04:27,469
the big red button and things explode
and and and stuff goes everywhere and so

59
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:32,790
in reality you got to analyze the
process and actually actually build your

60
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:38,020
big red button so there's a lot of a lot
of tax that are specific to the process

61
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:44,330
so last year process that we we study a
lot then actually comes with a bunch of

62
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:50,760
things that says the peak reaction
temper tantrum must remain below 200

63
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,730
degrees Celsius to present prevent
physical damage and so that's something

64
00:04:55,730 --> 00:05:00,240
specific to the process I just had one a
little bit ago where they use some nasty

65
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,650
nasty nasty ass and gets gets above 40
degrees Celsius and bad stuff happens

66
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:09,900
they say it's not actually an explosion
but it's close enough that nobody else

67
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:17,500
will air every process has these
specific attacks that can happen and

68
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:20,600
most the time when you talk to engineers
so we get what we call the cell to cut

69
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,890
your problem so few there's experiment
that was done a number of years ago

70
00:05:24,890 --> 00:05:29,140
actually a cookie factory and they went
to all the engineering said ok if you

71
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:33,300
can hack into this cookie factory and
really do some damage what are you gonna

72
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,600
do this cookie factory and almost all
these years came up with the equivalent

73
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,140
of salty cookies they're like oh yes
there's this recipe for the cookies and

74
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:44,590
lots of salt to the cookie and on the
machine will put out and they'll be

75
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:51,590
salty and then they threw the end they
threw the hackers that it went through

76
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:55,239
and crashed all the people cease and the
cookie dough set up in the pipes and

77
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:58,770
then they tried with heavy water
pressure to push the cookie dough out of

78
00:05:58,770 --> 00:06:02,090
the pipes and they fight chemically
eating the cookie dough and cut the

79
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:05,419
pipes out and threw them away but in due
to new heights and so none of the

80
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:11,150
engineers actually thought about this
this very simple mechanical attack

81
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:15,390
because engineers think about the hard
problems for this process so usually the

82
00:06:15,390 --> 00:06:21,099
guys that run the process a really bad
at predicting what the what the hackers

83
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:26,640
are going to do so if you're a process
this is probably what you already have

84
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,639
so this is just the

85
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:32,629
the layout of a vinyl acetate process so
you hold all these back to your

86
00:06:32,629 --> 00:06:36,639
discovery phase and you think about the
layout of the the process but more than

87
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:40,990
that you probably have all this other
stuff too so you got one-line diagrams

88
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:44,560
are running so you know how things are
hoping there have also done your dynamic

89
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,330
manipulations so you've watched
disturbances propagate across su no

90
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:53,029
changes in this complicated crossing
cause ringing and these loops and that

91
00:06:53,029 --> 00:06:56,080
type of stuff and probably have already
pulled out pull back the lateral object

92
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,349
you know how the ladder logic works and
you've done your research and on

93
00:07:00,349 --> 00:07:04,300
particular plans and what to see how
these plans have historically failed in

94
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,620
the past so one place I was going to go
with he was like the National Chemical

95
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:15,150
Safety Board and the Gold Cup ok I'll
acetate plant and then you pull up all

96
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:17,250
the things about all the ways the
finalists

97
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:22,930
has actually gone horribly bad and you
probably also done all of your dynamic

98
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:29,499
research so you need to know how
everything goes into interrelated so if

99
00:07:29,499 --> 00:07:33,310
you touch something and it propagates
it'll probably get to all the rest of

100
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:37,819
the pieces of the process and you need
to know how that works in order to get

101
00:07:37,819 --> 00:07:41,310
it done and so marina credibility
actually doing a presentation how to

102
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:45,659
construct this this dynamic duo the
process so that if you come and disturb

103
00:07:45,659 --> 00:07:50,830
it today than at any track to the
services to all the places that it was

104
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:55,810
so let's start with considering this
process though this is a process nature

105
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,379
might that I pulled off the internet

106
00:07:57,379 --> 00:08:02,770
years and years ago people love
publishing their stuff out on the on the

107
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:06,719
internet so this is obviously a heat
exchanger leak of some sort

108
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:11,270
we have we have a team full of assets
and a tank full of basic detergents and

109
00:08:11,270 --> 00:08:15,789
some cooling water and so those are
probably there to neutralize the water

110
00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:20,789
as it's running through and so we can go
look at this and and look at different

111
00:08:20,789 --> 00:08:24,969
things so if we take take acid we put
into the pipe and basically the pipe and

112
00:08:24,969 --> 00:08:29,300
lot acid plus a basis can make a salt +
water and lots lots of heat so perhaps

113
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:33,269
we could heat up the sleeve and pushed
up through the heat exchanger there's a

114
00:08:33,269 --> 00:08:36,750
bunch of stuff that we can to ensure
that we could think about and so I'm

115
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:39,289
gonna come back to this at the end of my
presentation and

116
00:08:39,289 --> 00:08:43,759
and maybe people will have more ideas
about what they could actually do so

117
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:50,490
this was going to be the title and we'll
just switch over into this one is a

118
00:08:50,490 --> 00:08:55,279
video so this is actually something most
boesky can actually understand which is

119
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:01,500
a bootleg whiskey so we have a we have a
hot pink that's where you put all your

120
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:06,839
match for your permit at all he did up
with a with a control loop and get all

121
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:12,060
nice and hot and you can you transfer
the so-called papers over into the to

122
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:15,719
the second tank and a new cool that came
down and you start you start convincing

123
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:25,000
it and then there's pumpkin the bottom
that you pump out your alcohol so on

124
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:33,699
this particular one then I'm just going
to accept this real quick and and go

125
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:40,609
into video mode instead of doing it and
so do your life so in this particular

126
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:47,410
case I was going to show a show a steam
collapse were all year so far we put it

127
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:51,389
in so this is basically this experiment
for those are the last set of unlikely

128
00:09:51,389 --> 00:10:00,720
barrels in my in my shop before before I
came here so I'm so in this case what

129
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,209
we're going to do is we're going to for
the attack is we're going to hit up the

130
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:08,040
heat up the stuff

131
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:13,899
Stephen the tank transfer to the
transfer to the other and and then kick

132
00:10:13,899 --> 00:10:19,519
in the coil the cooling and the pressure
the pressure in the pressure increases

133
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:26,740
and you can kind of see the barrel to
barrel popping down and then eventually

134
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:31,160
the pressure in the in the pressure in
the barrels gonna get to negative enough

135
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:35,920
that the barrel actually crash which
would have made a really awesome time on

136
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:43,969
stage but fortunately unfortunately we
didn't get there so

137
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:50,180
so let's talk about the actual
mechanisms of physical damage and how

138
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:53,859
would go about this so the first thing
that usually find his place shifting

139
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:57,870
chemical reactions so one of the things
that as the attacker then you're the

140
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:03,240
Great God of all the all the pipes and
valves and and switching things and so

141
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,220
chemical reactions are supposed to take
place in things like this great big

142
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:13,019
pressure vessels that are all stamped
and raided and that type of stuff so a

143
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:16,870
lot of times these things have heating
and cooling sleeves but they also have

144
00:11:16,870 --> 00:11:20,129
all the defense's that the process
control guys building they have pressure

145
00:11:20,129 --> 00:11:23,399
relief valves in case you were pressured
him catch basins

146
00:11:23,399 --> 00:11:28,069
below them in case stuff boiled over the
top and runs into the bottom they have

147
00:11:28,069 --> 00:11:32,180
burst discs that that will relieve the
pressure for sudden pressures and they

148
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:36,120
have ratings that says we test this
thing out to so many so much pressure

149
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:41,089
and it took it so where and when
something happens is almost completely

150
00:11:41,089 --> 00:11:47,480
under control so if we have a way of a
tank and a bunch of valves and switches

151
00:11:47,480 --> 00:11:53,850
valves and pipes then when those files
are open and close are almost always the

152
00:11:53,850 --> 00:11:58,930
things that went into it you have
control up so you can eat stuff up and

153
00:11:58,930 --> 00:12:04,550
moving around so this is a pretty common
diagram we have a couple of a couple of

154
00:12:04,550 --> 00:12:09,339
different things and holding onto and
their pump through a common pipe pipe up

155
00:12:09,339 --> 00:12:13,189
into the reaction vessel so in this case
we can just reverse that and put things

156
00:12:13,189 --> 00:12:18,170
back into the holding tanks etc we could
move the chemical reaction of unreacted

157
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:23,209
stuff happened to the practical I'm off
to the left if we don't keep the heat

158
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:27,410
the take up to its reaction from church
so the problem with free shipping

159
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:31,990
chemical reactions is the heat so if you
take a bunch of unreacted chemicals out

160
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:36,819
of a out of a vessel and then move it
into the parking structure most the time

161
00:12:36,819 --> 00:12:42,779
it's not going to start reacting so so
most reactions have an activation

162
00:12:42,779 --> 00:12:46,399
temperature and so as the attacker you
have to find an alternative alternate

163
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:52,390
method of heating it up so

164
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:58,660
across a little bit more awake later so
the next mechanism of physical damage

165
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:02,709
from you talk about is what water
doesn't stop suddenly so if you have a

166
00:13:02,710 --> 00:13:06,920
bunch of stuff at your house to house
they tell you when you turn the faucet

167
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:12,540
off and then some other part of the
house here I thought that's actually a

168
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:17,430
water hammer so all the water when you
when you get off the faucet is backing

169
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:22,599
up backing up until it hits its an elbow
and you actually hear the elbow go to go

170
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:28,080
through so pressure transients are the
basis for most attacks on the piping

171
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:33,420
infrastructure so in this case you have
a pipe if the developer closes faster

172
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:38,040
than a pressure transients gonna run
from the ball back and hit and reflect

173
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:44,719
back on that so so the water moving
through the pipe is actually actually

174
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,740
actually increases exponentially with
the size of the pipes of a four inch

175
00:13:48,740 --> 00:13:52,920
pipe with turning sixty feet then you
got about 1,200 pounds of course going

176
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:57,540
there but I have a 12 inch pipe running
the same distance of about 11,000 pounds

177
00:13:57,540 --> 00:14:02,089
of stuff running in there and they're
both running it at thirty miles an hour

178
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:06,670
and it suddenly stops that's that's a
significant amount of course so whether

179
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:12,410
or not say whether or not the shock wave
forms is actually on the very last

180
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:16,199
closing part of the valve so as the
bells closing it closed a really fast

181
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:22,420
and actually touches the actually
touches the the seal of the water hammer

182
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:27,610
forms and so so we did a bunch of
experiments with with them and so you

183
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:32,090
never quite know where the water hammer
in the league this week is going to be

184
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:38,460
in this case the weakest link in one
particular case the weakest link

185
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:42,190
actually was the the seals on the bell
and so in this case for got the power to

186
00:14:42,190 --> 00:14:44,790
close the valve really fast and we're
gonna try and damaged the parking

187
00:14:44,790 --> 00:14:49,010
structure but really what happened was
was the seals blew out there only a

188
00:14:49,010 --> 00:14:53,939
little holes but at 75 psi in a big pipe
this is basically several garden hose is

189
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:58,020
worth of stuff shooting out the bottom
so in this case what happens as well

190
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:01,610
like ok start the water hammer and then
like turn off the water and the water

191
00:15:01,610 --> 00:15:07,880
wouldn't turn off and just kept spilling
out there in the front of the pipe so

192
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:12,120
I'm gonna get that so so one of the
things that you can get about water

193
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:16,730
hammers is you have this big water is
moving through the pipe and it comes to

194
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:22,110
a sudden stop a lot of energy the energy
there is almost always convert heat so

195
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,440
if you go what to wear

196
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:28,220
waterhouse actually destroyed a piping
structure inside a factory one of things

197
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:32,190
that's almost always observed is that
this water hammer is actually at the

198
00:15:32,190 --> 00:15:36,370
pipes are hot to the touch so if you
open the pipe at the water slide thru 12

199
00:15:36,370 --> 00:15:41,840
/ water / to halt its going to turn most
energy into heat opened and closed it

200
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:46,390
again as promised to hold again you get
hit again so by cycling about you can

201
00:15:46,390 --> 00:15:49,810
actually keep the chemicals which is
very useful in place shifting the

202
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:53,760
chemical reactions from from someplace
to someplace else you can reuse the

203
00:15:53,760 --> 00:16:01,730
water hammer effect actually keep the
liquid so this is a Gravity Hammer or a

204
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:05,950
Stephen Boyd collapse and so this
actually happened happened a couple of

205
00:16:05,950 --> 00:16:11,310
times in in a big coal plant plants and
so in this case what you've got is

206
00:16:11,310 --> 00:16:18,819
you've got a slug slug of steam inside
of a liquid line and so you have a cold

207
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:22,370
cold water at the top and hot water at
the bottom so if you can push the

208
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:26,110
slugger steam through though the line
what happens is that bubbled up through

209
00:16:26,110 --> 00:16:30,030
the top and as soon as this team bubble
pops through the cold water drops down

210
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:35,650
and and hits this team polo and what
this team will transition from a gas

211
00:16:35,650 --> 00:16:40,300
into a liquid and actually Creek section
and sections suck the top back down and

212
00:16:40,300 --> 00:16:45,880
slam on top so if you've got several
tons of water in the US and in the tank

213
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:49,260
then that several tons of course there
are sitting there pumping on top of it

214
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:54,950
you can also use check balance just are
you're just like your water hammer so a

215
00:16:54,950 --> 00:16:58,650
lot of times you put flow control valve
so you're so everything's been to pump

216
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:02,319
in one direction and you don't want to
come back in the other direction so the

217
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:06,579
punch kick on pumps in one direction and
the comes back and I should check out

218
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:12,049
check mail slams shut so you can also
come over there and with a with a pump

219
00:17:12,049 --> 00:17:15,918
the pump on and it caused a water hammer
by just pushing against the check valve

220
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:24,140
11 check now slam closed over and over
again so so once you besides water

221
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:31,039
hammers and you also have cases where
pipes are meant to Cairo area liquids so

222
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,140
all all speed up a little bit of some
material inputs but interesting how

223
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:39,950
things happen when I scary liquids and
gases so if you have a pipe carrying

224
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:43,720
liquids and gases and the cast is moving
at a different speed than liquid as the

225
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:47,750
gas flows over the liquid will actually
form below ripples in the in the liquid

226
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:51,240
the ripples get bigger and bigger and
bigger until they actually touch the top

227
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,990
of the touch the top of the pipe and
once they touch the top of the pipe

228
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,419
actually form a seal and they take the
water and they pushed through the pipe

229
00:17:58,419 --> 00:18:03,429
really fast as all the pressure builds
up behind it and so the hard part about

230
00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:08,269
those are actually getting the figuring
out the stuff but you can actually use

231
00:18:08,269 --> 00:18:12,960
this was caused by a slug with piston
fact so in my face live with this defect

232
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,010
you actually get this effect where you
can slide ring through the pipe and then

233
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:20,169
you get your own reactive chemical in
the middle of it and some sort of him

234
00:18:20,169 --> 00:18:25,889
perform as you close the valve early
click the flag will actually push

235
00:18:25,889 --> 00:18:29,908
against and compress the liquid and once
the liquid is compressed then the

236
00:18:29,909 --> 00:18:33,250
contrived and above its activation
temperature and you can get a chemical

237
00:18:33,250 --> 00:18:39,880
reaction so the last 1 I'm going to
cover real quick as I only have a few

238
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:45,610
more minutes is is a vacuum collapse so
we tend to build lots of things that are

239
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:49,549
around because it's really efficient and
round things take lots of positive

240
00:18:49,549 --> 00:18:54,418
pressure around things tend not to take
negative pressures well so if you look

241
00:18:54,419 --> 00:19:00,470
here we have lots of instances where
negative pressure has happened so then

242
00:19:00,470 --> 00:19:03,720
once you get the negative pressure just
like here eventually get something to

243
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:07,389
buckle on the site and everything
collapses down so you can get down to

244
00:19:07,389 --> 00:19:13,279
make it a 14 psi so esteemed collapses a
variation of a vacuum collapse where are

245
00:19:13,279 --> 00:19:17,980
you actually going to put something into
the something hot and to the to the

246
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:18,680
vessel

247
00:19:18,680 --> 00:19:22,840
take it out of the vessel and let it
cool down as the as the steam

248
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:29,320
transitions from from gas to a liquid it
creates a lot of force 2011 CCE when CEO

249
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:34,870
Steve Turner 10 water turned into its
like 51 leaders or something like that

250
00:19:34,870 --> 00:19:40,219
of steve is to get these these massive
massive pressure pressure so in this

251
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,120
team collapse

252
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:45,139
most pressure vessels are actually
treated for a perfect vacuum so you take

253
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:48,950
a big reaction vessel you're not going
to be able to collapse a big reaction

254
00:19:48,950 --> 00:19:56,310
vessel but because it will take a
perfect vacuum but while the vessel is

255
00:19:56,310 --> 00:20:04,500
stamped with a I'm going to take take a
perfect perfect vessel then all the

256
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:08,400
stuff we built onto it isn't really
rated for that and more and more after

257
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:11,810
replacing steel pipe with plastic pipe
because it's cheaper and better and all

258
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:17,879
those things so you get a vacuum within
the vacuum within the reaction vessel

259
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:22,900
and then press the and that holds but
then all the pipes and everything you

260
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:28,360
hook onto it actually crush ok and so
then the last last one that i'm gonna

261
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:33,070
run over real quick before we end up is
three-phase attacks and so a lot of

262
00:20:33,070 --> 00:20:37,389
times and industrial processes you have
you have three phases three-phase

263
00:20:37,390 --> 00:20:42,340
attacks that are three motors and pumps
that are going three face and so so

264
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:46,889
they're going around but if you actually
bring in a motor out of phase when you

265
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:51,140
bring in and around her face then
there's actually at work to bring them

266
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:56,160
both in the face and so so if you have
to generator city next to each other and

267
00:20:56,160 --> 00:20:59,860
you bring them and I know faced the same
size ones going to they're both gonna be

268
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:02,100
back to back towards each other

269
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:06,860
generator one smaller generator is going
to experience a lot more force and so

270
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,879
the classic case this experiment

271
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:13,670
Newtonian mechanics the classic case of
this was your experience

272
00:21:13,670 --> 00:21:17,030
experiment ended the I know where they
bounced the generator up and down off

273
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:20,740
the floor and broke into little pieces
and electric power gets a lot of the

274
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:25,030
three phases tackle oh but but

275
00:21:25,030 --> 00:21:29,270
the work whenever you create the torque
that actually works on the working fluid

276
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:33,660
and so this is actually a failure right
here where a three-phase attack on a

277
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:40,800
three-phase incident on a holiday water
hammer effect and so in this case the

278
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:48,000
electric power went up and down brought
up the it brought the big pump and how

279
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:52,800
to face and that big pumping water
hammer went down and destroy the piping

280
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:58,040
system so by bringing in control of the
electric power you can actually cause

281
00:21:58,040 --> 00:22:03,050
transients to happen inside of your
fluid systems so but as an attacker here

282
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:07,110
doing all this blind you have to go feel
your way and so there's a lot of what I

283
00:22:07,110 --> 00:22:13,360
spent my time looking at is how to go
what did this so this is a temp of the

284
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:17,889
bills collapsing cure but at the end you
can see that instead of the attention

285
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:21,990
going down I get a nice collapse at the
end we see a bump in a ripple going

286
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:25,270
across there and so this is actually
what happens if you put a vacuum breaker

287
00:22:25,270 --> 00:22:30,690
on top of the the the the pressure
vessel you could see the vacuum breaker

288
00:22:30,690 --> 00:22:35,150
kicking in and stop the attack and so
one of the things that we have for the

289
00:22:35,150 --> 00:22:42,240
Wii study in physical damages held
remotely are we going to spot these

290
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,880
types of defenses so that we can test
something move on and go ahead the next

291
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:51,080
thing so then i think im at a time so
then looking at looking at this

292
00:22:51,080 --> 00:22:55,159
particular one we have we have a bunch
of a bunch more attacks that we can do

293
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:59,830
it we wanted to do a vacuum collapse we
have a bunch of liquid in a tank and

294
00:22:59,830 --> 00:23:05,000
sump pumps pumps up to it and close all
the valves and trying to pump that the

295
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:08,910
take out and talk lapses we have a whole
bunch of Alice you can try to do water

296
00:23:08,910 --> 00:23:13,030
hammer cycle these things really fast
get pressure transients moving moving

297
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:16,180
around there's a lot more attacks that
we can do that here that are actually

298
00:23:16,180 --> 00:23:20,890
actually kind of the bread and butter of
things and things that the engineers

299
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:29,530
generally don't think so but that i'm
gonna open up to 22 questions and I

300
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:32,850
apologize for 44 demo not working but

301
00:23:32,850 --> 00:23:39,310
but there's the questions I'll take the
No

302
00:23:39,310 --> 00:23:43,169
set this up over the accessibility and
we will collect from there
