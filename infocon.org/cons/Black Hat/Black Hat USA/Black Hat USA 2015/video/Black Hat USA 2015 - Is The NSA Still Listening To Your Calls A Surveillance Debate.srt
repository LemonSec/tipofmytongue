1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,900
hey everyone has gone you know for those
of you were here last year this is a

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:09,130
follow-up to last year's talk that we
had to be that we had less to refocus

3
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:11,639
and with a lot of groundwork

4
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:17,779
disclosures as well as what they say is
and is not doing I'm going to try to run

5
00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:21,198
through the Internet I love you very
quickly so that we can just jump into

6
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:27,710
what we plan to talk about it now for
this session which is USA freedom act

7
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:34,790
which is an act that Congress passed
over the summer to fix so we've learned

8
00:00:34,790 --> 00:00:41,390
about so the interim RJ Cox allegedly
for the Electronic Frontier Foundation

9
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:49,170
on the celebrity civil liberties and
privacy site user privacy security stuff

10
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:56,600
as well as email privacy law Jaffer I
just recently left the government has

11
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,250
worked at the Senate Foreign Relations
Committee before that I would the House

12
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:04,260
Intelligence Committee where I did ask
oversight Howard on Cyber Intelligence

13
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,950
Sharing legislation that was just part
of the white house also working on her

14
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:13,970
belt matter it's like so and so we're
going to have a good time I primarily to

15
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,860
things I think that you know we will
definitely mentions in the new whereas a

16
00:01:17,860 --> 00:01:22,240
activities that we learned about but we
will be focusing more so on the use of

17
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,240
freedom at you know what it didn't do
anything to congress ever do anything

18
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,658
and you know it was a good or bad law or
somewhere in between so quick overview

19
00:01:32,659 --> 00:01:37,970
for those of you who you know you may
not know what you say freedom act is or

20
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:43,060
what it does and so this was a bill that
passed Congress over the summer it deals

21
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:47,220
with the Verizon order that we saw this
was an order where the government was

22
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:54,298
using section Section 215 appeared react
to coalesce Americans domestic calling

23
00:01:54,299 --> 00:01:59,470
records calling record the letter was
sent to various telco companies and then

24
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:03,600
they were mandated to end over the
dealer car calling cards are dealing on

25
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,508
records americans what the bill does it
mean just three days the first thing it

26
00:02:08,508 --> 00:02:15,000
does is it injuries is it stopped that
program mandates that when the

27
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,780
government does search or when the
government does order under Section two

28
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:22,130
paycheck they have to name what is
defined in the bill as a specific

29
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:26,510
selection there's some debate as to what
can and cannot be a specific selection

30
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:31,780
term but it introduces the idea that the
government can't just say as they were

31
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,560
all americans calling records are
relevant to the investigation and we

32
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:43,850
want the second thing it does is
introduces an amicus into the Foreign

33
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:48,239
Intelligence Surveillance Court which is
available that was established in 1978

34
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:54,410
when they when Congress first passed all
his foreign intelligence laws and what

35
00:02:54,410 --> 00:03:00,720
it does is that court that court
operates in Dec their routing judges on

36
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,340
it and they review the orders over and
filed by the government under the

37
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:10,040
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act
what if the bill does is it it does not

38
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,679
mandate but it strongly encourages the
FISA Court that they should be included

39
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:19,209
and adversary when an argument is novel
when there's a new use of the technology

40
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:21,530
is a core constitutional issue

41
00:03:21,530 --> 00:03:28,200
and when she terms in the USA freedom
act are interpreted in two ways or

42
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:34,140
different ways the third thing it does
is it introduces transparency rato the

43
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:39,609
final score is infamous for or was it a
miss for not disclosing orders highly

44
00:03:39,610 --> 00:03:45,020
secretive and for being with me for
being a rubber-stamp we've seen a lot of

45
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:50,319
the numbers of the orders modified to
lead its very low percentage that's

46
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:53,649
reflective also sometimes if I support
system where some of the others do not

47
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:59,320
go straight to the judge there are
advisers who sometimes I get a look at

48
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:04,010
those orders but it's mainly bid you
know seen as a rubber stamp third thing

49
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:09,420
the USA freedom act does it introduces
transparency requirements reporting

50
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:16,440
requirements of the government now has
to require the number of orders the

51
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:22,820
number of customer accounts that may be
affected and the lake as well as

52
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:28,680
not just the just allow for the US
government reported it also allows

53
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:34,150
companies to report and in these wide
bands you know it's something we fought

54
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:39,820
for a very narrow then we would like to
see companies report no I've received 21

55
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:45,849
and I cells but what do you say does it
is doesn't in bands cells are National

56
00:04:45,850 --> 00:04:50,260
Security Letters a formal process under
the law where the government can get

57
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:55,200
does get business records and the like
and so does this does is wide and

58
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:59,530
security line 30 to 500 every six months

59
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:05,260
solicited me three big things that the
bill does present a quick overview of

60
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:09,760
that after that I'm gonna just jump into
you know what I think and then I think

61
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:14,400
jimmy is gonna responds we're right on
time which is nice and then we'll open

62
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:20,450
it up for questions cuz I think a lot of
people it is so it is rewriting to get

63
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:24,469
two very opposite people of us together
to talk about these things I mean

64
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:32,760
sometimes it happens but it is often not
it's often not as friendly I guess I

65
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:37,550
should say so I think questions you know
for you guys to ask both of us is really

66
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:45,750
buy them so just jumping into it is a
good is it bad you know if supported the

67
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:50,790
USA freedom act up until around when the
2nd circuit IC you brought the case

68
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:55,190
against section 215 programming business
records program and we did support the

69
00:05:55,190 --> 00:06:01,270
bill up until that point we thought that
the bill and we still think the bill is

70
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:07,010
a small step but it's an important step
we've seen interactive Esprit seen you

71
00:06:07,010 --> 00:06:12,580
know a lot of the privacy actors and
civil society organisations killed that

72
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,560
illustrate you know

73
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,340
we killed so we had been killed the past
few years and cybersecurity bills will

74
00:06:18,340 --> 00:06:23,520
see you know we have been killing a lot
of these very pricey basis bills bills

75
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,520
that we think are very pricey this is a
big step for I think privacy advocates

76
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:33,930
of Syria's asians is passing that bill
rated show that you can have a very

77
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:41,250
cohesive organized sustained campaign
over two years right word on that bill

78
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:45,750
and work to reform at least this one
program of that sa started essentially

79
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:51,160
after that certain leases closures so
you had a sustained coordinated campaign

80
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:56,510
and you actually got something through
congress that's it's a big step for

81
00:06:56,510 --> 00:07:01,590
privacy advocates but you have to look
at that and have to look at the other

82
00:07:01,590 --> 00:07:05,900
side of the coin and say look at this
step is small admittedly it's it's a

83
00:07:05,900 --> 00:07:10,049
small step but I think it's a step
that's going to build its going to build

84
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:14,790
hope for further reform another one of
these programs the law that authorizes

85
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,710
one is programmed to section 702 of the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance

86
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:22,400
amendments act that you know that is a
welcome sight in 2017 about what's going

87
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:28,450
to happen to that law so where we come
from is that it is good that it is a

88
00:07:28,450 --> 00:07:37,960
small step and also that it is very
important to have a bill that narrows

89
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,640
the power of the entire community this
is the first time that's happened since

90
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:48,120
they since they wrote the original 1978
and that's i think is a big feet and

91
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,669
then do that the government has to be
specific rate we won't stand for the

92
00:07:52,669 --> 00:07:56,969
government filing very broad blanket
orders collecting our nation American

93
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:01,950
information and so I think the standard
that he was a few places on the

94
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:07,860
and mandated much narrow search and a
particular search is really important

95
00:08:07,860 --> 00:08:14,030
thing i think is also important are the
institutional changes the FISA quarries

96
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:19,539
suffers from a lot of problems right you
had a Washington Post article quoting

97
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:23,310
the former by the court judge saying
look we can't really regulate this we

98
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:27,450
rely on an essay to notify us when
something goes wrong and we try to the

99
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:31,960
gate so I think the institutional
changes in USA freedom where the court

100
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:38,179
is going to have this is not just going
to be a one-sided court anymore as well

101
00:08:38,179 --> 00:08:41,959
as the opinions will be released so if
the bill

102
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:48,120
works we should not have a significant
opinion like the secret Verizon order of

103
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:52,930
secret top secret law interpretations
section 215 kept in the closet

104
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:58,120
you know the bill says if its novel it's
a significant constitutional issue it

105
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:04,670
has to be released and so those are very
quick overview of what I think about

106
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:09,689
values of freedom and and the good
that's there but also the other side of

107
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:18,170
the coin and and looking at the marginal
end and small step out in a few

108
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:21,860
challenge with you as a freedom at the
biggest one most obvious one is like we

109
00:09:21,860 --> 00:09:25,980
were here last year about us as yeltsin
the week that we were at the conference

110
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:32,900
are the USB began attacking Isis in Iraq
and and and legend Syria in part because

111
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:39,079
I United States the Taylor Swift kemal
and we now know your later and the

112
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:45,110
threat from Isis is growing you believe
the FBI records there are skeptical of

113
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:52,880
what you believe that the FBI director
Jim Thome he says that I some 200,000

114
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:57,140
Americans in the United States about
trying to encourage them to come out

115
00:09:57,140 --> 00:10:02,380
laws encourage them to use the method of
communication to communicate with Isis

116
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:09,230
and undertake attack near the United
States rolls and so the threat of this

117
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:13,060
press proceed by the government as
described by the FBI is growing and the

118
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,670
USA freedom act takes one tool and
there's pushes out there about how

119
00:10:16,670 --> 00:10:21,530
significant a valuable tool is it takes
one to a table at a time when other

120
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:24,780
governments around the world including
in some more allies in great britain at

121
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:29,819
like to increase their own domestic
surveillance authorities as well as

122
00:10:29,820 --> 00:10:33,830
their ability to for example our boxes
of their own citizens who got a final

123
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:38,760
prices and such an interesting dynamic
we're taking steps to limit carbon is

124
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:44,330
doing as a result of that have taken
place while other movies at hops

125
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:48,280
chretien in response to the threat
environment the other people feel safe

126
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,610
read about that i think is interesting
and challenging for privacy advocates

127
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:58,220
for awhile to get have supported the
bill but ultimately I think stable but

128
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:01,850
you know I think there are reasons their
produce a freedom at 21 the reasons is

129
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:05,280
what does that entrenches

130
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:08,750
the notion that the government can and
should be quite the same item at a time

131
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,950
looking at it it puts in place a
procedure for the government to

132
00:11:11,950 --> 00:11:15,890
repeatedly go back providers and
obtained the death this all seems that

133
00:11:15,890 --> 00:11:19,420
is going to be the providers which one
of the one of the kefauver government's

134
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:24,280
perspective in the usa FedEx doesn't
require before the government go the

135
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:27,839
private sector every day or every week
or two months you've got a place last 30

136
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:28,550
days of data

137
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:32,140
the government will hold it for X amount
of time a year to what are the amount of

138
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:37,410
time was now has to the carriers as you
know in order for a given specific

139
00:11:37,410 --> 00:11:41,980
identifier and there's a real real
chance to go probably won't keep their

140
00:11:41,980 --> 00:11:45,420
business reasons keep records along
those illogical and when was the last

141
00:11:45,420 --> 00:11:50,279
time you checked your phone bill and
with all the numbers right used to back

142
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:55,519
the day I'm gonna rebuild for a lot of
calls right to call I just got a bill or

143
00:11:55,519 --> 00:12:01,279
more expensive bill bill that way
anymore by and large as a result there's

144
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:04,660
no there's less of the business records
and now they're being a pressure from

145
00:12:04,660 --> 00:12:09,000
groups like you and the private security
2010 the records the government can't

146
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,959
get I'm so so people's privacy is
protected in that sense so there's a

147
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:16,029
real question whether that'll be there
but if the data is there you've now got

148
00:12:16,029 --> 00:12:21,570
a completely clear program before 2:15
it was unclear

149
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:25,399
really get the status of certain said
look it doesn't clog the statute you say

150
00:12:25,399 --> 00:12:29,709
we get all the records now there's a
methodology and Congress explicitly

151
00:12:29,709 --> 00:12:34,459
endorsed the notion of reflection of
large amounts of medidata albeit the

152
00:12:34,459 --> 00:12:39,680
fires of of American social records
without the need for a for a full blown

153
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,949
work and so that's that's I think it's a
process that was one of the challenges

154
00:12:43,950 --> 00:12:52,290
that USA proposed for the for the
present yeah that is a couple things I

155
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:56,089
think the the turntable something that
we have all gone back on you know what

156
00:12:56,089 --> 00:12:58,630
he tells community with the government

157
00:12:58,630 --> 00:13:03,579
you know what we have right now is we
had a review groups gives me by the

158
00:13:03,579 --> 00:13:07,500
president we also had an independent
executive agency called the privacy

159
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:11,350
celebrities and oversight board say that
the program was effective

160
00:13:11,350 --> 00:13:16,270
you know we had also about three
hearings to inform the Judiciary

161
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:21,220
Committee where the metric at Bentley is
how many texts this stuff and we've

162
00:13:21,220 --> 00:13:26,399
gotten 0 the one thing we do know
section two teams used for was material

163
00:13:26,399 --> 00:13:28,360
support case where this person

164
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:38,110
I believe in San Diego send over $3,500
to I think this terrorist group in the

165
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:42,690
Middle East and so you know I think at
least on the effectiveness we haven't

166
00:13:42,690 --> 00:13:48,860
heard it we haven't really heard you say
well this is incredibly vital because it

167
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,620
stopped exercising credible because we
are using it to even social change

168
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:57,610
people think that they are doing is it
effective or not has has been settled at

169
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:03,260
least by the review groups and by still
be so I think you know if that is going

170
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:06,329
to be an argument metrics or
methodologies and the attention he

171
00:14:06,329 --> 00:14:11,949
doesn't trust that so they look a bit of
the FBI and the and the deal I put out

172
00:14:11,950 --> 00:14:18,890
of other documents that showed my nine
separate conviction actually stopping

173
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:24,630
the capabilities for you will have two
screws on whether that's a legit case or

174
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:29,339
not they laid out they've also said that
you know it stopped taxes in dozens of

175
00:14:29,339 --> 00:14:33,320
countries around the world not just the
us- and look at this thing to remember

176
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,610
about this whole question medical
options this is not a silver bullet

177
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:42,050
meant it as Berio tell you this person
going from point A to point B that's

178
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:46,660
just not it's used its its confirmatory
it's helpful to help you identify what

179
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:52,180
people can identify network analysis
right that we now can talk about that

180
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:56,660
that's done is a key part I never could
easily but that's never stopped to

181
00:14:56,660 --> 00:15:00,980
terrorist attack but its intelligence
quotient IQ dozens of pieces of

182
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,890
information but in the other and see if
you can figure out what's happening

183
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:08,050
right now the 911 Commission reports
have looked harder problem was we didn't

184
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:11,589
have all the pieces we did connect them
up with we didn't share patient we don't

185
00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:15,600
work as a collective government to know
what everybody else knew and put it

186
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,769
together to put the pieces together and
so you know method as one small piece of

187
00:15:19,769 --> 00:15:26,000
that and it's it's it's never going to
be the case of alligators to stop this

188
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,300
terrorist attack now that be

189
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:32,810
said the governor has put the call out
of his right with the with the not will

190
00:15:32,810 --> 00:15:38,319
be traveling from Colorado to New York
in that case the 215 program was used

191
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,600
against confirmatory evidence they
already had thought that he was involved

192
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:48,100
and it was it confirmed his connections
to other members of his network and so

193
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:53,110
that confirmed that it wasn't again was
little I think there are two things that

194
00:15:53,110 --> 00:16:00,420
I think that it's not that tells you
didn't have tools that the intelligence

195
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:04,130
community failed to put them together
the information was there at the

196
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:08,860
information was shared the fighting was
blamed for a lot of that but I think you

197
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:14,850
know at least what is bringing out is
the fact that when we read the 911

198
00:16:14,850 --> 00:16:18,770
Commission report we think it says that
the information was there is not about a

199
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:24,850
lack of tools read it was not about the
inability to collect all of our coin

200
00:16:24,850 --> 00:16:28,780
records to try and change and against
the perspective attack it was that CIA

201
00:16:28,780 --> 00:16:33,010
did have some information on the
plotters in Yemen FBI did have some

202
00:16:33,010 --> 00:16:42,760
information on domestic people taking
classes and sketching us around that so

203
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:45,810
I think that you know that's one thing I
don't know just step back on the

204
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:50,699
efficiency cuz I think that is going to
be very important is getting a new

205
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:54,090
methodology metric system that we've
been pushing for because right now

206
00:16:54,090 --> 00:16:57,400
everything is behind closed doors and
classified and the american public

207
00:16:57,400 --> 00:17:04,190
doesn't know doesn't know you know how
effective these programs are when we saw

208
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:08,260
when I see a mass collection of
Americans message calling records and

209
00:17:08,260 --> 00:17:13,210
then you know too many Christians say
this actually isn't reasons I'm

210
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:17,150
terrorist attacks it leaves a huge
question into you know why are we do

211
00:17:17,150 --> 00:17:22,070
and is it worth the cost rate what is
there's a huge privacy costs in knowing

212
00:17:22,069 --> 00:17:26,689
and having the assay or any intelligence
community know that you know I called my

213
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:30,780
dad about the Yankees last night and I
don't think we saw that cost benefit

214
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:36,790
analysis at all I think it came far too
late and it's it's pretty egregious rate

215
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:42,129
is an egregious collection for at least
an album that is looking citizenship so

216
00:17:42,130 --> 00:17:57,230
his passport was taken away so welcome
back love had also come back down states

217
00:17:57,230 --> 00:18:00,910
and stand and you know they would you
stand in court we'll see about that but

218
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:08,810
at this point I think it's a it's a
valid point I think the valid point that

219
00:18:08,810 --> 00:18:13,940
there are other countries on the other
side of surveillance right there we've

220
00:18:13,940 --> 00:18:17,200
seen in France and we've seen in Britain
these intelligence laws that are

221
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,820
actually expanded housewares and the USB
actually have the USA freedom but just

222
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:26,260
on the note you know what the USS it is
not doing on on citizenship and things

223
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,060
like that

224
00:18:27,060 --> 00:18:31,159
entrenching magnet program I think
that's a good point you know that I

225
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:35,430
think the question that we all ask is
what a different program exists right

226
00:18:35,430 --> 00:18:40,130
you had the 2nd circuit essentially say
that this was this falls outside the

227
00:18:40,130 --> 00:18:43,740
statute they don't touch constitutional
issues right thing they focus purely on

228
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:47,770
its statute does it just not allow it
and I think that the question you know I

229
00:18:47,770 --> 00:18:53,330
was asked myself is what there has been
another similar program and does that

230
00:18:53,330 --> 00:18:56,710
mean that we do need to reform the law
does that mean that we did he's

231
00:18:56,710 --> 00:18:59,990
introduced this idea where the
government asked to pick a specific

232
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:05,360
selection term and is it sufficiently
narrow great we try to ensure that it is

233
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,649
sufficiently narrow by including
negative causes these things and bills

234
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:12,330
that that describe what it cannot be as
well as describing

235
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:16,049
narrow categories rate of what it could
be so you know that's how that's how we

236
00:19:16,049 --> 00:19:21,250
try to attack that problem and the data
will be there I i think that's up in the

237
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:28,059
air right there so the United States
have a formal data handy right we don't

238
00:19:28,059 --> 00:19:32,470
have a form of data mandate there's
there is there are regulations that

239
00:19:32,470 --> 00:19:44,610
Mindy the keeping of calling records for
18 months long distance so we have that

240
00:19:44,610 --> 00:19:59,449
their online by the way I mean very few
people have been waiting the question of

241
00:19:59,450 --> 00:20:03,220
the data if the data will be there is a
big question I think the relationships

242
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:06,440
you know what we've seen for the
documents and what I think the everyday

243
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:11,360
Americans use when they see their
relationship between a lot of these

244
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:15,370
large corporations and the government is
that I think it will be pretty rare when

245
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:20,268
I think it'd be pretty rare if the
corporation just completely you know

246
00:20:20,269 --> 00:20:26,299
goes to celebrate I i think that that
would be rare and what it does is it

247
00:20:26,299 --> 00:20:30,320
favors a court order process rated
favors legal process and I think that is

248
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:34,820
what we're searching for and what we
need in any of this rate you're gonna

249
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:38,210
have any collection it's gotta be under
very strict legal process a

250
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:41,960
constitutional legal process and it
looked like a healthy skepticism of

251
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:47,070
Governors rails right and we all
probably do have it if the country began

252
00:20:47,070 --> 00:20:51,710
the fourth floor protection against
government against government intrusions

253
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:55,519
your private life and so it's important
to schedule an important important

254
00:20:55,519 --> 00:20:59,389
question is programs and asked why the
beginning is that is the cost benefit is

255
00:20:59,389 --> 00:21:04,229
the cost for the benefit and you know
your mouth you point out a couple of

256
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:09,490
government panels and determine that the
trail of course the government cell to

257
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:10,330
the program

258
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:13,279
and said it was worth it and I would
know that the Obama administration

259
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:17,429
continued after the rubbish didn't stop
the program right up to the minute that

260
00:21:17,429 --> 00:21:21,409
that the USA for decades past they can't
in the program i'll make plans for a

261
00:21:21,409 --> 00:21:25,990
slimming down right and then the minute
I passed the restart the program and so

262
00:21:25,990 --> 00:21:30,289
you know clearly government right in in
this administration which obviously you

263
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:36,230
know about the bush administration would
pursue more privacy paid to the lake

264
00:21:36,230 --> 00:21:40,360
believes are sold out right even though
their own panels question value and so

265
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:44,428
you know it's important be skeptical too
important to try and find a path forward

266
00:21:44,429 --> 00:21:50,039
on Hyper privacy consistent with you
know that the need of the government and

267
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:53,720
the need you want to have your
government protect your security writer

268
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:57,690
that's an important part of the city you
believe they have limited power power he

269
00:21:57,690 --> 00:22:06,659
wanted a half which one court thing to
do for you answer the question of if if

270
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:10,929
nothing else there had been a better fit
right in the cost-benefit debate in

271
00:22:10,929 --> 00:22:14,450
congress right it resulted in the
passage of legislation that ultimately

272
00:22:14,450 --> 00:22:19,600
dozen different political preference of
a lot of activists right but in trying

273
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:24,500
to program in a much more limited scope
down when I put back on that and say it

274
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:29,980
does get rid of the programs where the
government does not have a particular

275
00:22:29,980 --> 00:22:38,340
name does not have a particular you know
I person so I can I think that is that

276
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:41,178
it was not the ultimate goal for that
legislation I think that was one of

277
00:22:41,179 --> 00:22:43,990
those schools I think there was read the
passage of that bill essentially

278
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:48,389
acknowledges both on the government and
cause they you had different government

279
00:22:48,389 --> 00:22:51,340
did he say different things but you did
have the president support the bill you

280
00:22:51,340 --> 00:22:54,769
had the DNI support the Director of
National Intelligence support the bill

281
00:22:54,769 --> 00:23:03,159
as well as the NSA chief and I think
that lovely letter that support of the

282
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:07,909
bill noted the potential problems with
and the challenges posed a security but

283
00:23:07,909 --> 00:23:12,200
did say it would continue necessary
operations and that it would not

284
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:16,210
contribute to our national security and
so

285
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:20,830
I think that's one of the questions of
it does and these programs right and you

286
00:23:20,830 --> 00:23:25,179
know I have no doubt that there probably
were very similar programs we have

287
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:29,220
reports to try to salvage at the New
York Times saying that there was

288
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:32,110
potentially a similar program and
financial records so I think that it

289
00:23:32,110 --> 00:23:35,949
kind of does it does to lead to delete
excuse me it does get rid of those

290
00:23:35,950 --> 00:23:40,630
programs this book collection programs
and the debate is the true debate I

291
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:46,140
think we're both such fine touching on
is how it now is specific selection is

292
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:50,880
the question and you know I think that a
lot of people who follow you know where

293
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,480
the individual private organizations
were right there was a split on using

294
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:57,780
Freedom Act where you say you had some
private organizations support the bill

295
00:23:57,780 --> 00:24:03,129
is not support the bill and a lot of it
hinged on how you interpreted specifics

296
00:24:03,130 --> 00:24:08,060
and how narrow of the records using the
government could get with it and you

297
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:12,389
know that is it's a key term in the bill
and we will see how the FISA Court

298
00:24:12,390 --> 00:24:17,420
interprets it and how it gets and how it
develops so I think we should take

299
00:24:17,420 --> 00:24:24,710
questions on the limited to 250 medicare
private talk about contents reveals 702

300
00:24:24,710 --> 00:24:29,950
clashes outside United States so if you
wanna ask questions we'd love to take

301
00:24:29,950 --> 00:24:40,640
them and we get to go back and forth in
front of you guys I questions

302
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:48,380
we can repeat the questions to a couple
of questions actually one about the

303
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:54,350
surveillance of calls telephone records
is the large clearly stage like a

304
00:24:54,350 --> 00:25:01,290
traditional cell phone calls from these
employers like art as it also player is

305
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:05,480
there any ambiguity return calls made
using non-traditional a Google Voice

306
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:12,760
over IP systems yes I think and I think
the law made for why there was a law was

307
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:15,690
it in some ways expanded what they
thought they believe they can get

308
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:21,890
expanded all forms of communication
beyond for what what traditionally used

309
00:25:21,890 --> 00:25:25,490
for inside the government's looking to
get more under the new USA feeding

310
00:25:25,490 --> 00:25:30,480
program and they did in the 213 program
that I don't think I that's a question I

311
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:34,530
don't think so when it comes to call
records call records are defies

312
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:38,730
definition of call records to find quite
narrowly definitely call records it has

313
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:46,190
to be either a person place or person
and individual action individual sees me

314
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:52,380
not a person because obviously the whole
corporate people are persons so it has

315
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:57,620
to be an individual person has been
individuals so the call records call

316
00:25:57,620 --> 00:26:02,800
records it's quite narrow I think its
actual records yeah like I P so it

317
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:08,070
depends on the answer is it depends on
the term that they're using right they

318
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:15,740
can use a temporary sign at work address
but if they're collecting too much the

319
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:20,740
court will not the court isn't supposed
to allow it also that question if it

320
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:24,310
does come up should be public that I
think that's the question that hit the

321
00:26:24,310 --> 00:26:27,690
spot on how you interpret the terms that
are going to be used in how the

322
00:26:27,690 --> 00:26:31,970
government is interpreted in terms so
your question I think exactly to the

323
00:26:31,970 --> 00:26:38,210
transparency requirements in the bill we
should if there is an order using an IP

324
00:26:38,210 --> 00:26:38,930
address using

325
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:44,250
a temporary network address and it's
quite broad towards a new application or

326
00:26:44,250 --> 00:26:50,410
significant in any way we will deal to
be clear on the 215 program that the

327
00:26:50,410 --> 00:26:53,810
government that you know we have we
learned about collecting phone records

328
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:57,980
now he was a freedom they will have the
the law does permit a broader scope and

329
00:26:57,980 --> 00:27:02,670
it goes beyond called yet I would say
though it always went beyond color

330
00:27:02,670 --> 00:27:06,750
records rate you had in the statute the
statute of the statue at the statutes

331
00:27:06,750 --> 00:27:17,150
they were using it so we'll see if they
expanded to more like a communication

332
00:27:17,150 --> 00:27:23,250
then gets into totally different much
broader spectrum of data can be anything

333
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:28,040
I remember you were talking about just
the back of the communication of the

334
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:28,700
content

335
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:35,140
authorities to my next question is
aboard the actual content so how does

336
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:42,340
the existing law that specific about
applies to the Internet traffic patterns

337
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:46,050
doesn't help that a player is it too
broad

338
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:53,680
so we have very different visions you
can go first look historically the five

339
00:27:53,680 --> 00:27:54,580
along right

340
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:58,970
define precisely the type of technology
use and where the people were located

341
00:27:58,970 --> 00:28:04,220
and so prices would generally applies to
threaten Americans communications today

342
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:09,500
even and there's the FISA Amendments Act
which fell to foreigners were looking

343
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:13,610
outside the united states and their the
collections much broader and more while

344
00:28:13,610 --> 00:28:17,610
the office in that collection you will
get confused with those foreigners

345
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:22,110
overseas we're targeting you get the
continent of communications for american

346
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:24,629
Metal where they located the world
within the United States or outside

347
00:28:24,630 --> 00:28:28,100
United States you have to go get a court
order based on probable cause to believe

348
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:33,219
in the contest to believe that their
reform power tool for power purchase

349
00:28:33,220 --> 00:28:39,500
fire terrorist or criminal court order
you believe it the reason probably the

350
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:43,560
pricing itself essentially amounts wait
for the map warrant or very simple

351
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,480
Analog

352
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:50,620
as its not the point of contact for
details

353
00:28:50,620 --> 00:28:56,139
item that is over is that is an
intuitive for intelligence surveillance

354
00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:01,290
this is as I said we're gonna have very
different interpretations of it because

355
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:08,090
702 yep this is dealing with a gated
against USA on section 702 it is

356
00:29:08,090 --> 00:29:14,280
intended to target foreigners and it is
intended for foreign collection but what

357
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:19,790
we're seeing and what was release is
that there is a tremendous amount of

358
00:29:19,790 --> 00:29:26,340
Americans content being sucked in on the
searches and by the searches that you

359
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:29,428
know we think that there are certain the
constitutional protections I should be

360
00:29:29,429 --> 00:29:33,340
in play that there should be a higher
standard for that statute because of the

361
00:29:33,340 --> 00:29:36,439
fact that you know we hear the
government agency that we don't target

362
00:29:36,440 --> 00:29:40,910
americans we are the government say that
this is just on elections illegal the

363
00:29:40,910 --> 00:29:46,049
lawsuit under the under that law but the
law also allows for a tremendous amount

364
00:29:46,049 --> 00:29:47,970
incidentally collection

365
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:53,960
every kind of surveillance and you get a
traditional right from a courtyard I

366
00:29:53,960 --> 00:30:01,480
might add your phone or a criminal right
everybody else that's also because of

367
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:07,809
last year but we've all seen in casino
right where I were in Vegas on the phone

368
00:30:07,809 --> 00:30:10,120
they're talking about you know whenever
trade or business

369
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:14,260
drops off the line and then the guys on
the phone to happen there talk about

370
00:30:14,260 --> 00:30:16,920
about the mafia business

371
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:23,010
the government is always play in this
game you know collecting unintentionally

372
00:30:23,010 --> 00:30:27,080
collecting information that is relevant
to that thing and so in the case of

373
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:35,220
americans we do we do this if we don't
do the same way the wiretap on or off

374
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:39,610
all we do is we redact out america's
information when it's collected if it's

375
00:30:39,610 --> 00:30:42,580
not for intelligence you don't keep it
up to you to keep your loan for

376
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:47,929
intelligence information and if it's
relevant understand that submission so

377
00:30:47,930 --> 00:30:51,970
there are protections but it's a
different kind of message it's a very

378
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:58,020
different kind of example you had a
warrant that was specific details to

379
00:30:58,020 --> 00:31:02,030
your spying on what you aim to get as
well as being reviewed by a judge ray

380
00:31:02,030 --> 00:31:06,360
when it comes to section 702 what we see
is certifications that judges don't see

381
00:31:06,360 --> 00:31:13,860
and are sent over to Internet Service
Providers we're targeting terrorists

382
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:20,800
overseas which which have been disclosed
actually been disclosed by the

383
00:31:20,800 --> 00:31:24,639
government so we we can kind of talk
about that and those who are these very

384
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:28,240
broad categories that are submitted to
the governor's seat of government that

385
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:37,230
are you know the real issue is a process
where the content that you in fact that

386
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,550
when you send off one of these
certifications are going to have a

387
00:31:39,550 --> 00:31:40,330
tremendous

388
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:45,419
the collection right in the casino
example is going to be much smaller

389
00:31:45,420 --> 00:31:50,310
because you say exactly what you're
searching for what you want to get what

390
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:54,620
you came to get where you can even
search whereas with 7:02 you know we

391
00:31:54,620 --> 00:32:00,610
don't have many the standards we have
broad category we have a we think we're

392
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:04,110
gonna do significant purpose right you
know we think you'll get this but beyond

393
00:32:04,110 --> 00:32:07,409
that we don't really have a neutral
magistrate looking at

394
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:12,850
the education and the exact that's huge

395
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:17,610
the first to tell you know i i dont know
so part of my job is reading a lot of a

396
00:32:17,610 --> 00:32:21,300
lot of these documents right in the
policies of the government foreign

397
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:27,940
intelligence to find quite broadly in
the features that was talking about this

398
00:32:27,940 --> 00:32:34,830
you know when you do collect too much
actors in some instances you know the

399
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:40,840
last year right there are two examples I
love pointing to one is it allows for

400
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:47,610
the procedures allow for their retention
American communications a technical data

401
00:32:47,610 --> 00:32:53,159
base reason and the way they just do a
technical data bases defined as any

402
00:32:53,160 --> 00:33:00,150
maintenance or ability to keep the data
rates like this is that way its

403
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:01,700
definition

404
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:05,870
encryption great anything that is
encrypted there's no analysis there's a

405
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:11,820
such an assumption essentially that if
you're using the reason why that is

406
00:33:11,820 --> 00:33:16,120
stakes if you're trying to think that
might be right because you need to get

407
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:19,540
to where you can you talk right using
brute force wherever I thought of using

408
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:24,710
it's not it's not listed but the time is
four ever so for the encryption

409
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:30,760
encryption clause allows for forever
there's no time limit on when you can

410
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:36,060
and cannot do if you were able to show
that it wasn't Americans encrypted

411
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:39,590
communications I think he got you know
you may have an argument they're really

412
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:42,949
we could do this

413
00:33:42,950 --> 00:33:47,850
my question is we

414
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:52,928
with the freedom act rate that's what
the freedom act we saw lot of outcry

415
00:33:52,929 --> 00:34:00,700
from you know congress things like that
about telecommunication records being

416
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:07,200
stored but when this normally happen
there is a lot of other even more

417
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:16,070
privacy I guess you could call them
violations and I'm just wondering why we

418
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:23,139
haven't heard that from lawmakers it's
all about phone records and my my second

419
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:30,579
question is where security I i see the
value of mass collection of data and

420
00:34:30,579 --> 00:34:35,109
training drill intelligence from in just
wondering each year individual

421
00:34:35,109 --> 00:34:43,009
philosophies on intelligence gathering I
definitely some value and intelligence

422
00:34:43,010 --> 00:34:46,800
from surveillance but at a certain point
you know I don't want the government

423
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:51,500
looking at me through my cell phone
camera something so just thoughts there

424
00:34:51,500 --> 00:35:00,220
yes sure on the on the first line my
answer I've done that cause it was my

425
00:35:00,220 --> 00:35:04,000
answer is that I think there are two
answers one is that Congress is

426
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:08,740
following the league's so you had
section 215 come out congress outraged

427
00:35:08,740 --> 00:35:09,868
it took them two years

428
00:35:09,869 --> 00:35:13,170
well it took him two years to learn
about it right cause some of the members

429
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:16,630
are saying they didn't even know about
it and then also figure out what to do

430
00:35:16,630 --> 00:35:22,040
about it I think what we're seeing is
congress trail behind early trade so

431
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:28,700
after the Horizon League you had a
disclosure along discussing section 702

432
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:32,520
and what we've been talking about and
what we're seeing you know what I'm

433
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:34,740
seeing a DFF when I talk to

434
00:35:34,740 --> 00:35:40,450
therein and education they had been an
education-based right probably for the

435
00:35:40,450 --> 00:35:46,700
past at least six or seven months trying
to get a grasp grasp on what is how

436
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:54,419
incredibly invasive potentially is but
that Congress is starting to look at

437
00:35:54,420 --> 00:35:58,140
section 702 and that you know people are
certainly gives getting geared up and

438
00:35:58,140 --> 00:36:02,450
trying to figure out what is going to
happen when that walks buyers 2017

439
00:36:02,450 --> 00:36:07,319
the other thing is the second answer
when I talk about is on the encryption

440
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:11,320
on some of the back doors i mean you
have seen the house more on it I don't

441
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:14,930
think I've seen the senate you know when
I try to remember I don't think I've

442
00:36:14,930 --> 00:36:17,879
seen the senate really looked too much
into those issues may be there couple

443
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:23,860
hearings but in the house will be in see
in our bills being presented we saw

444
00:36:23,860 --> 00:36:30,140
actually two amendments get attached to
the house appropriations bills

445
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:36,720
essentially very vocally saying you
should not have back towards technology

446
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:45,868
products and things like that so you
know it's there in the house I'll try it

447
00:36:45,869 --> 00:36:50,970
so jumping into just so another great
question that's a question you know I

448
00:36:50,970 --> 00:36:56,209
think the core issue if I were still at
the core issue and the core problem it's

449
00:36:56,210 --> 00:37:02,510
that after September 11 we saw as shit
right and that shift was from targeted

450
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:09,800
surveillance particular surveillance a
much more narrow smaller after more into

451
00:37:09,800 --> 00:37:14,780
we need to collect it all we need to
make sure that we have so much

452
00:37:14,780 --> 00:37:18,410
information that we can run metrics on
it that we could figure out who was

453
00:37:18,410 --> 00:37:23,290
talking to all performed intelligence
purpose but we know that definition is

454
00:37:23,290 --> 00:37:27,130
quite broad so you know i think that
that is the huge shift and you know my

455
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:33,050
Syria on it is that my theory on it is
that I think we've gone you know far too

456
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:33,859
wide

457
00:37:33,859 --> 00:37:36,500
what we've seen from the disclosures
will be seen from a lot of the court

458
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:39,990
orders is just a massive amount of

459
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:45,649
occasions and data entry of american
communications right time to focus on

460
00:37:45,650 --> 00:37:49,470
Americans data solely because they're
very strong arguments when the

461
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:53,750
Constitution kicks and although I think
it's it's it is harder to talk about

462
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:57,490
hard I think they're certain
international law principles that the

463
00:37:57,490 --> 00:38:03,609
USB know probably should follow but has
not signed onto but I think that that's

464
00:38:03,610 --> 00:38:07,730
that is how I would distill what has
happened and what we need to do is you

465
00:38:07,730 --> 00:38:12,520
know what's at least precipitate he
catalyze national conversation on some

466
00:38:12,520 --> 00:38:12,970
of these things

467
00:38:12,970 --> 00:38:16,520
catalyst composition all these things
but at least we're talking about them

468
00:38:16,520 --> 00:38:19,960
you know at least the polls show that
Americans now know what the third party

469
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:23,800
doctrine is right you know people are
understanding what daddy give over and

470
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:26,820
how that implicated with government
surveillance as well as corporates or

471
00:38:26,820 --> 00:38:32,160
companies are also a huge amount of data
on us so i think that you know is is my

472
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:37,049
answer to that is that we should find a
way and we can find a way because there

473
00:38:37,050 --> 00:38:45,250
is a way to clamp down and to narrow
back the ability to search for the

474
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:50,210
ability to collect all this information
we should have the confidence to find a

475
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:53,550
particular person we should have the
confidence to make sure that we don't

476
00:38:53,550 --> 00:38:57,930
have to set everything up on a fiber
optic cable that we have covert agents

477
00:38:57,930 --> 00:39:01,560
doing work to make sure that we don't
have to do that we had very narrowly

478
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:06,880
targeted potentially computer
exploration stuff or we have narrowly

479
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:14,840
targeted programs and activities instead
of this just masculine dude you guys for

480
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:15,950
their side

481
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:22,500
yes i was just curious if when or if you
think there will actually be in actual

482
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:27,970
review through the courts of the
constitutionality of these programs so

483
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:32,850
so you're the 215 program was reviewed
by the second circuit they determined it

484
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:36,980
was it didn't it didn't have the stature
apartment did address the constitutional

485
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:41,890
issue there's going to be there already
ongoing about cell phone location data

486
00:39:41,890 --> 00:39:46,730
just like that earlier today we were
preparing for this look at the courts of

487
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:51,210
the courts consider these issues we we
have to litigate the 702 program with

488
00:39:51,210 --> 00:39:58,900
Yahoo in the FISA Court litigation
declassified in 2009 2008 by the fact

489
00:39:58,900 --> 00:40:03,080
allegation the name of the plotters
declassify that's the stone leagues and

490
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:07,069
we both the FISA Court itself as well as
an advisor for review in the second

491
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:11,940
member case before that core in both
cases the government one that won that

492
00:40:11,940 --> 00:40:14,970
argument that the question was
reasonable under the Fourth Amendment

493
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:19,169
even this brought under Article action
that the market so concerned about the

494
00:40:19,170 --> 00:40:25,660
dramatic haitians is reasonable that
didn't go to the Supreme Court Yahoo

495
00:40:25,660 --> 00:40:31,170
judges that's right three times but of
course you could have heard you by the

496
00:40:31,170 --> 00:40:38,270
by the way they didn't do that but
you're right but if you chose not to

497
00:40:38,270 --> 00:40:44,950
have lost you know twice but you know I
think it is a very real possibility I

498
00:40:44,950 --> 00:40:47,890
could happen and I think we'll see what
happens but you know the courts have

499
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:51,670
generally given the government fairly
broadly when it comes to national

500
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:57,790
surveillance particularly when congress
endorse whether it's in the USA feed

501
00:40:57,790 --> 00:41:02,390
imaginable limited for more broader
former 7024 tends to give pretty pretty

502
00:41:02,390 --> 00:41:09,330
badly wanted to question two questions
actually so the person is it seems like

503
00:41:09,330 --> 00:41:13,940
these Western countries that you
mentioned France UK United States show

504
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:19,440
you are passing these sweeping domestic
surveillance laws because terrorism

505
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:26,440
realistically do you ever see a point
where A Western administration would say

506
00:41:26,440 --> 00:41:30,450
you know what terrorism isn't actually
that much more threatening or we can

507
00:41:30,450 --> 00:41:36,790
sunset these provisions first part the
second part related is it seems like I'm

508
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:41,110
hearing that the metric being used to
measure these are kind of way these

509
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:46,290
programs is well if we can stop one
terrorist attack we should do it and so

510
00:41:46,290 --> 00:41:51,240
almost every all the cost is being
weighed against with it

511
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:54,359
couldn't stop the terrorist attack or
can we prevent a terrorist attack I

512
00:41:54,360 --> 00:42:00,270
think even said that while these the
medicare programs would necessarily stop

513
00:42:00,270 --> 00:42:03,119
an attack but they're hopeful so you
know what

514
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:07,320
helpful if every American were camera
and microphone all the time and if

515
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:11,460
that's the metric like if we can stop
one terrorist attack then why wouldn't

516
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:15,880
that be reasonable as well and that's
exactly why you kind of have to step

517
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:24,440
back from the FCC model great cuz if it
was efficacious to just tap phones

518
00:42:24,440 --> 00:42:28,310
government would probably try to make an
argument like that on the first one I

519
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:34,529
can there be something so that the
picture that did sunset for about 24

520
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:39,130
hours before congress couldn't get its
act together and so it did expire for a

521
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:44,790
little bit and then it was rebooted so I
think that there can be a son said I

522
00:42:44,790 --> 00:42:50,759
think that would you point to is an
issue may be the issue of our time right

523
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,790
if you look at the number of
prosecutions for a terrorist-related

524
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:58,380
charges by the DOJ it's in the annual
report it's always something like less

525
00:42:58,380 --> 00:43:02,700
than one percent right the DOJ is
generally charging a majority of

526
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:07,140
narcotics and drug trafficking cases so
I think there is just something you know

527
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:14,670
about you know how humans how we respond
to a terrorist sorry we have this whole

528
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:19,010
lone wolf idea thats going there's a
provision in a check that called the

529
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:23,380
lone wolf provision that has never been
used I mean I think that my answer is

530
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:26,660
yes I think that there is going to be a
time in there is going through a

531
00:43:26,660 --> 00:43:30,299
revaluation of all those laws I think
you saw that with the USA freedom acts

532
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:37,290
and with what the Patriots ostensible II
was being used for it to collect so I

533
00:43:37,290 --> 00:43:40,430
think the answer is yes and I think
we're in that period revaluation and

534
00:43:40,430 --> 00:43:44,299
we'll have more points out that a number
of these laws were to have something

535
00:43:44,300 --> 00:43:46,350
built in the USA PATRIOT Act

536
00:43:46,350 --> 00:43:49,940
911 had some spilled into some of those
things were made permanent

537
00:43:49,940 --> 00:43:53,630
some of them are still off and a part of
this

538
00:43:53,630 --> 00:43:57,519
sunset every few years harken back to
the sides were revisited that the

539
00:43:57,519 --> 00:44:01,970
trigger really the 215 revisiting it
beside the sort of the Lisa came out

540
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:07,459
where the fact that it was going to go
away completely and so our path forward

541
00:44:07,460 --> 00:44:11,230
so there are some things build it is
something that do help with that

542
00:44:11,230 --> 00:44:16,690
ongoing question of when the war on
terror if ever right is everything the

543
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:21,109
president made clear that it is that it
can and should come to an end in

544
00:44:21,109 --> 00:44:23,170
Shiprock coming in soon

545
00:44:23,170 --> 00:44:25,900
couple of years ago you said these
things were you know we're coming

546
00:44:25,900 --> 00:44:31,309
towards the end of that effort it may be
time to revise or repeal the underlying

547
00:44:31,309 --> 00:44:35,009
authorization for use of military force
now of course things have changed since

548
00:44:35,009 --> 00:44:39,950
then we've got in that entire conflict
this administration's now in an actual

549
00:44:39,950 --> 00:44:44,649
shooting war albeit a limited one with
ice and so you know it's hard to know

550
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:48,619
when that Tara struggles wait up the
government could would be willing to

551
00:44:48,619 --> 00:44:51,730
give up some of the towers or the
congress aside support

552
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:56,150
powers away but of course the risk is
hot right and it's easy today for us to

553
00:44:56,150 --> 00:45:00,579
think about and forget about how
catastrophic and how deeply we all the

554
00:45:00,579 --> 00:45:05,130
title of the tax-writing dale's planes
for those buildings down in the country

555
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:09,019
was in complete shock 3,000 people three
thousand-plus people lost their lives

556
00:45:09,019 --> 00:45:14,538
that day and you know it's hard to
remember that now you know thirty years

557
00:45:14,539 --> 00:45:19,490
removed from that but you know I think
we'll just see but i think is right that

558
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:22,459
we're going to process them as you get
further away from those catastrophic

559
00:45:22,460 --> 00:45:27,269
type of tax it is it is easier for
people to think about how you might

560
00:45:27,269 --> 00:45:32,140
limit collection how you might they
might take steps to to to do that

561
00:45:32,140 --> 00:45:36,710
course the challenges you know if you
don't make if you make if you don't put

562
00:45:36,710 --> 00:45:39,079
in place of the white walls now right

563
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:44,609
you run the risk that you legislate and
have a crisis about the most good idea

564
00:45:44,609 --> 00:45:48,569
that game because of a crisis right so
as we talk about things like going dark

565
00:45:48,569 --> 00:45:52,180
and encryption I think it's important
that we come together now before there's

566
00:45:52,180 --> 00:45:56,589
a terrorist attack or a real problem
where you're going to legislate against

567
00:45:56,589 --> 00:46:01,140
a very tough to get really bad loss if
you're looking to play privacy the time

568
00:46:01,140 --> 00:46:12,368
active now rather than waiting for the
Castro debate about this topic even even

569
00:46:12,369 --> 00:46:17,809
here today there's a lot of throwing
around terms like a national security

570
00:46:17,809 --> 00:46:26,359
threat of terrorism are typical examples
of Isis or al-qaeda in Turkey brought to

571
00:46:26,359 --> 00:46:33,098
mind were really think this is being
used much more broadly against you know

572
00:46:33,099 --> 00:46:38,440
peace out of this animal rights activist
we're just a camp on Occupy Wall Street

573
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:46,309
person a whistleblower and the debate is
so often about you know protecting

574
00:46:46,309 --> 00:46:51,990
against these real terrorist threat vs
Inter protecting privacy and very little

575
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:59,140
about what is a legitimate terrorism
threat and whether that's being

576
00:46:59,140 --> 00:47:05,879
overstepped and you know we have a long
history of overstepping that and why

577
00:47:05,880 --> 00:47:11,329
doesn't that get more scrutiny and is a
FISA Court in this new scheme gonna be

578
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:17,759
considering that as well so what you put
out a very good point which is that this

579
00:47:17,759 --> 00:47:21,329
sexual motivated there is a viable
alright with these disclosures that the

580
00:47:21,329 --> 00:47:25,980
US government surveilling domestic
activists morally King junior right jane

581
00:47:25,980 --> 00:47:29,369
fonda right that's what prompted these
laws restrict orkut surveilled back in

582
00:47:29,369 --> 00:47:34,059
the nineteen seventies and so what was
it about the snow disclosures we haven't

583
00:47:34,059 --> 00:47:38,180
seen evidence of that in the snow
disclosure that there's no there's broad

584
00:47:38,180 --> 00:47:42,149
surveillance of domestic political
opposition or the lack of the nixon type

585
00:47:42,150 --> 00:47:46,210
activities in the current Fletcher
present haven't seen that are happening

586
00:47:46,210 --> 00:47:49,380
right from what I've seen inside the
government I don't see that happening

587
00:47:49,380 --> 00:47:52,269
but you know there's there's a
possibility

588
00:47:52,269 --> 00:47:55,899
the question you raise the visibility
which is how broadly defined you define

589
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:59,990
these terms terrorism is just a surety
and how they're being used and least in

590
00:47:59,990 --> 00:48:03,279
the current wave but we've seen in the
in the in the course of a destroyed by

591
00:48:03,279 --> 00:48:04,339
the fire

592
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:06,200
doing under 702 is going out

593
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:10,689
foreigners overseas who presented for
intelligence trapped by spies and

594
00:48:10,690 --> 00:48:15,170
terrorists the like not domestic peace
activist and in fact the 702 laws we've

595
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:18,990
talked about a little bit required you
to go get a federal court order whether

596
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:23,189
from a 504 or from a criminal court to
serve any american for any purposes you

597
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:27,890
have to find a belief that there are
domestic terrorism crime and suppression

598
00:48:27,890 --> 00:48:32,040
of well you know these animal allies had
engaged the stairs mirror back in the

599
00:48:32,040 --> 00:48:36,930
back in the eighties right we remember
the attacks on the Colorado ski resorts

600
00:48:36,930 --> 00:48:41,690
in like that some activists engagement
so is that terrorism seems she's not but

601
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:47,390
it's only a criminal act and so that's a
hard question we've seen a few things

602
00:48:47,390 --> 00:48:55,118
we've seen that a law firm right when
the law firms working for them but they

603
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:59,760
were spied upon by this program but
don't have the section 702 but there is

604
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,700
an exclusive there was an exclusive
report on how the programs would be used

605
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:09,000
to spy on a law firm engaged in trade
negotiations on a given topic thing is

606
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:12,890
we've seen in america

607
00:49:12,890 --> 00:49:17,920
targeted for surveillance but they
didn't it was under it was unclear as

608
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:21,140
you should check you should check it out

609
00:49:21,140 --> 00:49:28,910
I can go right now I believe his colony
it was it was there so that's been

610
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:32,899
reported on the second line are we had
profiles

611
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:38,240
arab-american activist being spied on
again the details in Article 22 section

612
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:44,990
702 or if there were backed by the 1978
original Beisel it's illegal it's

613
00:49:44,990 --> 00:49:49,200
against the law explicitly to surveil
Americans under 70 to probe the matter

614
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:52,669
where they are in the world it is
illegal to assume that it's all lawful

615
00:49:52,670 --> 00:50:01,420
and unlawful just actually passed in
2009 720 254 order these are these

616
00:50:01,420 --> 00:50:05,920
american that's that's what's required
of the law requires you to show probable

617
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,609
cause right or indicate that the person
they for intelligence target RNA form

618
00:50:10,609 --> 00:50:15,369
powered uniform our that's the law was
passed just like you have to go in a

619
00:50:15,369 --> 00:50:19,160
criminal case to go to court to get the
american and get a course that person so

620
00:50:19,160 --> 00:50:27,288
that's that's that's the constitutional
state police he is that with the 702 the

621
00:50:27,289 --> 00:50:31,119
incident the collection people have been
searched for great there are searched

622
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:37,310
the collection you get if you were
targeting foreigners that

623
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:40,450
I say we're searching the pilot
communications for domestic USA

624
00:50:40,450 --> 00:50:48,770
identifies right so if you collect
foreigners if you are right and you want

625
00:50:48,770 --> 00:50:53,250
to see if the americans love to take off
any sense well did you not take it off

626
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,890
the table but there should certainly be
a high legal standard right now an

627
00:50:55,890 --> 00:51:01,220
analyst just while I would love the
collection is against somebody who did

628
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:04,339
not have any for the memories have no
constitutional rights right and

629
00:51:04,340 --> 00:51:08,220
Euclidean supporter look at that and say
they have no rights are washed out the

630
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:16,069
source of the data file of information
but I look through it because a group of

631
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:20,160
other possible you can look through it
and get legal process right and not the

632
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,120
legal process not such as legal process
when you're looking at are searching for

633
00:51:23,120 --> 00:51:35,759
us' identifier should be but why you're
not but we will see around outside
