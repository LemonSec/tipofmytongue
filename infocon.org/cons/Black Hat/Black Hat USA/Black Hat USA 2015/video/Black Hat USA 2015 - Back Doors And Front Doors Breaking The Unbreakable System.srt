1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,140
this presentation is going to be a break
in the unbreakable system by James the

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:16,680
narrow Matthew green so please welcome
them with warm applause thank you so we

3
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,980
are we're going to be talking today
about key escrow and the problems that

4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:24,250
face governments and companies as we
start to see and and encryption takeover

5
00:00:24,250 --> 00:00:27,800
everywhere we're not gonna be hacking
anything unfortunately so if anyone's

6
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:31,619
here to see something interesting
happened with the Jeep you might be in

7
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:35,690
the wrong place but if you were trying
to see that you're here while plea like

8
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:42,309
this as much right thing he's so I'm gym
tomorrow I'm in information security the

9
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:46,699
data privacy intellectual property
attorney out of washington D C and with

10
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:50,329
the is Matthew green he's an expert in
applied cryptography and network

11
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:55,989
security and he's also a professor at
Johns Hopkins University so just a

12
00:00:55,989 --> 00:01:00,300
little bit of background we thought a
lot about where we should try to do a

13
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:04,280
talk about back to us and we thought
black hat would actually be the perfect

14
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:10,270
place for it because the people who come
to black hat have very deep technical

15
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:16,830
understanding and they're also
interested in policy so that let's have

16
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:22,780
at it so you'll be a little bit of
overlap between some of the issues that

17
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:25,970
matter dresses and some that I dressed
but hopefully you'll hear them from a

18
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:30,840
different perspective from each of us
and it'll it'll still be worth hearing

19
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,750
it in that context as it is a little bit
of a disclaimer I have to give one cause

20
00:01:35,750 --> 00:01:40,900
I am an attorney and these issues are
really contentious I'm not here to

21
00:01:40,900 --> 00:01:45,850
represent or speak for any particular
interests either the technology

22
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,408
companies or the government

23
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:54,380
and going to set forth the issues as I
think perhaps we haven't looked at them

24
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,408
before in a way that might be useful to
us going forward we try to solve this

25
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:06,189
problem as a as an initial point I think
we need to justify what we're talking

26
00:02:06,189 --> 00:02:12,129
about the term back doors has been used
a lot and it's been in general the

27
00:02:12,129 --> 00:02:15,190
issues we have with the promise we have
a debate is that nothing is very defined

28
00:02:15,190 --> 00:02:19,599
everything's very abstract in in very
conceptual including the cause of the

29
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,700
back door what we mean by that is just
for the purposes of this talk so they

30
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:27,000
were on the same page when we talk about
it back to where we're going to forget

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:31,849
everything and anything between we can
cryptography key escrow split key

32
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:37,310
account mirroring and so on all of these
are our methods of providing what has

33
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:43,370
been called most most recently in the
under doormats pay-per-view seen as

34
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:49,030
exceptional access that is a method for
an authority perhaps the government or

35
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:56,340
law enforcement to obtain information
from a system that it wasn't intended to

36
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:02,769
have by the system is designed with that
in mind just as a point of clarification

37
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:07,620
is worth pointing out because even
experienced journalists in this space

38
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:13,549
often makes it a sort of like inflation
between end-to-end encryption and device

39
00:03:13,549 --> 00:03:17,299
encryption and it's worth pointing out
that these are two completely different

40
00:03:17,299 --> 00:03:22,620
systems and the legal issues and the
policies that technical issues that are

41
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:28,819
implicated by trying to obtain
exceptional access to review systems are

42
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:33,339
completely different from most part in
this talk we r gonna be focusing on

43
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:39,810
messaging systems so we're really
talking about the peer-to-peer side of

44
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:45,630
this and the end point between two
points

45
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:51,710
so with that you still have a lot of
competing interests that they were

46
00:03:51,710 --> 00:03:55,820
trying to reconcile in this in this
debate there in one side of history of

47
00:03:55,820 --> 00:04:00,019
the technologists and privacy advocates
and the technology companies most

48
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:03,750
notably apple and the other side of this
there is the government interest and the

49
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:08,970
government interest is has a long
history of trying to find more ways to

50
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:14,350
get more information that is the other
half of of of the debate and there's

51
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:20,649
this huge chasm between right now and it
really seems unsolvable so when we hope

52
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:28,489
we can do here is provide a possible to
avenue that we might want to pursue that

53
00:04:28,490 --> 00:04:33,900
really hasn't been discussed much before
and we also want to take a look at some

54
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:38,979
of the policy considerations in a new
way that are in strictly government

55
00:04:38,980 --> 00:04:46,150
access is bad or maybe there's more
complex than that so just as a little

56
00:04:46,150 --> 00:04:50,590
bit of background with respect to
government collection of information

57
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:55,340
through a few types of data dad will
come across in this there's medidata

58
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:58,950
which is obviously the outside of the
envelope this information practically

59
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,460
can't be encrypted because you wouldn't
be able to deliver the message if it

60
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,659
were under the current system that we
were talking about these ancillary data

61
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:10,730
such as GPS and browser histories and
really for the point of this operation

62
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:15,470
content and we see that mostly and
particularly with respect to messages

63
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:22,430
such as tech secure applications like
that whats app as well as emails that

64
00:05:22,430 --> 00:05:27,160
could readily be encrypted as well so

65
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,430
who is asking for backdoor access
unfortunately if you're if you're

66
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:36,570
concerned about privacy it's pretty much
everybody at this point in the us- their

67
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:43,530
calls for this exceptional access by the
director of the NSA by the York County

68
00:05:43,530 --> 00:05:47,250
District Attorney by the Suffolk County
District Attorney Massachusetts and

69
00:05:47,250 --> 00:05:52,760
moves obviously and publicly that the
FBI true director James Comey

70
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:58,039
internationally there's almost as much
if not more to be concerned about with

71
00:05:58,040 --> 00:06:03,490
respect to the issue as the Prime
Minister Cameron in the UK has talked

72
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:08,340
about banning advocate finding apps that
are in back toward china has recently

73
00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:14,510
passed a law that is reported to require
that critical systems be secure in

74
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:23,860
controllable and Pakistan has released
the Pakistan has is now requiring that

75
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:28,740
communications not go thru black raised
beds because they don't offer encryption

76
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:34,600
functionality and I ran has reporters
have been what's happened so is a hot

77
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:41,760
debate and the stakes are pretty high
but with that said is there anything new

78
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:46,250
going on here maybe maybe there is a
US-led laws have long authorized

79
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:50,770
collection of all sorts of data that you
might have on your phone or that you

80
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,640
might transmit over a network

81
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:57,580
relevant specifically for the FBI in
this context there's a wiretap act and

82
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:03,780
the restrictions imposed on on that by
the fourth amendment so even even James

83
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:10,859
Comey of the of the FBI recognizes that
the Fourth Amendment restrictions would

84
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:15,470
equally apply in the context of whatever
exceptional access might be made

85
00:07:15,470 --> 00:07:19,240
available so just as a reminder but with
this would require and would still

86
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,830
require under even the way we might
consider to be the most objectionable

87
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:28,820
back to our proposals here in the united
states it still would require that there

88
00:07:28,820 --> 00:07:33,890
be probable cause for a person to
believe that your people cause for the

89
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:35,919
government to believe that

90
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,990
the nation's relate to

91
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:43,430
enacted is being committed or is or has
been committed that would be a felony

92
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:46,100
they had the government has to be able
to show the true no alternative

93
00:07:46,100 --> 00:07:50,550
procedures that would get it to the same
place there has to be probable cause to

94
00:07:50,550 --> 00:07:54,810
show that the evidence would actually
show what the government's trying to

95
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:59,010
show so there are some checks built into
the system and these checks are

96
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:01,880
substantially unchanged and there's been
no

97
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:06,640
as as these sexual acts of proposals
have been made there has not been as of

98
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:11,440
yet a concomitant proposal to change the
way the oversight of the of this works

99
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:15,510
were still looking at the the same
Fourth Amendment restrictions that we've

100
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:24,180
always had alongside of that the while
the fourth amendment and in a procedural

101
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:26,440
controls are basically unchanged

102
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:32,340
there's been a long history of the us-
government seeking to control the way in

103
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:36,150
which information can be protected such
that it would not be able to read the

104
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:42,030
communications shortly after ww2 the
importance of photography was readily

105
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:45,939
apparent to all who were paying
attention and the government instituted

106
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:51,540
some initial export controls on the
technology in the early nineties we saw

107
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:54,650
the clipper chip which I'm sure most of
you probably all of you are familiar

108
00:08:54,650 --> 00:09:02,500
with in 1994 the congress passed through
which required that telecommunications

109
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:09,150
carriers allow law enforcement access to
their systems that was also a direct

110
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:15,420
reaction to changes in technology back
win telecommunications would have been

111
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:21,270
circuit-switched it was very easy for
the law enforcement to just simply clip

112
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:25,460
wires onto your on your system in and
listen to your phone calls once you had

113
00:09:25,460 --> 00:09:29,950
my IP BAE Systems then it was it was
harder so you need to have more

114
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:33,920
cooperation from the carriage to do it
and clean it was it was a mechanism by

115
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,719
which that that was accomplished but it
doesn't cover everything it really is

116
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:46,190
limited to carriers even now VoIP
carriers for telecommunications services

117
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:48,050
and it doesn't cover information
services

118
00:09:48,050 --> 00:09:54,010
such as email and messaging and that is
that are concerned for the law

119
00:09:54,010 --> 00:10:00,269
enforcement mission so in 2010 update
scalia to cover information services and

120
00:10:00,269 --> 00:10:06,079
in 2013 the FBI's you may recall
proposed requiring Internet

121
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,640
communication services providers to add
in wiretapping capability and even

122
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:17,209
proposed mining companies that fail to
respond appropriately to to wiretap

123
00:10:17,209 --> 00:10:28,930
orders so ultimately we've got a regime
where the government can get data has

124
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:33,370
been getting data but something's
changed and what is that thing called

125
00:10:33,370 --> 00:10:38,040
going dark and you might want it you
might wonder why is the government

126
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,110
suddenly concern about this why the
sudden push that this in front of us now

127
00:10:42,110 --> 00:10:46,730
and I think the answer is really not
much has changed since always wanted

128
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:53,250
this people always had means of you
could always use pgp so but what's

129
00:10:53,250 --> 00:11:01,170
happened is as you probably noticed the
mobile and if if if if the reports are

130
00:11:01,170 --> 00:11:04,770
you believe these folks they reported
that there whats app is now eight

131
00:11:04,770 --> 00:11:09,810
hundred million million active users as
of April 2015 that's a lot of people

132
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:15,189
today and if you just look not too far
even into the future it's pretty easy to

133
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:19,540
imagine a world where there are
literally billions of people using

134
00:11:19,540 --> 00:11:23,810
end-to-end encrypted communications for
which there's no ready way for any

135
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:27,949
governmental authority to to review and
that would be different

136
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:34,779
pgp was is often regarded as user
interface disaster it's too hard to see

137
00:11:34,779 --> 00:11:39,720
complicated and it doesn't work on
mobile very well at all if at all so

138
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:45,040
things like what happened to do work
incredibly well and the rate of adoption

139
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:51,519
is fantastic it's a huge success success
story the likes of which you

140
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:56,430
technologies probably have have really
had a chance to to to appreciate

141
00:11:56,430 --> 00:12:01,040
and that's that's the concern so from
the from the law enforcement perspective

142
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:06,730
if you think about it they were used to
getting all the SMS he wanted and now

143
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:13,220
users are able to me we vote we have a
magic crypto on your messages called

144
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:18,770
crypto dust across your tax and now the
government can read them so that's

145
00:12:18,770 --> 00:12:25,500
that's the cause for concern and it's
not clear how the government would

146
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:30,980
possibly solve this problem going
forward so you may not necessarily

147
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:35,010
believe that the stories that the
government is is is putting out there

148
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:41,000
right now the motivational tails up my
sis and child predators a lot of stories

149
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:45,350
that are meant to stir the heart strings
but I think that's just because they're

150
00:12:45,350 --> 00:12:48,560
just really not articulating it well
enough and they're stuck talking about

151
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:53,079
the future but I think if if you if you
believe they're looking at the long game

152
00:12:53,080 --> 00:12:59,190
they probably do have a problem that
they need to find a way to solve so the

153
00:12:59,190 --> 00:13:04,060
heart of the debate you've got to
technologists privacy advocates the

154
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:07,050
technology companies who don't want to
be required to change the way their

155
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:10,339
systems work and you've got the
government interest on the other side

156
00:13:10,339 --> 00:13:16,820
that would like to be able to access to
use these messages so there are a few

157
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:23,110
key arguments that come up again and
again in opposition to any kind of

158
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:27,959
exceptional access system and they can
be summed up as as such they at the

159
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:32,040
break forward secrecy and we'll have
more to say about the technical merits

160
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,630
of the positions and and what this
really means the Daybreak forwards

161
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:42,370
forward secrecy in fact in the paper
that just came out that was cited as the

162
00:13:42,370 --> 00:13:45,890
prime one of the primary concerns that
was even a concern in the original key

163
00:13:45,890 --> 00:13:50,100
escrow clipper paper for me 1997 Ford
senior season very big deal and all

164
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:53,540
these proposals that are out there right
now they've been seriously considered

165
00:13:53,540 --> 00:14:00,430
key escrow and he's planning and so on
break that and I think everybody can

166
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:03,349
agree that it's a legitimate problem
with the system

167
00:14:03,350 --> 00:14:07,820
the systems have been proposed out there
also would break the negated encryption

168
00:14:07,820 --> 00:14:08,790
which is important

169
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:12,099
and there's a huge issue with who
controls the keys the ideas you have

170
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:16,320
some kind of master key that would be
able to decrypt all the messages or or

171
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,920
or you would have a copy of a key that
was your messages that would be stored

172
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,160
in a central server somewhere and this
would become administrative nightmare

173
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:28,959
and you checking target and therefore
practically not feasible legally there

174
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:34,040
are also some concerns chiefly first
amendment concerns with asking companies

175
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:38,540
to manage the company's writer software
to certain way and also oversight

176
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:46,189
problems how can you possibly have a
regime where your communications are

177
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:51,700
secured only until somebody decides
they're not and how do we decide who

178
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:56,230
gets to make that decision is there a
review process for that because it seems

179
00:14:56,230 --> 00:15:01,830
based on recent experience a systematic
reviews and who knows if the government

180
00:15:01,830 --> 00:15:07,090
would have its own key server to get to
get the keys it just seems like maybe an

181
00:15:07,090 --> 00:15:11,110
intractable problem but one that maybe
it could be solved if we if we worked

182
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:15,360
hard enough at it there are also some
real practical problems if you try to

183
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:21,090
maintain a back door is filmed in a row
pgp famously said if privacy is outlawed

184
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:25,220
only outlaws will privacy certainly if
if you buy the crypto only outlaws will

185
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:30,140
have tripped out and that's a fair point
and it would be very pretty I think

186
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:34,870
everyone would agree that sophisticated
criminal actors will not use your back

187
00:15:34,870 --> 00:15:39,140
door system no matter what is almost
impossible so if you were willing to

188
00:15:39,140 --> 00:15:42,140
accept the back door solution you must
also be willing to accept that it will

189
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:46,500
not be a hundred percent successful in
its stated mission of allowing law

190
00:15:46,500 --> 00:15:50,120
enforcement to a scene access to every
single message that anyone ever writes

191
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:54,960
so maybe there's a sliding scale at some
point we decide to leave we've got

192
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:00,570
enough and alternatives include the
going private proposal which was

193
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:05,490
advanced by Professor Delavan the idea
being that instead of giving out keys to

194
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:09,790
everyone's messages what you were doing
said has allowed the government hack

195
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:14,160
everybody's phone which as you can
imagine has a lot of technical

196
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:15,689
complexity to it

197
00:16:15,690 --> 00:16:19,610
and feasibility of it could be questions
you may also wonder if you really want

198
00:16:19,610 --> 00:16:23,030
the government taking everybody's phone
to get to the Employee Retirement wants

199
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:26,130
a message instead of just having your
key in getting that particular message

200
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:32,130
so well last trying to find a way
forward through this and the question

201
00:16:32,130 --> 00:16:38,980
that we we need to be asking is is there
a way that we can reasonably satisfy all

202
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:42,630
the interests of these parties are the
technologies of the privacy advocates

203
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:47,030
and the law enforcement community so
that they can get two types of

204
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:51,430
communications that they've always had
until the proliferation of magic crystal

205
00:16:51,430 --> 00:16:56,510
wants and what we have here is who I
think there I think you meant I will

206
00:16:56,510 --> 00:17:02,470
have a debate about this later in the in
the talk but there is a proposal to that

207
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:08,360
this recently been advanced for how to
back door key server and I think that

208
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:11,919
this solves a lot of the problems and
should be forced to be seriously

209
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:19,630
considered as a potential solution to
the problem so there is a technical

210
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:24,530
solution possibly that's not as bad as
as what's been what's been considered so

211
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:28,700
far that there should be further
investigated and I think we also need to

212
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:39,030
think about further about what the point
of no back doors would be so right now

213
00:17:39,030 --> 00:17:44,250
14 get a certain amount of material and
they have been successful using this

214
00:17:44,250 --> 00:17:48,980
material in criminal prosecutions but
that's just a domestic view of it and

215
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:56,430
there's maybe the maybe the debate is
really that if Apple had a back door in

216
00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:01,240
his device or enhanced messaging then
other countries more repressive regimes

217
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:05,230
would also demand similar level of
access which then Apple would have a

218
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:10,140
very hard time in saying no to right now
apple says no to everybody that works

219
00:18:10,140 --> 00:18:14,170
great and they can credibly do that in
places like China once once Apple goes

220
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:17,460
down the road is slippery slope and
everyone gets back door is probably the

221
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:22,650
way that story ends and maybe the answer
is well we're not gonna get

222
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:26,550
access to every email that in every text
we would like to get possibly if you're

223
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:34,050
a law enforcement here in exchange for
allowing a more free discussion among

224
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:39,760
parties in other countries like China
maybe that's the longer game that we

225
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:46,850
should consider so without our turnover
match so I like about this audience I

226
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:51,340
like jim is that normal technical
audiences you get kind of an echo

227
00:18:51,340 --> 00:18:54,860
chamber when it comes to things like yes
crow I'm trying as hard as I guess is

228
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:59,159
that better when it comes to things like
the idea of governments being able to

229
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:04,280
intercept communications there is a very
adamant libertarian technical sort of

230
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:08,860
utopian streak where everybody says no
absolutely not it's not something we

231
00:19:08,860 --> 00:19:13,310
should be and that's not something that
we can I that's not a policy that we can

232
00:19:13,310 --> 00:19:16,879
actually you know it here too we have to
consider the possibility that law

233
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,490
enforcement throughout the world is
going to going to ask for access to our

234
00:19:20,490 --> 00:19:23,740
communications can really control that

235
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:31,160
so I'm going to spend the next few
minutes talking about the technical side

236
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:36,880
of this argument I don't know how much
closer I get to talk about some of the

237
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,980
tactics of the history of these backdoor
proposals maybe you turn it down a

238
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:46,150
little bit better so I wanna go back
let's talk about what's happening now so

239
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:51,950
a few of you probably saw starting in
2013 or so the Drug Enforcement Agency

240
00:19:51,950 --> 00:19:56,970
began asking for access to systems like
iMessage and they began to complain

241
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:00,070
publicly in the press that they were not
able to intercept encrypted

242
00:20:00,070 --> 00:20:04,750
communications with iMessage a lot of
people are skeptical dismayed news about

243
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:10,200
bin about June of 2013 those of you who
remember June of 2013 probably also

244
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:14,780
remember why we stopped talking about
this a few days later this happened a

245
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:18,750
few days before the Snowdon revelations
came out so this entire issue got kind

246
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:22,710
of pushed off the map but it didn't go
away forever and came back with more

247
00:20:22,710 --> 00:20:28,640
recently as the FBI began asking for
access to encrypted devices so there are

248
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:33,309
these new encryption systems being built
into Apple and someday Android may get

249
00:20:33,309 --> 00:20:36,809
around to making the default so that we
can actually encrypt everything based on

250
00:20:36,809 --> 00:20:39,870
a password you entered your device and
this is apparently causing a lot of

251
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:45,239
party for the FBI we myself and a number
of other scientists wrote a paper about

252
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:50,070
why it's very difficult to build that
doors into systems like that the FBI

253
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:53,620
director didn't agree with us and said
basically that you know the scientists

254
00:20:53,620 --> 00:20:56,860
were wrong on this issue I disagree with
him on that but I'm gonna try to tell

255
00:20:56,860 --> 00:20:58,040
you why that is

256
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:03,149
before I do that I want to go back in
time to go back to the late nineteen

257
00:21:03,150 --> 00:21:07,490
eighties and early nineteen nineties
when this entire original debate began

258
00:21:07,490 --> 00:21:10,990
this is a period known as the crypto
wars and the thing that kicked off the

259
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:16,590
crypto Wars was this device here that
the IBM PC or maybe PCs in general the

260
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:19,919
entire collection that was available
what happened in the late nineteen

261
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:23,660
eighties with the cryptography went from
something that militaries had exclusive

262
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:27,820
control over to something that you could
actually implement and deploy on a

263
00:21:27,820 --> 00:21:28,550
computer in

264
00:21:28,550 --> 00:21:32,889
house and that completely revolutionized
our entire field it went from being just

265
00:21:32,890 --> 00:21:36,520
an academic Derryfield to be just
something that ordinary people could use

266
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:42,560
I'm sure you recognize this guy bill
Zimmerman who wrote the first simple

267
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:48,139
encryption program that you could use
for email called PDP PDP 1.0 I think it

268
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:54,540
came out in 1990 or 1991 it was speaking
from my point of view with a little bit

269
00:21:54,540 --> 00:21:59,170
of historical you know be be able to
look back it was a complete piece of

270
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:03,860
garbage at the time it featured a cipher
that fills ammerman had invented called

271
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:09,610
castle magic or basal Matic and let me
just read you some of the flaws that

272
00:22:09,610 --> 00:22:12,620
this had so in addition to having some
flaws where it was acceptable to

273
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:17,229
differential cryptanalysis it also had
two more embarrassing conceptual flaws

274
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:21,950
like it failed to encrypt the last bit
of every bike that was being encrypted

275
00:22:21,950 --> 00:22:27,450
so it was not a good program but it got
better very quickly and over the period

276
00:22:27,450 --> 00:22:31,300
of a year to Congress and law
enforcement began to realize that they

277
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:34,720
had a serious problem on their hands the
criminals can now use this to basically

278
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:39,280
lock up communications in a way that
they could not read and so we saw a

279
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:43,610
series of articles I'm sure you
recognize these guys back in the this is

280
00:22:43,610 --> 00:22:48,340
dated april seventeenth nineteen
ninety-one move on unscrambling messages

281
00:22:48,340 --> 00:22:52,260
is a sale to work senate hearings where
people said we need laws to actually

282
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:55,550
outlawed these encryption mechanisms and
to come up with alternatives so that we

283
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:59,040
can continue to be able to read these
and maintaining you know

284
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:06,070
continued providing law enforcement
access to messages that entire sequence

285
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:10,340
of events led to a handful of possible
outcomes I'll come to them in a second

286
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:13,810
but first I want to talk about how this
is replaying today

287
00:23:13,810 --> 00:23:18,860
today we have all the same problems that
we had in nineteen ninety-one except we

288
00:23:18,860 --> 00:23:24,260
have them in a scale that may be an
order of magnitude greater pgp adoption

289
00:23:24,260 --> 00:23:29,000
will everybody was terrified of it never
got above about two to three percent of

290
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:33,170
all email maybe that's being generous
may be one person but today we have

291
00:23:33,170 --> 00:23:37,840
end-to-end encrypted messaging like I
message which has now close to a billion

292
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,909
users and we have what which is what
this icon is that has 800 million active

293
00:23:42,910 --> 00:23:46,830
users where people without even knowing
it are now encrypting their data so the

294
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:50,730
problem exists we also have encrypted
devices where people are using pin codes

295
00:23:50,730 --> 00:23:55,130
to actually encrypt the all of the date
on there there I saw this problem

296
00:23:55,130 --> 00:24:01,170
continues today so how do you go about
solving this problem technologically how

297
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:05,870
do you break the unbreakable crypt us
well they're basically three enter the

298
00:24:05,870 --> 00:24:10,889
first obviously is that you can ban
encryption altogether and this is

299
00:24:10,890 --> 00:24:14,870
something that country's am disgusted
various times it's not a good idea I'm

300
00:24:14,870 --> 00:24:18,669
not gonna try to convince you that it's
a bad idea either because our president

301
00:24:18,670 --> 00:24:20,400
has already weighed in on this

302
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,680
fortunately President Obama's basically
said there's no scenario in which we

303
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:28,380
don't want really strong encryption and
this is something I've spoken to members

304
00:24:28,380 --> 00:24:32,550
of the national security council who are
a little bit ticked off about this

305
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:35,470
because it basically constraints their
options they can't do anything that will

306
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:40,920
actually weaken or break encryption
another option is that we can find ways

307
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:45,760
to make encryption that is so weak that
law enforcement can somehow break it but

308
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,410
that individuals will still have enough
security for their messages commercially

309
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:54,230
this sounds like a crazy idea is crazy
idea but it's something we tried in the

310
00:24:54,230 --> 00:24:58,710
past in the nineteen nineties throughout
the nineteen nineties we made the we

311
00:24:58,710 --> 00:25:03,110
maintained a rigorous regime of export
controls or what we did is we mandated

312
00:25:03,110 --> 00:25:07,240
that everybody encrypting their data had
to do so with weak encryption key

313
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:11,210
and we built this into a cell and we
said if you're going to access the

314
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:14,980
website your server has to be able to
support these weak cipher suites these

315
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:20,010
modes of operation that are not very
strong and then we repealed the export

316
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:24,309
control laws and we didn't take out the
cipher suite we left these export

317
00:25:24,309 --> 00:25:29,600
controls over Sweden there until 2015
when a group of researchers earlier this

318
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,309
year

319
00:25:30,309 --> 00:25:33,490
realize that they had a way that they
could actually roll back any encrypted

320
00:25:33,490 --> 00:25:38,120
web site connection and the SSL
connection to use export strength crypto

321
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:42,159
and then break the connection almost
instantaneously using about eight hours

322
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:46,650
a preprocessing on a computer and then
about a fraction of a second worth of

323
00:25:46,650 --> 00:25:49,690
time to actually cracked the connection
and that was called the Freak

324
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:52,900
vulnerability and these guys didn't even
know what they had found they had a

325
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:55,850
vulnerability that they thought they
thought nobody out there was still using

326
00:25:55,850 --> 00:26:00,300
export control encryption and then we
did ask and we found out that 35% of the

327
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:05,690
internet still use this stuff so we can
encryption has consequences that go well

328
00:26:05,690 --> 00:26:08,170
beyond what you think it's going to do
it's not a good idea

329
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:11,570
later we found additional
vulnerabilities call log jam so we can

330
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:17,540
encryption generally not a great plan
which leaves us with essentially a third

331
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:22,629
approach and that is to design and
production systems that have specific

332
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:26,940
vulnerabilities built into them that are
essentially nobody but law enforcement

333
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:31,120
will be able to decrypt them these
systems are called key escrow systems

334
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:35,610
not show you roughly what they look like
or have looked like in the past one of

335
00:26:35,610 --> 00:26:39,219
these systems was included in the device
called the clipper chip which gets lots

336
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:43,800
of press people talk about it all the
time this is the micro Tronix Michael

337
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:47,510
trunks I think version of it this is
what the packaging looks like there's a

338
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:50,520
lot of stuff going up going on inside
there there's a there's a

339
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:54,570
tamper-resistant chip in their their
keys there is a secret algorithms all

340
00:26:54,570 --> 00:26:58,500
sorts of nonsense this was fielded as
potentially the replacement for all

341
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:02,030
software encryption this would be placed
inside of every phone in every computer

342
00:27:02,030 --> 00:27:05,850
back in the nineteen nineties it had a
built-in government-backed or so the

343
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:10,080
government would be able to access your
encryption now let's look at how this

344
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,090
was done

345
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:15,209
clipper added a field to every encrypted
message called the law enforcement

346
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:18,110
access field or the leaf

347
00:27:18,110 --> 00:27:22,260
what happened inside of that field was
that the eighty bit session key that was

348
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:27,320
used to encrypt your phone caller your
email was wrapped up an encrypted under

349
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:32,590
a special device specific team built
into your device called a unit key the

350
00:27:32,590 --> 00:27:37,220
FBI or the Department of Justice how to
copy of every single one of these keys

351
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:40,940
they were programmed into your device
and they had a big database which was

352
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:45,380
allegedly split into two parts so two
different agencies controlled it so you

353
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:49,010
would encrypt your session key under
this unit key you would attach to it the

354
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:53,530
unique idea of your device so that the
FBI can look up your device and you

355
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:56,540
would attach this sixteen-bit checks on
to the end of it just to make sure

356
00:27:56,540 --> 00:28:01,450
everything was kosher and he didn't trip
this whole thing under a global family

357
00:28:01,450 --> 00:28:07,890
now can any of you guys tell me what
might not be so great about this you can

358
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:11,630
shout if you want there any technical
problems with this approach you see

359
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:13,410
right now

360
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:19,070
ya global Chiefs I don't use global keys
and anything that means every single one

361
00:28:19,070 --> 00:28:22,850
of these devices have this shared key
inside of it and if somebody broke into

362
00:28:22,850 --> 00:28:26,610
one of them they would have the global
key that would let them essentially they

363
00:28:26,610 --> 00:28:28,570
at least part of this message

364
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:32,490
another flaw that Matt blaze discovered
in the nineteen nineties is that there

365
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:38,080
is only a 16 bit checks on attached to
this thing that reason that checksum is

366
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:42,240
there let me explain what that does the
the fear that the FBI had was that

367
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:47,780
people would tamper with the data going
over the wire to either strip this leaf

368
00:28:47,780 --> 00:28:52,428
out or just a mall it so that the
connection would still be encrypted but

369
00:28:52,429 --> 00:28:56,600
nobody would be able to recover that
session he formerly chief so the added a

370
00:28:56,600 --> 00:29:00,379
checksum and the encrypted this entire
blog under a family key so that if you

371
00:29:00,380 --> 00:29:04,570
tried to connect to another honest
device and it was not able to decrypt

372
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:08,740
this stuff and verify the checks on it
would refuse the connection so in order

373
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:13,230
to talk to someone you had to send the
leaf that was the idea but the checksums

374
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:18,169
only 16 bits long which means that if
you just make up random blobs of data

375
00:29:18,169 --> 00:29:23,799
after about 65,000 tries you're gonna
get it right this is not a huge issue

376
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:27,750
but it means that you can basically make
leaps that look like they're valid but

377
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:29,539
contained nothing inside of them

378
00:29:29,539 --> 00:29:32,340
meaning that you can now use a clipper
chip to communicate without a law

379
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:37,168
enforcement backdoor the impact of this
was that after millions of dollars of

380
00:29:37,169 --> 00:29:41,200
spending the NSA and the folks who
designed this realize that they built a

381
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:45,179
broken system and they just abandon the
entire idea now some say that's because

382
00:29:45,179 --> 00:29:47,789
the idea was kinda bad in the first
place they were looking for an excuse

383
00:29:47,789 --> 00:29:51,919
but this is one way of doing it if we
look at how you do this with software

384
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:55,149
none of that will work but you can build
something that uses public key

385
00:29:55,149 --> 00:29:59,689
encryption that uses essentially
triplets a 256 bit session key from an

386
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:03,809
iMessage session under some public
escrow key where the secret key is held

387
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:08,399
by the FBI and if you talk to people in
government this is exactly the kind of

388
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:12,678
thing that the us- government is
considering the problem with this idea

389
00:30:12,679 --> 00:30:18,529
though is that at the end of the day it
relies on a lot of people getting a lot

390
00:30:18,529 --> 00:30:22,220
of things right those private keys BTUs
government has to hold a secret key

391
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:26,109
everybody who implements this has to do
it right you have to worry about that

392
00:30:26,109 --> 00:30:29,720
keep getting stolen and so on so this is
the proposal that's on the table we may

393
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:35,259
see this Sunday but it is going to be
very very tricky to do it correctly and

394
00:30:35,259 --> 00:30:38,399
then the last question that last
question is really the tapas who manages

395
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:42,849
those private keys and who is going to
make sure that no government agency

396
00:30:42,849 --> 00:30:48,168
hands those over to the MSA or allow
anybody to perform a surveillance you

397
00:30:48,169 --> 00:30:51,700
what you have no real assurance once
those private keys are gone the security

398
00:30:51,700 --> 00:30:55,489
of every encrypted connection in the
United States would essentially be

399
00:30:55,489 --> 00:31:01,379
compromised so this this design is very
kind of weak last thing I want to cover

400
00:31:01,379 --> 00:31:05,889
this is often a slight tangent in terms
of breaking and and messaging systems

401
00:31:05,889 --> 00:31:09,590
there's one other approach you can take
that does not involve that in key escrow

402
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:15,499
and as jim mentioned that essentially to
go after the key servers Apple for

403
00:31:15,499 --> 00:31:19,690
example maintains a key server somewhere
on their data centers every time I wanna

404
00:31:19,690 --> 00:31:23,749
call someone or text somebody on a
message I sent a lookup requested that

405
00:31:23,749 --> 00:31:27,749
key server and Apple sends me back their
public key if they have five devices I

406
00:31:27,749 --> 00:31:33,080
get back five public keys I have no real
assurance that Apple is really giving me

407
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:36,290
back your public key when I talk to you
I trust

408
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:39,990
in that role and if somebody was not
trustworthy if Apple is not trustworthy

409
00:31:39,990 --> 00:31:44,420
they could very easily modify their key
service to give back and FBI keep that

410
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:49,350
would be a great way to enjoy things
this is the flow from one request you

411
00:31:49,350 --> 00:31:53,000
can put a proxy know there's no
certificate you can put a proxy in to

412
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:57,190
see exactly what these key lookups look
like so at the end of the day these

413
00:31:57,190 --> 00:32:01,990
entire all of these systems that right
now depend on trusting your operator not

414
00:32:01,990 --> 00:32:06,250
to do this kind of stuff so
fundamentally securing end-to-end

415
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:11,120
messaging systems depends on you
trusting your up your your carrier not

416
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,879
to get a secret subpoena from the US
government demanding that the answer

417
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:20,030
an FBI key and that is the question you
know what is the legality of doing this

418
00:32:20,030 --> 00:32:23,940
and then can we really trust the
government and companies not to do this

419
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:37,660
stuff to us now so that back to you

420
00:32:37,660 --> 00:32:51,360
put in there is one of the parties
simply enough so we we we had some

421
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,899
questions that we wanted to kind of
address on the from the technology side

422
00:32:55,900 --> 00:33:02,570
from the posse side to to see where we
go we came out and saw one of the two

423
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:08,710
start with one of the big issues that is
this content is brought out is that it

424
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:12,140
would be and this is certainly apparent
in the points that made which is is it

425
00:33:12,140 --> 00:33:19,080
is very very hard to make a system that
would allow for exceptional access it

426
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:25,240
wouldn't have some kind of insurance
laws or an opportunistic lot that can be

427
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:34,900
found and respected things like the
clipper chip and kissed her systems I

428
00:33:34,900 --> 00:33:38,620
think he's been very well established
that these are almost impossible to do

429
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:43,179
in a way that would make sense if you
have again a a global key is this is a

430
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:49,840
huge target of UN from a technical
acting point but with respect to

431
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:52,820
something like the key server if you're
going to duty injection of something

432
00:33:52,820 --> 00:34:01,179
like the iMessage platform is it is dead
does it argument still hold water that

433
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:07,880
this would be either created an enormous
target said she'll be unreasonable risk

434
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,750
you to do it or isn't there are other
technical impediments that make it

435
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:13,080
unreasonable to

436
00:34:13,080 --> 00:34:17,290
request that it be done or tried to make
it done can the government go to Moxie

437
00:34:17,290 --> 00:34:22,159
for example and say hey we we need you
to insert these kids we need you to

438
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:26,420
modify the code of your key sir what is
the law and how much protection is there

439
00:34:26,420 --> 00:34:32,409
are companies you say no so these are
these are two key issues that that

440
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:37,620
really haven't installed yet and I think
until we actually I think what we need

441
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:41,980
to do at this point is to move forward
and to try to speak out a system because

442
00:34:41,980 --> 00:34:47,300
right now everyone is shooting at
amorphouse target there's no real

443
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:51,030
proposal on the floor for how this would
be done now we've gotten this we have it

444
00:34:51,030 --> 00:34:55,740
were a specific ASAP injection that's
the whole system and the question is can

445
00:34:55,739 --> 00:35:00,040
you build it to end is illegal to do so
this is hard to say right we'd have to

446
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:04,009
go a little bit a little bit farther but
I think from just from the legal point

447
00:35:04,010 --> 00:35:08,540
of view you may need some additional
authorities say there may be free speech

448
00:35:08,540 --> 00:35:13,009
issues with forcing the company to write
specific software although the first

449
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:16,930
amendment is not a complete solution is
to just look at for example if you trust

450
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:21,669
with Microsoft Microsoft is was not
permitted to bundle the browser in in

451
00:35:21,670 --> 00:35:25,800
certain ways and the First Amendment
problem with that because there are

452
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:30,210
other issues here is not always each is
kind of a murky question but that

453
00:35:30,210 --> 00:35:33,450
doesn't mean they would get to define an
issue that we need to get resolved and

454
00:35:33,450 --> 00:35:39,620
you may need something like an update to
clear we probably would have you talking

455
00:35:39,620 --> 00:35:42,880
about four hours law enforcement
required to telephone companies give law

456
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:47,330
enforcement access to their to their
networks essentially you may need

457
00:35:47,330 --> 00:35:50,350
something like that this is for
information services providers which

458
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:54,190
were not part of Kalia that they will
have to provide something for their

459
00:35:54,190 --> 00:35:58,530
technical issues one of them is that you
can certainly look at the output of the

460
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:02,550
Apple he certainly let's say if you have
a piece of software that you write that

461
00:36:02,550 --> 00:36:06,280
can intercept and do what I did you can
see the keys to come back Fred Jacobs

462
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:10,160
wrote one so it is possible for targets
to see whether they're being surveilled

463
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,910
but looking and then making sure that
there

464
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:15,819
you know getting not getting on looking
kids coming back from a request so

465
00:36:15,819 --> 00:36:18,410
there's always going to be this
visibility thing whereas with key escrow

466
00:36:18,410 --> 00:36:22,799
approach where every connection is
fundamentally broken by design

467
00:36:22,799 --> 00:36:26,140
you know there is no way of detecting
when somebody's actually surveilling

468
00:36:26,140 --> 00:36:34,379
writes it another compromise would have
to be made because presumably there will

469
00:36:34,380 --> 00:36:38,039
be people who will run whatever
detection software it is or they'll put

470
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:41,180
something on their own network even if
it's not on the divisive example of

471
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:44,990
fifty Apple store doesn't allow you to
install this on a non jailbroken phone

472
00:36:44,990 --> 00:36:48,879
you may have to look at it as in some
other way but to be people who are

473
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:52,859
sophisticated enough to to find out
certainly that he injection it is

474
00:36:52,859 --> 00:36:58,200
happening so in order for us to accept
that as a as a as a solution we probably

475
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:02,009
have to be comfortable with the idea
that it's not a solution for all

476
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:05,329
communications all the time and I think
this through the compromise that they

477
00:37:05,329 --> 00:37:08,539
were headed towards law enforcement is
gonna probably have to accept that

478
00:37:08,539 --> 00:37:12,770
they're not gonna get because of the
technical issues that they're not gonna

479
00:37:12,770 --> 00:37:17,859
get a global key to everything all the
time they're gonna get something less

480
00:37:17,859 --> 00:37:21,038
than that and they'll have to also
recognize that there are some

481
00:37:21,039 --> 00:37:23,329
communications that will escape

482
00:37:23,329 --> 00:37:27,150
description because of the concern you
have about this entire issue is that

483
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:30,990
fundamentally once you start building
systems that have this exceptional

484
00:37:30,990 --> 00:37:34,319
access capability once you have
governments being able to eavesdrop on

485
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:37,710
anybody's communication on the man
that's a technical capabilities nothing

486
00:37:37,710 --> 00:37:41,380
there's nothing illegal about it so how
do you built-in safeguards will you you

487
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:44,970
build in legal safeguards to make sure
thats not abused but then what happens

488
00:37:44,970 --> 00:37:49,589
when that same system built and deployed
inside of every phone the country is

489
00:37:49,589 --> 00:37:53,710
sent overseas to governments the Navy
don't have those legal safeguards are we

490
00:37:53,710 --> 00:37:57,390
basically giving a huge technical
subsidy to the repressive governments of

491
00:37:57,390 --> 00:38:00,890
the world by building these systems are
then handing them over you know so that

492
00:38:00,890 --> 00:38:05,589
we can chase a few child pornographers
now the BRICS countries will use this to

493
00:38:05,589 --> 00:38:05,870
do it

494
00:38:05,870 --> 00:38:10,400
they want these are the things that were
in a lot right now

495
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:16,900
problem that can't really slippery slope
is 120 Apple giving back to our to the

496
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:21,920
FBI how did they say no to a back door
to some of their regime where we would

497
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,930
all agree that may be that that every
team is is repressive we don't want

498
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:32,359
those this communications to be exposed
and some greater public global sense of

499
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,800
what we think the world changed to look
like exactly in exchange for the little

500
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:40,100
guy is the big guide the clever people
will get caught by this anyway so you'll

501
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:44,220
catch a bunch of low-level people who
aren't smart enough to avoid your system

502
00:38:44,220 --> 00:38:49,009
and in the meantime you'll you'll allow
China to completely read on all the

503
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:52,790
devices yes I i mean if they need
encryption they will get in touch it

504
00:38:52,790 --> 00:38:56,710
it's it's really the israeli the folks
using my message I don't think too many

505
00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:00,690
HYSYS members using iPhone but maybe
they do and what I don't think that

506
00:39:00,690 --> 00:39:03,750
they're going to rely fundamentally how
polite message after they know that

507
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:07,790
their systems built in that allow the
government to eavesdrop so really

508
00:39:07,790 --> 00:39:11,120
there's a fundamental question about who
exactly where we're going to be spying

509
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:17,569
software any clever folks in the
audience who wanna take a hack at how

510
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:27,200
you would back door key server W
gridlock to see that talk here so we've

511
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:31,600
got a few minutes for questions if
anyone wants to shoot anything or throw

512
00:39:31,600 --> 00:39:39,230
anything at either of us their
microphones out for that I think

513
00:39:39,230 --> 00:39:47,660
20 miles away from where I was trying to
think of the physical world equivalent

514
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:52,890
if this right now if law enforcement
agencies think someone is doing

515
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:58,290
something bad they will get a water and
they will come to my home and the door

516
00:39:58,290 --> 00:40:03,440
and ask my apartment provided to give
them a key so that they could come

517
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:08,230
located when they want why oh why isn't
the proposal do go after specific

518
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:10,000
devices

519
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:14,440
why are they trying to do it for
everyone by default so I have a theory

520
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:18,560
about this and Jim Jim can enter as a
lawyer but my theory is that our entire

521
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:22,890
jurisprudence for the last hundred years
has been shaped by the technical

522
00:40:22,890 --> 00:40:28,259
capabilities of the system that we have
now so for the last hundred years of

523
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:32,070
telephones we happen to have a system
that it's very easy for a provider to

524
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:34,980
tap because everything go centralized
there's no way to build an armored cable

525
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:38,570
you can tap into and so just been
convenient for us to build systems that

526
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:41,830
have these these kind of eavesdropping
capabilities maybe of end-to-end

527
00:40:41,830 --> 00:40:43,580
encryption had come first

528
00:40:43,580 --> 00:40:46,440
would have made a transition from the
idea of having papers inside of your

529
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:47,180
home

530
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:50,899
two papers outside of your home that are
not available to government and we would

531
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:54,740
never have developed all of these
intermediate eavesdropping kind of

532
00:40:54,740 --> 00:40:58,029
support laws and and the church burns
around it but that's just my theory and

533
00:40:58,030 --> 00:40:59,869
I'm definitely not a lawyer

534
00:40:59,869 --> 00:41:03,100
yeah it's more complicated once things
are out there on the network for sure

535
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:09,589
there's a third party doctrine which
holds up once you put it out there on

536
00:41:09,590 --> 00:41:12,830
some third-party server then it can be
done and there's the stored

537
00:41:12,830 --> 00:41:15,529
Communications Act which allows

538
00:41:15,530 --> 00:41:20,250
accessing of emails over a hundred
eighty days old without a warrant so

539
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:24,550
it's it's did the analogies to the
physical space always get to really

540
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:31,690
really problematic so that's especially
in areas things like how back we start

541
00:41:31,690 --> 00:41:36,140
talking about chasing your baby in hot
pursuit of your of your data across the

542
00:41:36,140 --> 00:41:42,609
internet so it's interesting analogy
place it's a really really are very very

543
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:47,700
separate which is why we broke out that
the iPad the device's separately from

544
00:41:47,700 --> 00:41:58,520
all the stuff that we're doing on the
network I used to a lot of working in

545
00:41:58,520 --> 00:42:02,930
this area starting with a startup that
failed about twenty years ago

546
00:42:02,930 --> 00:42:08,009
try strata doctor

547
00:42:08,010 --> 00:42:15,660
that system that we built back there was
a small town school system but basically

548
00:42:15,660 --> 00:42:21,529
it was a key management server with also
built in policy so that these were not

549
00:42:21,530 --> 00:42:30,390
handed outdated keys were not handed out
by US policy this course and it was

550
00:42:30,390 --> 00:42:32,819
interesting was that we built into it

551
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:37,339
the concept of what we had the agents of
various top level

552
00:42:37,339 --> 00:42:42,690
we had special agents dead early these
are people you know

553
00:42:42,690 --> 00:42:49,469
administrator type people who to head to
get together and bring together to

554
00:42:49,469 --> 00:42:54,509
shadow keys in order to access keys that
were in key management system so every

555
00:42:54,509 --> 00:43:04,099
message that went out had a certificate
with the information in it like an idea

556
00:43:04,099 --> 00:43:10,369
or whatever it was that was encrypted
and was encrypted under and those keys

557
00:43:10,369 --> 00:43:14,890
Ross toward back on key measures ok one
communicate with be able to contact to

558
00:43:14,890 --> 00:43:20,729
be approved under the occasion process
it had a turkey that would be decrypted

559
00:43:20,729 --> 00:43:25,930
throw away the data key receiver would
get the message attached a message

560
00:43:25,930 --> 00:43:30,598
saying you use the Site Details policy
whatever it was

561
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:36,339
go back to the server get a policy
approved to read the message get the

562
00:43:36,339 --> 00:43:43,109
data key decrypted now you can come back
later that was recorded by an FBI ever

563
00:43:43,109 --> 00:43:47,920
so basically you're saying why can't
that design work at large scale well

564
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,789
there's a lot of problems I mean you've
got

565
00:43:50,789 --> 00:43:54,949
accessibility was the server goes down
now you can access it well ok the new

566
00:43:54,949 --> 00:44:02,439
synchronization issues these ideas have
been thought through may be done I think

567
00:44:02,439 --> 00:44:06,279
probably the largest deployed key escrow
system is the Fortezza system which i

568
00:44:06,279 --> 00:44:10,059
think does some of this stuff but that's
not very big when you consider when you

569
00:44:10,059 --> 00:44:14,189
compare that to the scale of an entire
nation or no apples customer base these

570
00:44:14,189 --> 00:44:16,379
are huge huge groups of people

571
00:44:16,380 --> 00:44:19,339
the trust assumptions on people holding
keys are going to be enormous if you're

572
00:44:19,339 --> 00:44:22,009
not necessarily going to trust all of
them especially given what we've learned

573
00:44:22,009 --> 00:44:28,809
since 2013 about how much we can trust
the government so so there are a lot of

574
00:44:28,809 --> 00:44:32,779
a substance that simply have not been
ever tested at that kind of level so

575
00:44:32,779 --> 00:44:36,749
what works beautifully on a white board
of the maybe a small system doesn't

576
00:44:36,749 --> 00:44:41,019
always work at the scale of an entire
hundreds of servers and he's actually

577
00:44:41,019 --> 00:44:47,009
very skillful into the hundreds but I
mean when I look into it

578
00:44:47,010 --> 00:44:52,340
twenty years now and I we're trying to
deploy complex systems now with

579
00:44:52,340 --> 00:44:57,980
cryptography enabled and fundamentally
setting aside policy education side

580
00:44:57,980 --> 00:45:04,760
you've got extraordinarily complex
causes a lot and I and I'll be honest

581
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:10,310
with you everybody I'm not gonna go in
typing or try to remember this key was

582
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:15,040
used here and that he was there you're
gonna have to automate and that's why do

583
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:21,630
they have to be synchronized centralized
place if you're using and how do you

584
00:45:21,630 --> 00:45:26,790
deal with that and i got the mobile
world are you got maybe people who are

585
00:45:26,790 --> 00:45:30,940
very involved with you know in Iran and
want to communicate among you know

586
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:35,050
people who are against their
government's actions that's gonna be

587
00:45:35,050 --> 00:45:41,020
different but different systems mobile
we're dealing with centralized

588
00:45:41,020 --> 00:45:46,980
management and after centralized that
means are accessible to be accessible to

589
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:52,720
design systems do that in a way that's
not compromising you know what I want to

590
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:59,779
make sure we have a chance to ask
questions it's ok maybe

591
00:45:59,780 --> 00:46:04,630
did that person wanna ask a question or
are they good

592
00:46:04,630 --> 00:46:14,910
couple of questions really so first we
talked about cryptography

593
00:46:14,910 --> 00:46:19,109
transposition substitution cipher kind
of thing how does the supplied something

594
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:28,500
like this taken out there that is is
also covered and second question would

595
00:46:28,500 --> 00:46:38,260
be more involved this key particularly
billion personal level he said that so I

596
00:46:38,260 --> 00:46:41,559
mean the first answer is that we have no
solution for steganography steganography

597
00:46:41,559 --> 00:46:46,339
is the art of hiding information and
other information we have no solution to

598
00:46:46,339 --> 00:46:50,630
that we have no solution Brax we have no
solution for open-source encryption

599
00:46:50,630 --> 00:46:53,740
projects there's nothing you can do
about this information will never be

600
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:58,089
accessible the best you can do is
outlawed cryptography to the point where

601
00:46:58,089 --> 00:47:01,180
maybe you can detect people using those
and then you just go out to them on

602
00:47:01,180 --> 00:47:05,470
suspicion so those things are done
that's always going to be an open area

603
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:08,848
now in terms of how who pays for
managing key as well right now apple

604
00:47:08,849 --> 00:47:13,450
pays for managing their own keys Moxie
base for managing its own keys that

605
00:47:13,450 --> 00:47:17,250
works great but who pays for all of this
additional work for building systems

606
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:20,720
that support exceptional access that's
going to be very expensive to do

607
00:47:20,720 --> 00:47:25,750
securely and it's not clear who's gonna
bear the cost of doing that from a legal

608
00:47:25,750 --> 00:47:29,670
perspective is technically covered under
some of the acts that are coming out or

609
00:47:29,670 --> 00:47:39,099
is it applied only I think about things
that would be considered Dr Peter

610
00:47:39,099 --> 00:47:43,190
whatever rules would cover cryptography
would should should cover that you

611
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:46,490
should come as well but at this point we
don't know what the laws are going to be

612
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:51,538
a law that it seems very unlikely or
going out something that says PGB or a

613
00:47:51,539 --> 00:47:55,160
steganography program has to include a
back door you're more likely to see

614
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:58,970
carriers be approached and so they
wouldn't be affected by that makes a lot

615
00:47:58,970 --> 00:48:01,980
of sense to approach that the carrier
level already I messaged level of the

616
00:48:01,980 --> 00:48:06,770
key server because fewer parties who
have to interact within and perhaps

617
00:48:06,770 --> 00:48:12,150
compelled to support your back door
system that the better for efficiency

618
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:16,109
and cost no like so if you're really
just looking at you know something like

619
00:48:16,109 --> 00:48:22,538
whatsapp iMessage tech secure things
like that if you just had those three

620
00:48:22,539 --> 00:48:28,220
key servers you be doing pretty well in
terms of in terms of what you would you

621
00:48:28,220 --> 00:48:32,509
would cover so one of the other points
actually want to make earlier about the

622
00:48:32,510 --> 00:48:40,170
the advantages of the key injection is
that it was going to be criticisms of

623
00:48:40,170 --> 00:48:44,380
Chester systems is that very subject to
abuse and once there's a master key out

624
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:48,420
there is very hard to control who can
use it when his keys persist that's a

625
00:48:48,420 --> 00:48:54,069
huge problem persists coming forward to
going backwards a break for security but

626
00:48:54,069 --> 00:48:58,529
if you did key injection that that does
potentially solve some of those problems

627
00:48:58,529 --> 00:49:04,010
because you don't have to master key if
if somebody if a warrant is properly

628
00:49:04,010 --> 00:49:07,779
issued for a certain persons
communications applications from certain

629
00:49:07,779 --> 00:49:14,059
device that key gets injected for that
account and then tikki content expire

630
00:49:14,059 --> 00:49:18,539
till it stops what's up the government
from escrow every single person from

631
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:22,640
inject take it to every single count I
think we you end up how would you have

632
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:25,868
to do is you have to have first of all
you need is building up oversight that's

633
00:49:25,869 --> 00:49:29,319
that's a whole separate or some boring
legal things are going to be some other

634
00:49:29,319 --> 00:49:34,650
time maybe but I think if Nick center
using Apple's servers Apple is it is

635
00:49:34,650 --> 00:49:39,289
since we could become a whistleblower I
obviously they're not allowed to vote

636
00:49:39,289 --> 00:49:45,779
who is being monitored but if they had
if Apple announced that it had 88 keys

637
00:49:45,779 --> 00:49:51,530
serials keys and I think people might
get concerned about this is going

638
00:49:51,530 --> 00:50:00,440
think we should I think I take issue
with the idea that dejection may be much

639
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:06,580
of a solution in that it it relies on
what is effectively a user experience

640
00:50:06,580 --> 00:50:12,560
design compromise on the board of Apple
to take care of your health but that

641
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:19,290
security distribution really involves
three receptions for reading that lists

642
00:50:19,290 --> 00:50:24,770
all the defender of anything at the
distal recipients key is that which he

643
00:50:24,770 --> 00:50:28,840
believes to be the correct key to your
your we trust Apple because we think we

644
00:50:28,840 --> 00:50:32,490
can trust Apple but once we announced
that you can't trust Apple that nobody

645
00:50:32,490 --> 00:50:39,709
will trust Apple even Apple might decide
to change the design response to such an

646
00:50:39,710 --> 00:50:44,800
idea I do think that big problems just
when they start and that is exactly that

647
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,670
that that trust this was part of the
reason why these systems work so well

648
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:51,860
you're not knowing the winds need to
know when he said verified their team

649
00:50:51,860 --> 00:50:55,840
with anybody else we discuss it in to
work quickly adopted everybody to verify

650
00:50:55,840 --> 00:51:00,080
brzezinski adoption would be far less to
maybe maybe we can exploit that user

651
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:06,080
experience issue one way or the other I
still wish I could verify I think you

652
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:09,980
should have it I we agree on this
completely thank you so much for coming

653
00:51:09,980 --> 00:51:17,100
to our school at the reviews you get
that email thank you
