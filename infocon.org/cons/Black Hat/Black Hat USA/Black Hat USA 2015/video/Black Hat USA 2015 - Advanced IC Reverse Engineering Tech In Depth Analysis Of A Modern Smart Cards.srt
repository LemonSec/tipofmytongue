1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,569
and everybody thank you for coming I'm
very happy to be here with you gonna

2
00:00:05,569 --> 00:00:10,599
share resume my research and if you the
other air reverse engineering that's

3
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:17,390
that's the thing I do since an hour over
10 years and I created my company like

4
00:00:17,390 --> 00:00:22,529
two years ago because to me I do various
engineering and other US agreed to

5
00:00:22,529 --> 00:00:29,420
something that should be taken very
carefully because all of the the cold

6
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:35,250
and get things are we will be on on some
devices at some point some trips so it

7
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:42,719
means that the trip itself must be very
secure to keep your secrets secrets

8
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,079
over the years have been told that the
reverse engineering and other attacks

9
00:00:47,079 --> 00:00:52,520
were something that nobody that it's a
threat but it really shouldn't be so big

10
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:56,399
because the time and resources involved
a pretty big need some big equipment

11
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,609
this study can be very long and so so
everybody says likely we know but the

12
00:01:01,609 --> 00:01:06,890
threat it's a threat we know that the
attacks can give very nice results it's

13
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:13,119
effective but you know it's the attack
today the number of attackers to law and

14
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:18,409
and mostly we don't care and this
reflects also endured a valuation retail

15
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:24,990
for the cards because as the reason time
and resources the the craterian doesn't

16
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:31,429
take care for me but this kind of
techniques so that's why I created my

17
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:36,049
company because I wanted to investigate
two things so first of all what can be

18
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:42,270
done with the reverse engineering intern
piracy in terms of other big doors in

19
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:50,060
turmoil I prefer intermol listens to and
end at the same time I wanted to

20
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:56,890
to experiment and it and I was sure the
time that we could make the time and

21
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:03,079
resources reason disappear because
that's the point I think we can analyze

22
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:08,739
out there pretty fast and that's the
subject of the stock so for this talk we

23
00:02:08,739 --> 00:02:13,900
will demonstrate our group of pirates
will attack discard this card is a

24
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:18,920
patriot cards so we will talk to a bit
longer but that's the goal for the

25
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:23,390
Pirates will be just to this is a black
box for them you know they take the card

26
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:27,910
will just remove it from plastic and
resolutely need to know and say okay so

27
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:32,510
we have a card what's the architecture
we don't know about it and what's inside

28
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:36,480
the memory company the memories of
nobody they were they want to dump its

29
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,660
so we will see today how we can extract
these kind of things in a matter of

30
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:46,209
weeks not months left before the blacks
black book situation so we'll start with

31
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:50,280
some background before jumping inside
the car to know just to give you an idea

32
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:56,739
of their security has been taken into
account over the years so the background

33
00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:01,680
is we will focus and secure microchips
so secure microcontrollers are all

34
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:07,390
around us in our pockets because its ID
cards its banking cards cards cards

35
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:11,220
everywhere but it's also present

36
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:16,540
video game controllers printer ink
cartridges and all of the consumable

37
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:23,000
that must be protected to make sure that
you are buying the right brand so in

38
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:29,690
this situation we have physical controls
everywhere and we have invested attacks

39
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:34,320
so I won't speak about side channels I
won't speak about an invasive attacks

40
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:39,170
because for me if I have to import cheap
let's say for example visit priority out

41
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:39,780
somewhere

42
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:45,530
of some sort and I want to expected to
find a way to to build countermeasure I

43
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:49,520
will do an invisible attack because I
know my chance of success is a very

44
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:55,220
close to 100% and with the techniques
described its 100% and it's pretty fast

45
00:03:55,220 --> 00:04:00,090
so that's the whole thing about the talk
so when we are speaking about other

46
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:05,560
insecurity I have to speak about
patriotism points because they were many

47
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,860
the first market to suffer heavily from
this kind of things you know because as

48
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:14,610
you know the decision all is broadcasted
to everybody so everybody get the single

49
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:19,380
and Delmon opinion need is to have a key
so it's called the control word which is

50
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:23,409
decrypted by dismantled over there so if
you have the controller basically you

51
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:29,490
can decrypt the the channels in which to
me for free so it didn't take too long

52
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:37,110
to to to Savile was kind of device to
emulate official cards so that karen is

53
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:41,919
must be the same as the original except
that the trips every channel and that

54
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:46,859
the experience and detailed description
is likely into yours or influence

55
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,690
whatsoever I think the battery will die
before maybe so

56
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:57,660
a speech TV good this problem a lot you
know the one that for pushing the other

57
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:01,900
securities seen you know and as you can
see in in

58
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:09,729
in 20 years in 10 years almost in 10
years due amounts of consumer and send

59
00:05:09,729 --> 00:05:15,300
swords and shields and things that
Greece was a growing constantly and

60
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,449
rapidly and so now and when we are
speaking about smart cards it's

61
00:05:19,449 --> 00:05:23,910
completely two devices not just like
before where you can open the trip

62
00:05:23,910 --> 00:05:28,020
look at it understand mainly it was
working and just try to extracted the

63
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,719
thing is completely different now it's
pretty arms but at the same time so

64
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:38,039
pitch he was pushing the security to
address security markets but we are

65
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:43,419
seeing like straight globalization right
now so it means not only pay TV was the

66
00:05:43,419 --> 00:05:47,990
problem of piracy because peres's just
one thing but various supply chain

67
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:53,120
security which is of major concern
because of most of the good to do people

68
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,400
design ships but they don't build them
himself that to a trip up somewhere and

69
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,109
they got the trip back to know and
what's become the trip back to the the

70
00:06:04,110 --> 00:06:07,810
one we designed always bugged or
something so that's that's a very

71
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:13,330
critical issue but also if somebody's
and also to reverse the county could

72
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:18,760
just since I please or stuff you know so
the security undercurrent lesbian

73
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:23,510
lesbian very big and the the biggest
thing that I see coming and it's already

74
00:06:23,510 --> 00:06:28,349
during the way it's going to fitting
because it is a small market you know

75
00:06:28,349 --> 00:06:30,760
but if you can apply any

76
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:37,830
ink cartridges or consumable whatsoever
and you're you're reaching US markets

77
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:40,550
and for pirates it's it's the way to go

78
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:45,750
so the same time we have doing tonight
the Kings who is it was coming and fast

79
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:50,270
and is the same thing we will react to
rely on secure microchip microcontroller

80
00:06:50,270 --> 00:06:55,810
bills that would be all around us and it
will push the security team and when do

81
00:06:55,810 --> 00:07:00,400
the parents are already doing
contributes citizens it could be a real

82
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:07,190
critical issue so anyway so that's just
for introduction but now 22 this little

83
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:11,510
car I will first explain the approach we
were taking four police took because

84
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:16,490
it's a research project so it's it's a
research project that we wanted to me as

85
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:22,060
close as possible as pirates now you're
so this discount for me was a black

86
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:31,140
books and a truce to spend too much time
I choose to try to to look at a picture

87
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:35,669
we can because it's supposed to be a
really nice card in it is I mean this

88
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:41,690
card was on the field for I don't know
more than seven years and never never

89
00:07:41,690 --> 00:07:47,260
nobody was close to to to get to it you
know so that's pretty cool but if you

90
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:51,860
ask me now which specific vendor
invoices I won't give you the answer but

91
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:57,730
I can just say that what I will present
today is applicable to any smart cards

92
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:06,670
in this situation almost from smuggles
to assist you know if you have any sort

93
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:11,540
of course it's a bit more work to exist
in the same approach you can do the same

94
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:17,950
thing so what's what's I want to
Ferguson will be the analysis method

95
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:23,490
because when I was starting this ten
years ago and we have to extract achieve

96
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:28,320
it was pretty funny because we had to
take pictures with a microscope can open

97
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:31,490
the pictures together and then we were
tracing lines by N

98
00:08:31,490 --> 00:08:37,630
Novus Photoshop and was pretty painful
and it was pretty time consuming and

99
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:42,349
at some point foot worship was crushing
or it took 10 minutes to save a picture

100
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:50,060
or your computer was too old to not
enough for whatsoever a super yarn so we

101
00:08:50,060 --> 00:08:54,569
we choose the old Tris and that's what
we're talking about we really talked

102
00:08:54,570 --> 00:09:00,320
about the regime preparation because to
me that's that's not the biggest parts

103
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:04,500
but it's a big part if you're prepared
enough it will simplify your life for

104
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:10,630
the rest of the analysis so the the
first temple this is a failure analysis

105
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:17,439
techniques so it's simple preparation so
you have like the integrated circuitry

106
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,690
12 differences it's the integrated
circuit is like this track which is like

107
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:29,130
10 micron speak with interconnect layers
and transistor at the bottom and we want

108
00:09:29,130 --> 00:09:34,390
to 22 image that it's a situation so I
expect to mir technology that is already

109
00:09:34,390 --> 00:09:35,370
quite small

110
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:40,769
not the smallest one but like ninety 90
metre or maybe a bit below and

111
00:09:40,769 --> 00:09:45,249
when you we are talking about this
feature size it it means that we can't

112
00:09:45,249 --> 00:09:49,309
rely on a single pictures anymore
because they would you will see it it's

113
00:09:49,309 --> 00:09:53,249
it's not visible to trace line on the
optical pictures because you see nothing

114
00:09:53,249 --> 00:09:58,259
and then this is to the analysis which
will read which which will be sorry the

115
00:09:58,259 --> 00:10:06,269
main part of the talk so I opened the
card and i was looking at the material

116
00:10:06,269 --> 00:10:11,779
and when I was removing the plastic I
remove also the position which is an

117
00:10:11,779 --> 00:10:15,910
oxide layer on top of the trip to
protect it and the trip was looking like

118
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:21,189
white so it's it's already information
the chip is made of aluminium and its

119
00:10:21,189 --> 00:10:25,998
technology that I like a lot because for
the it gives you a choice for the

120
00:10:25,999 --> 00:10:30,290
process which is pretty straightforward
if the trip is very minimal

121
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:37,170
made of tungsten and this difference in
in material gives you the ability to

122
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:42,969
each and the text and will not be
attached to it so it means you can reach

123
00:10:42,970 --> 00:10:48,799
of its kind of pictures where you have
like three colors black is the traces of

124
00:10:48,799 --> 00:10:52,179
the lines lines are not here anymore
we'll just see the profile of them you

125
00:10:52,179 --> 00:10:58,049
know the white is the job going down to
the level below and the rest so they're

126
00:10:58,049 --> 00:11:02,470
great thing will be excited around

127
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:08,180
the length so it means that if you have
this kind of things maybe you can you

128
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:14,680
know official differing and and separate
the futures and automatically detect

129
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:20,800
them and that's what we will do so once
you you did miss the processing you will

130
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,410
make symmetric so on the left picture
you have an obstacle picture of the the

131
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:30,360
trip and as you can see it's very active
Lalang because we see like big blocks of

132
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:36,240
many lines and if I want to trace one
you know it's it's almost impossible and

133
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,070
it is with modern ships on the right
side

134
00:11:39,070 --> 00:11:45,610
SEM picture so scanning electron
microscope picture and what we see is a

135
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:50,810
standard set and you see that the
depreciation gates may be like ninety 90

136
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:56,939
metre wide and it's looking like 100
pixel you know so you have in a position

137
00:11:56,940 --> 00:12:02,430
to to deal with with with with the chips
even who is this mysterious on the trip

138
00:12:02,430 --> 00:12:09,290
so the trip honking outs of like five
layers it as a shield to but I want to

139
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:15,589
shield for the simple reason it's
nothing in the analysis process and from

140
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:20,770
my experience I don't know every nice
shield I don't know if that icon papers

141
00:12:20,770 --> 00:12:25,829
that I can just go between the lines of
something so I won't speak about she

142
00:12:25,830 --> 00:12:31,060
will just be about the core and all the
difference so we have like 25 mental

143
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:36,500
errors so deeply deeply picture on the
pretty picture you will see the actual

144
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:41,500
various great political lines so it's
the phone lines on it you know and the

145
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:48,140
whites that are going to the metal one
year earlier so as I said I removed the

146
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:53,640
line so we see traces of the lines and
if you're going down to something which

147
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:55,600
has recently with a report

148
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:03,139
something so we had like fifteen hundred
pictures earlier which is like average

149
00:13:03,139 --> 00:13:08,680
size for smart cards not to be it's a
really big I mean you hit a bigger drive

150
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:15,859
but it's it's not the biggest thing on
earth you know so the fact that we

151
00:13:15,860 --> 00:13:22,350
removed two pictures you something that
gives us a lot of trouble for one simple

152
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:29,630
reason is we are distorted and if you
ask the USDM vendor to have like tables

153
00:13:29,630 --> 00:13:34,920
for the distortion or something that he
was ok I didn't know it was distorted

154
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:39,120
you know so you have to to to find a way
to to correct that yourself so that was

155
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:43,790
one issue and it's a big issue because
now you have like a lot of picture and

156
00:13:43,790 --> 00:13:48,529
as I said 1500 pictures to me is not a
lot of picture ID some pictures you know

157
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:53,000
but if you have likely already 1000
picture when you want to creating

158
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,319
additional pictures together could be an
issue you know so it's an issue for our

159
00:13:57,319 --> 00:14:00,670
longing to do the pictures together but
now you have to elect leaders also

160
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:05,870
together and you know it was me I create
enough that you can't raise the same

161
00:14:05,870 --> 00:14:13,019
goal in sight to the cheap deep inside
the cheap on many layers and and and

162
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:17,750
this can be tricky and on top of that
you have to stand outside so I would

163
00:14:17,750 --> 00:14:23,319
guess I should have written standard
says when I was running electronic I was

164
00:14:23,319 --> 00:14:30,189
told that this was gates but tremendous
a standout cells so I'm sorry for this

165
00:14:30,189 --> 00:14:35,199
anyway so we have all this problem and
forced the solution was to to write like

166
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:39,589
a tool so that's what I did I was
writing at all so it's called serious

167
00:14:39,589 --> 00:14:44,019
automated reverse and training software
in Smith to address all of this spring's

168
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:48,199
you know so it's made for extracting the
features but also created a picture

169
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:53,699
together make distract and you can't
raise two fingers inside to disclose

170
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:58,189
graph and some so that's what we will do
so first step of the studio now will be

171
00:14:58,189 --> 00:15:02,449
to extract the future so we have the
same picture and we do some

172
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:08,380
need and we get the extraction version
of its with lines and we can do listen

173
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:13,770
all the pictures we don't do the same
thing for the standout cells which means

174
00:15:13,770 --> 00:15:19,120
we have like metal one and the picture
of the same standard cell if we put that

175
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:24,360
together we have is expected version of
it we can steve is pretty silly this is

176
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:31,350
like you know get the penis transistors
are our ball hits the area was are

177
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:35,600
usually smaller and you can just buy I
see what's going on

178
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,940
ok so you do respond all the trip so now
we assume that we have extracted every

179
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:45,600
feature of the food core of the of the
smart card and I we will see what we can

180
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:51,630
do is it so if people back to his
current so what do we see so first of

181
00:15:51,630 --> 00:15:56,240
all we can already see a lot of things
on the bottom left this is all analog

182
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,910
blocks that I will not speak about
because it's not interesting for me

183
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:04,589
student account could be but in this
case I will do something else on the

184
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:10,920
bottom right on the top right sorry ways
to look up from on the top left

185
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:16,449
run which is pretty big and human memory
the blue thing is the is the flash

186
00:16:16,450 --> 00:16:22,390
memory and all the rest of his green
thing which is a bit like a duck for the

187
00:16:22,390 --> 00:16:28,069
shape I don't know is there is the core
digital secretary that drives the trip

188
00:16:28,070 --> 00:16:34,050
you know so as I said we extracted every
future so all his

189
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:35,729
range

190
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:40,690
thing is the current features of the
core extracted that we did the same also

191
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:46,870
for the standard cells so every of the
green points is a cell or so for the

192
00:16:46,870 --> 00:16:52,240
particulars today there is like 22 who
frozen cells that are displayed here

193
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:58,139
it's not all of them but it's enough for
and during the study so you have a great

194
00:16:58,139 --> 00:17:03,579
year which has been extracted data to
justify but we will come back again on

195
00:17:03,579 --> 00:17:10,020
this point alright so what did occur
once now is to extract the memory

196
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:14,679
contents so when I see all of this
memory of course I don't want to extract

197
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:19,549
the rar I want to extract the rum and I
want to extract the flashing I want to

198
00:17:19,549 --> 00:17:24,859
know which which is the main memory and
so on so let's speak about the flash for

199
00:17:24,859 --> 00:17:30,850
first so it's easy to to to spot a flush
with optical pictures oh by the way this

200
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:36,459
is backside pictures all of the optical
pictures we will see our backsides Sobek

201
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:41,490
said it means I remove remove the built
so no more so you can book and I can

202
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:48,020
just looks through did become like this
I think for me it's it's it's the best

203
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:52,980
picture to quickly get information that
we're out the first where memories where

204
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:58,270
all the books you know it's it's very
useful so when I C vs casey you on on

205
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:03,429
the bottom reads like this white
rectangles and was our capacity as you

206
00:18:03,429 --> 00:18:07,660
know and if you have a flashlight in
your prime for sure you are attached to

207
00:18:07,660 --> 00:18:13,290
it because the flash or chrome to you
raise your right itself it needs to have

208
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:18,030
like I trent's so it needs to build
reception or any country just take the

209
00:18:18,030 --> 00:18:22,149
five water comes to it and general
advice you know she's using restructure

210
00:18:22,150 --> 00:18:28,380
its which is the the charge for this
cooperation writing and erasing so it

211
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:34,320
means also that this is the chatroom I
can just switch the high-profile anger

212
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,389
another trip counter euros or program
itself this can be very useful because

213
00:18:38,389 --> 00:18:42,639
in most cases for example these
prejudicial denver is a security and

214
00:18:42,639 --> 00:18:47,629
triggered but the charge pump now
country race / there's nothing that can

215
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:52,710
prevent you for just doing your research
and starting again so it's it's pretty

216
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:56,960
useful to tune or other children please
because it's it's a it's something that

217
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:03,230
you can easily cuts to avoid like sheep
areas here when when security here in to

218
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:08,639
interrupt are triggered alright so this
is the flash so I want to read it now so

219
00:19:08,639 --> 00:19:15,539
I need to find out the difference over
over the top of its so you see like QVC

220
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:21,750
interactive goes repeating and you can
see on the human version the thing and

221
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:26,450
so I said back safely try interesting
because as you can see we can still see

222
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:32,279
at least I would say 23 metal layers
beneath the interconnect Piranesi

223
00:19:32,279 --> 00:19:36,700
invertebrates also a good thing you know
because I can quickly spots where they

224
00:19:36,700 --> 00:19:42,679
are putting this in years you know and I
can already tell trace it so what we saw

225
00:19:42,679 --> 00:19:48,009
is that it's just what you have like a
number of charges directly into groups

226
00:19:48,009 --> 00:19:53,629
and it goes on both sides of the the
flash so now we need to to to find the

227
00:19:53,629 --> 00:19:57,158
right place to to make the extraction
and I suppose that this is a situation

228
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:04,519
if so it must be encrypted at least
encrypted so we can just extract the

229
00:20:04,519 --> 00:20:08,320
data herein think we will do we will be
done but will be the case we live like

230
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:16,960
that and we will be able to do nothing
with it so just dress for Apple products

231
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:24,019
and I tried to trace the output of the
flash to the core optical pictures was

232
00:20:24,019 --> 00:20:30,740
painful and i couldnt eat res 19 for
sure but line was going inside of course

233
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:31,730
of its the line

234
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:36,250
arriving inside the core but that's the
only one that they could trace to the

235
00:20:36,250 --> 00:20:36,780
core

236
00:20:36,780 --> 00:20:41,160
you know and it's a bit frustrating and
that was due the stressful part of the

237
00:20:41,160 --> 00:20:45,560
of the custody because ok I will give a
total black hat and no I don't know

238
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:50,270
where the pressure rising to the the
logic it's pretty bad but anyway so we

239
00:20:50,270 --> 00:20:55,490
found only one but to me it's enough
because now we can trace it and try to

240
00:20:55,490 --> 00:21:02,800
find your voice so limited we were using
for the old study is like emitted where

241
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:08,520
we think that the differences qualities
average it's not perfect we also think

242
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:15,120
that the image created he's not perfect
and we therefore we assume that the

243
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:20,760
feature extraction is not 100% accurate
so we have to choice we can say okay

244
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:24,290
it's not perfect but what we will do is
we will correct everything before

245
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:30,360
starting the study will shake every
future correct and we didn't choose that

246
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:33,969
route because what we wanted to do is
not extract the full flooding at least

247
00:21:33,970 --> 00:21:40,210
of the trip it's just trying to to find
a way to extract the memory in the

248
00:21:40,210 --> 00:21:46,770
shortest amount of time and without
using heavy equipment such as focused

249
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:48,350
and games and stuff like that

250
00:21:48,350 --> 00:21:56,540
alright so we did what I called
languishing so it's like me to show but

251
00:21:56,540 --> 00:22:00,830
to make the task is to click on a line
and now you know where it's going it's

252
00:22:00,830 --> 00:22:05,129
already connected to the to the standard
cells and so on his building drive to

253
00:22:05,130 --> 00:22:08,700
very low profile and everything at the
same time support you to look at the

254
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:14,430
district is it's very comfortable you
know you don't spend like a day to

255
00:22:14,430 --> 00:22:15,730
producing the language

256
00:22:15,730 --> 00:22:23,160
New Deal follow like everything so what
they did first I have a new one output

257
00:22:23,160 --> 00:22:26,990
and I wanted to know where it was going
and whistled which is going to to

258
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:31,910
mention flexors and which placer
structures are frail I can say to trip

259
00:22:31,910 --> 00:22:37,860
for a good reason because if you have a
multiplexer upstream boots so two

260
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:41,250
different inputs in a control signal to
decide which one will you go to the

261
00:22:41,250 --> 00:22:45,720
other two you know so it means you can
just below the the control signals to

262
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:50,670
find all of them you know so if I have
too many pictures available now

263
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:56,430
selection signal I will find all of them
on December you know and this thing is

264
00:22:56,430 --> 00:23:02,750
pretty nice because I can pull all of
them on the symbol I can trace them back

265
00:23:02,750 --> 00:23:09,360
so this is a view inside the software is
some of the the gates traced and so on

266
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:15,459
and this is what happens when we do we
trace the singles back so now I know

267
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:21,380
where all of the output of the flash
going inside the core and I'm sure it's

268
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:25,300
it's not like I could be this line on
the one next to it it's over charades

269
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:31,899
respond so it doesn't mean anything i
mean you can't extracted the chip at

270
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:37,130
this stage but at least we know what's
going on and so it was also is the

271
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:42,190
decision soon on so it's going to do
Mix's we have the Flash output go into

272
00:23:42,190 --> 00:23:46,760
it and we were trying to make sense of
this like you can change the order of

273
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:53,120
the bits you know inside the word and he
could be in generous toward could be

274
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:57,550
something else but to me it's not real
events so far to try to guess what

275
00:23:57,550 --> 00:24:03,360
decision are you going to them tomorrow
so we have to follow now the dementia

276
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:09,310
places and that's what we did so we
followed that was to pass you know one

277
00:24:09,310 --> 00:24:15,549
person was combinatorial logic could be
like as boxes or light encryption

278
00:24:15,549 --> 00:24:20,549
very light for me and visit Derek path
with a good book go back to amateur

279
00:24:20,549 --> 00:24:25,929
picture and you have one powerful
generates so again to to follow this is

280
00:24:25,929 --> 00:24:32,429
pretty easy and you have the example of
what's the disorder is giving us as

281
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:39,940
israeli visualization so the visit is
part of the the tool is not super fancy

282
00:24:39,940 --> 00:24:47,580
yet but it's fine of two to get the
information you want anyway so deal for

283
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:53,289
and I said therefore we get to this
point where we followed the two paths

284
00:24:53,289 --> 00:24:59,220
come into one then there is another mix
denver is also combinatorial logic so it

285
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:04,710
could be also scrambling something as
boxes and then we have like registers

286
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:10,580
and yeah I wrote instruction register
but that was the biggest part of the

287
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:14,980
study because at that stage you don't
know if it's the instruction register

288
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:19,109
just know that there is a registered
there if his instruction register it

289
00:25:19,109 --> 00:25:23,470
would mean the data is in clear and I
can extract the flash at this point I

290
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:29,409
don't have to look at something else
this is enough to know so that was the

291
00:25:29,409 --> 00:25:34,320
demand parts of the city was to look
just after which was going on because if

292
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:38,580
this is the instruction or just sir I
should have the instruction decoder just

293
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:44,299
have to differing you know and at that
point but you you should see is so the

294
00:25:44,299 --> 00:25:48,350
instruction decoder is usually the
biggest part of the energy or at least

295
00:25:48,350 --> 00:25:55,799
its big pretty big and so we decided to
check inside if you could see a grouping

296
00:25:55,799 --> 00:26:02,480
of you know like ok we see that here in
sticking six big 66 bit sorry or is

297
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:07,309
taking 12 years sticking it is grouping
to bits like this you know because when

298
00:26:07,309 --> 00:26:12,210
you have this information about size of
groups you just need to look at some

299
00:26:12,210 --> 00:26:15,570
shit you know like you take

300
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:22,139
career mode all I do think that I should
you know and you look at the instruction

301
00:26:22,139 --> 00:26:27,209
set you know until you try to find the
same group inside instructions and once

302
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:32,409
you free if you can find that nation's
crew to tell you that ok that's the

303
00:26:32,409 --> 00:26:38,609
instruction register so that was the
case but what that is what we we felt so

304
00:26:38,609 --> 00:26:44,590
once we compared of the match ok we have
to the instruction register it's really

305
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:50,799
bad at that stage because I'm sure at
this stage is in clear the flashes

306
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:57,700
demand memory and I can just look at the
the register and I can I can already say

307
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:02,100
ok I will jump the cheap at this point
you know and it was really bad because

308
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:07,559
of the lines that are going to do
instruction registers and and that

309
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:12,658
exists in the instruction register they
are all rooted from metal to let's say

310
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:17,629
two metal for so to the top of the trip
so you don't even need to to to do

311
00:27:17,629 --> 00:27:22,248
something serious beating two to reach
the lines were on top you know and

312
00:27:22,249 --> 00:27:31,039
that's really sad to see such thing so
anyway next parts is just too stingy

313
00:27:31,039 --> 00:27:39,490
instruction register and each register
us and we found the control signals that

314
00:27:39,490 --> 00:27:48,609
for us at the best 122 to make an attack
it's one is like a clock or read cinema

315
00:27:48,609 --> 00:27:54,159
which is perfect for synchronization
it's really useful

316
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:57,460
when you have a secure microcontroller
because one of the the controversial

317
00:27:57,460 --> 00:28:03,880
that is usually used during the clock so
your your clock cycles are like moving

318
00:28:03,880 --> 00:28:09,400
this way you know so it means it means
if you need several acquisition you can

319
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:13,480
sing them together but there's also
something else it would ever like trucks

320
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:19,010
to your meaning that some of the pics
acreages disappear you know randomly and

321
00:28:19,010 --> 00:28:23,600
now if you do several equity acquisition
and you are missing some clock cycles

322
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:28,120
you completely lost in your your your
bits don't match the inside the bites

323
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:33,320
and so on and you can't extract the data
but if you're visiting now you can dress

324
00:28:33,320 --> 00:28:38,649
them the cheap and you're like dick like
a clock to to to tell you went to sample

325
00:28:38,650 --> 00:28:45,080
data ended it is ok you know you also
know a thing like the evil see no evil

326
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:52,280
signal is the thing I like the most fun
registers because it prevents day or two

327
00:28:52,280 --> 00:28:57,950
to be updated so it means that I can
completely locking their registering the

328
00:28:57,950 --> 00:29:05,170
state's the output will not move
whatever happens the inputs and so we

329
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:10,770
have synchronization and enable and we
know that the data is in clear so at

330
00:29:10,770 --> 00:29:15,910
that stage we know that we can make a
good extraction so you could extraction

331
00:29:15,910 --> 00:29:16,960
is very

332
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:21,250
I mean it's an old technique very old
technique before people were just

333
00:29:21,250 --> 00:29:27,510
touching lines and should condemn to the
ground was enough to to to them chips so

334
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:32,158
it's a bit more tricky but if you can
play on the enable seamless you can you

335
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:38,510
can start to be in the position you want
so did all points of leader code

336
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:45,169
extraction just to to extract the full
memory contents in the address order you

337
00:29:45,169 --> 00:29:51,850
know so its address 0 let's address is
your address 1 address 2 risk-free and

338
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:56,418
so on so you extract the full memory
like this without any problem so what

339
00:29:56,419 --> 00:30:01,520
happens usually now is that the the
triple net started address 02 started

340
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:05,580
the end of the flash is a jump to
somewhere in the beginning so you don't

341
00:30:05,580 --> 00:30:09,620
want to to to be the beginning because
otherwise you will get just the end of

342
00:30:09,620 --> 00:30:14,510
the flesh so you want the trip to be
able to jump the beginning and now you

343
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:17,929
want to trigger the linear code
extraction and that's where the enable

344
00:30:17,929 --> 00:30:25,159
signal is very important I didn't
mention that but you can also so I put

345
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:30,450
up or needle extraction you could do it
is renewals which if you do it with poor

346
00:30:30,450 --> 00:30:35,890
it will give you extra redundancy to us
think the bits so it means for the

347
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:41,100
extraction you will have money do not
include the clock casino which will be

348
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:48,209
pro sink 1704 on the scene where you
will play with it actively to triggered

349
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:53,660
good extraction and then two needles and
this one will be treats and Europe will

350
00:30:53,660 --> 00:31:00,300
move on the and underlines so if your
processor is like a bit why'd you will

351
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:12,060
do seven acquisition 1615 and so on so
going to achieve induce me I just want

352
00:31:12,060 --> 00:31:17,060
to show you are not ship just to
comparing because when we speak about

353
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:21,720
all ships the only thing is different
you know we have like the EEPROM at the

354
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:22,530
bottom

355
00:31:22,530 --> 00:31:26,210
interprets images pictures it's really
easy to spot just looking at the lines

356
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:32,480
and the waiver structured and on top of
the temperature of the core we can also

357
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:36,940
raised in New Year since that is the
core because it's all mister you know

358
00:31:36,940 --> 00:31:42,040
and in between we have like the
strictures 88 and was like going from

359
00:31:42,040 --> 00:31:45,610
the American structure and put into the
structure to the course it's very easy

360
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:49,969
now to to know its output input buffer
and you already know that you can make

361
00:31:49,970 --> 00:31:55,360
dealing with extraction they're done you
know it's it's like i don't know today's

362
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:59,879
or something but that's not what really
we have with with Madonna cheap where we

363
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:06,390
have to jump inside according check so
when you have to go now to defeat to

364
00:32:06,390 --> 00:32:13,190
really extracted the contents it can be
problematic you know for many reason so

365
00:32:13,190 --> 00:32:17,570
I spoke about shells so even if I don't
think that she's a good it's still

366
00:32:17,570 --> 00:32:24,340
something that is preventing you to to
reach the lines very easily then

367
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:28,699
depending on the line 0122

368
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:33,560
to connect to you have to go from the
front side or from the backside and

369
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:41,690
excited it can be very difficult to do
because navigates inside with the trip

370
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:47,890
silicon substrates visible only could be
tricky because you have no reference

371
00:32:47,890 --> 00:32:51,840
point and you have to create some and so
on but going from different side was

372
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:57,010
made in chiapas the same because people
just plain areas the trips which means

373
00:32:57,010 --> 00:33:01,180
we'll just take you like polishing
machine and at the end of the process

374
00:33:01,180 --> 00:33:08,230
when we deposit last oxide layer to just
make it let you know if if I be afraid

375
00:33:08,230 --> 00:33:16,420
to face of oxide is just completely dark
just just like you know so the good

376
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:21,750
thing with the method we are using is
restricting extracted sorry every future

377
00:33:21,750 --> 00:33:27,330
of the core so we turned that into a
justifying so just two fighter thethe

378
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:32,120
fighter created by the chip manufacturer
for just manufacturing the trip so we

379
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:36,550
have like those pains and was like you
can just put that inside the machine you

380
00:33:36,550 --> 00:33:41,580
know in our June every day with
disorderly so you precisely nowhere you

381
00:33:41,580 --> 00:33:45,649
where you are where you want to go what
you want to reach so it makes a lot of

382
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:51,750
bravery during the past just digging
holes to try to find like your places I

383
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:55,530
can connect to and it was a very
difficult when you have this kind of

384
00:33:55,530 --> 00:34:02,580
ability it's like you are it's it's very
comfortable so anyway so with all of

385
00:34:02,580 --> 00:34:10,850
this clash extracted check so let's look
at the wrong now so the debates in Iran

386
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:18,000
could be anywhere and you know it could
be due parents would be between the

387
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:26,989
various and Mittal 10 between eight and
12 whatsoever so the thing to do is just

388
00:34:26,989 --> 00:34:31,379
look at it and see if you see a
difference if you don't have it you know

389
00:34:31,379 --> 00:34:39,399
you know that the secluded as dopants so
I read some somewhere

390
00:34:39,399 --> 00:34:44,879
people could could do back doors on the
integrated circuit which depends and

391
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:50,038
that this is impossible to sports and I
never understood this you notice claim

392
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:53,779
because if you have like depends if you
can make a difference

393
00:34:53,779 --> 00:34:59,000
each so you will see that you will ever
like white thing that will remain in

394
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:05,390
black thing that is just dependent event
each way so it makes a difference now

395
00:35:05,390 --> 00:35:09,390
between the kind of depends so you can
read it so it means that at this stage

396
00:35:09,390 --> 00:35:15,868
we can just extracted the road bits we
don't know if it's encrypted or or in

397
00:35:15,869 --> 00:35:22,260
clear so we can check that but at least
we can extract them so we used the tool

398
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:29,220
and we did the same thing that we did
with with the flash that we just resting

399
00:35:29,220 --> 00:35:35,450
on where we just look what I was doing
so the room is encrypted and this really

400
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:41,549
knew since after after two minutes of
Destiny because we found some zone

401
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:45,220
gates you know everywhere and it's a
good sign I mean when you have

402
00:35:45,220 --> 00:35:50,959
exaggerated you have your encryption on
us for sure so we could also check

403
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:57,750
several things we figured out that the
room and I will talk about this later

404
00:35:57,750 --> 00:36:03,760
sorry but we will know that on the same
time we had mixes and we had flip flops

405
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:10,510
and this was confusing but it can simply
just tell that the description of the

406
00:36:10,510 --> 00:36:16,800
wrong is taking several cycles so ok you
know but so we know that it's encrypted

407
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:20,050
and we know that if we follow all of
these gates you know we loved

408
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:24,230
Description mechanism you know so we
have two rabbits we have the Description

409
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:28,930
mechanism we put that together and we
have the Roman clear so we didn't finish

410
00:36:28,930 --> 00:36:35,529
the the best part because it was not
interesting to have the declarant with

411
00:36:35,530 --> 00:36:42,330
us for a legal reason especially so but
to extract Durham I want using a machine

412
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:47,009
pictures are drying up because you have
the robots and you have the the

413
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:52,000
Description mechanism later the
underwear underwear is never lame so if

414
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,480
you can make a picture of it you you
will find what you're looking for for

415
00:36:55,480 --> 00:37:04,160
sure it's 102 some success is no nothing
to it all rights so then finally we we

416
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:11,710
we wanted to finish with with the RAM
and distribution from and something it's

417
00:37:11,710 --> 00:37:17,280
very very easy to spot that we are both
encrypted and after reserved reply but

418
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,290
we don't really care about that in
denver is a mix and then again some

419
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:29,560
trainer scrambling and encryption and ok
so we know it's a secure trip so

420
00:37:29,560 --> 00:37:35,370
everything is encrypted and it makes
sense but we also know that now I want

421
00:37:35,370 --> 00:37:40,170
to use like putting reaction to change
the result or register value or

422
00:37:40,170 --> 00:37:42,550
something inside the RAM

423
00:37:42,550 --> 00:37:46,400
the chance of success is pretty no I
mean I will change it but we don't

424
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:51,130
review of the encryption mechanism by
which has a lot of where maybe I want to

425
00:37:51,130 --> 00:37:54,980
change or new fuel are just maybe one
you know to get access to another page

426
00:37:54,980 --> 00:38:00,810
or simply so that was enough for us to
to to to to see and say ok this is

427
00:38:00,810 --> 00:38:07,509
encrypted we won't play resumed was like
and laser bleaching or you me or stuff

428
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:16,030
like that anyway so I will I will now
Google good to kind of conclusion so

429
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:23,900
it's a long conclusion get ready for our
first of all 22 so we will be requesting

430
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:29,070
that one day just to compare timing of
all the different attacks that I see in

431
00:38:29,070 --> 00:38:35,220
my work life so that is something that
if I have this chip today it's within a

432
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:41,730
week will be extracted because this trip
has absolutely no secret it's not good

433
00:38:41,730 --> 00:38:47,140
then I want to show you this because
this trip is there was something we did

434
00:38:47,140 --> 00:38:52,270
by Endre sponsorship so increasing
increasing inside the court so is it

435
00:38:52,270 --> 00:38:57,060
will be a good comparison between the
dismantled we just did it up 81 and

436
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,480
something which is not be true it's not
a secure but we had to do manual tracing

437
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:06,100
so that's a bit processor and when we
have when we studied the flashes of his

438
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:11,180
two blocks on top is only one passion oh
and if you see there is a grey area in

439
00:39:11,180 --> 00:39:14,620
the middle of the picture which is the
same pitcher we sit there and we see

440
00:39:14,620 --> 00:39:20,009
that race participants so 42 approach
for a bit processor for service like a

441
00:39:20,010 --> 00:39:24,480
million bucks or somewhere but this
particular going directly inside the car

442
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:29,430
so we knew that we had to go inside the
car if we wanted to find the magic spots

443
00:39:29,430 --> 00:39:36,839
to perform the extraction for example
and so that's what we need to know so we

444
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:40,090
wanted to find this party 2228

445
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:45,840
which police search with Photoshop in
nineteen so we found that there was

446
00:39:45,840 --> 00:39:54,380
three different pass to to follow and
the two first were not usable force so

447
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:58,030
there was one like you are pretty to
bits and you are some dates in a

448
00:39:58,030 --> 00:40:02,230
generation of one did you know it's up
to you to think that there could be an

449
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:08,040
instruction or just tell there because I
don't know anyone beat process second

450
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:13,880
pass was it was a bit better I like it
but we couldn't use it at the time so we

451
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:22,550
we we were finding which pictures and
then we find some people and in fact was

452
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:28,460
latch that's and this could be you know
but then we follow due to the latches

453
00:40:28,460 --> 00:40:35,210
and it's just like a change you know so
it's again computer instruction register

454
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:39,960
because you need to have like eight
outputs going somewhere and instruction

455
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:45,070
decoder and doing something which was
not the case we finally found the right

456
00:40:45,070 --> 00:40:49,700
spots with major producers and
instruction register and as you can see

457
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:55,220
there was the twosome single and alleges
clock so kind of reaching all for

458
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:59,859
synchronization which is very useful and
then they will signal which which we

459
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:04,250
give you the opportunity to just
navigate inside the code you know you

460
00:41:04,250 --> 00:41:08,020
could just you could you could like for
example get the running code and see

461
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:13,730
some branches and say ok I want to
enable the single european choose if you

462
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:19,430
want to branch or not you know so spring
magic but just to do this it's not that

463
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:24,990
negates I think it's like i don't know
like 300 or 400 gates you know we didn't

464
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:29,540
go deep inside the core and there was no
encryption that I wasn't here so we

465
00:41:29,540 --> 00:41:33,450
could have just taken to 42 did you know
and then it would have been difficult to

466
00:41:33,450 --> 00:41:37,220
find the right to total Britain why not
we would have to think and this stage

467
00:41:37,220 --> 00:41:43,379
but to do all this was taking like two
months is all rights so what's the time

468
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:48,030
where we needed to to to do this today
that we just true so this is the flash

469
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:56,370
just Cometic the trio were looking at
and so very less than two weeks and when

470
00:41:56,370 --> 00:42:02,580
I see matterease the processing the
trips getting every layer and the trip

471
00:42:02,580 --> 00:42:10,000
inside the SEM and make the pictures so
listen to reach then feature extraction

472
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:15,110
less than two weeks and we did some
checking to to to make sure it was

473
00:42:15,110 --> 00:42:23,710
writing off to to to work with then when
we were doing this I said under three

474
00:42:23,710 --> 00:42:27,550
we're just increasing money it's not
like we did you fall flat net lease and

475
00:42:27,550 --> 00:42:32,070
try to do something with it is retracing
with its making the Middle East as we go

476
00:42:32,070 --> 00:42:39,310
in and during that process we feel like
to 22,000 instances of the standard send

477
00:42:39,310 --> 00:42:46,670
a tree we extracted and we found
instruction register in like a day but

478
00:42:46,670 --> 00:42:50,610
to make sure it was instruction register
so looking at the instruction decoder to

479
00:42:50,610 --> 00:42:55,410
use like a week it was the longest part
of the studies show that this all study

480
00:42:55,410 --> 00:43:02,520
is like almost nothing you know it's
removed humanitarian the precision parts

481
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:08,310
it's like three weeks three weeks enough
you know in Sri recent trip which is

482
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:14,850
supposed to be super secure which will
benefit for 10 years will be extracted

483
00:43:14,850 --> 00:43:22,080
so I guess it's it's it's it's important
enough that I mentioned but it was it

484
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:29,100
was a real security what we saw was the
PLL

485
00:43:29,100 --> 00:43:32,299
memory encryption every memory was
encrypted

486
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:36,030
appreciation of the different parts
inside occurred this means that if I was

487
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:40,380
stressing airline you could almost go to
one side of the trip going back to the

488
00:43:40,380 --> 00:43:44,860
other side before reaching a standout
sell you know so you have a part of the

489
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:49,310
encryption which is here on the under on
one side of the trip when do the part of

490
00:43:49,310 --> 00:43:54,610
the same encryption is like a few
micrometers away and when they see

491
00:43:54,610 --> 00:44:01,180
micrometers its big partnership you know
so what was the pink so you had to put

492
00:44:01,180 --> 00:44:05,940
up with Photoshop expected time to be
like six months or so you know something

493
00:44:05,940 --> 00:44:11,730
pretty long then you know I could
extraction after say that this method is

494
00:44:11,730 --> 00:44:16,060
working and it will still work for some
time because some consumers are also

495
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:22,440
some consumers are things that you you
come to bypass the room you can read it

496
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:28,660
just based on the pictures and and then
yeah I put other custom implementation a

497
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:32,700
questionable I don't know if at some
point in the process because I'm sure

498
00:44:32,700 --> 00:44:38,520
his shippers crypto process are and I
think the room is made for it but there

499
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:42,660
could be a social system function you
know like cryptographic mention that are

500
00:44:42,660 --> 00:44:49,500
not software could read it would be
recorded as you can see you can Chris

501
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:55,520
lines but you can also generate at least
so it means that if you can find it and

502
00:44:55,520 --> 00:45:00,380
to find it would be like following the
Roman bit more and see where its branch

503
00:45:00,380 --> 00:45:04,750
to something that looks like a state
machine or another controller and you

504
00:45:04,750 --> 00:45:08,460
should then that's how you can just 22

505
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:14,589
the customer retention and again you do
trip is on the field for Fourier more

506
00:45:14,589 --> 00:45:23,960
you will have a lot of time to students
to to to find a producer exactly on the

507
00:45:23,960 --> 00:45:24,540
card

508
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:31,080
alright I will end up with with the
process so the facts to make it

509
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:32,880
completely

510
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:38,300
the process of the very best and ring
and described you as the result of a two

511
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:43,780
to be stressed as I was saying before
like the region he was less than two

512
00:45:43,780 --> 00:45:48,140
weeks you know and the defector

513
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:53,940
defector improvement compared to the
beauty shop manual increasing is like I

514
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:58,650
don't know it's hard to describe but
it's it's it's more than 15 it's it's

515
00:45:58,650 --> 00:46:05,780
huge and in this message is also opening
doors and this is something that's for

516
00:46:05,780 --> 00:46:09,950
sure how we use to investigate later
it's going on for now we have registered

517
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:15,290
and unregistered likely which is called
active and it's only did the standard

518
00:46:15,290 --> 00:46:21,529
cells you know I can filter the the
thing and i cant retail sales and the

519
00:46:21,530 --> 00:46:27,570
judges to poison produced to see
registers or latches and you can do that

520
00:46:27,570 --> 00:46:33,710
it means that night they come with some
investigate a key or lesser lesser fault

521
00:46:33,710 --> 00:46:38,170
injection I can just focus on visits
because I know that if a platoon leader

522
00:46:38,170 --> 00:46:43,660
for example on top of combinatorial
logic I don't expect much to happen but

523
00:46:43,660 --> 00:46:48,750
I do the same thing on top of her letter
people up the ethical it will be will be

524
00:46:48,750 --> 00:46:52,460
more powerful because the valuable
staging of the clock cycle and I will be

525
00:46:52,460 --> 00:46:58,040
able to prepare so it means I can reduce
the tax office by a factor which is just

526
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:03,779
huge and and and do the things like that
that is not the only doors that open

527
00:47:03,780 --> 00:47:08,650
with this kind of methods and I don't
know but I hope I will be there next

528
00:47:08,650 --> 00:47:13,620
year to show you some more aware of
things so thank you for your attention

529
00:47:13,620 --> 00:47:19,420
if you have any question visa microphone
there but we have like two minutes for

530
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:23,000
it but I will be available right after
if you have any question and we can

531
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:38,090
discuss together thank you

532
00:47:38,090 --> 00:47:44,080
they're just poured the recoding or
maybe you just say it loud enough to 200

533
00:47:44,080 --> 00:47:57,750
I get it and I will repeat

534
00:47:57,750 --> 00:47:59,140
no

535
00:47:59,140 --> 00:48:03,620
not really I'm sorry

536
00:48:03,620 --> 00:48:10,020
yes

537
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:14,430
yes

538
00:48:14,430 --> 00:48:21,750
almost i mean it's almost understand
architecture so the question is is the

539
00:48:21,750 --> 00:48:27,450
pictures enough to to make a clone of a
trip so yes I know it's enough to

540
00:48:27,450 --> 00:48:32,410
understand completely the architecture
the to find alton that must be custom

541
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:36,990
but say you miss one thing is the memory
contents and for the American centur is

542
00:48:36,990 --> 00:48:43,899
a flash or chrome unity extracted and
you can see the business side of luxury

543
00:48:43,900 --> 00:48:49,130
prom so you have to use like him and
make an idiot to be able to prove it did

544
00:48:49,130 --> 00:48:59,020
things but that's not very to just a
little bit of a question about your deep

545
00:48:59,020 --> 00:49:04,180
processing methods for delivering do you
have any particular trickery I know a

546
00:49:04,180 --> 00:49:08,578
lot of people are using polishing or
chemical d layering or lapping but those

547
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:12,089
tend to produce somewhat uneven results
when you're trying to do a full later

548
00:49:12,089 --> 00:49:17,578
image do you have any purpose to that
this so i i didnt

549
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:21,490
about the processing techniques

550
00:49:21,490 --> 00:49:25,200
I'm just asking if you have any
particular technique for even lead to

551
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:27,319
layering

552
00:49:27,319 --> 00:49:33,308
23 that's that's the truth that's tricky
parts if you want to to achieve

553
00:49:33,309 --> 00:49:38,640
something very even and also face need
to combat techniques I would I would

554
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:44,828
strongly advise anything like that or
reactive ion etching or anything along

555
00:49:44,829 --> 00:49:48,150
those lines or yeah i know i mean

556
00:49:48,150 --> 00:49:52,299
machine chemical mechanical polishing

557
00:49:52,299 --> 00:49:57,279
so to avoid chemicals and if you do all
of that in the right order you will get

558
00:49:57,279 --> 00:50:02,609
to the processing which is very
complicated and maybe just related at

559
00:50:02,609 --> 00:50:06,650
that time you had mentioned something
that I haven't actually seen or done

560
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:10,630
before where he removing the bulk so
again in emerging from the back side are

561
00:50:10,630 --> 00:50:16,020
you using Azure chemical recipe for just
making two bucks a feature that's very

562
00:50:16,020 --> 00:50:20,079
easy and it's it's super easy you just
need to have something that with all

563
00:50:20,079 --> 00:50:22,869
your cheap because when will be removed

564
00:50:22,869 --> 00:50:27,349
we left like 10 microns of interconnects
metal interconnections I don't exceed

565
00:50:27,349 --> 00:50:32,660
with mechanical constraints which
related to the chip itself and other

566
00:50:32,660 --> 00:50:36,460
traditional approaches going from the
top side using hydrochloric or or

567
00:50:36,460 --> 00:50:41,609
something i mean you can do this but on
modern ships is there's no way this can

568
00:50:41,609 --> 00:50:46,490
be used to have a good results with
chemical do you actually use for doing

569
00:50:46,490 --> 00:50:52,009
that to processing I i'm sorry I don't
you will in the future I was just asking

570
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:57,520
what chemicals are you actually using
for the bulk silicon removal I use it to

571
00:50:57,520 --> 00:51:01,089
time it's 11 your dog suit

572
00:51:01,089 --> 00:51:09,380
ok so if you have any other question we
can discuss later thank you
