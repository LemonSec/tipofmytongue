1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,850
welcome to Black Cat 2015 thank you so
much for being here you are currently in

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,490
K

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:14,460
with the session data driven threat
intelligence metrics an indicator

4
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:22,029
dissemination and sharing with Alex
until and alexander's Sierra couple

5
00:00:22,029 --> 00:00:25,590
quick announcements there will be a
reception tonight and the business holla

6
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:32,700
at 5:30 p.m. but this college located in
the shoreline a room the pony alerts

7
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:42,200
will take place tonight Mandalay Bay BCD
6 p.m. so that's manly BCT and that side

8
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:46,430
of you all please would ensure that your
cell phones are on vibrate we would

9
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:48,719
appreciate it and enjoy the cut

10
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:56,710
talked how's it going

11
00:00:56,710 --> 00:01:01,800
thank you so much for being here it's
after lunch so tragic because away I'm

12
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,070
aware there are eight other talks going
on so I'll just save you the trouble the

13
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:11,970
point of the other talks is don't put
computers in stuff cuz that's pretty

14
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,720
much what's happening here all week long
so anyway this is a true friend

15
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,840
intelligence and if you guys are on the
twitters we have a hashtag for the talk

16
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:28,229
it's hashtag DDT I we try to keep it
very simple very few keystrokes you guys

17
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:34,329
are incentivized to use the hashtag and
of course old be after the talk I'll be

18
00:01:34,329 --> 00:01:38,119
following up and see all the terrible
things are guys said about us and how

19
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:42,180
this talk is terrible and all those
different things by the way I looked it

20
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:47,549
up on Urban Dictionary DDT I doesn't
mean anything so it's completely safe

21
00:01:47,549 --> 00:01:53,790
for work for you guys to tweet the
hashtag CDTI so without further ado I'm

22
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:58,280
I'll explain so I'm the chief data
sciences of needle right and I've been

23
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:02,530
doing a lot of research that's some of
its a similar to do some of its a bit

24
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:08,020
more machine learning ish under the MOC
project and this is my colleague Alex

25
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,500
Sierra

26
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:17,110
so just a quick intro and what products
are so it was like project is a group of

27
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:21,320
like-minded individuals that are
discussing how to properly apply machine

28
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,680
learning information security we have a
few open source projects some of which

29
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:30,870
have powered all the data analysis that
will be showing today so please make

30
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,400
sure to check it out and needle is the
commercial entity that was born out of

31
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:42,060
our research on machine learning to
threat intelligence data and information

32
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:45,770
security a large so if you are
interested in that

33
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:51,520
feel free to look it up later and get in
touch the agenda will start talking

34
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:54,840
about a little bit and introduction
about what threatened tell is and what

35
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,739
is it good for what can you do with it

36
00:02:56,739 --> 00:03:00,700
why is it worth measuring at all we'll
talk about the open source projects

37
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,820
combine inch EQ test the power the
analysis will be doing today

38
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:10,380
measuring the indicators using Taq test
and something that's no this isn't a

39
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:13,820
person who has been involving we'll be
talking about sharing communities and

40
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:18,840
some measurements that we did on top of
that and then future research and

41
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,590
because we're doing a presentation of
all the metrics I decided to do some

42
00:03:21,590 --> 00:03:25,310
presentation metrics you guys so make
sure you guys are keeping track and also

43
00:03:25,310 --> 00:03:29,120
keeping me honest very important that
you guys take something out of this so

44
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,640
we have 50 ish slides of course I wasn't
bothered to count them all you know how

45
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:37,790
these people are it's it's there's a
there's a margin of error of their right

46
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:41,739
but I can tell you there are three T
three key takeaways in this presentation

47
00:03:41,739 --> 00:03:46,000
I will specifically point them out to
you throughout right and these are

48
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,180
really the things that I believe you
should be getting out of what we're

49
00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:50,440
talking about

50
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:55,590
there will be two times where I will
vary uncorrected derisively Defense

51
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:59,250
Intelligence vendors so I want to make
sure you guys pay attention for that but

52
00:03:59,250 --> 00:04:02,989
they did really in some cases they need
to be defended because it's really not

53
00:04:02,989 --> 00:04:07,070
careful right and also have one
prediction on what the future of threat

54
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:13,060
intelligence sherry really is right so
then six months from now when someone

55
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:18,410
some new Flynn start-up Tuesday Apr net
right and they beat the boss writers for

56
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:21,959
the CEO to put it there you just just
remembered attributed part of their

57
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:29,650
first so anyway so what is intelligence
good for sofa looking at the press and

58
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:33,950
what people are talking about lot is
attribution and attribution is awesome

59
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:39,450
if you do get it right by the cautionary
tale there so if you are making a very

60
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:43,900
structured high-level decision making on
your information security programs and

61
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:46,940
you can take advantage of the fact that
you know what the TTP looked like over

62
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:52,250
the threat actors are then by all means
do go after the higher-level threat

63
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:57,169
intelligence data that will contain that
information since attribution is so hard

64
00:04:57,169 --> 00:05:02,109
it will be expensive both the amount of
effort of the very valuable people that

65
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:06,770
do that work and also for you to get you
there those people or to buy the service

66
00:05:06,770 --> 00:05:11,909
so make sure you will actually use it
but for the rest of you that don't have

67
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:16,040
the budget for it and you don't want to
feel left out you know after Dasani

68
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:21,289
debacle a few of the people we now
decided to help you out

69
00:05:21,289 --> 00:05:25,990
you're not left out of the conversation
because everyone had the that there pat

70
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:31,320
you worry about who did the sunny how to
attribute that so there's Dasani

71
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,840
attributed to a website that will go
into the various and the BIR database

72
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:42,520
will randomly pick on a statistical
representative way throughout actors

73
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:47,810
methods indicators and will generate a
completely new totally random but

74
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:52,639
represent a new report on how to
attribute the tribute the sony has so

75
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:55,780
now when you go to Barton information
security people you have something to

76
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:02,969
talk about her own version on how to
achieve the Sony hack and also

77
00:06:02,969 --> 00:06:07,709
you know how will upper management know
that you guys are really awesome and

78
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:11,729
ready to handle all those pandas and
bears if you don't have an attack map

79
00:06:11,729 --> 00:06:16,889
right it's okay for the have-nots for
the people that still don't have those

80
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:22,919
cool maps there's also an open source
project called pew pew that will allow

81
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:26,808
you to again using random data don't
even have to set up a lil intellectual

82
00:06:26,809 --> 00:06:32,559
funny but it will just get random data
from from the various online database

83
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:37,319
and generate random attacks and you can
choose whatever you want for the attack

84
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:41,779
means I just wanted to point out most of
you here in the room probably knows this

85
00:06:41,779 --> 00:06:46,869
map as a threat but map right but it was
actually an open source project maybe

86
00:06:46,869 --> 00:06:52,639
three months before that but they belong
so I mean it's funny because even that

87
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,599
they got right in their characterization
be stolen open source project he thought

88
00:06:56,599 --> 00:07:02,579
it was theirs right there are real real
credit expanded its amazing and the best

89
00:07:02,579 --> 00:07:09,220
part

90
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:20,320
so I mean so there's your budget coming
your way but now seriously what about

91
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:25,260
using threat intelligence data to
actually defend your environments right

92
00:07:25,260 --> 00:07:29,810
that should be something at least at
least somewhere on your list right so

93
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:33,760
yeah if you do have some statistical
planning that you can use a higher level

94
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:39,340
of intelligence data for go for it but
what can we do the technical indicators

95
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:45,229
so supposedly would could use all those
domain names IP addresses URLs hashes

96
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:49,870
and what not to help us doing the Farr
and information security monitoring to

97
00:07:49,870 --> 00:07:56,620
detect incidents but how do we go about
doing that and there's a problem that

98
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:02,120
people overlook so we see a lot of talk
about the base rate policy but we don't

99
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,540
see not talk about the affirming the
consequent fallacy the problem is when

100
00:08:06,540 --> 00:08:12,210
you look at an IOC it's telling you what
how does the mower behave it's not

101
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:16,789
telling you that the mower is the only
thing that behaves that way right so if

102
00:08:16,790 --> 00:08:21,550
you see a valid I'll see saying this
malware uses the Google Docs or Dropbox

103
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:26,390
or whatever API and you stopped alerting
or blocking everything the top to toe

104
00:08:26,390 --> 00:08:31,280
CBI's economy in the world apart right
and so I don't know if you've ever seen

105
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:36,199
8888 and up and up on a feed somewhere
but it's rather common so we're gonna be

106
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:39,839
flooded with false positives I think
that the the important lesson here is

107
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:45,410
there are interesting and smart ways to
use the technical indicators but they're

108
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:49,900
not signatures and they're not usable
directly as blacklists you have to know

109
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:52,720
what you're doing and this is actually
some of the very interesting work we

110
00:08:52,720 --> 00:09:01,480
have been doing with a research but how
can you know how good those indicators

111
00:09:01,480 --> 00:09:08,520
are as we all know garbage in garbage
out so as a buyer for gonna buy a feeder

112
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:12,819
gonna buy indicators to try to use them
in your very much or threat intelligence

113
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:18,660
program how can you tell which ones are
good or not how can you measured in how

114
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:19,649
can you compare them

115
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:24,209
there might be even value using some of
the open the public once and that's why

116
00:09:24,209 --> 00:09:28,899
we say the stock has data driven we're
about to help you understand how can you

117
00:09:28,899 --> 00:09:33,610
measure those feeds and and and know
which ones might bring more value to you

118
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:38,240
so anyway let's get something going here
because I guess that's pretty much why

119
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,379
you came here that they can't guess I'm
not sure never sure so there are two

120
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:46,839
open source projects that we have on the
team all-sec project right I'm not going

121
00:09:46,839 --> 00:09:52,029
to a lot of detail on combined but
pretty much combine allows you to parse

122
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:55,269
multiple sources of threat intelligence
open threat intelligence the internet

123
00:09:55,269 --> 00:09:59,569
you just is reasonable all its busy
malls in a CSV orgies and format

124
00:09:59,569 --> 00:10:03,490
something that's very easy to use right
and you can manipulate in all the

125
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:04,769
different ways

126
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:09,019
someday I'm gonna be able to finish my
enterprise development course or

127
00:10:09,019 --> 00:10:12,980
something I'll be able to implement
sticks and suboxone it as well and i

128
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:17,069
dont baby that's required them to become
basic essential job or something

129
00:10:17,069 --> 00:10:23,929
enterprise-grade yeah it is it is of
course and and I just wanna meet in the

130
00:10:23,929 --> 00:10:27,579
we're really going to be talking about
you test so did you test will be taking

131
00:10:27,579 --> 00:10:33,420
the sparse data right that we gathered
from multiple different open fields

132
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:39,540
right and using it to create statistical
visualisations and some even more

133
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:44,839
interesting statistical inferences thats
that can give you a better sense of how

134
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:51,050
you can compare it against a not right
so we have the code ride so the coldest

135
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:55,410
air up there and get up so everything
we're doing here you guys can totally do

136
00:10:55,410 --> 00:10:58,719
at home with stuff you have in your
kitchen you know these things girls

137
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,749
right and also I mean it's kind of
pointless for us to be talking about a

138
00:11:02,749 --> 00:11:07,519
dieta driven talk we don't actually
giving you did so we have a lot of data

139
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:14,199
right so we have we actually published
on this repository a year worth of

140
00:11:14,199 --> 00:11:20,240
threat intelligence data so every single
day since days this

141
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:26,980
June 1st 2014 we went to all these feeds
we gathered and we see them in a way to

142
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:30,959
take you test understands and you get a
snapshot for each day for each one of

143
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:36,819
these things right I did some very like
bit back of the napkin calculations we

144
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:40,230
have like me be 500 K

145
00:11:40,230 --> 00:11:44,779
indicators per day so that's roughly a
hundred and sixty-five million

146
00:11:44,779 --> 00:11:48,500
indicators that you guys have to play
with you guess keeping open your own

147
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:54,310
threat intelligence company with that
I'm pretty sure so anyway guys everybody

148
00:11:54,310 --> 00:11:58,689
gets in the Gators I think that's that's
really all that you want because we all

149
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:02,730
know that the more indicators we have
we're probably going to be sure gonna be

150
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:07,680
safer right so this is one of the things
that's going to try to to figure out so

151
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:14,209
this is a sampling of the feeds right so
as you can tell I'm sneaking in cold

152
00:12:14,209 --> 00:12:17,369
there and there's actually

153
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:22,990
on our notebook on our mark don't file
which is equivalent to an iPod notebook

154
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:29,060
where I'm calling lol yeah I actually
lost of that completely check your test

155
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:34,439
is is built in our right which is a
statistical language so if you guys are

156
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:37,000
actually working with threat
intelligence with the Saudi move data

157
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,660
you guys are data scientist nobody has
told you yet so just call your bosses

158
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:46,279
and get a raise right now so I just want
you guys to make sure that I mean it's a

159
00:12:46,279 --> 00:12:49,290
great opportunity for you to get your
feet wet with us the disco language as

160
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:53,270
well right it makes a lot of the stuff
that I'm doing here

161
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:56,579
much easier so you guys should should
probably take a look

162
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:59,680
you shouldn't have to bother too much
with it if you just want to use the the

163
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,989
package so these are the feeds ride if
you go to the open source the

164
00:13:04,990 --> 00:13:08,640
open-source fathers a weekend air it
says which one of these downloads it

165
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:14,620
were and things like that so I mentioned
using two fields which are they are open

166
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:18,310
but they are reserved and in the sense
that not maybe not everyone has access

167
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:24,250
to them its caffeine speed and John
Brennan back seat but they're both in a

168
00:13:24,250 --> 00:13:30,190
way public right so we got on this day
there so before we get started on the

169
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:37,480
actual deaths right we are this is what
they look like we have an IP address or

170
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:41,240
domain name and what's being tied to
what's the source of it and we did it

171
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:46,310
was collected right and so we're calling
this are raw data set which is we just

172
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:51,349
got this from there and it it's is right
and we have what we're calling on

173
00:13:51,350 --> 00:13:55,720
Gingrich the asset we're doing some sort
of tinkering with it because we wanted

174
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:00,839
to normalize everything to IP addresses
so first of all we are on that specific

175
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:08,279
date that's thing happened we do a DNS
query and we gather what would you be

176
00:14:08,279 --> 00:14:11,439
addressed at the resort to that IP right
we're using

177
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:17,330
for sites set for that right there very
kind to let us use this on our research

178
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:22,910
and we're also I mean just because why
not we read the stuff from maximum

179
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:26,230
aggressive riding the ESN we're ready

180
00:14:26,230 --> 00:14:32,900
country and immortals because yeah why
not but we're gonna play with a few of

181
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:37,000
these data data points and at the end
this is pretty much what it looks like

182
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:43,560
right so you can see it if their IP
address it came from a domain name

183
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,699
you'll see it on the host item there
right

184
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:50,990
so these are the raw data sets that this
is how the data is presented their right

185
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:57,290
and we're doing some experiments and
tests with this the first one is the

186
00:14:57,290 --> 00:15:01,890
novelty test right which is something
that everybody should be concerned with

187
00:15:01,890 --> 00:15:07,240
when they are ingesting some sort of
intelligence this pretty much means

188
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:16,150
day-by-day right how many new ride and
how many disappear I mean allegedly

189
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:19,400
cleaned out hopefully it was not like
they have big boobies pressure something

190
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:23,720
about the guy they are actually looking
at it oh maybe this is not malicious

191
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:29,720
anymore maybe I should check it out my
feet right and as you can see it becomes

192
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:34,400
very visual for you to understand what's
the frequency and how those feeds are

193
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:40,220
are behaving so when you look at this
example here right we have on the upper

194
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:43,940
left corner we have eight at the end of
the right and you see it's a very

195
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:50,320
healthy 5% each day that gets bad or
removed right there's a little bit of

196
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:55,370
curation there and not a lot right I
haven't really looked at UTX stuff that

197
00:15:55,370 --> 00:15:58,720
they're doing but I assume there's more
there is there's some interesting stuff

198
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:06,980
there as well right and but for instance
one thing that should be a very very red

199
00:16:06,980 --> 00:16:11,600
flag for you guys something like in the
law were in the lower left which is

200
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,120
stuff is being added right and this is
like six months that I plotted their

201
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:21,940
everyday you get a little bit more added
right and according to my calculations

202
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:24,769
here by 2050 you probably blocked

203
00:16:24,769 --> 00:16:28,529
all ipv4 address space so you might just
well brought them now because that's

204
00:16:28,529 --> 00:16:33,589
where that's going to get to if you
really trust but that's definitely a red

205
00:16:33,589 --> 00:16:38,230
flag right and its people are generating
if the feed for you you you're not

206
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:42,639
giving you daytime information as in
this is what is an occasion was first

207
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:46,660
seen Alessi and you cannot make a
decision on that if your gonna eat

208
00:16:46,660 --> 00:16:50,999
something or not they're just giving you
a dump of Vita right

209
00:16:50,999 --> 00:16:53,730
the fact that they're not doing the work
for you is something that's very

210
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:57,230
concerning it's something that you
should always be a good listener Baldwin

211
00:16:57,230 --> 00:17:01,299
who you are working thats I don't think
that's the case in any

212
00:17:01,299 --> 00:17:05,629
beat feat but it's important for you to
know the shape of the data how it would

213
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:11,860
potentially look like right and anyway
this is just an idea you can see it very

214
00:17:11,859 --> 00:17:15,918
differently from food to feed but a
healthy feed will be able to change

215
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:22,370
itself renew itself from time to time in
20 of course keep up with what ever

216
00:17:22,369 --> 00:17:29,989
changing at landscape or in such a buzz
word here right there's nobody test as a

217
00:17:29,990 --> 00:17:34,770
friend which is the aging test which is
actually looking at this specific

218
00:17:34,770 --> 00:17:39,399
analysis on the flip side so instead of
trying to measure how many things get in

219
00:17:39,399 --> 00:17:44,270
and get out so let's try to track the
life of one indicator so given an

220
00:17:44,270 --> 00:17:49,000
indicator there how long this how long
does it usually live how long does it

221
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:53,970
stay on her feet as it did in case just
sit there forever or something like that

222
00:17:53,970 --> 00:17:59,809
so you get grass like so this is all
that the outbound data that we had to

223
00:17:59,809 --> 00:18:05,020
play with and and display much

224
00:18:05,020 --> 00:18:09,480
things that are serving our or CNC

225
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:13,610
IP addresses right and you can see the
some of these seeds they don't go very

226
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:17,800
far is that they died after two or three
weeks you almost recycle everything

227
00:18:17,800 --> 00:18:22,379
right that's mike that's usually when
most of these IP addresses are most of

228
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:26,330
these indicators they disappear right
and they get removed right you

229
00:18:26,330 --> 00:18:30,949
definitely want to be aware of how long
is an indicator sitting on the feed

230
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:37,180
right on your body when you you're
ingesting to try to make a decision if

231
00:18:37,180 --> 00:18:42,790
whatever aging work that they're doing
is is good for you and it's helping you

232
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:48,830
all right so this gets really fun when
you go to inbound data because

233
00:18:48,830 --> 00:18:53,879
especially when I talk about inbound
data i'm talking about these guys who

234
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:59,750
are I don't know a brute forcing your
sis agent trying admin admin and things

235
00:18:59,750 --> 00:19:03,530
like that because these guys are just
too big too was everywhere and a lot of

236
00:19:03,530 --> 00:19:09,350
D seats they're actually just low
interaction honey pots they're just

237
00:19:09,350 --> 00:19:13,860
listening for this message board
somewhere so every time someone hits

238
00:19:13,860 --> 00:19:19,360
that thought that IP address it will
capture that AP and it will send a tie

239
00:19:19,360 --> 00:19:25,040
between list so you see that it just
turns way too much every day you have a

240
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:28,770
completely different list of IP
addresses they're showing up to you I

241
00:19:28,770 --> 00:19:32,920
mean I really question the validity of
this kind of feed of this kind of

242
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:37,240
information right there's a lot of
people who pays a lot of the threat

243
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:40,980
intelligence in the direction of many
parts and like old these people are

244
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:47,640
there shooting at you and I mean there
are probably use for it in in the lot of

245
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:51,730
different environment especially for
doing if you using that as a basis for a

246
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:55,430
more complex calculation of the
likelihood of an IP address trying to

247
00:19:55,430 --> 00:20:01,180
defraud your side or something but again
you gotta know what you're getting right

248
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:05,980
you gotta if you if you have access to
the data and you need this kind of data

249
00:20:05,980 --> 00:20:07,710
for the kind of work that you're doing

250
00:20:07,710 --> 00:20:12,410
using tools like this now you can
actually check and see if the shape of

251
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:17,080
the data today they are providing you is
actually in accordance to what

252
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:21,230
hypothesis you have on what you needed
it to look like for your stuff to work

253
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:27,690
right so again there is no right or
wrong answer here i just i just think

254
00:20:27,690 --> 00:20:33,370
it's pointless but doesn't mean you have
to agree with me so this is an

255
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:37,750
interesting one and and we have five
tests and this is the odd one out which

256
00:20:37,750 --> 00:20:43,320
we call the population test which is is
a funny it's a funny play that we do to

257
00:20:43,320 --> 00:20:49,590
try to answer one of those people are
always asking the question of 0 to

258
00:20:49,590 --> 00:20:53,909
destress intelligence matter to me right
to a to a specific measures of matter

259
00:20:53,910 --> 00:20:59,820
right and this in a way tries to play
with that concept as in trying to figure

260
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:05,110
out if whatever the whatever data you
getting under threat intelligence feed

261
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:10,409
how does it relate or how the hell does
that look similar to different groups of

262
00:21:10,410 --> 00:21:14,880
data that you have so if you compare
them are all of these coming from the

263
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:20,190
same ASN right is everything bad coming
from China or something like that I mean

264
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:23,480
maybe you want to test this hypothesis
out maybe you want to understand if you

265
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,390
should push to your board that every
single communication from China should

266
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:32,880
be blocked right so you get some funny
things like this so when you look at the

267
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:37,380
and this is all of courses or other
countries but when you look at the

268
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:40,100
bottom tier there

269
00:21:40,100 --> 00:21:45,399
the lower graph it's this is actually
the real population of IP addresses I

270
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:49,660
mean as real as you believe that Max
minds

271
00:21:49,660 --> 00:21:54,520
domains Gio Goi be things correct like
we're gonna assume it's correct because

272
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,260
we're doing a lot of operations based on
it right so we're talking about

273
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:03,460
forty-four percent of all the IP address
is being mapped to the USA and maybe

274
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:08,300
nine percent of this to China it's funny
because when you look at your the

275
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:14,730
outbound data right it more than 50% of
the aggregated information from all the

276
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:19,850
open threat until things that we used
the extra point that 50% of these IP

277
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:25,610
addresses are in the us- and only six
percent are in China what that means is

278
00:22:25,610 --> 00:22:30,260
if you're connecting to an IP address in
dus it's actually more likely for that

279
00:22:30,260 --> 00:22:34,500
IP address to be infected did you were
connecting to an IP address in China

280
00:22:34,500 --> 00:22:40,670
because the distribution of all the IP
addresses in the world right if you're

281
00:22:40,670 --> 00:22:45,860
just connecting wrangling randomly to
then to them you would be bringing the

282
00:22:45,860 --> 00:22:50,959
the chance UDP and IP address in the USA
or China and then if its militias are

283
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:56,730
not so it it lets you play some it lets
you play some some interesting games to

284
00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:02,100
try to see if you really you're in a way
your concerns about especially when

285
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,990
you're talking about this low level
indicators like a good rest of course we

286
00:23:04,990 --> 00:23:10,860
do not condone any sort of GOP base
their tribution it starts to get

287
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:13,919
interesting to see and to compare
different datasets and see if you're

288
00:23:13,920 --> 00:23:17,980
getting like-for-like and if the data
sets are different from each other right

289
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:23,389
and it's really about sampling right
it's really about different

290
00:23:23,389 --> 00:23:28,529
different threat until feeds different
providers they will have different

291
00:23:28,529 --> 00:23:31,639
techniques they will have different ways
together this data so they will be

292
00:23:31,639 --> 00:23:37,299
simply badness from different places
right and so you can definitely look at

293
00:23:37,299 --> 00:23:41,099
those different fields and try to figure
out if there's askew on their method oh

294
00:23:41,099 --> 00:23:45,218
these guys much more likely to give me
permission about cybercrime this guy's

295
00:23:45,219 --> 00:23:50,539
much more likely to give me information
about General espionage right and

296
00:23:50,539 --> 00:23:55,639
sometimes they will say they'll tell you
one thing and they could not be doing

297
00:23:55,639 --> 00:23:59,269
that with the data right and this is an
interesting way for you to aggregated

298
00:23:59,269 --> 00:24:04,639
data and to look at it and to try to
make these decisions yourself right so

299
00:24:04,639 --> 00:24:10,309
we actually have a statistical inference
implementation of that you can actually

300
00:24:10,309 --> 00:24:14,940
do right I'm not going to get into this
I'm not going to go into any detail but

301
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:20,749
you can pretty much see if things are
more likely to be militias on a specific

302
00:24:20,749 --> 00:24:23,700
country or NESN or something like that

303
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:28,700
less likely or you just don't care it's
just like the same it's it's always

304
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:34,019
Germany I don't know they're doing their
work very well whatever they're doing so

305
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:40,959
anyway this is this is just an
interesting to play with so your lab

306
00:24:40,959 --> 00:24:44,599
tests is one of the most interesting as
we get we got because we can actually

307
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:48,869
tell if those fees they have the same
data or not right so if you look at the

308
00:24:48,869 --> 00:24:53,418
data it seems every single person I mean
a lot of these people are using the same

309
00:24:53,419 --> 00:24:57,209
honey parts together this data and to
all those different things like you see

310
00:24:57,209 --> 00:25:01,719
there's a lot of overlap there's a lot
of different things going on there right

311
00:25:01,719 --> 00:25:06,999
and I mean it just really tells that
some people have turned on their machine

312
00:25:06,999 --> 00:25:10,709
to scan the whole internet so they will
hit everyone's honey pot or people show

313
00:25:10,709 --> 00:25:15,469
me honey pots so again I don't really
think there's a lot of inside the rest

314
00:25:15,469 --> 00:25:19,249
from this right but the one that really
got me the one that that makes me really

315
00:25:19,249 --> 00:25:24,369
interested in is really deal because
when you look at all those different

316
00:25:24,369 --> 00:25:30,988
seats right and if I were to add some
private speech there actually be four

317
00:25:30,989 --> 00:25:35,580
you would see that they don't seem to
overlap that much right it seems like

318
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:40,300
everyone is identifying different pieces
of my or even if they're tracking the

319
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:43,840
same actors are all pointing at
different IP addresses different domains

320
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:49,629
different sources right and this really
got me thinking it is this really sold

321
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:55,260
by vs did distributed by people just
making IP addresses up I mean I really

322
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:59,480
searching the same things right and I
decided to look at the idea of a

323
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:06,010
uniqueness test right which is i mean
how you need is a piece of data I mean

324
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:13,900
what percentage do do do they have 10
feeds how much of my day don't show up

325
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:17,140
on one thing and how much am I did it
only showed two feet and the motivation

326
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:22,040
behind this is pretty much the whole you
measure how many fish there are in the

327
00:26:22,040 --> 00:26:28,399
lake right so if you have one of the
easiest way to do that you just gettin

328
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:33,300
ads and you get like a hundred fishes
out of the lake and you tackle the

329
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:37,830
efficacy and then you just throw them
back and give them some time to

330
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:40,169
recuperate from the trauma or anything
like that

331
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:43,950
will soon around the lake will be
married you know they're they're fishy

332
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:48,950
things and then you go back there and
you just do it again you'll get hundreds

333
00:26:48,950 --> 00:26:55,170
fish out of the art of the lake right
and assuming you did it randomly right

334
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:58,350
especially if you go to different parts
of the lake and don't get two hundred

335
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:03,719
official same place them on a fish that
you actually get from both of these

336
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:08,520
trials right to 10 actually tag will
give you a general idea of how many

337
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:13,420
people you actually have covered so if
you only got five percent of the fish so

338
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:17,330
we're talking about a hundred issue if
you only got 25 fish that were tagged

339
00:27:17,330 --> 00:27:22,290
your population it's probably in the
vicinity of twenty times a hundred fish

340
00:27:22,290 --> 00:27:27,450
right so kind of the amount of the
amount of drugs that we have of course

341
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:28,510
you do this

342
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:31,780
a hundred thousand times I dunno how
mean you guys to the statistics and you

343
00:27:31,780 --> 00:27:37,740
to find what the standard deviation as a
no confidence level blah blah blah but

344
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:43,610
you you catch my breath right and
there's actually studies about this and

345
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:46,649
and the City CD did a study

346
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:52,510
late last year about how much uniqueness
is what I thought it was when I looked

347
00:27:52,510 --> 00:27:56,790
at those numbers of these guys are crazy
they clearly did something wrong it's

348
00:27:56,790 --> 00:28:01,590
impossible that if the end they claim to
have been looking at seventy five

349
00:28:01,590 --> 00:28:05,220
different feet or something like that
and they had this amazing uniqueness

350
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:09,550
people are not reporting on the same
things we be there even finding the same

351
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:11,370
things are just reporting part of it

352
00:28:11,370 --> 00:28:16,449
nobody knows right it's all very opaque
and I was like no no this is wrong I'm

353
00:28:16,450 --> 00:28:20,450
gonna write a uniqueness test and I'm
gonna prove that these guys are wrong

354
00:28:20,450 --> 00:28:24,530
I'm gonna come here in black on black
hat and I'm gonna tell everyone how I

355
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:32,360
disputes RCC know they were absolutely
right so when I use my data right and

356
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:37,709
again there's a six months worth of data
it's staggering amount the amount of you

357
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:45,300
right and and it doesn't look good just
think about the fish analogy it means

358
00:28:45,300 --> 00:28:53,270
that if we're all joined from the same
phone of evil cyber fish rights we're

359
00:28:53,270 --> 00:28:59,820
not catching fish right so what chance
do we have a tall of trying to map in a

360
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:05,710
way what is good and what is bad in in
either indicators right near in things

361
00:29:05,710 --> 00:29:09,530
that you would be able to represent very
discreetly like that so this was

362
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:14,610
actually the point that we did on the
DBR

363
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:20,428
in April right so we were invited by
Verizon to actually write part of the

364
00:29:20,429 --> 00:29:25,520
threat intelligence blurb because we had
been deemed a world where we had been

365
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:31,049
doing this research for almost nine
months of the time right and pretty much

366
00:29:31,049 --> 00:29:37,889
the completion here was that given the
situation the idea that you would be

367
00:29:37,890 --> 00:29:43,910
secure just hoarding all the indicators
right it's completely it's a lot it's

368
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:48,059
it's never gonna work that's not a
winning strategy right you're not gonna

369
00:29:48,059 --> 00:29:52,910
be your not gonna be winning you're not
gonna be able to create any semblance of

370
00:29:52,910 --> 00:29:59,000
reasonable threat intelligence program
just by thinking about 00 get Cody 2013

371
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,200
qu 33 feed

372
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:06,600
200,000 seeds and somehow I'll make them
run myself or my father oh I have no

373
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:13,840
idea which it's a big data file but away
and how how does would run and it's it's

374
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:18,610
it's it's it's an unwinnable right and
use our key takeaway number one right

375
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:22,270
the more than those achieved you have
does not mean that you have a better

376
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:23,910
program right

377
00:30:23,910 --> 00:30:28,760
the point of the program right people
say a threat intelligence program the

378
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:32,390
point here is that you're trying to
learn from whatever information they

379
00:30:32,390 --> 00:30:35,890
just don't have to feed you just don't
have the indicators have the contextual

380
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:42,710
information about oh this was this guy
is one step guy right and this is how

381
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:50,350
they behave right this is the kind of
tools that they use this is anyway this

382
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:54,520
is more or less the way to the register
who is or has been have been doing that

383
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:59,270
in the past it did you learn from this
example your analysts learn from these

384
00:30:59,270 --> 00:31:05,460
examples right and now if they're faced
with an incident or any event insider

385
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:09,570
networked they can make an informed
decision that you know what I have

386
00:31:09,570 --> 00:31:15,928
actually seen this before this looks a
lot like whatever now any mobile right

387
00:31:15,929 --> 00:31:17,549
and

388
00:31:17,549 --> 00:31:18,790
and

389
00:31:18,790 --> 00:31:24,430
I know how to handle these guys I know
how to figure out how to maybe best

390
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:29,490
defense against is so I mean it's really
important we we take a break here right

391
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:34,030
and what I'm seeing here is not that you
shouldn't get through intelligence feet

392
00:31:34,030 --> 00:31:41,170
but what i'm saying that is it's not the
winning move east to learn from them

393
00:31:41,170 --> 00:31:45,570
it's not from blindly using them the
work that these people that do the

394
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,260
research what I mean

395
00:31:47,260 --> 00:31:50,540
calmly told about the threat
intelligence providers the guys who are

396
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:53,860
actually there in the trenches they're
crawling through air ducts to get the

397
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:58,699
insult to you whatever they do write
these guys are providing a ferry usually

398
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:04,390
providing a very good service right and
it's just like a largely unused by the

399
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:10,080
population might get back to that point
I mean if we weren't doing this is it

400
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:14,330
that they weren't doing this I mean how
would we be know about all about sliding

401
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:23,520
panda right which is the new our new
friend actor I love slight intended to

402
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:28,900
keep the second key takeaway from this
talk right is that you guys should all

403
00:32:28,900 --> 00:32:33,880
of the Ekiti so deejay cutie is not a
threat after as far as I know but he

404
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:41,300
drops some easy beats right so I think
it's I think it's this is an important

405
00:32:41,300 --> 00:32:44,290
takeaway it's probably the one that
people remember the most from this talk

406
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:51,280
to one thing remember just kidding I
think another just quickly talking about

407
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:55,000
the uniqueness test if you see all of
those very competent salt of the earth

408
00:32:55,000 --> 00:32:59,630
people they're doing the threat that the
the basic research and finding reversing

409
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:03,320
the mall refining thread actors and if
you see that even with all those

410
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:08,090
companies doing all that work and we're
still finding very few indicators in

411
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:11,309
common that would also give us

412
00:33:11,309 --> 00:33:18,559
indication of the size of the total
universe of findable things which seems

413
00:33:18,559 --> 00:33:25,408
is pretty huge so sorry to be the bearer
of bad news but wait there's problems

414
00:33:25,409 --> 00:33:30,019
are solved right now there's threat
intelligence sharing so shouldn't threat

415
00:33:30,019 --> 00:33:34,419
intelligence sharing help us solve those
problems so threat intelligence sharing

416
00:33:34,419 --> 00:33:39,679
is a good thing you know my mom always
told me to share to be a nice kid and so

417
00:33:39,679 --> 00:33:44,990
it's it's only polite that you share if
you have good data but can we measured

418
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:50,639
can we find out how good it is but first
some people have been talking about the

419
00:33:50,639 --> 00:33:55,559
storm herd immunity and I'm not an
epidemiologist but I play one on black

420
00:33:55,559 --> 00:34:02,080
hat and so would like to talk a little
bit about herd immunity under the going

421
00:34:02,080 --> 00:34:07,918
to college concept is since diseases
have to spread between people that are

422
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:12,668
physically close to each other if you
have a large popular large population of

423
00:34:12,668 --> 00:34:17,009
course you only need to find a large
city you're only going to get into

424
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:20,780
physical contact with a very small
subset of the entire population so

425
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:27,740
there's a point where even if you are
not vaccinated yourself but it most

426
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:33,408
people in the population are vaccinated
immunize somehow against some sort of

427
00:34:33,409 --> 00:34:34,220
disease

428
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:41,918
deep on that she will bump into someone
that is infected lowers dramatically so

429
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:45,918
even though you're not immunized
yourself you are still benefiting from

430
00:34:45,918 --> 00:34:51,629
the fact that a lot of people are right
and that translates beautifully to

431
00:34:51,629 --> 00:34:56,199
threat intelligence ride because no one
has 425 TCP listening to email from

432
00:34:56,199 --> 00:35:01,200
everywhere in the world you don't have
any services at all it's very restricted

433
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:09,180
it makes no sense to think that because
you are on a vertical and your bank a

434
00:35:09,180 --> 00:35:15,609
and now because you shared an indicator
was banks BCG and that bank F

435
00:35:15,609 --> 00:35:19,319
even though he does not have any
signatures or any protective controls

436
00:35:19,319 --> 00:35:21,390
this my work

437
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:25,589
it will be magically protected from that
because if you believe the threat

438
00:35:25,589 --> 00:35:29,920
intelligence sharing brings herd
immunity is what your thinking is what

439
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:35,309
you're implying and I think that's just
ludicrous right everyone is connected to

440
00:35:35,309 --> 00:35:38,829
everyone on the internet the basic
premise that you have to be physically

441
00:35:38,829 --> 00:35:46,579
close to someone just does not apply
anyway sorry for the rant I got to get

442
00:35:46,579 --> 00:35:50,779
really angry at screamin my computer
when I see some marketing materials you

443
00:35:50,779 --> 00:35:57,809
know that's just me so let's talk about
sharing how much sharing is going on is

444
00:35:57,809 --> 00:36:02,910
everyone sharing or people just leaching
so what can we learn from actual data

445
00:36:02,910 --> 00:36:08,288
that tells us how sharing is being done
because yeah there is something the same

446
00:36:08,289 --> 00:36:12,670
way that there is value on any threat
intelligence feet there is value in

447
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:16,720
getting doing to cater to my not beyond
anyone's feet because you have a trusted

448
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:20,578
company that did the research themselves
and someone that was attacking them and

449
00:36:20,579 --> 00:36:25,829
shared with you but how good is that is
in order to do that again where did a

450
00:36:25,829 --> 00:36:31,720
driven presentation here we reached out
to a few sharing communities and a lot

451
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:32,490
of him

452
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:38,450
responded and gave us anonymized data
that allows us to do research without

453
00:36:38,450 --> 00:36:42,529
letting us know anything about the
actual content or who was involved in

454
00:36:42,529 --> 00:36:47,109
the sharing to protect both the innocent
and the guilty and so we would

455
00:36:47,109 --> 00:36:50,869
particularly like to thank the people
nice people that Facebook thread

456
00:36:50,869 --> 00:36:55,619
exchange and threat connect for sharing
it with us and allowing us to name them

457
00:36:55,619 --> 00:37:00,980
in all the other people that share the
data but asked to remain anonymous

458
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:05,640
we love you too we just you know the the
love interest pls pls publicly

459
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:11,150
platonically perhaps so so anyway

460
00:37:11,150 --> 00:37:16,460
and this is this is very much a work in
progress right I do not have structured

461
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:20,670
tests as I have for the threat
intelligence idk yet I'm honestly just

462
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:26,180
getting my feet wet with this data and
i'm looking forward to continuing these

463
00:37:26,180 --> 00:37:33,089
kinds of of analysis and and with more
and more people right so one of the

464
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:38,210
things that I'm not doing which bothered
me a lot is that I don't think I'm able

465
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:42,250
to share these numbers we view the
actual numbers that I'm using behind us

466
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:48,080
presentation because although there were
few sharing communities they're

467
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:52,120
definitely not enough of them in the
sense that is a published today this

468
00:37:52,120 --> 00:37:57,779
data the smartest amongst you would be
able to children part would know who I'm

469
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:02,380
talking about when I say it's sharing
community are sharing community be right

470
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:06,840
so there's probably as we grow this data
set and we get more people to

471
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,850
participate

472
00:38:07,850 --> 00:38:12,990
right Republic gonna be able to share
some sort of anonymized hardcore

473
00:38:12,990 --> 00:38:19,520
hardened into these things right so
basically we're we're looking about to

474
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:23,480
actually three months of data right
we're trying to figure out what are the

475
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:27,600
number of indicators are shared by day
in the number of any case there are

476
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:33,790
shared by member and one of the things I
was very keen of getting

477
00:38:33,790 --> 00:38:38,340
and it's something that one of the ways
that will expand this research is how

478
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:42,560
many did not seek not so much how many
of them were added but how how many of

479
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:48,500
them were deleted or how many of them
wore added to the leader right because

480
00:38:48,500 --> 00:38:51,520
these are

481
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:56,500
indirect signs of some sort of quality
problem there if you had put an

482
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:01,020
indicator and and then he had to change
it somehow maybe you weren't so sure the

483
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:04,460
first time right so this is something
that's one of the things I'm not a lot

484
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:08,750
of people think about when they're doing
shown communities in fact almost all of

485
00:39:08,750 --> 00:39:15,400
them were unable to provide this data
from me from there from there from there

486
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:19,900
from the system's the ones that could
again there were way too little and I

487
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:23,080
couldn't really I can't represent the
state in any meaningful way without

488
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:28,569
giving them away so sweet so some
interesting things happen when you look

489
00:39:28,570 --> 00:39:33,460
at that so this is thinking about
sharing by day right and it's funny as

490
00:39:33,460 --> 00:39:38,220
hell because the largest community this
is the largest community I had right and

491
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:42,790
you look at the by day maybe the largest
something bad happened on that spike

492
00:39:42,790 --> 00:39:47,700
there but the largest amount of sharing
that had a specific day with 200

493
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:52,419
indicators right from IP addresses the
meaning to things like that but when you

494
00:39:52,420 --> 00:39:57,020
look at the smaller communities there's
a lot more going on you get to the

495
00:39:57,020 --> 00:40:03,570
thousand thousand fifteen hundreds right
and again this ties into our intuition

496
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:09,390
that well if I it's just like a lot of
people in this community ride and I

497
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:13,500
don't know them all right maybe i dont
wanna tell everything that I know right

498
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:19,940
and a lot of the intelligence community
has been doing sharing in some way or

499
00:40:19,940 --> 00:40:25,080
another in very closed circles and very
close to risk groups right and we're

500
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:29,250
seeing that even with all the technology
and all the way that we're making this

501
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:33,310
popular we're trying to make the smaller
and easier for people to do that that

502
00:40:33,310 --> 00:40:38,330
mentality is not changing right and also
don't think it will change a lot right

503
00:40:38,330 --> 00:40:42,970
which is very conflicting with the idea
that people are being pushed to share

504
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:48,680
more so I can't really worked out in my
head right now be be you guys skin how

505
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:52,100
do you get to school high school
cafeteria all over again

506
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:58,440
yes so but even when you look at the
volume right and it's not across the

507
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,640
board it's not like everyone is sharing
so

508
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:06,598
this is yet another example right this
is a smallish community they are in the

509
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:12,440
Haight ends right there's like eight
people during that period actually ten

510
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:19,390
percent of them actually shared
something and this is a log axis so the

511
00:41:19,390 --> 00:41:25,049
first guy had like a million seven
hundred indicators that they share right

512
00:41:25,049 --> 00:41:30,769
the second one was more on the twenty
thousand or something like that that's a

513
00:41:30,769 --> 00:41:37,209
log grass its reading this proportional
right there at the end and you see this

514
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:42,549
kind of things even in in in
environments where you don't have what

515
00:41:42,549 --> 00:41:48,700
we call a catalyst or oh this is the guy
who owns the threat intelligence sharing

516
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:52,750
community so he still feels kinda
responsible to add stuff there from time

517
00:41:52,750 --> 00:41:57,109
to time and to try to read those things
even in situations where you have like

518
00:41:57,109 --> 00:42:02,680
equal here so to speak right you see
things like this you see there's a maybe

519
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:08,680
a 10% to 15% of people directly sharing
and contributing back to the pot did

520
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:12,279
this not surprise me in shouldn't
surprise you either because that's just

521
00:42:12,279 --> 00:42:18,039
the way that social networks organize
themselves right so this is not a

522
00:42:18,039 --> 00:42:21,900
like-for-like this tweet to followers
not how many how many times people have

523
00:42:21,900 --> 00:42:26,210
to it which will clearly see that you
have something that looks like power

524
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:32,369
locks Power life so his right mind is
here from Kenneth security no I did not

525
00:42:32,369 --> 00:42:38,119
check if it's a power-law leave me alone
right but its power lawyers it's good

526
00:42:38,119 --> 00:42:39,809
enough right

527
00:42:39,809 --> 00:42:45,029
and another thing I want to discuss
which i think is is relevant is also

528
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:49,619
something that you guys accuse about is
does make a difference in this is really

529
00:42:49,619 --> 00:42:50,880
the overlap

530
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:56,869
think again but I'm heading to private
features to it right and I'm also adding

531
00:42:56,869 --> 00:43:00,559
showing community so I'm treating the
show community as a threat intelligence

532
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:06,119
Street right and you see that the
overlap properties the day they maintain

533
00:43:06,119 --> 00:43:12,519
themselves right in fact I could even
think of the sharing community as a kind

534
00:43:12,519 --> 00:43:13,580
of a threat intelligence

535
00:43:13,580 --> 00:43:20,220
I know the the cafeteria like that until
just before talking about right and you

536
00:43:20,220 --> 00:43:24,779
see the same thing in the unique minutes
so the point that gets me right would it

537
00:43:24,780 --> 00:43:31,500
be the same would they be equivalents in
this new world right of you can get a

538
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,840
feed from someone or you can get you can
be part of a threat intelligence

539
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:39,190
community I it's it's kind of the same
but it's a little bit different right

540
00:43:39,190 --> 00:43:45,550
like everything in life and the biggest
question I think that people ask

541
00:43:45,550 --> 00:43:50,920
themselves right and you should be
asking themselves is maturity right you

542
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:55,900
just pretending to be an adult I you
they're like oh I'm gonna do I'm gonna

543
00:43:55,900 --> 00:44:01,380
do some shearing and I know what I'm
doing and look I got 888 this case

544
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:05,410
clearly variable that may contribute
back to my community so that they can

545
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:10,440
all be safe from this evil doer right in
this becomes a very very large concern

546
00:44:10,440 --> 00:44:17,930
on this communities and anecdotally
again right people that actually depend

547
00:44:17,930 --> 00:44:22,520
on this character is they have a huge
concern as more and more people come in

548
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:27,910
to see two if they have amateurish
enough threat intelligence program that

549
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:31,649
they can meaningfully compared
contribute back so the question becomes

550
00:44:31,650 --> 00:44:36,400
when you enter into a sharing community
like that are you just are used to

551
00:44:36,400 --> 00:44:40,950
getting the best news you're like that
he had to read that feature knowing

552
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:44,060
everything was doing what did you just
sign up to the Red that the threat

553
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:47,940
intelligence you don't wanna go to the
radical threat intelligence rather the

554
00:44:47,940 --> 00:44:51,540
threat intelligence is just endless
ripples of the four shown a friend

555
00:44:51,540 --> 00:44:57,820
intelligence and that's when the dark
web by the way so I i so just a quick

556
00:44:57,820 --> 00:45:02,210
note I was looking for something that
would represent how awful read it was

557
00:45:02,210 --> 00:45:06,500
but I couldn't find any comment that
just didn't make me feel sick so I'm

558
00:45:06,500 --> 00:45:11,130
just publicizing search said a Jones
book which talks about how credit and

559
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:18,500
other events communities are they tend
to be very awful but I'm not saying I'm

560
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:22,830
not preaching fear about elitism right
and this was something that 451

561
00:45:22,830 --> 00:45:24,529
published recently about

562
00:45:24,530 --> 00:45:28,300
was read intelligence just for the one
percent right is this something that

563
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:32,350
only the highest tier people would be
able to meaningfully use and

564
00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:38,549
meaningfully work and I don't think we
should try to we should try to take this

565
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:42,910
people away right and we should be able
to provide them some help with questions

566
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:48,319
like this right that's how can sharing
and how can these things help me

567
00:45:48,320 --> 00:45:52,260
understand what maybe it's something
that's happening only to me or it's

568
00:45:52,260 --> 00:45:57,740
something that could be understood as a
commodity so the next take away that I

569
00:45:57,740 --> 00:45:59,959
want to do the things that the thing I
want you to close this presentation

570
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:04,960
where is that actually these people
should not be working together right but

571
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:09,610
maybe not publish content maybe not
everyone is mature enough to publish

572
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:14,350
content back to a threat intelligence
community but everyone has telemetry

573
00:46:14,350 --> 00:46:20,500
everyone knows who you're talking real
they should have at least 500 lost

574
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:24,760
somewhere right that tells them what
they're seeing what you're talking right

575
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:29,210
this over that we built in from the
start of the work that needs doing and

576
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:33,920
it's really one of the biggest secrets
on how we are able to make sense of the

577
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:38,210
threat intelligence data it's relevant
or not for specific customer of ours

578
00:46:38,210 --> 00:46:43,260
right my prediction which is the same as
the takeaway is that the threat

579
00:46:43,260 --> 00:46:47,830
intelligence communities will start to
fight either ways to get different sorts

580
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:54,360
of data which will be able to traction
evolve and change and use better

581
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:59,160
telemetry formation because you do not
have to do not need to have done the

582
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:03,200
whole analysis the need to be able to
figure out that there's a nation state

583
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:06,490
that actor for you to give me good
information

584
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:12,959
ride that you've actually seen this guy
before right so maybe now either more

585
00:47:12,960 --> 00:47:16,780
words or less worried right depending on
how many of these you've seen how many

586
00:47:16,780 --> 00:47:21,820
of these people UFC and anyway this is
this is pretty much I think when you

587
00:47:21,820 --> 00:47:25,560
talk about sharing these are the kinds
of things we put this should be talking

588
00:47:25,560 --> 00:47:29,540
about in order to make it the morning
clues of experience for everyone so I

589
00:47:29,540 --> 00:47:32,549
like to have a lot more takeaways but

590
00:47:32,549 --> 00:47:37,670
the point here is make sure you analyze
all your data you have the the project

591
00:47:37,670 --> 00:47:41,130
and you can replicate the whole thing
right if you are doing some community

592
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:44,289
issue are doing a threat intelligence
sharing community we would love to have

593
00:47:44,289 --> 00:47:50,599
a look at your data right will give it
some exercise will produce very well and

594
00:47:50,599 --> 00:47:55,199
remember you can see the stars and the
other scientists right just make sure

595
00:47:55,199 --> 00:48:01,049
that we can do and that's pretty much it
I ran over my time and there's probably

596
00:48:01,049 --> 00:48:05,349
not time for questions here so you guys
can just follow us all the whole and

597
00:48:05,349 --> 00:48:08,869
will probably take care of all of you
thank you very much thank you
