1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,110
hey guys thanks for being here for the
last like had 2015 especially also

2
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:12,849
competing with that Khan which is
running in parallel we got a little

3
00:00:12,849 --> 00:00:18,410
challenge here that slides will see here
I could not get them to fit on the

4
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:23,119
screen you seen as fighting with it the
challenges you gonna fill in the blanks

5
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:30,470
alright so you're welcome deborah ok how
many of you are computer security

6
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:37,589
officers are people who work in security
and organizations pretty good of course

7
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,360
in black heard you gonna be there all
right honey love you deal with malware

8
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:47,680
malicious program that's pretty cool and
so you got terabytes of Maryland won the

9
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,640
terabyte of malware got there abides
divides lots of them other than my lab

10
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:59,590
to what do you do with them in
identified some others is seldom each

11
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:03,920
other I just say hey here's my daughter
by the main pass it on to you people go

12
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:08,670
about collecting malware and what we
want to do in this dark is telling how

13
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,970
we can can word there's terabytes of
malware into source of intelligence

14
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:19,619
that's the focus of the thing is how do
I convert it into something useful

15
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:23,700
rather than something that we consider I
got there about similar I'm so proud of

16
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:32,920
it but don't touch it or change that let
me introduce myself I'm here and I'm

17
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,090
professor in the University of Louisiana
at Lafayette and I haven't made my

18
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:43,159
colleague we worked because the last
time I'm gonna rush to this part may say

19
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:46,420
so here's the thing

20
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:52,079
cybersecurity disconnect the last one
the top so have you heard of this event

21
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,639
that happened and white house when
someone harder drawn that landed inside

22
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,600
the white house lawn

23
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:07,639
now ok alright okay to somehow what
happens when you have this kind of

24
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:15,500
physical security incidents of
violations typically you got a whole

25
00:02:15,500 --> 00:02:20,730
bunch of in this case a secret service
zooming in and to the people who are

26
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:25,630
done whatever and they go through the
complete history of the person to find

27
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:32,180
out what is it about not even if your
own home let's say you went home and you

28
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:34,010
found a window to be broken

29
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:41,540
you are likely to call 911 find out
what's going on who's after me even if

30
00:02:41,540 --> 00:02:46,900
the person perpetrators not gone in
because the dog was barking I do have a

31
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:53,190
defense however when will the incident
happens you're not just happy to see ok

32
00:02:53,190 --> 00:02:58,730
go it's ok no one to Kandahar my house

33
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:04,518
disconnected cyber security incidents
and the incident is just an attempt

34
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:10,030
someone trying to get in you kept him
out and it's ok man that's got a cap

35
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:14,970
tomorrow need to worry but it is only
when someone actually still a whole

36
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:20,530
bunch of credit card information and
things are going all over the place

37
00:03:20,530 --> 00:03:28,299
strand you start reacting to it and what
we want to do is change that and its

38
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:36,680
worldwide jet mosque in his keynote
session is when you're under cyberattack

39
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:42,780
why do not employ every resource at our
disposal and the context of his

40
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:49,100
conversation he was also bringing in law
enforcement why we call 911 in a sense

41
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:50,060
why don't we go

42
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,640
pursuit

43
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:57,079
offender now if you have a call 911 in
this sort of situation you need

44
00:03:57,080 --> 00:04:01,700
intelligence is not just enough to say
okay are attacked and so on

45
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:06,500
at some point guard how to extract
information so that you can somehow

46
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:12,290
pursue the perpetrator and what we want
to do is convert the malware

47
00:04:12,290 --> 00:04:18,159
intelligence now the basis that we have
here the missing part of the top is we

48
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,650
are talking about extracting
intelligence based on the economics of

49
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:24,349
developing malware

50
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:28,560
look at the model of developing malware
as a starting point we know mulberry

51
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,930
software and we know lighting software
is expensive

52
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:38,970
other writing good software is expensive
and we're talking about malware it's a

53
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:45,270
program that if it crashes the user is
not a call back and ask you how is not

54
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:51,159
working you got to have the program that
works in a remote machine and hopefully

55
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:55,020
doesn't crash the machine because of it
crashes the machine all bets are off in

56
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:59,930
order to get anything out of it we have
a problem there's gonna be intense in

57
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:04,510
terms of complexity and you're
generating those programs have you heard

58
00:05:04,510 --> 00:05:08,860
the numbers you got like two hundred
thousand miles a day now it is something

59
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:15,660
that number two hundred thousand a year
they've been doubling every year so most

60
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:20,510
likely next year when you hear will be
half a million a year

61
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:23,740
asorio day that number is back

62
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:31,570
extremely big number it's a complex
after there can't be that many

63
00:05:31,570 --> 00:05:37,500
programmers writing programs malware
everyday that trying half a million

64
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:43,740
miles every day they gotta be developed
in some other way they are complex off

65
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:50,750
half a million of them every day trying
a new software in some sense to the

66
00:05:50,750 --> 00:05:55,669
economics of developing potentially goes
to this effect you got to use some other

67
00:05:55,669 --> 00:06:03,320
nation regard to use some way to create
lots and lots of variations and that's

68
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,060
typically what happens you have this

69
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:10,980
packing polymorphic polymorphism
technology you create you take a program

70
00:06:10,980 --> 00:06:18,970
and you start wrapping up some kind of
form understand all of that looks very

71
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:26,639
different in every instance that's one
kind of marxism office location to do

72
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,900
you can also get the court itself we
transform the court was classically

73
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:36,650
carla's metamorphism will prob
polymorphism and of course you also

74
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:40,799
using a variety of different libraries
are typically when you're developing

75
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:47,610
malware you gonna buy borrow still
somehow the actual call you in a bread

76
00:06:47,610 --> 00:06:51,990
together is a complex court and then you
get a chance on the cord and Israel all

77
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:54,780
over the place mister classic

78
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:59,888
if you don't have a zero their taxes are
you gonna exploit any 12 penetrator

79
00:06:59,889 --> 00:07:04,889
environment beside the mechanism to
penetrate to infiltrate the environment

80
00:07:04,889 --> 00:07:09,430
you also need the card that enters the
environment is going to do something

81
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:15,350
useful and it's extremely likely that
code is not within India today the court

82
00:07:15,350 --> 00:07:20,030
has written a very long time and are you
gonna use that code so what we're doing

83
00:07:20,030 --> 00:07:25,200
is my cell extracts intelligence things
information out of them away so I can

84
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,849
make connections I know the code has
been written and rewritten and borrowed

85
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:33,940
and store and and what not to create
something that has been transformed

86
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:38,960
after the fact to use this model we are
trying to a storming the court after the

87
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:46,820
fact and reusing code and we have tried
to see whether we can essentially find a

88
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:52,680
way to connect malware based on their
cold so what we gonna get out of the

89
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:59,580
intelligence if I have various to relate
not just a bad we are still using this

90
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:03,109
particular type of library for some
attack may be choosing this encryption

91
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:08,020
library is using this cord for back door
is using a particular time record for

92
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:14,070
killing is using a variety of cord all
of it has to be a professional

93
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:18,330
production quality court to work is
boring that good nite Inn

94
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:23,240
connection between malware I could
potentially say well you know this

95
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:28,659
to think that two actors wonders
attacking a bank and wondered attacking

96
00:08:28,659 --> 00:08:32,990
an NGO somewhere maybe those connected
this relationship between them

97
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:37,399
we could find connections between maybe
something that attacking

98
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:43,390
that's been received actual unit in
India maybe or china or some other part

99
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:47,939
of the world you could find connections
between the currency looks like someone

100
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:54,560
is targeting us the intent is not just
to have that you sitting on but to find

101
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:58,469
connections so that the two hundred
thousand or so malware samples you're

102
00:08:58,470 --> 00:09:03,579
coming at your door every day you can
partition it in some so that you can say

103
00:09:03,579 --> 00:09:04,979
huh

104
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:09,050
it looks like this piece of course
they're coming out of my sales

105
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:13,719
department or they're trying to hit the
sales here and marketing team there

106
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:20,459
maybe there's a connection and that's
what what the evidence that we can find

107
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:24,670
connections I don't care if you look at
and here's one particular piece of one

108
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:34,490
article which is that stocks that in
this case the precursor to the next year

109
00:09:34,490 --> 00:09:40,029
especially with this article says is you
got the cord local shared courtroom

110
00:09:40,029 --> 00:09:45,040
Stuxnet and then you have the case of
Stuxnet Salukis called being used in

111
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:50,040
some other place you find articles from
Kaspersky they're pretty good in that

112
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,769
there were a lot of articles from
Kaspersky they go deep into the court

113
00:09:53,769 --> 00:09:59,370
and find connections between what might
be considered by Melissa malware so

114
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:03,760
there is enough empirical evidence to
show that the connection exists that

115
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:08,730
it's in the court that people share
called what we want to do is can we do

116
00:10:08,730 --> 00:10:15,120
it in scale so why do you have a spare
scan Symantec researchers sitting and

117
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,890
actually extracting information from
court we want to do it automatically and

118
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:24,519
we want to do it on scale so what we
want to talk about today essentially is

119
00:10:24,519 --> 00:10:27,790
a mechanism to extract intelligence

120
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:33,030
from malware on a large scale

121
00:10:33,030 --> 00:10:43,069
let me see what we're trying to achieve
we're developing what might be called

122
00:10:43,070 --> 00:10:47,190
Google for malware so think of it if you
have done

123
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:54,030
Google Image Search you done image and
image uploaded in Google and search the

124
00:10:54,030 --> 00:11:00,550
image the query and fine others similar
images so imagine the same thing here

125
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:06,819
your day came out where you uploaded
aside and doesn't just a reminder this

126
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:11,530
is about things it says okay and it's
also similar to all of these other

127
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:15,949
things we have of course not just a
similarly you want to say okay what is

128
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:20,410
the correct potentially give you more
information as part of our requirement

129
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:27,670
we want to develop some notion of
Bristol match without very large

130
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:33,260
collections your terabyte collection of
the challenge them yard line the

131
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:38,600
challenges of all starting point is some
notion of malware reaches a little piece

132
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:43,150
of cord scary looking stuff and
typically offer skated so you won't have

133
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:48,410
a place to deal with escape the malware
then the next

134
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:54,709
this notion of malware into what's
classically call as a document document

135
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:58,760
is not a lowered document document is
just a phrase used in information

136
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:05,350
retrieval to represent something the
whole are some of the ideas come from as

137
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:10,530
a text document but we really not clear
document will create a notion of words

138
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,360
and national sequencing of words and so
on

139
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:20,360
mapping to document the next part is of
course grading in excess in excess of

140
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:29,380
that you can surge the collection very
fast for part 2 I'm gonna go through all

141
00:12:29,380 --> 00:12:35,320
of the pieces reviewer high-level view
each part not really wanna see all the

142
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,360
gory technical leader but give you

143
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:43,410
big picture is that what are the king of
asian threesome of the game was

144
00:12:43,410 --> 00:12:49,170
innovations be bringing is we wanted to
use of introspection I mean I use it in

145
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:54,420
the drought so essentially what it means
is cloud is typically are you have a

146
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:59,360
machine break it up into a whole are
virtual machines and the top of the

147
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,890
virtual machine began on other virtual
machines that will contain windows and

148
00:13:04,890 --> 00:13:08,899
then we gonna watch the virtual machine
running inside the virtual machine to

149
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:14,290
figure out what the program inside suing
you can do it in scale and so that

150
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:20,380
enables us to do it in scale which means
we can now potentially analyzed on

151
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:26,480
something like Amazon Cloud Amazon
doesn't like to learn Mandarin the

152
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:32,450
terrible did you could potentially lower
their energy innovation will bring is

153
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:37,750
what we call as a semantic fingerprint
on the blood the semantic fingerprint is

154
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:45,240
essentially if you look at by economics
to trust one chord you gonna try to

155
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:46,779
obfuscate the cold

156
00:13:46,779 --> 00:13:51,980
caissons mean somehow your transforming
the sequence of bits so we don't want to

157
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:57,899
have fingerprint that based entirely on
just a bit in the court we want to have

158
00:13:57,899 --> 00:14:03,199
fingerprints that's based on what the
Brits are trying to do and that's what

159
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:07,939
we gonna semantics as in what is it
actually trying to achieve and achieved

160
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:12,910
here is in the actual court there two
levels of achieving a cheering as you

161
00:14:12,910 --> 00:14:18,219
look at the behavior as in what kind of
behavior in a sense of fire behavior of

162
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:23,910
what he's trying to do my talking to the
Windows OS here we're talking about

163
00:14:23,910 --> 00:14:29,279
semantics of the court itself as the
program that malware users to perform

164
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:32,870
something they want to extract the
semantics and we want to use the

165
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:39,600
semantics as the US for fingerprint and
remember the malware economics people

166
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:44,630
are sharing called people are
transforming code so I can however to

167
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:47,950
under a stronghold and then find a
better match

168
00:14:47,950 --> 00:14:56,550
then I have a bit of creating a branch
based on code now what happens of course

169
00:14:56,550 --> 00:15:01,319
I'm gonna skip this because we have
talked about it a little bit more so the

170
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:05,880
first challenges codification and our
two person called up for discussion one

171
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:11,490
is ours having removing an outer shell
which is gone packing remove the outer

172
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:16,450
shell and the second is even the inner
shell the code itself may be similar but

173
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:22,780
different in which the second part is to
map similar code to similar form so in a

174
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:34,980
nutshell what we do is we have we have a
matter to unpack Manuel inside there's a

175
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:39,020
whole lot of people have done unpacking
before and so we got we have some very

176
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:43,579
matters of unpacking but given the time
constraints I'm not gonna go into the

177
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:47,890
details of that and we're focused on
something more exciting that no one else

178
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:52,410
has been doing which is normalizing
court-ordered missing undertook the fill

179
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:56,860
in the blank their part of the court
normalization the hard anomalies code to

180
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:00,720
the number is called something like this
problem is something to this effect you

181
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:05,140
have this code segment and so when you
transform cord you could potentially

182
00:16:05,140 --> 00:16:11,580
converted into the various different
cord segments what happened all of these

183
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:16,910
pieces according to seeing they all
perform the same task exactly the same

184
00:16:16,910 --> 00:16:25,260
thing but as you say the court is
different what we want to do is not the

185
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:31,390
school to the same form so we can have
just one representation for all of this

186
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:36,040
respect very special court and the way
we achieved by mapping called the

187
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:39,750
semantics and what does that mean that
this is a piece of court in this case

188
00:16:39,750 --> 00:16:48,420
and semantics is algebraic expression
just like linear algebra simultaneous

189
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:56,430
equations collection of simultaneous
equations that describe what the piece

190
00:16:56,430 --> 00:17:01,359
of code is attempting to do so

191
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:07,530
are you honestly I don't have been so
far it does but but the key thing is you

192
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:12,470
can simplify expressions collection of
simultaneous equation you simplify the

193
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:17,160
expression bringing the simplest form
and that is essentially what we do we

194
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,589
take the original program in my opinion
the semantics and then we simplify

195
00:17:21,589 --> 00:17:27,059
simplification require the same kind of
properties are you using out you have a

196
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:31,850
disability property community property
associated property we use all of this

197
00:17:31,850 --> 00:17:36,830
property to simplify it turns out
there's nothing magical nothing new its

198
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:42,480
use in compilers all the time when you
compile advice to optimize your code it

199
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,760
uses all of this theatrics all we're
doing is being the same tricks to

200
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:55,559
understanding extracting meaning for
good right that's the first part the

201
00:17:55,559 --> 00:18:00,660
second to this is a member of the
station we gotta unpack and my bed to go

202
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:06,169
to be heard in a sense removed all this
cold medications and MapReduce seconds

203
00:18:06,169 --> 00:18:10,770
of simultaneous equations the next part
is to create a PDF document we want to

204
00:18:10,770 --> 00:18:18,549
create document so in document is rather
challenge comes in we want we want to

205
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:23,129
create to the presentation so we can
search on a very large scale so it's not

206
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:27,720
we don't want to compare to documents at
a time you don't have big document and

207
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:32,350
then compared is this the same as that
we don't want to do comparison pairwise

208
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:36,959
if you ever gonna bite off from
Melbourne who don't want to be taking

209
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:42,299
one sample and matching up against each
of them we are to create indexes so that

210
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:45,240
you can take it documented break it into
pieces

211
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:51,370
Hashmi says look at things and bring him
out the key word there is cash I want to

212
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:57,709
be able to create hashes such that when
I map the semantics to hash if two

213
00:18:57,710 --> 00:19:02,760
pieces of cord have similar semantics
similar in some notion of program amanda

214
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:05,830
says it will have the same hash

215
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:10,449
second part and once you can hash it
addresses a whole bunch of things you

216
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:16,740
can use your disability databases like
mongol to represent a document on a

217
00:19:16,740 --> 00:19:21,669
distributed architecture and that gives
you the scale that you need to surge a

218
00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:27,250
very large collection so what's the
trick to represent wineries and so

219
00:19:27,250 --> 00:19:31,789
classic metal representing binaries is
taking a sequence of birds and

220
00:19:31,789 --> 00:19:35,720
converting it into what I did

221
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:42,700
solar backup is a variety of ways to
convert into document what we are doing

222
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:47,470
is using semantics what's all the other
people have used is converting does

223
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:53,519
taking the actual bits to represent
document let me use actual bits you get

224
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:58,880
a lot of powers very fast however is not
good in the sense that it's very similar

225
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:04,809
document may have different bitch so you
can imagine my antics

226
00:20:04,809 --> 00:20:10,918
our strategy is we take a binary map
into the simply cannot create a control

227
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:17,320
program and this is where it comes we
cleared what's gone on the bottom will

228
00:20:17,320 --> 00:20:18,740
see the two parts

229
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:28,389
semantics and something we call as Jews
Jews is very similar to our in jewish

230
00:20:28,389 --> 00:20:33,740
you squeezed orange what you get is the
essential they are in the jewish nearly

231
00:20:33,740 --> 00:20:39,510
weather plus there is what we want to do
here we take a binary squeeze it and

232
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:45,139
extract what we call it the semantic
juice so I'm gonna give you an overview

233
00:20:45,139 --> 00:20:54,149
of what is demanding and so when we're
talking about words semantics toward the

234
00:20:54,149 --> 00:20:59,120
challenges how do I make sure that when
I have two things that are very similar

235
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:04,309
the end up having the same words so then
I hash it's exactly the same and when I

236
00:21:04,309 --> 00:21:11,158
say the housing in the blood on
strengths by Tom hired someone actually

237
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:15,870
create string string at the sequence of
kind of two and a half

238
00:21:15,870 --> 00:21:21,070
there should be the same so you have a
program with different colored my bed

239
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:22,230
into a semantics

240
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:30,110
jewish create a hash and I'm going to
search the big challenge that we have a

241
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:33,860
big picture of the challenges like this
so you have this sequence of

242
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:37,600
simultaneous equations you can reorder
the questions and they still say the

243
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:43,559
same you can reorder the terms in the
equation because you know there's a

244
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:48,690
sorry associated with the community
rules and you can pre-order terms you

245
00:21:48,690 --> 00:21:53,120
agree or equations they are still the
same equations what I want to do is be

246
00:21:53,120 --> 00:21:58,300
able to impose an order so that given to
set of equations that are equivalent I

247
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:05,090
have the same order to the way we do it
is we introduce some ordering rule we

248
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:10,860
introduce our own ordering room so you
can use a dictionary order and by and

249
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:14,740
large if you impose a dictionary order
and you introduced a little bit of

250
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:21,000
tricks involved for dealing with
community even associative property

251
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:26,110
deliberate approach you can essentially
guide for a very large collection not

252
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:32,350
always but a very large collections you
can get same semantic same strings same

253
00:22:32,350 --> 00:22:40,919
identical sequence of equations for the
same court but for a little catch like

254
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:47,420
any other way you have the variable acts
and it changed the variable Y is still

255
00:22:47,420 --> 00:22:51,360
the same aggression if you are
consistently change the equation

256
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:58,669
variables and the catches how do I deal
with these variables how do I take two

257
00:22:58,670 --> 00:23:06,200
equations that equal equivalent but the
only thing that if the variables and

258
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:12,910
ensure that they are identical get that
triggers involved so here's what we do

259
00:23:12,910 --> 00:23:18,540
is we take the variables and we use
something you'll be used

260
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:27,040
the trick used in logic programming
someone escape some of this trick using

261
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:37,659
logic programming no prologue apologized
in logic programming you can word

262
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:43,060
essentially what is called the variable
X X into what is called a logical

263
00:23:43,060 --> 00:23:47,409
variable logic variable is like a
quantifier there exists a cure for all X

264
00:23:47,410 --> 00:23:55,240
you create a 2500 replace all the
symbolic variables X like just replace

265
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:59,360
it with a large aquarium and a new day
call the logical variables and there's a

266
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:05,429
way bro love to what scholars a unify
terms unifying means given to terms you

267
00:24:05,430 --> 00:24:10,280
can unify them and say that the equal if
all the difference is in the logical

268
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:15,899
variables that's a good thing but other
gives us gives me the power given to set

269
00:24:15,900 --> 00:24:21,630
of equations is the only thing different
is the logical variables to the variable

270
00:24:21,630 --> 00:24:27,310
names I can obstructed and then I used
for a lot of unification if I unified if

271
00:24:27,310 --> 00:24:33,770
to sequence of equations unified they
are prevalent as simple as that

272
00:24:33,770 --> 00:24:40,420
so we are shocked it up then be used to
model of unification so now essentially

273
00:24:40,420 --> 00:24:46,010
what happens is worried aloud incredible
you still need to give it a name there

274
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:51,440
still a little bit of tricks involved in
making sure that two different equations

275
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,190
with different symbols in the beginning

276
00:24:54,190 --> 00:25:01,220
can be mapped to the exactly identical
sequence of strings by replacing all the

277
00:25:01,220 --> 00:25:05,470
symbols biological variables and then
giving them a different name to the

278
00:25:05,470 --> 00:25:10,360
little bit of tricks and while there but
for the summer just leave you with that

279
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:14,850
is doable and that's essentially what we
do

280
00:25:14,850 --> 00:25:24,149
my skip this my guess is I'm running out
of time is looking ok so I don't want to

281
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:25,340
learn more about it

282
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:31,750
about computing juice I was lied that
has kept doing the little things here

283
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:33,350
this is not happening

284
00:25:33,350 --> 00:25:41,379
summarizes so you see on the top part so
yeah binary converter disassembly and

285
00:25:41,380 --> 00:25:47,490
when i doing the second box is the
semantics and completing the semantics I

286
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:52,170
actually do what color the symbolic
interpretation I interpret the code

287
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:56,470
symbolically and symbolic interpretation
is nothing different from algebraic

288
00:25:56,470 --> 00:26:01,190
simplification so I simplified and when
I'm doing the simplification I track

289
00:26:01,190 --> 00:26:05,800
everything I do I keep track of the
steps performed once I've simplified go

290
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:09,060
to the next when I replaced all the
variables

291
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:15,290
actually be exposed like algebraic
equations were able to replace them by

292
00:26:15,290 --> 00:26:19,960
large aquarium with switches the upper
case letters to have this and then when

293
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:25,300
I keep track of what transformations I
applied that national extremely valuable

294
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:30,169
part if I know the method I used to
simplify when I find two different

295
00:26:30,170 --> 00:26:36,290
pieces of court and if I can relate them
by the same steps simplification steps

296
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:44,420
it tells me that they're using the same
of the station steps possibly what we do

297
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:51,410
here so the next part is how do you
create indexes and index it makes you

298
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:59,500
want to be able to quickly find that
live in the middle and end of the red

299
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:03,380
thing that the needle in a haystack and
there's no red strength that you can

300
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:08,450
find ok just need a final in the history
that's the International find it fast

301
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:15,960
it's really simple problem once you have
computer distinguished scholar jews and

302
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:22,090
I once I have mapped it in a form that
the strain that killed ring you can

303
00:27:22,090 --> 00:27:27,429
compare strings are two blocks of code
and save the strings are saying they are

304
00:27:27,430 --> 00:27:32,790
exactly the same or very similar events
you can achieve that then life is

305
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:35,230
extremely simple all you have to do is

306
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:40,500
go back to those people who are already
doing the remaining people like those

307
00:27:40,500 --> 00:27:46,840
who are who know how to define surged
through large collection of data that's

308
00:27:46,840 --> 00:27:51,309
really all we need to do is computer
crashes and so here what we do is

309
00:27:51,309 --> 00:27:55,629
something called what the blank part is
kinda off is be created what is called

310
00:27:55,630 --> 00:27:57,480
the men hash

311
00:27:57,480 --> 00:28:03,490
let me visualize the problem for you so
you have two documents like I said

312
00:28:03,490 --> 00:28:08,940
documents and the document is a
collection of Jewish so you're too

313
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:12,070
collection of documents and compare that
our community

314
00:28:12,070 --> 00:28:17,678
hey do they have a lot of similar jewish
essentially what we're doing so you not

315
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:21,780
to mention got another document you
trying to match you don't want to go by

316
00:28:21,780 --> 00:28:27,428
as much as you know when big one
document these kind of lower than it is

317
00:28:27,429 --> 00:28:31,040
another document is lower than you match
them on words it's very very expensive

318
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:36,960
instead what you do is you create what's
gone as a hash hash essentially says

319
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:42,830
that let's just pick one attribute off
the document so one that you don't hear

320
00:28:42,830 --> 00:28:48,100
an example and actually booed if my
document was people and the presentation

321
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:53,250
of information about people might say
let's just be care of her if if two

322
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,730
documents match on the head

323
00:28:54,730 --> 00:29:00,780
there's a very good chance that were
similar you randomly pick some what's

324
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:06,389
gone to the preacher you randomly bigger
fuel features and match on this feature

325
00:29:06,390 --> 00:29:12,290
it gives you some inside into that the
similarity the probability that the two

326
00:29:12,290 --> 00:29:16,860
documents are saying so you're not going
exact match you're doing a probabilistic

327
00:29:16,860 --> 00:29:17,729
Maj

328
00:29:17,730 --> 00:29:25,049
well let me big 30 fissures and just
imagine Terry Peters so instead of

329
00:29:25,049 --> 00:29:29,510
having 10,000 creatures you randomly
picking some thirty forty some number of

330
00:29:29,510 --> 00:29:39,070
features and the number of features you
pick gives you a way to tune the quality

331
00:29:39,070 --> 00:29:44,580
of match with respect to the cost so
that's roughly what happens if we create

332
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:45,879
identifier

333
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:50,640
preachers we identify them randomly
scholar random function we apply the

334
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:58,930
same function on sort of collection of
documents and now by picking our

335
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:03,120
collection we have not choose the number
of random function supply and what we

336
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:09,510
find is all they do is apply 11 random
functions so we have 11 random functions

337
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:15,550
that we apply to pick up what was called
the similarity between procedures cord

338
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:20,270
blood units functions so all I want to
do is find similar functions once I find

339
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:24,530
similar functions that I can still use
that to find similar boundaries so we do

340
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:30,500
has to find similar function and then we
use that to find some Lebanese the kids

341
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:36,670
we want to find how the notion of surge
at various levels of granularity so you

342
00:30:36,670 --> 00:30:43,810
will find hey I had this function is
available it is used in this crap out of

343
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:48,240
there I have or have a collection of
functions can you find me either binary

344
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:53,430
that use it so we don't want to be
limited to just a notion of a full image

345
00:30:53,430 --> 00:30:58,540
search our to be able to do some notion
of partial image search so that

346
00:30:58,540 --> 00:31:05,020
marvelous you create document your
computer crashes and in this case we

347
00:31:05,020 --> 00:31:11,000
compute what's called a min hash house
goes your way to search through a large

348
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:17,550
collection relatively fast but
probabilistic is speaking with certain

349
00:31:17,550 --> 00:31:22,590
level of probabilistic guarantees I'll
put it all together than architecture

350
00:31:22,590 --> 00:31:31,379
our system that we have the steps of
moving minor aid to cash involved this

351
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:38,610
nigga by only one packet you disassemble
it and then you bringing the procedures

352
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:45,600
and now I compute the semantic cash one
side and a cash computer crashes to

353
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:50,149
create indexes for procedures and I used
min hashes to find similar boundaries

354
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:56,010
and do whatever and this is we haven't
implemented in a web service called

355
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:56,999
Wireless Bartel

356
00:31:56,999 --> 00:32:00,579
people who are entitled are calm you'll
find the web service where you can

357
00:32:00,579 --> 00:32:05,779
upload the malware and it will go to the
whole process i dont line and then you

358
00:32:05,779 --> 00:32:13,559
can carry and search for similar bindery
it's a pipeline architecture currently

359
00:32:13,559 --> 00:32:23,139
using my role as a mechanism to schedule
our innuendo individual components we

360
00:32:23,139 --> 00:32:28,279
can distribute the components in any
number of machines and stuff to keep

361
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:33,909
artists we can it's not limited to
working at the one unit and one computer

362
00:32:33,909 --> 00:32:40,979
single computer we can distribute it I'm
gonna have transferred over his gonna

363
00:32:40,979 --> 00:32:51,690
give you some insights into the results
we have received we have

364
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:58,350
how many of you actually understand
everything that I've done them out again

365
00:32:58,350 --> 00:33:05,330
well as well as a professor and while
this is not an assignment it's something

366
00:33:05,330 --> 00:33:09,529
the other day down and you can now use
it it's available tonight and if your

367
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:15,279
company hopefully we can do that are
nice and show you now that he's been

368
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:20,610
talking about pulling the system how do
the actual ago about Jews it everybody

369
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:25,649
talks about intelligence but you know
what exactly is part of those Indonesian

370
00:33:25,649 --> 00:33:33,489
resides and how can we actually apply
those so to do that we didn't get a

371
00:33:33,490 --> 00:33:39,929
steady with behind and they were kind
enough to provide us with Myler samples

372
00:33:39,929 --> 00:33:48,870
of grass 14 mile urged families about
2,500 executable files that when the

373
00:33:48,870 --> 00:33:55,459
system currently takes us into but this
is a matter that we collected over a

374
00:33:55,460 --> 00:34:00,360
year and they put it through the system
and first event for unpacking and well

375
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:06,559
this is this one is graphically shows is
that dividend distribution of how the

376
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:11,719
money was distributed across to my
family is against its not buddy evenly

377
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:17,029
distributed but the bloom are showing
that would justify their money into the

378
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:21,869
system and the Irish bar shows how many
of those files but actually image unpack

379
00:34:21,869 --> 00:34:27,530
and unpacked would really like to say is
that I visited executive p.m. and found

380
00:34:27,530 --> 00:34:28,389
that it

381
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:32,809
this afternoon some deal could in a
memorandum to extract under the new good

382
00:34:32,809 --> 00:34:37,399
and put it all into some of these files
and send it to the system fired

383
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:43,418
generating the semantics in the houses
and what this table summarizes is that

384
00:34:43,418 --> 00:34:48,399
while the used three kinds of you
distinctive air to detect a friend and

385
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:51,210
backing has been finishing sign to
actually extract the contents from

386
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:57,950
memory and then go through and invited
them called humping down which basically

387
00:34:57,950 --> 00:35:05,529
relies on returns so execution of the
Packers more internet right now but

388
00:35:05,529 --> 00:35:11,289
essentially shows is that the image is
used by many similarities to say the new

389
00:35:11,289 --> 00:35:17,510
gender didn't mind it was not so similar
to them back by no means a lot of new

390
00:35:17,510 --> 00:35:21,260
board was generated and you can see it
here

391
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:24,329
person of all the fires were
successfully done by the only had

392
00:35:24,329 --> 00:35:28,740
roughly 20 percent failure cases which
is pretty good considering this is the

393
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:33,758
generator and baghdad's and fully
automated system now how do we use the

394
00:35:33,759 --> 00:35:38,900
information to be got his intelligence
so this is the first example of true

395
00:35:38,900 --> 00:35:46,089
intelligence what I have over here are
and grab that essentially shows how the

396
00:35:46,089 --> 00:35:49,460
same while it was being bagged using
different backgrounds and then

397
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:54,390
distributed I'll be around all of those
bright icons representing the oldest new

398
00:35:54,390 --> 00:36:00,250
mother fires there behind the visor
might be put into the system they are

399
00:36:00,250 --> 00:36:06,450
open box type icons are the un-backed
files and the skull like in the skies

400
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:10,910
actually represent the CNC I base from
where they were extracted a different

401
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:18,368
communicating with and so we can add
there are several of those right I go

402
00:36:18,369 --> 00:36:25,970
down to 1-1 and all of these are shower
one matching

403
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:31,618
bag binary so they were essentially the
same but they were back using different

404
00:36:31,619 --> 00:36:37,020
backgrounds and hence the different
wineries sound that is there is one

405
00:36:37,020 --> 00:36:42,290
through intelligence that we actually
get out of the system the second ok now

406
00:36:42,290 --> 00:36:47,279
what doctor laconia did to his romantic
hashing was that he was a medical apps

407
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:51,090
and other procedures and say oh these
procedures are essentially the same

408
00:36:51,090 --> 00:36:58,210
procedures I can't say in their same
procedures only other skater differently

409
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:00,170
which is why the look different

410
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:05,520
that means that any knowledge that you
have about any one of those procedures

411
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:09,490
can be propagated to all of the other
procedures that there there are exactly

412
00:37:09,490 --> 00:37:15,919
the same so I and reporting on the
procedures and he said ok can you tell

413
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:23,200
us about any of the procedures that you
have over here and all of the the blue

414
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:28,009
points and the personnel procedures that
I identified as being library procedures

415
00:37:28,010 --> 00:37:32,070
once in that the procedure is actually
elaborate procedure and you know which

416
00:37:32,070 --> 00:37:36,740
library procedure as it has been
identified by then you know essentially

417
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:41,379
about the procedure nice once you know
when the procedure guys you really don't

418
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:45,380
need to reverse engineer because you
have all the information I already right

419
00:37:45,380 --> 00:37:54,580
but you can see it's not too many you
know procedures over here but we were

420
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:59,598
able to use semantics ashes and sober
begin at 9 a.m. let's do procedures had

421
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:04,030
the same semantics think she did do the
same thing so it doesn't matter if I'm

422
00:38:04,030 --> 00:38:07,490
not able to identify the news on the
same procedure as we know they're the

423
00:38:07,490 --> 00:38:12,779
same procedures so no need to reverse
engineer and Soviet propaganda and this

424
00:38:12,780 --> 00:38:18,500
is what began almost half of the
procedures now I don't need to be

425
00:38:18,500 --> 00:38:25,740
revised engine either that's the beauty
of semantic hashes and

426
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:31,140
this is now new intelligence and your
knowledge new inferences that God that

427
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:38,680
we were not able to get previously on
the impact of this so many handles for

428
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:44,540
Indy 500 binaries and we brought them up
into procedures what we got was this

429
00:38:44,540 --> 00:38:49,940
very good off as you go from left to
right the number of mine and he's acting

430
00:38:49,940 --> 00:38:56,010
crazy and on the y axis we have a lot of
number not the best and the number of

431
00:38:56,010 --> 00:39:02,240
procedures that we got so many
procedures kept on increasing ok let me

432
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:07,850
know how many we go down to regard
approximately 1.7 million procedures in

433
00:39:07,850 --> 00:39:13,460
the 2400 binaries but that's a lot of
procedures so he said again Monday if I

434
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:20,090
am looking at the code blocks and I just
do a cryptographic hash in the code

435
00:39:20,090 --> 00:39:27,700
blocks no just a cryptographic heist but
I get dan is the green line and that's

436
00:39:27,700 --> 00:39:34,040
about 200,000 procedures so this
validates the initial exemption they're

437
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:40,100
not to look ahead then mother is not
being really did every time you use a

438
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:45,220
lot of Gordon was already use doing now
that could is unless you have some good

439
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:50,200
time tested it and you can use it again
and so you keep using it again every

440
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,520
time you create a new month when you
bought us some ideas are you borrow some

441
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:58,990
features about us some procedures and so
from 1.7 million gunned down two hundred

442
00:39:58,990 --> 00:40:04,100
thousand but then these hundred thousand

443
00:40:04,100 --> 00:40:10,230
office skated good and not truly unique
procedures many good look at the juice

444
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:16,940
of these procedures they could do this
but only about 32,000 unique procedures

445
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:27,670
done down from 1.7 million to 32,000
procedures this imagine the past now

446
00:40:27,670 --> 00:40:33,960
it's our tariffs magnitudes and I look
at these guidelines you see the neck

447
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:37,450
distance between these guidelines is
increasing as you move two words that I

448
00:40:37,450 --> 00:40:43,098
didn't cite as it moved of its positive
x-axis but on the buy access this is not

449
00:40:43,099 --> 00:40:47,970
an Intergraph this is the lot to debase
10 which means every time the distance

450
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:52,299
increases by a unit of one actually
decreased caused by an order of

451
00:40:52,300 --> 00:41:01,109
magnitude by way of your gone one
decimal place left and this shows the

452
00:41:01,109 --> 00:41:07,930
person they just library procedures and
identified so the personnel number of

453
00:41:07,930 --> 00:41:13,098
reasons obviously is increasing as we
saw in the previous grant now another

454
00:41:13,099 --> 00:41:15,940
impact of this intelligence

455
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:21,330
America next month and families that we
previously thought I'd were very

456
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:22,029
different

457
00:41:22,030 --> 00:41:28,420
disparity not known again the red the
red eye cancer all orders in my bag

458
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:35,410
binaries and open bar structures are
unpacked my knees but this guy has three

459
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:43,609
before my family's does one get smoked
black dark comment is funny learner and

460
00:41:43,609 --> 00:41:50,098
green as I limited my family and if you
see they are all plastering each family

461
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:56,530
farms its own glasser except for some
some bad wineries are coming in from

462
00:41:56,530 --> 00:42:03,720
each of the family when you look at that
the respondent unpacked my knees go back

463
00:42:03,720 --> 00:42:11,310
into the family's cluster so what this
shows is that some

464
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:20,900
on abuse malware families were sharing
the same back then back into their own

465
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:26,119
bag by mister been back to dinner on
cluster which means that undermine my

466
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:28,420
good was studied different

467
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:32,040
probably created their own separate
miles where the families are not the

468
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:37,450
same but for some some of their bag by
Moody's they decided to use the shame

469
00:42:37,450 --> 00:42:43,000
the same back this is some very valuable
knowledge just connected

470
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:47,650
not just three discounted my lips I miss
but you know now that probably there is

471
00:42:47,650 --> 00:42:51,380
some connection between the actors
behind this family is because somehow

472
00:42:51,380 --> 00:43:00,960
they all had the same factor now we're
getting some really good results how to

473
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:06,970
be going very fine so we looked up again
to be found that ok to modern family

474
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:12,189
starts I'm an optimist and this seemed
to be shedding some good so we randomly

475
00:43:12,190 --> 00:43:17,530
picked a few procedures and you put them
through been left and miss at a camp in

476
00:43:17,530 --> 00:43:24,280
this video thing do they really match
and you look at the end of matching

477
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:27,910
program structures are not on the graph
and it looks at the structure understand

478
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:36,440
what is the same and now these
procedures but not dead in the bad news

479
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:41,990
is that he had but they were present in
mind at ease and his agency

480
00:43:41,990 --> 00:43:48,160
all of the samples and we had this
procedure was done in 65 of the $319

481
00:43:48,160 --> 00:43:52,410
comment samples and me high and 1,359

482
00:43:52,410 --> 00:44:01,149
but families I'm so this is the shows
and very strong connection we also have

483
00:44:01,150 --> 00:44:08,950
other procedures bad another thing that
we can do in this system is we can

484
00:44:08,950 --> 00:44:14,330
understand the evolution of the modern
family on the right now we've been

485
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:18,860
talking about connections between just
different families there but if you have

486
00:44:18,860 --> 00:44:24,000
fun family and UN allies just the good
of the N one family only going to say

487
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:29,270
okay in this one of these samples from
this one month and family how many

488
00:44:29,270 --> 00:44:30,990
procedures are dead

489
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:37,359
share that draws on of the minored in
that time and on the x-axis we have the

490
00:44:37,360 --> 00:44:41,690
percentage of minorities in which the
procedures were found and AM I actually

491
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:48,960
had number of such procedures so
essentially we had 200 procedures than

492
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,589
100 percent

493
00:44:50,589 --> 00:44:56,788
wineries on this family they lost her
family and I feel betrayed their only

494
00:44:56,789 --> 00:45:02,589
and maybe ten percent of the family and
other thing that we can do it fine

495
00:45:02,589 --> 00:45:08,349
needle in a haystack so what happens
when you have a mother family that is

496
00:45:08,349 --> 00:45:13,619
evolving very rapidly and we knew every
few days there's a new sample and

497
00:45:13,619 --> 00:45:21,729
somehow the code has changed while this
can tell you then again grabbed and

498
00:45:21,729 --> 00:45:25,538
wrapped around the left hand side you
have a lot of procedures which means

499
00:45:25,539 --> 00:45:32,670
that of the early is it features that I
did in about 60 to 65 percent of the

500
00:45:32,670 --> 00:45:38,329
minorities and most of the procedure in
less than five percent of the bite of

501
00:45:38,329 --> 00:45:43,299
these which means that good as involving
but do not believe this is the new

502
00:45:43,299 --> 00:45:50,630
insight into the modern family and this
is the Intelligence Bureau IB I once

503
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:58,549
managed to summarize in a nutshell wires
bank is a system that has got seven new

504
00:45:58,549 --> 00:46:02,410
innovations to extract money
intelligence

505
00:46:02,410 --> 00:46:08,149
got a package that uses p.m.
introspection we have we have semantic

506
00:46:08,150 --> 00:46:13,450
fingerprint thing we also have so many
caches a farm of locality sensitive

507
00:46:13,450 --> 00:46:18,140
hashing for basically doing some
probabilistic matches so you don't have

508
00:46:18,140 --> 00:46:22,219
to go buy some a job he proceeded to
have the procedure in this time instead

509
00:46:22,219 --> 00:46:28,329
you can determine if the probabilities
according the probability function and

510
00:46:28,329 --> 00:46:33,930
then very high or very high probability
I should be able to match things that

511
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:39,049
are matches that are similar and the
broad match for things that are not so

512
00:46:39,049 --> 00:46:46,479
much a very low and you can just do that
by changing the country and some of

513
00:46:46,479 --> 00:46:51,299
their resigns after five mins typically
done back then generate automatic

514
00:46:51,299 --> 00:46:54,640
unpackaged takes about 30 seconds it
spins off a be M

515
00:46:54,640 --> 00:47:01,379
and automatically backs the minority and
sends you a whole new be filed under 30

516
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:06,100
seconds and badly beyond so into
semantic harshest

517
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:10,690
doesn't separate process that goes on
and that also takes about 30 seconds and

518
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:16,460
you can put in the system now because
they have everything has been indexed

519
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:27,160
and under is it one second I'm sector is
difficult to read from it and you can do

520
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:38,170
procedures procedures origin and a
hundred milliseconds and yeah the system

521
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:45,650
is very highly scalable each day's is a
separate processes and should be I'm

522
00:47:45,650 --> 00:47:52,990
introspection is always about money and
so is jews and so are the queries and we

523
00:47:52,990 --> 00:47:58,100
have a distributed architecture that is
already explained and so that things to

524
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:03,980
date from the doc basically my deposit
is a good source of intelligence and

525
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:09,840
then now whenever the number I'm already
increased people invited myself the

526
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:14,090
mother is increasing so do such huge
numbers but if it's increasing to such

527
00:48:14,090 --> 00:48:17,570
use numbers it's also giving you a lot
of information you have now a much

528
00:48:17,570 --> 00:48:22,250
bigger source of information out that
and we are meant to inspection

529
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:28,820
essentially allows you to monitor the
behaviour of a mother as it is executing

530
00:48:28,820 --> 00:48:33,350
in vivo and I've heard below the things
you know because they're monitoring it

531
00:48:33,350 --> 00:48:40,319
from the outside through a lot of
different types of God applications like

532
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:45,590
metamorphism polymorphisms and other
similar discussions the child to be

533
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:51,010
concerned very difficult to do and
semantic hashing neighbors are very fast

534
00:48:51,010 --> 00:48:57,060
going over various levels of granularity
daily because such fun similar

535
00:48:57,060 --> 00:49:01,770
procedures he could such basic not
enough good beginning then search for

536
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:03,520
different minorities down

537
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:10,230
to the by in part by an idiot and
finally virus malware intelligence

538
00:49:10,230 --> 00:49:24,730
system is available to you online it is
also allows you to reduce your costs

539
00:49:24,730 --> 00:49:29,240
reverse engineering allows you to
identify done with it is actually

540
00:49:29,240 --> 00:49:35,069
connected separate incidents and so you
know that actually connected and it also

541
00:49:35,070 --> 00:49:40,120
provides the fascination in response and
reminders and incidence of violence

542
00:49:40,120 --> 00:49:46,600
against find out some other similar
month previously analyzed so you know

543
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:58,710
how to respond to such questions

544
00:49:58,710 --> 00:50:30,630
I have a hearing problem area have fun W

545
00:50:30,630 --> 00:50:42,810
to have discussions like the question
way that why you too can connect with

546
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:52,310
juicy mandates if it's going to be okay
that's a good question to the same

547
00:50:52,310 --> 00:50:58,820
quarter being real good is used but
remember taking the trash on the court

548
00:50:58,820 --> 00:51:04,800
so the mechanism of defeating the matter
with doubleheaders is applying sudden

549
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:09,859
transformation after the fact that
actual crash emission you played it on

550
00:51:09,859 --> 00:51:15,980
computer July 2012 so you packet the
backing and one transformation but even

551
00:51:15,980 --> 00:51:21,039
with backing what happened to somebody
so gore and the where the court is good

552
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:26,939
by taking the same exact tragedy but
automatically by machine transforming it

553
00:51:26,939 --> 00:51:34,578
so you see a sequence of gold and then I
showed the video shows that of any the

554
00:51:34,579 --> 00:51:40,169
essentially the same type of
transmission can be done by machine and

555
00:51:40,169 --> 00:51:45,739
there are many more free by lamar Fig
distrust mission ended available that

556
00:51:45,739 --> 00:51:52,209
use or other subject protection tools
that are available that apply their

557
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:57,799
transformation for you so the reason we
want to use the notional deuces to deal

558
00:51:57,799 --> 00:52:04,309
with those transmission in addition it
takes all scored and then compile and

559
00:52:04,309 --> 00:52:08,219
when you compile every time you
recompile accord there's a possible

560
00:52:08,219 --> 00:52:12,509
possible variations there's a
possibility of variations you may also

561
00:52:12,509 --> 00:52:19,900
add new behavior in the cold so you know
it's not exactly some variations in the

562
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:25,979
cold for example may use different
registers for the same logic so you have

563
00:52:25,979 --> 00:52:29,198
the same chord with the compiler choose
a different set of instructions

564
00:52:29,199 --> 00:52:33,569
different registers different memory
locations and you want to move those

565
