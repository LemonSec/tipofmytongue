1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,670
this session is being persistent in
software-defined networks and this is

2
00:00:04,670 --> 00:00:17,470
your speaker Gregory Peck first off
thank you for coming today it is indeed

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:23,198
staying persistent in software-defined
networks my name is gregory pick it

4
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:30,760
would help our security I am part of our
have a secure operations group an

5
00:00:30,760 --> 00:00:36,050
overview of today's stock buybacks
leaders know what is it about new people

6
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:43,790
so we'll talk about that just a bit
after that is stupid is as stupid does

7
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:49,769
exploiting it next point out and I guess
is we'll take advantage of those

8
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:55,760
weaknesses and see what we can do it
going forward out of a dress as we get

9
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,899
this deal with remediation will go with
medication damage control and then wrap

10
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:05,510
up with Tom so I time where they're
still taking us and why would find

11
00:01:05,510 --> 00:01:13,730
ourselves in this competition again
alright let's start with white box

12
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:20,440
white box is standard how do I get a
blank slate running merchants like I'm

13
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:28,479
trying and Broadcom chipset Intel AMD
and PowerPC processors using an open

14
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:34,020
operating system and linux-based the
idea is to remove the hardware from

15
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:40,199
equation to make a commodity by using
off-the-shelf components that point

16
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:47,290
forward to stop her that makes the
difference is critical for

17
00:01:47,290 --> 00:01:55,740
software-defined networking site can be
used without so I do it for the same

18
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,399
reason you would imagine
software-defined networking reduce costs

19
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:06,860
respectability and more control in
gaining control arm or you can use it

20
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:11,110
like a regular weight you can connect
with this age as you can manage to find

21
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:17,560
this wage to continue the network did
for management purposes you can control

22
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:23,080
it adopts a puppet show printable hadn't
managed with the rest of your

23
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:24,890
infrastructure

24
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:30,010
for you could gain control what's
happening now working on our control

25
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:34,950
plane is centralized controller and
makes an irreplaceable and respond to do

26
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:40,670
what they're going for obviously with
lightbox your hardware get a plane and

27
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:46,000
the Commons Justice flexible exchange
over if you want to be tied and 84

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:54,569
bender and technology and proprietary
you are pretty free and hardware right

29
00:02:54,569 --> 00:03:03,488
to open network and consolidate the
Putnam play that's right right actually

30
00:03:03,489 --> 00:03:11,880
dropped that network and do so in a very
famous fashion when he was adopted only

31
00:03:11,880 --> 00:03:16,959
is firmware for paramount network
switches there is growing but you need

32
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:20,959
to move the system known as their to
boot the network right there to

33
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,260
facilitate installation and removal and
recovery systems comes pre-installed

34
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:30,910
because it is part of firmware is really
there to automate that's what he played

35
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:36,340
in only a thought america systems which
kicks off this is a going private

36
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:42,080
network may be a bad

37
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:57,100
the blank slate and only ruler can go
wrong turn out thanks for not only is

38
00:03:57,100 --> 00:04:01,930
happening system it is only until the
debate on Lenox Road account has no

39
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:08,310
repairs word and blank and do not force
enforcing change it so that black

40
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:15,060
pastors like the man himself was also
weak telnet by definition is insecure

41
00:04:15,060 --> 00:04:19,769
per week and his age and the keys are
weak eighteen potentially an

42
00:04:19,769 --> 00:04:31,190
installation Mon Fri 6 bid to mention
our installer now looking much better

43
00:04:31,190 --> 00:04:37,630
use a predictable said you are else
standard this is we're only gonna look

44
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:45,310
at 123 you know that I'm anybody does it
will get an exact URL from ADT be four

45
00:04:45,310 --> 00:04:53,080
sign a bill that URL from the DHCP
response and then look for ipv6 neighbor

46
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:59,000
hey do you have an installation and then
go through a waterfall the TFTP now when

47
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:03,250
it follows this very predictable very
noble path it also looks for a

48
00:05:03,250 --> 00:05:07,450
predictable filename her that found them
to start with one found him looks more

49
00:05:07,450 --> 00:05:12,039
than another and other means you can
then be in front of me you know we're

50
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:16,000
always gonna be immune from that and
whatever you like

51
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,810
no questions asked because they're not
corruption or any indication so if you

52
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:26,830
have any compromise with no questions
asked

53
00:05:26,830 --> 00:05:37,120
right now limitation is where we see
opportunity thanks tony has installed

54
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:49,530
the system partition and that it is both
and if so should only be modified

55
00:05:49,530 --> 00:05:54,190
nothing to stop a modified only from
operating again and again and again and

56
00:05:54,190 --> 00:06:01,660
again whatever it may be entered has
told you again and again and again what

57
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:08,250
did it mean of course well there's lots
of opportunities available to ways to

58
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:17,280
get only talk about the different ways
to do it and also may not be the best

59
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:23,280
way it could of course comment directly
on a blank text like stale you can wait

60
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:32,200
up again you could step in traffic and
metal their eyes and tell her you crack

61
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:39,770
at his age and Finance and Operations
battalion likely only got 400 randomly

62
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:47,030
here 100 1 percent of the time right if
they are installing a system that is

63
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:56,630
terrible he said basically operating
system to 20 minutes remaining 99.9999%

64
00:06:56,630 --> 00:07:02,800
I'm not really feasible or I think back
home

65
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,860
take a look at me being there at the
right time right to compromise and

66
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:15,569
installation biro getting determiner if
its neighbor to put the tape to be sorry

67
00:07:15,569 --> 00:07:20,069
but I still get to call these lacks epic
also you have to be there at the right

68
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:27,979
time and if you are able to get a chance
to talk compromise insulation on my next

69
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:29,289
time yet

70
00:07:29,289 --> 00:07:35,389
20 and I had to be there at the right
time not a real good approach that's one

71
00:07:35,389 --> 00:07:38,129
is looking

72
00:07:38,129 --> 00:07:43,990
systems directly way to a recovering
standing up and running a passenger

73
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:54,120
cabin system not if I only had a
partition is exposed and it has been and

74
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:59,460
will continue to be enforced to be key
operating activities for compromise

75
00:07:59,460 --> 00:08:07,830
that's about cars to take me like that
and now uniform wear white sticks and

76
00:08:07,830 --> 00:08:16,318
you are there forever active forever but
you get to long-term contracts and

77
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:22,690
that's really what you want as an
attacker to hide it can take as long as

78
00:08:22,690 --> 00:08:27,770
you can tell

79
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:32,088
take a look at the network operating
systems given that only it's pretty much

80
00:08:32,089 --> 00:08:37,630
useless there and see how well they're
doing in protecting themselves and

81
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:44,300
protecting only and what we have to get
past them at that point becomes a very

82
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:55,670
important to linchpin for all this is
done by only operates which are turned

83
00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:00,029
out a whole under-covered systems no man
for right now that have only compatible

84
00:09:00,029 --> 00:09:07,829
distributions that only a handful right
now to talk about it and Thomas are

85
00:09:07,829 --> 00:09:13,219
looking at this we are open every
clinics which light

86
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:18,380
Linux and UNIX OS

87
00:09:18,380 --> 00:09:25,010
open-air clinics its distribution for
Paramount which is as they are based on

88
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:30,810
Debian Linux loans no teachers need to
run a stretch but I have a real hard

89
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:36,069
time trying to switch real hard time
conditions which is really to reference

90
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:40,490
to doctor said here you go

91
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:49,890
the starter you develop your honor
system to promote only right for tonight

92
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:55,470
ok will do that I look at 42 points 6

93
00:09:55,470 --> 00:10:03,100
packaged open-air SL rest is actually
added my hair looks a lot like obsd be

94
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:12,010
defined as rich agent it added 2012
photo most configure the network it is

95
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:17,200
an extension of big cloud from attached
and launched a particular solution by

96
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:22,270
big hard cock big cock fabric Mason
Plumlee switching network and cloud

97
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:26,340
Federer takes over you were actually
actively discouraged from adding as we

98
00:10:26,340 --> 00:10:32,860
just want you walk away I kind of look
at it as a managing my site you will see

99
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:38,840
it that's really good idea if you walk
away from that switch

100
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:50,050
in the AM catholics version 2.5 points
in 2008 the most current version so I

101
00:10:50,050 --> 00:10:57,780
put it out there so version 2.5 point
three also based on Debian Linux chef

102
00:10:57,780 --> 00:11:06,530
animal died in 1994 and about some
automation and orchestration maintained

103
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:10,930
by t-minus networks

104
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:22,880
unwise non access meaner format really
count XOS 3.54 points for what they do

105
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,240
relate this is her name and turns out
that a lot of problems you seem to point

106
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:36,650
before well in the same time for the
paycheck for animal to make it part of a

107
00:11:36,650 --> 00:11:45,890
damn thats environment party switch to
make it can maintain by technology to

108
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:55,250
start off with the agency found
themselves and agents and non-christian

109
00:11:55,250 --> 00:12:04,050
North indication I'm so excited to go
eat which we're gonna go you do need to

110
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:08,099
put the controller at your own free

111
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:16,160
she's going to talk to go and do
whatever you tell you know and down the

112
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:22,550
slide because I didn't want to hold a
blank space charge through the same here

113
00:12:22,550 --> 00:12:27,758
OpenSSL can use updating but that way I
need to confer

114
00:12:27,759 --> 00:12:34,009
hardly an impact that but still has a
little more about the stuff I'm not to

115
00:12:34,009 --> 00:12:42,940
their versions immediately right common
problem on this platform is it actually

116
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:51,519
comes to south London AP ice pounds with
a dedication which means that you have a

117
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:55,300
good opportunity for topology flow and
messaging application to authorize

118
00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:00,359
access an action movie acts are driving
change categories how many people have

119
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:07,410
been talking about dropping initial
energy efficient light and now and I

120
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:14,680
told us when using it to buy network but
there are bigger problems and this is

121
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:21,089
where things are looking at that again a
persistent tried getting onto the switch

122
00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:31,649
and persistent and actually talk about
my first many faults account I'm

123
00:13:31,649 --> 00:13:36,480
bringing up for two good reasons as two
reasons why does such a big deal

124
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:39,550
the birthday is there's a limited
ability to add other users

125
00:13:39,550 --> 00:13:45,910
you are kind of stuck with these
accounts except as Catholics

126
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:52,819
but there's a command injection that
will add around with these accounts

127
00:13:52,820 --> 00:14:07,800
second reason is there are need only
obstacle and you again right here on out

128
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,979
because when you had that account today

129
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:16,769
doing targeted killing me like you are
due to different ways you could get a

130
00:14:16,769 --> 00:14:22,200
foothold on your YouTube account this
way it's smooth sailing

131
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:29,769
he escaped she'll fight has rapper but
thereafter as easily left behind by

132
00:14:29,769 --> 00:14:33,920
having an able and among bash

133
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,380
black shoe deal directly tapping system
there is no rubber so you are just there

134
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:41,450
at the Shell

135
00:14:41,450 --> 00:14:49,000
OS boot camp up there in the public and
you can pop into all sorts of tanks

136
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,589
right now they did a good job of that
today actually had some foresight they

137
00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:58,620
limited what public can do I tried to
screw it

138
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:06,660
shadow file but i wouldnt I turned out
though if you unpack the firmware can

139
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:11,360
find all sorts of useful things I found
something that I can start as a backdoor

140
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:18,540
I gave me my child actress like that how
much I knew what you have to shell

141
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:24,880
access it pretty much installation which
which light turns out that not count

142
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:28,640
because those county record every day I
when you're stuck with our local

143
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:33,160
Cardillo pretty counter supposed to get
right turns out that low private account

144
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:39,000
admin is actually UID 0

145
00:15:39,000 --> 00:15:45,300
talking about the poor and is this
really is about a lot of bad decisions

146
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:54,699
on a part of the locations are missing
the first of many Linux you get the

147
00:15:54,700 --> 00:16:02,350
pseudo everything you have free reign
with sudo you are wonderful

148
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:09,600
not even at low privileged account a
lesser charge account and you start to

149
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:16,180
back door county started with images and
you have your show and check out your

150
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:26,420
idea and turns out you're also UID 0
good idea

151
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:33,959
that's all things in a way that one
account YouTube account to do full

152
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:38,630
control of your network for unauthorized
actions which first network do

153
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,930
everything it can do before I had
excellent access high driving change

154
00:16:41,930 --> 00:16:46,609
traffic you drop 1 I'll be up and
sisters and cousins and easy path all

155
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:53,639
the way and direct access to get back
with ready access to compromise if

156
00:16:53,639 --> 00:16:56,389
indeed the persistence

157
00:16:56,389 --> 00:17:05,809
talk about the implications and honestly
think I'm blow up on him

158
00:17:05,809 --> 00:17:13,670
your network

159
00:17:13,670 --> 00:17:19,630
on line 11 12 screen child's last year
as all those are open source products no

160
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:26,260
way what can we expect an open-source
are open source I was catching up or you

161
00:17:26,260 --> 00:17:28,310
know you pay for the product

162
00:17:28,310 --> 00:17:34,110
paper higher-quality ok I'm all do
dinner parties here right now who will

163
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:40,919
show you know it's one hand and have the
vendor products such as though so we

164
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:49,130
have content controller these sorts of
things start to piss people off I got a

165
00:17:49,130 --> 00:17:55,320
lot of interesting views on my profile
at Lincoln this week so i think im

166
00:17:55,320 --> 00:18:01,760
putting some people off of this so I
thought there and you log in below

167
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:07,070
private account and and and you go
through the Bible commands and I found a

168
00:18:07,070 --> 00:18:13,080
really interesting one called a bug bash
but I like and then I went and got to

169
00:18:13,080 --> 00:18:17,120
the shell and you're paying close
attention to the account slide you saw

170
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:23,879
the recount their head in the stable
area near the switch may discourage you

171
00:18:23,880 --> 00:18:29,570
actually the case and those which led to
discourage you so narrow that away from

172
00:18:29,570 --> 00:18:35,919
the pack matters if you hide it from you
feel like I said the past likely to make

173
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:42,900
a new account hard now I think you'll
realize that that an account and

174
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:47,879
password so you can just go ahead and
distributor

175
00:18:47,879 --> 00:18:54,189
get $1 done is keeping you want your
login you have to actually counted the

176
00:18:54,190 --> 00:19:09,169
password and I said I would if I can do
that what I can to admin first likes to

177
00:19:09,169 --> 00:19:16,359
work on my back and I cannot get
surprised about that now take a look at

178
00:19:16,359 --> 00:19:26,929
the package and UID 0 with the
homewrecker right I'm pretty much ready

179
00:19:26,930 --> 00:19:35,730
get access you can take a look at that
time i SAT there and the info and I need

180
00:19:35,730 --> 00:19:41,450
obviously for right into account and so
had that I should put more red circles

181
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:54,200
at their place to do it up I can Canada
shadow you can change the password you

182
00:19:54,200 --> 00:20:03,760
can change our way right and yet this
one and I will tell you what that is and

183
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:15,870
I may come out now after so start that
up and you know who am I just checked

184
00:20:15,870 --> 00:20:25,199
there and then you can see password and
turned out there to count action or two

185
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:33,730
thousand also UID 0 Chelle with
representation like that

186
00:20:33,730 --> 00:20:43,060
not make him an injection for Animal
Clinic so I'm very shy name already been

187
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:52,889
notified so that's a patch came out on
Friday

188
00:20:52,890 --> 00:20:58,610
come up with too many like Duratec
played so you know I'm operations guy

189
00:20:58,610 --> 00:21:06,100
breaking so I like to show off when I do
a banner that sort of thing I celebrate

190
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:17,300
this I guess a little bit as mitral
author mary had these tools that low

191
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:24,149
project manager is to scale back soon
for me and you try to get back to you

192
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:29,960
say I we're only gonna give you access
to these tools to find areas which need

193
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:33,760
to take an argument and I'm going to end
up being some commands and parameters

194
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:38,570
right they passed through to CEO Jamie
server and is that is what they call

195
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:41,689
roads that I can go to the code is there
was a tiny compared against that

196
00:21:41,690 --> 00:21:46,370
anything that's not as it gets colder
now promises command injection issues

197
00:21:46,370 --> 00:21:54,879
are there were no Friday that lied to by
Pat filter and because she also around

198
00:21:54,880 --> 00:22:03,230
you get to pretty much escape and go to
the limitations and actually anything

199
00:22:03,230 --> 00:22:07,270
like it right

200
00:22:07,270 --> 00:22:14,080
running hard all the time course on in
life which is first I didn't bring one

201
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:20,220
with me i'm not forceful as the german
blonde and black entered economy now all

202
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:27,390
safe as I don't know the plan on paper
can be shipped right from the thing that

203
00:22:27,390 --> 00:22:46,850
I have a stop iraq switch for this was
running it is installed

204
00:22:46,850 --> 00:22:53,549
go here

205
00:22:53,549 --> 00:23:05,280
and lots of the AM writing right now in
the delay

206
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:13,670
and great

207
00:23:13,670 --> 00:23:18,429
cannot obviously had access those five
tools

208
00:23:18,429 --> 00:23:26,799
maybe I know about the command injection
so here I am so glad that you no imagery

209
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:36,299
here and everyone say this I made sure
that larger fine art so we have a tool

210
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:42,879
that I have access to our actual pseudo
and go ahead and inject by making my

211
00:23:42,879 --> 00:23:49,549
injected him and the like part of the
label never do that I need to the other

212
00:23:49,549 --> 00:23:58,460
places that's easily overcome by create
a script to my home directory and inject

213
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:06,509
into the unknown command because our
release which got back there but it

214
00:24:06,509 --> 00:24:20,860
injected nonetheless

215
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:30,110
and I'm gonna go ahead and try to go
after the shadow fall again

216
00:24:30,110 --> 00:24:36,860
sure yet you

217
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:40,860
collapse

218
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:53,729
so if I passed a man who had an exam and
then paused at the end because I made

219
00:24:53,730 --> 00:25:00,559
sure I had the resources for

220
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:07,309
the next demonstration

221
00:25:07,309 --> 00:25:16,600
have your opponent is take a look at
their auntie devices / and horny and you

222
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:29,100
can use to know for sure right ed to
dump it in a way that locations all this

223
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:36,730
I like I was getting past and how easy
is it to do this time either Seyfried as

224
00:25:36,730 --> 00:25:41,470
they become a firewall and window is a
never ending a Linux still there say

225
00:25:41,470 --> 00:25:47,240
they look at young people so I am
playing the goateed administrator

226
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:53,559
administrator because they have beaten
before all tied they have put out on the

227
00:25:53,559 --> 00:25:59,119
internet now that put into it I'll plan
and a great points and it didn't web

228
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:05,549
browser and get a drive-by download you
can't open email attachments 1991 way to

229
00:26:05,549 --> 00:26:16,350
hold talks about that and I do show up
in a big brother to brother is gonna be

230
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:25,529
there at a windows-based binary and back
to Windows system is going to wait for

231
00:26:25,529 --> 00:26:32,249
the use of those people accounts now I
did that to make it simple mind you

232
00:26:32,249 --> 00:26:39,759
could easily be logged in connection to
switch to once it gets going

233
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:41,940
naturals

234
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:49,730
it will switch and write a Linux
compatible binary to the outside of the

235
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:53,110
switch and need to download anything
internet and text me carrying this

236
00:26:53,110 --> 00:27:00,959
payload secondary payload is called the
mother and a brother get started a

237
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:09,529
defect or Dan impacts on shelves little
brother and I mean what a big brother

238
00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:18,490
spore can get treatment brothers
modified only by 50 ne not install a

239
00:27:18,490 --> 00:27:28,970
time for a little bit of back and forth
and back and do the a flash there and

240
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:36,940
then connects to a brother or anywhere
you want to go

241
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:41,940
98 passengers who are you and ACL
firewall that sort of thing and really

242
00:27:41,940 --> 00:27:52,500
nice and use an HTTP or her she'll
compromises and abroad using hers and it

243
00:27:52,500 --> 00:28:02,570
will use proxies proxy will do its best
many as 20 go ahead and demonstrate the

244
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:07,759
idea is to have a way for that better
than to reach out and get that extra

245
00:28:07,759 --> 00:28:18,169
taxes to anybody out there might be
waiting for it to go ahead and

246
00:28:18,169 --> 00:28:21,880
said that guy

247
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:27,370
I need to make sure he's going a little
bit he's not very good at hiding on our

248
00:28:27,370 --> 00:28:37,760
specialists will pop up difference I can
I said going and you as an international

249
00:28:37,760 --> 00:28:41,840
me in that case going on doing whatever
I do and then one time or not I'm gonna

250
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:59,000
log into my switch here and there

251
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:10,990
and I put I put a rapid just like me so
we don't have any new enable this of

252
00:29:10,990 --> 00:29:17,170
course is just extra right they mothers
are you seen running

253
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:27,920
distract you takes time to do that I can
do whatever I want to do is fine can

254
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:35,270
figure that out when I get off

255
00:29:35,270 --> 00:29:47,900
to run over to see two

256
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:52,900
sharing is going ok

257
00:29:52,900 --> 00:29:58,419
she takes a bit to catch up

258
00:29:58,419 --> 00:30:01,750
was at the time here and do this

259
00:30:01,750 --> 00:30:06,880
that's good news

260
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:19,680
you can see that new brothers and his
job he started their brother Linux

261
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:22,010
binary

262
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:40,029
important to keep in mind right that the
Windows system is not easy to do I am

263
00:30:40,029 --> 00:30:49,849
timing issues I just make sure that is
the exchange able to complete so 92 I'm

264
00:30:49,849 --> 00:30:58,590
able to me right now is reeling from IBM
to the Windows Linux p.m. to Windows

265
00:30:58,590 --> 00:31:12,218
host to a Linux c2 terror and I could've
been there I am on the network at some

266
00:31:12,219 --> 00:31:16,149
point I'm not network administrators
guide on the mall there and take a look

267
00:31:16,149 --> 00:31:21,580
at that switch and it looks fucking and
against all because that's what we do

268
00:31:21,580 --> 00:31:25,279
now we don't try eclipse much as we want
things I would find out what's going on

269
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:31,419
in the white things out so it's going to
lie about it and installed on our part

270
00:31:31,419 --> 00:31:41,070
of the process

271
00:31:41,070 --> 00:31:57,340
freaking out because the back door and
reinstall that get my path

272
00:31:57,340 --> 00:32:02,260
yup

273
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:09,470
that's just not true

274
00:32:09,470 --> 00:32:18,540
kickoff is gonna do it ever does right
and all processed

275
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:26,470
start back on the presentation and then
we can go back and check to see whether

276
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:40,000
direct reflection of beneficence

277
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:45,930
harsh were made poor choices by the
vendors doing all the talking meetings

278
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:52,540
that they're looking for only as an
expert system to protect them today it

279
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:56,940
is something that you customer right now
do all the right things and a perfect

280
00:32:56,940 --> 00:33:05,860
world than any solution do you have
everything that might show up in reading

281
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:15,490
writing business why you pictures like
we have to remind our choices and their

282
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:20,840
application to talk about their products
in a catch up to a sort of thing sites

283
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:27,270
hardware install Environment Agency and
enterprise architecture and hardware

284
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:32,790
platform that would really help out a
lot I'm sure it had me with a big switch

285
00:33:32,790 --> 00:33:38,610
had he's put and x86 base which is we
need to get them

286
00:33:38,610 --> 00:33:45,439
PCR and I know abide by that are in the
works so many such a big deal a lot if

287
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,400
there are any power PCs which is in the
works and the ones they should also have

288
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,670
2 p.m.

289
00:33:51,670 --> 00:34:01,470
only working to get this part of
standard keypad run by they started by

290
00:34:01,470 --> 00:34:03,900
networks

291
00:34:03,900 --> 00:34:15,990
right ways to add resilience fried beef
up your party see why we need to have

292
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:22,969
told that there are things going on that
stage increase the key entropy change

293
00:34:22,969 --> 00:34:27,379
you know we can remember passwords are
pretty good about that choose not to

294
00:34:27,380 --> 00:34:33,510
Thursday's cool passwords saved and I
don't hand out there I'm gonna factory

295
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:42,120
settings I think that they're not doing
hands-on I think they are not being

296
00:34:42,120 --> 00:34:50,839
honest I told me he 650 bill Warfala be
a good thing and do nothing wrong with

297
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:54,820
that there can protect hopefully our
database server to make sure it's only

298
00:34:54,820 --> 00:34:58,800
one Assange addresses and I'd like to
see it

299
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:02,460
inflation things I know I know there's
always complications with without keys

300
00:35:02,460 --> 00:35:07,240
and getting sign that would go a long
way towards helping out one part of the

301
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:11,060
problem is the fact that this kind of
install anything

302
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:19,330
signing session would result that before
you start let's see what happened with

303
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:24,270
our eyes only

304
00:35:24,270 --> 00:35:33,460
check back with a diverse topics in his
back and install again back to RT to see

305
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:39,300
if we can get that connectivity back now
I know that disrupted so I'm going to

306
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:49,840
take a man to be bothered to tell him to
reconnect a little brother again and a

307
00:35:49,840 --> 00:36:03,440
fresh install them better access is down
there are no class for that

308
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:22,950
so happen to them there a number of
things going down there to create a

309
00:36:22,950 --> 00:36:28,879
contribution anything we can do to
strengthen because so much realized by

310
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,770
location try to tell anyone to do to
strengthen the system animal names on

311
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:43,050
the account through accounts I think any
better would be able to add users and

312
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:53,170
users can add users but you have two
choices you had men or monitor

313
00:36:53,170 --> 00:37:01,610
think you'll use to take twenty exposed
and from there you could of course in

314
00:37:01,610 --> 00:37:08,110
change password and change password they
really want to give you idea back you

315
00:37:08,110 --> 00:37:14,760
are so addict at account to make sure
that county go ahead and have less

316
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:21,270
religious are able to have that could be
functional also and I guess he UID 0

317
00:37:21,270 --> 00:37:31,960
removed from an international access to
get access she'll understand why do you

318
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,560
have a day even though they discourage
you

319
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:38,970
one-time password an option under
self-service portals can use

320
00:37:38,970 --> 00:37:47,509
self-service yourself a one-time
password to make sure that they really

321
00:37:47,510 --> 00:37:50,240
needed to go to help you get that

322
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:56,770
rapper good option 1 I'm passionate that
and there's a big secret that man and a

323
00:37:56,770 --> 00:38:00,340
pissing off knocks

324
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:07,360
ok not quite a powerful there is not cat
stare you can start that up and you can

325
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:14,390
plug into a bad thing she could care for
most of the action too pretty good job

326
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:21,200
of protecting her she'll get in there no
issue a tax shelter food wrapper I was

327
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:24,020
just a really long time to reverse
engineer

328
00:38:24,020 --> 00:38:34,240
how one person can stand in ages of
course at a less

329
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,109
and not misuse of prescription
medication I know we're all worried

330
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:40,330
about today get some key distribution

331
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:44,509
sorry I stand there there there have you
left and right have them do everything

332
00:38:44,510 --> 00:38:52,619
they can to get any case there is a
connection first 40 remediation and then

333
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:58,800
there's changing things make me stronger
platform to compromise

334
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:03,900
people like me away from me that
firmware right at any time to make Asian

335
00:39:03,900 --> 00:39:10,210
and we had to bring up then isolate
imagine playing again going quite common

336
00:39:10,210 --> 00:39:17,670
have an open quite common to have it
just ended about a VLAN around that you

337
00:39:17,670 --> 00:39:24,160
know we goes close you can manage
difficult as I get close you can see no

338
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:29,690
reason why I'm hanging right gets close
you can physically separating have a

339
00:39:29,690 --> 00:39:37,840
jump box anyone here been in operation
and they have no place May 29 and all

340
00:39:37,840 --> 00:39:45,800
conditions and yesterday they have about
200 I can't you haven't done by John Fox

341
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:54,050
next night that and you're using a gas
station we have to do what's necessary

342
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:59,250
and what the Bible in some cases to
protect networks I need a decent defense

343
00:39:59,250 --> 00:40:06,880
and then switches right which is of
course a word to learn about it

344
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:10,880
after taking a pass to change
comprehensive not just sat on their

345
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:17,990
presentations now but also send us on it
which is well and then partition would

346
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:25,939
not be a bad idea either make sure it
hasn't changed so racing and I'm in

347
00:40:25,940 --> 00:40:34,039
disney's touching stories told the four
miners and their poor choices and racing

348
00:40:34,039 --> 00:40:39,140
ahead and we're talking again about
impact on security and what else

349
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:49,410
developers and kinda different hair care
products to market important I get it we

350
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:57,660
all get like never answer Robinson had
been through this before taxes I would

351
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:03,750
like to see you read the best practices
I like to see you create your own you

352
00:41:03,750 --> 00:41:10,759
know because that's happening then
restart America and every year and he's

353
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:19,380
meant we had to fix a clean up and clean
up its important that we hire someone

354
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:24,250
for security and any reason why I point
this out and you get a lot of startups

355
00:41:24,250 --> 00:41:31,359
small unit within the operation now
working a lot of people who are people

356
00:41:31,359 --> 00:41:37,450
right now able to stand up straight and
14 security now they bring an outside

357
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:45,578
company to check out midway through at
the end for release

358
00:41:45,579 --> 00:41:51,369
just before release right someone to
look at this outside eyes

359
00:41:51,369 --> 00:41:54,329
you're talking about star China much
momentum seems to have proved themselves

360
00:41:54,329 --> 00:42:01,460
it's more competitive and I would pay
more attention to detail later why don't

361
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:10,119
we can fix it now because when you do
try to sell and you tried to carry can

362
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:16,569
be a featured you can be so here nigga
difference you want you to learn from

363
00:42:16,569 --> 00:42:22,569
the desktop ok we meet but our audience
and Marc Anthony want you to learn from

364
00:42:22,569 --> 00:42:28,380
desktop operating system vendors
leverages man whose idea it isn't

365
00:42:28,380 --> 00:42:32,880
platform about her control to take over
what we see them doing is taking over

366
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:37,789
the definition of treachery see them
taking over American at work but they're

367
00:42:37,789 --> 00:42:42,119
kind of the vote comes as no reason why
there can be some sort of reference to

368
00:42:42,119 --> 00:42:53,930
the 2010 stick looking at this day when
I'll play this wage is no reason why you

369
00:42:53,930 --> 00:42:56,410
can't have some sort of look at the
Lottery's

370
00:42:56,410 --> 00:43:04,420
drawn up to a platform right now control
yourself but something secondary you

371
00:43:04,420 --> 00:43:08,809
have metal visibility across the
platform you're just not focused on

372
00:43:08,809 --> 00:43:14,859
defining you know the switching network
to broaden and open it up and there's no

373
00:43:14,859 --> 00:43:19,200
reason why they can't also be like a
problem for any general term now playing

374
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:24,819
out there good example is nationally
partition are things that are supposed

375
00:43:24,819 --> 00:43:29,538
to be everyone can check this and this
is critical you are getting persisting

376
00:43:29,539 --> 00:43:34,680
your game that the president's an area
full access in traffic it's important

377
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:36,899
that the exercise

378
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:44,460
so always count on July 29 here to open
up like a security system is critical

379
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:54,010
and how IT security in case they believe
the difference they're safe relying on a

380
00:43:54,010 --> 00:43:57,980
customer and airline customers to have
everything just right and the solution

381
00:43:57,980 --> 00:44:02,380
to operate a perfect world and catch
everything and you know things off and

382
00:44:02,380 --> 00:44:07,100
put together my taxes and over again by
one out there and make sure you can

383
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:12,430
assume that one can find its gonna keep
everybody else out there will be some

384
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:20,569
our case it's not safe behind tape just
talking to us box and how it can make or

385
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:26,860
break you can go to when I send it over
to Linux system does need you with a

386
00:44:26,860 --> 00:44:33,610
persistent visibility a number of things
that can be done about that up I get

387
00:44:33,610 --> 00:44:43,790
online bookings which is right going to
talk about right and computer network

388
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:53,310
and Internet maybe breakfast which they
might not be so length their taxes that

389
00:44:53,310 --> 00:45:01,600
good stuff and you can take a look at
leave his post after you take a look at

390
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:07,029
them but that is it

391
00:45:07,030 --> 00:45:11,150
backwards

392
00:45:11,150 --> 00:45:12,070
ok
