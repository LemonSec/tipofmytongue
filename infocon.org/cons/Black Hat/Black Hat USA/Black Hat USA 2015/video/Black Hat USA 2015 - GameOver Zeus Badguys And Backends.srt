1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,290
good afternoon thank you very much for
being here I'm elliott's I work on the

2
00:00:04,290 --> 00:00:09,620
FBI's Pittsburgh's ivers water work for
our ski and I'm joined today by two

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:15,049
friends of mine Tillman Werner senior
security researcher a crowd strike and

4
00:00:15,049 --> 00:00:18,710
white sandy is a researcher at Fox I T

5
00:00:18,710 --> 00:00:22,630
we want to do today is give you an
inside glimpse and what probably the

6
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:26,580
last two years of our life look like
leading up to the state down and talk to

7
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:30,679
you a little bit about game over suits
came over as it's being a banking Trojan

8
00:00:30,679 --> 00:00:37,059
a piece of malware designed to steal
money from business banking accounts was

9
00:00:37,059 --> 00:00:41,010
incredibly sophisticated incredibly
successful in its heyday was able to

10
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,160
speak most of the security systems in
place by major financial institutions

11
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,319
did some pretty interesting pretty
private pioneering work on this project

12
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,110
mites gonna talk to you about the group
we were up against very much organized

13
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:58,500
crime group organized according to
organized crime principles very highly

14
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,829
specialized in their trade and Tillman
is gonna talk to you about the

15
00:01:01,829 --> 00:01:05,150
incredibly sophisticated measures we had
to take in order to take control of this

16
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:09,790
botnet taken away from the guys running
and maintain control and I'd like to add

17
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:13,570
that game over Zeus was designed in a
lot of ways in response to previous

18
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:17,389
industry and law enforcement
investigations was designed to make it

19
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:22,570
impossible for us to end up taking it
over so I want you to pay very close

20
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:26,820
attention because at the end we're going
to announce a challenge which should

21
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,289
lead to one of the bigger rewards ever
offered anybody black hat so before we

22
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:35,710
get going I would like to thank number
of individuals who were absolutely

23
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:39,089
instrumental to bringing this on board
you if you ask me what I do for a living

24
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,280
I tell you I play team sports and we had
to build an incredibly big team to make

25
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:48,040
this happen to those numbers are here I
would like Brett and Frank to stand up

26
00:01:48,040 --> 00:01:53,399
these handsome fellow is right here did
a ton of work thank you guys so much

27
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:56,830
thank you very much

28
00:01:56,830 --> 00:02:01,160
and then just a huge number of people in
the private industry on the government

29
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:05,250
side help us out with his a lot of
really interesting work came out of some

30
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:08,669
of our international partners Cal lot of
creative thinking came out a DOJ in

31
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:13,839
order to ensure we can actually pull
this off so now mike is gonna talk to

32
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,170
you about how this whole thing was put
together organizationally an

33
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:25,549
architectural II before he does that I
want to give you a quick example of what

34
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:29,140
does look like on the victim and what
the fraud cycle look like how they

35
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,589
actually moved this kind of money
successfully the FBI's estimate was over

36
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:37,230
100 million lost in the United States
probably two or three times and

37
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:38,049
internationally

38
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:42,310
just from game over zuzu peer-to-peer
zoos the guys responsible for this have

39
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:46,540
been doing this a whole long time and a
lot more money than that generally what

40
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:50,790
happened the victim would get a spam
email that's spam e-mail result in

41
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:54,620
infection that infection resulting
account takeover fraud which would then

42
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:58,740
result in an international wire using
either correspondent banking

43
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:03,180
international banking some ACH payments
but they actually displayed a remarkable

44
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:07,340
understanding of USA and other
international banking systems meaning

45
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,910
they were able to move money in most
cases a lot faster than we were able to

46
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:11,579
chase it

47
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:17,140
losses range from around $10,000 a
single largest loss that we observe 6.9

48
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:20,750
million dollars and i wanna talk to you
just for second about that one specific

49
00:03:20,750 --> 00:03:25,040
loss to kind of give you an idea of what
this look like so leading up to this

50
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,510
would be November 6 2012 was the time
they stole a 6.9 million dollars we were

51
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,480
doing some really interesting work
thanks to a good friend of mine over

52
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:39,268
Dell SecureWorks game over zoos the crew
behind it started doing DDoS attacks

53
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:43,600
against banks as soon as the fraud had
occurred and they did this for a couple

54
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:47,540
reasons one now the banks internal
security resources were tied up

55
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:50,670
observing you're trying to solve the
DDoS attack why are we getting hit with

56
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:54,339
suspected but they were also
specifically attacking the e-banking

57
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:58,080
login page for these financial
institutions preventing the victims from

58
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,330
logging into discovering the fraud
that's a current theme with most of our

59
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:06,130
designed to do account takeover fraud is
it got increase that amount of time from

60
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:09,180
when they execute the fraud when the
victim discovers a because that's when

61
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:09,780
the whole

62
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:13,709
chase for the money usually kicks off
with this Dell SecureWorks researcher

63
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:16,889
figured out the specific dirt jumper
which is indeed awesome botnet command

64
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:21,680
control know that these guys were using
a started sending me a live feed every

65
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,419
time there was an attack so now instead
of finding out about these frauds may be

66
00:04:25,419 --> 00:04:29,450
days or even weeks later we were
notifying the bank sometimes within 10

67
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:33,240
or 15 minutes of the fraud occurring
that they were being DDoS attack because

68
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,690
of the game will reduce fraud and what
specific characteristics to look for in

69
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:40,590
terms of payees where the money was
going out to chase it down into what

70
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:44,450
happened is over a period of a couple of
months we were able to go from me just

71
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:47,430
an astronomical success rate on their
part where there were almost never

72
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:51,710
successful and I'm gonna talk about that
at the tail end of this talk so this 6.9

73
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:55,489
million dollar wire out the door on the
6th PCT attack we contact the bank were

74
00:04:55,490 --> 00:05:00,370
given the information the bank has
trouble finding this loss the bank is in

75
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:03,430
a unique position where most of their
customers are other banks so they really

76
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:08,710
weren't prepared for this type of
incident they got DDoS attacks are

77
00:05:08,710 --> 00:05:11,419
probably next week and that was really
troubling for me to see because

78
00:05:11,419 --> 00:05:14,750
generally the length of the DDoS attack
directly pertain to the amount of funds

79
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:18,490
and after three days we were the longest
attack I'd seen so when four six or

80
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:21,910
seven we were a little worried every
little bit before that they called me

81
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:25,390
and said we found that it's big and
Switzerland so we work through with the

82
00:05:25,390 --> 00:05:28,659
money when we work with a Swiss police
will work with a victim and what we were

83
00:05:28,660 --> 00:05:33,330
able to do is get the person to receive
those funds arrested so in subsequent

84
00:05:33,330 --> 00:05:37,229
interviews with in partnership with your
account police we were able to figure

85
00:05:37,229 --> 00:05:41,380
out that this guy was kneeling large
sums of money for game over zoos and

86
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:44,969
other criminal organizations we were
actually able to get those funds

87
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,900
recovered and returned back to the
victim and that's one of the things that

88
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:51,250
was really unique about this
investigation was getting beyond being

89
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:54,220
behind the power curve in getting the
point that were actually able to stop

90
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,590
the frauds and relative real time and
getting recovered and passed out to the

91
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:01,090
victim and now mike

92
00:06:01,090 --> 00:06:08,969
alright I'm gonna talk about tu
operation both the structure of the

93
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:12,560
group but also some of the technical
aspects be behind him our itself

94
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,770
basically is uses existed for nearly a
decade and the first two versions that

95
00:06:18,770 --> 00:06:22,270
we distinguish although the first two
versions were basically the same just

96
00:06:22,270 --> 00:06:26,539
like in the evolution of the previous
version they were sold his kidney our

97
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:29,750
kid Miller means that you can actually
purchase it and set up on your own

98
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:36,010
servers and only meet require basically
Super Sport package to get the latest

99
00:06:36,010 --> 00:06:45,060
updates but in 2010 or through whose
nickname slavic he basically announced

100
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:50,200
that he wouldn't know long supported and
give support to other people so actually

101
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,240
what really happened he said he would
retire but what actually happened is

102
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,789
that he started to private branch and
not anymore so far but only as a kind of

103
00:06:58,789 --> 00:07:03,500
a managed service variant of Zeus and it
was known as murder fat and like

104
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:09,410
actually Zeus 2.1 was the version number
of using that version and started in

105
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:10,729
September 2010

106
00:07:10,729 --> 00:07:17,940
that was the lead up to what we know
it's going to be abused basically

107
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:22,460
zoos or game of reduced gamers use the
name comes from the command control

108
00:07:22,460 --> 00:07:29,520
channel using game over to PHP when they
when it started so essentially there was

109
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,669
a group of people who are actually using
the kit Mauer based it goes at least

110
00:07:33,669 --> 00:07:40,549
back to 2009 prior to that we not sure
or at least I'm not sure how it goes but

111
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:45,030
that group was using to keep power and
then they merged into the private miller

112
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:53,880
that was known as used to win 11 had a
number of features which were a lot of

113
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,860
unique to get a domain generation
algorithm to prevent taken activity or

114
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:03,440
to mitigate their regular expression
support in the weapons X 11 X on the

115
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:08,539
configuration format within juice and a
farming sector would like and that's a

116
00:08:08,539 --> 00:08:15,469
separate piece of malware but it was
very integrated so interesting

117
00:08:15,469 --> 00:08:20,090
technology dead person due to that
specific variant then you later in

118
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:27,929
September 11 2011 basically they
upgraded from this is 2.1 variant to

119
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:32,539
appear to be as use which internally is
known map as maps and version number

120
00:08:32,539 --> 00:08:35,620
thirteen had a number of earlier
versions which were just for development

121
00:08:35,620 --> 00:08:40,250
and testing initially dad had a
peer-to-peer network which is only

122
00:08:40,250 --> 00:08:45,800
designed to let the bad guys have
continued to have access to the system

123
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:49,050
even though all the other command
control systems in the back and was

124
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:55,229
disabled and it had traditional
communication with no DEP HDD

125
00:08:55,230 --> 00:09:01,430
php file the group actually that use
this was very focused on corporate

126
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:05,599
banking accounts while you see a lot of
banking now are typically consumer

127
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,250
accounts are more attractive because
there are many more

128
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:13,060
it's easier to random people use online
banking but these guys really focus on a

129
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:17,699
corporate banking accounts although they
also did consumer banking fraud and

130
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:22,030
other types of food like your card not
present individual operators also

131
00:09:22,030 --> 00:09:27,740
actually use it as a regular book meant
that as you know something to monetize

132
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:32,290
as as Max's maximizing profits basically
so they loaded other types of malware

133
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:37,520
like richard and what probably leave
many people knows that crippled Locker

134
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:42,790
was retribution was actually authored by
the same person that wrote to reduce

135
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:45,930
obviously it's

136
00:09:45,930 --> 00:09:49,239
quite special because criminal or
something you know when it comes in your

137
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:54,580
system you're obviously no one noticed
them out there and you won't be able to

138
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:59,420
you know you probably most people won't
start to do their banking when they get

139
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:08,219
their father talking about the group the
group basically has at least 5 years

140
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:15,050
experience that set a team it has
changed over time but it is existed at

141
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:22,060
the end basically as a diagram showed
over there five years of experience but

142
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:27,599
the individual operators have actually
worked for more than 10 years many cases

143
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:32,600
in the primary scene and most of them
are from Eastern Europe and Russia

144
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:40,830
Russia is the main group several people
from Ukraine as well there are two

145
00:10:40,830 --> 00:10:46,870
leaders and basically one of the leaders
of slavic was more involving a technical

146
00:10:46,870 --> 00:10:53,810
part in actually creating them our
setting up the backgrounds and managing

147
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:56,949
everything from a technical perspective
and other leaders and organizational

148
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:06,070
person involved in the actual money
moving and and and and recruitment so

149
00:11:06,070 --> 00:11:11,160
it's very typical like a normal
organization although people were not

150
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:14,560
just signed one rolls they had several
roles so it's not you cannot say exactly

151
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,400
the organization looks like this but it
had a support team with dedicated

152
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:24,600
support people third-party suppliers who
are supplying prime markets like black

153
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:31,720
hole spam botnets like got whale and
other services to just allowed you

154
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:38,160
affiliates we charge actual users to
increase their botnets or increase their

155
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,120
revenue

156
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:44,540
obviously there was immune network and
that was a large group of people there

157
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:48,339
was never coming they were trying to
recruit or trying to acquire as many as

158
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:52,490
possible so that many different
suppliers and yet very dedicated group

159
00:11:52,490 --> 00:11:55,470
of people

160
00:11:55,470 --> 00:12:00,500
opening large corporate accounts from
corporate accounts in places where you

161
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:05,920
can easily establish a business and a
business account typically like special

162
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:12,660
economic zones are free organizations in
total there were 27 different bodies and

163
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:18,740
we get to that later and 27 IDs means
that there were 27 different groups have

164
00:12:18,740 --> 00:12:25,500
seen more last 20 active different
affiliates which could be one individual

165
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:34,740
or an entire group of people this is a
screenshot from their internal system it

166
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:41,410
shows how many different people were
just involved in just the mewling part

167
00:12:41,410 --> 00:12:49,530
there is well over 50 people in total
within this group that you know there

168
00:12:49,530 --> 00:12:53,000
are some very special order some things
like for example new recruitment which

169
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:59,390
are quite delicate and difficult waste
to their difficult to get so there's a

170
00:12:59,390 --> 00:13:01,590
lot of people involved in that part

171
00:13:01,590 --> 00:13:07,330
looking at for example to technical part
the hosting so where did they get

172
00:13:07,330 --> 00:13:12,650
service this is changed over time but
especially in the last period the last

173
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:20,030
few years they had access to our hosting
provider at a very good system of having

174
00:13:20,030 --> 00:13:26,500
servers without an actual IP address
just in that block virtually and then

175
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:30,510
had virtually piece from completely
different ISP and routed through tunnels

176
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:35,640
to those servers so in case anyone would
take down D virtual IP addresses he

177
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:39,310
would just not around anymore but the
actual servers where the data was were

178
00:13:39,310 --> 00:13:42,579
safe because they were actually stored
in completely different location and

179
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:49,330
only the poster of that would know where
that data and physical service and

180
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:56,110
obviously very cooperated co-producing
closing down to protect all that we had

181
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:01,580
had a proxy servers both from the
command control channel which was in

182
00:14:01,580 --> 00:14:04,780
coming but also for protecting the

183
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:08,939
affiliates persons that actually commit
fraud they also did not actually

184
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:13,320
directly connected to back and so in
case some information leaked it would

185
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:19,100
only be a proxy IKEA not the actual
location of the back and looking

186
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:25,160
technically superior network to match
dad they didn't have a separate to

187
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:30,100
basically the builder and those of you
familiar with Zeus indicating our there

188
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:37,380
was a zoo builder which is a graphical
user interface to create like a building

189
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:42,930
and you compile the configuration to
binary format game for shoes had

190
00:14:42,930 --> 00:14:47,170
something along those lines he was
actually based on the old version but it

191
00:14:47,170 --> 00:14:51,270
was actually a command-line version but
they still call it exceeds so whose

192
00:14:51,270 --> 00:14:57,360
builder original building was also calls
it has been a key it was used to control

193
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,660
the network through private as a key we
presume that there is only one or maybe

194
00:15:02,660 --> 00:15:08,180
several people that had access to the
leader in later versions they actually

195
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:11,939
used his bill also to you debug to
peer-to-peer network by crawling a

196
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:18,400
network cable something probably done in
response to attempts to poison endeavor

197
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:29,260
to counter these attacks sexually
special debug debug builds on an hour

198
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:33,660
which had locked files of everything
that happened on the network layer and

199
00:15:33,660 --> 00:15:37,990
it would use for example Wireshark and
easy bills to figure out what people

200
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:44,650
that were poisoning computer network
were actually attempting to do is an

201
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:48,860
example of a package that would go over
lining was completely encrypted with

202
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:55,930
Iran over them however if you decrypted
package actually would end up with an

203
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:58,459
HDB package which had

204
00:15:58,460 --> 00:16:05,790
generique HP layout and important here
is that there is a next header which

205
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:10,560
actually specifies which both within the
peer-to-peer network and backgrounds

206
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:15,500
this boat and this communication
actually belongs to do so there was a

207
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:20,080
proxy which was also acting as a router
which routed packets to write back end

208
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:27,810
and then facilitated it wasn't only
regular communication is also in the

209
00:16:27,810 --> 00:16:34,319
configurations of the ball so hard to
explain all consider weapon jects but

210
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:39,430
the target pattern for example is
something that you need to know it's the

211
00:16:39,430 --> 00:16:44,930
target in this case macys.com but then
it also has ordered these statements so

212
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:51,030
in this case is only 17 2007 its shows
that this trip inject this specific

213
00:16:51,030 --> 00:16:55,089
statement is only applies to one partner
and that was needed because the

214
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:59,040
configuration was actually spread
through 20 peer-to-peer network so using

215
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:04,060
to build a wood uploaded uploaded
configuration but it would be the same

216
00:17:04,060 --> 00:17:09,589
configuration every system but in the
boat which had a body building or

217
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:14,230
rebuilding had to figure out which
configuration parts were applying to

218
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:22,089
death and involved were actually a large
number of commands saudis facilitated

219
00:17:22,089 --> 00:17:26,250
most C 24 purposes for example

220
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:32,770
which were both the regular browser
cookies Flash cookies but also

221
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:37,330
certificates and it could retrieve those
but also could delete those for example

222
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:41,810
if you had a session opened with a
website if you had a session cookie you

223
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:46,470
would not have to login so they removed
quickly so to force the victim to log

224
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:50,170
into the website and then the post a
logging would actually capture data

225
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:56,620
logging data using powerful additionally
the blocking of you or else that is to

226
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:58,540
facilitate for example

227
00:17:58,540 --> 00:18:06,560
videos part 2 50 victim was you know if
you do victim was a victim of fraud they

228
00:18:06,560 --> 00:18:09,580
would actually blocked a banking you're
also that the victim couldn't access to

229
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:15,449
banking in more interesting and eases
the highlighted ones in red and also

230
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:22,640
commands to search for files on the
system and it came to us that in 2012

231
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:29,710
2013 to have been working on searching
for specific information information

232
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:36,970
wasn't typical for financial it was
actually do political in nature and we

233
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:42,040
have some examples of go later but it
shows that there was something different

234
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:46,200
going on which was unusual compared to
everything else will be seen

235
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,570
financial measure space typical
espionage corporate espionage or

236
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:56,169
something for trading stock trading
information from companies have advanced

237
00:18:56,170 --> 00:19:01,250
knowledge of certain events you know
influences stock price but it was

238
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:04,180
something completely different you had
nothing to do with typical financial

239
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:09,570
marrow this hasn't been published before
and we have a lot of white paper out

240
00:19:09,570 --> 00:19:13,280
that should be out right now that
actually details

241
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:17,120
a lot of the information search keywords
and then you can read those and

242
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:25,800
translate them and be sure to highlight
several so there were there was one book

243
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:31,580
which was actually hidden from all the
other operators who appear to produce at

244
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:35,870
least most operators actually that
bought that I D did not exist in many of

245
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:36,860
the systems

246
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:40,320
but it would be was there and it did
have a back and it was actually and it

247
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:45,590
was targeting specifically Georgia and
Turkey and searching for things like you

248
00:19:45,590 --> 00:19:51,240
know Intelligence Agency names within
those countries information that country

249
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,549
or the government within a country would
have on russian specific russian things

250
00:19:56,549 --> 00:20:03,879
very interesting was the key words that
were in in Turkey which also involved in

251
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:07,929
the Syrian conflict which borders with
Turkey and recently was in the news with

252
00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:12,570
a lot of actually turkey become involved
in the Syrian conflict

253
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:16,830
you can see there are some interesting
keywords like Russia mercenary Syria so

254
00:20:16,830 --> 00:20:21,840
obviously you know someone wants to know
what kind of information to Turkish

255
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,780
government has on your knowledge has
about russian mercenaries fighting in

256
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:31,520
Syria then the botnet that was
struggling ukraine actually was a

257
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,950
separate botnet but opponent was first
used for financial fraud and then later

258
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:42,220
actually babe repurposed at botnet to go
to do DSP nice and actually that

259
00:20:42,220 --> 00:20:46,980
happened you know when to start of the
ukraine rushing recent refrain Russia

260
00:20:46,980 --> 00:20:52,500
Russian conflict basically they were
searching for only a limited number of

261
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:56,549
keywords which word the names of secret
documents or classified documents and

262
00:20:56,549 --> 00:21:02,929
the agency's decision to intelligence
agencies within russia ukraine so it was

263
00:21:02,929 --> 00:21:07,500
just an initial set of keywords while
the other two but that's all they both

264
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:12,230
met with Georgian Turkey had a number of
key words were so they had names of

265
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:22,100
people working at the intelligence
agencies also as keywords

266
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:28,639
so I'm introduced he's going to talk
about specifically you tackle that was

267
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:36,640
done on a peer-to-peer network and how
that actually worked ok thank you Mike

268
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:43,559
ok so before I go into the details here
and I just want to take a step back and

269
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:48,780
explain why it was necessary to attack
the spot on a technical level so it

270
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:52,820
should be pretty clear by now from ickes
analysis that this was a significant rat

271
00:21:52,820 --> 00:21:58,090
very well organized and I mean this
entire infrastructure was built to be

272
00:21:58,090 --> 00:21:59,039
under strict

273
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:04,379
indestructible more or less so you can
ask the question why would somebody be

274
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:09,590
so crazy try to try to take this over or
take this down

275
00:22:09,590 --> 00:22:15,860
well the answer to that question is will
later talked about the legal part of

276
00:22:15,860 --> 00:22:23,590
this operation it's very risky in a way
if you only if you don't combine illegal

277
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:27,309
operation with the technical operation
because what we have seen in the past is

278
00:22:27,309 --> 00:22:31,480
that when the bad guys when they realize
that they've been investigated they

279
00:22:31,480 --> 00:22:38,110
tried to destroy evidence and all these
variants including this one here they

280
00:22:38,110 --> 00:22:42,689
have a command it wasn't a slider that
my shoulder area they have they have two

281
00:22:42,690 --> 00:22:47,860
commands one is called OS kill and
destroy they are very destructive

282
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:52,860
commands and they can be used to
basically brigham machines drying

283
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:58,809
machine and infected machine so we
anticipated or assumed that if this

284
00:22:58,809 --> 00:23:03,049
legal operation started and they they
realize that they would probably try to

285
00:23:03,049 --> 00:23:09,049
destroy some machines so we said we need
to make sure that that can't happen we

286
00:23:09,049 --> 00:23:13,700
need to make sure that we control the
command channel of the botnet and that

287
00:23:13,700 --> 00:23:20,360
you know the body but operators are not
able to issue so I mean that's easier

288
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:23,590
said than done especially for like these
dynamic

289
00:23:23,590 --> 00:23:30,360
but that's like this one here but I'm
going to explain how we achieve that and

290
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:35,279
for you to understand how we did that
it's necessary that we talked a little

291
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:42,539
bit about be in infrastructure first so
game over this actually follows the very

292
00:23:42,539 --> 00:23:48,740
popular concept or idea we have seen
that in abundance as well not very many

293
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:53,159
but the CREM della CREM so to speak to
the more sophisticated but they all use

294
00:23:53,159 --> 00:23:58,039
this kind of apology the bottom layer
that you see on the slide you that is

295
00:23:58,039 --> 00:24:02,570
the p2p networks so every infected
machine stores the list of neighbor

296
00:24:02,570 --> 00:24:07,149
nodes that it talks to all the other
infected machines the subset and

297
00:24:07,149 --> 00:24:10,629
disorganized self-organizing their
updated all the time you talk to each

298
00:24:10,630 --> 00:24:18,049
other much like in those p2p
file-sharing networks ok and the gang

299
00:24:18,049 --> 00:24:22,820
they could use this p2p network to
propagate binary updates configuration

300
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:28,730
updates and they did that all the time
but it's more convenient to operate but

301
00:24:28,730 --> 00:24:31,659
not when you have a centralized
command-and-control infrastructure you

302
00:24:31,659 --> 00:24:39,630
want to have the centralized that you
can log into you know it's so what what

303
00:24:39,630 --> 00:24:44,029
most of these partners do is they have
centralized around top usually hidden

304
00:24:44,029 --> 00:24:48,490
behind proxy so that the red dot said
you see here on this slide those are

305
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:50,820
proxies we call them

306
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:55,360
principal servers and behind that you
have the actual back and system which is

307
00:24:55,360 --> 00:25:02,979
usually more than just one computer so
you can see these these white nodes in

308
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:06,120
the p2p network those are special nodes
and we'll talk a little bit more about

309
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:11,879
that in a second any pure that is
publicly reachable and you can imagine

310
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:16,539
these days most infected machines are
behind some sort of firewall or not so

311
00:25:16,539 --> 00:25:20,350
you cannot directly talk to them but
some of them are publicly reachable and

312
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:24,969
they actually have a more prominent role
in the network we call them proxy nodes

313
00:25:24,970 --> 00:25:31,470
because they take messages and translate
them into the HTTP protocol that mike

314
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:37,769
was showing and that is in San upstream
to the command control back so that is

315
00:25:37,769 --> 00:25:44,669
the infrastructure and in order to
attack this we had to understand the

316
00:25:44,669 --> 00:25:47,710
inner workings of the protocol of the
peer-to-peer protocol the custom

317
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:53,059
protocol that these guys created we're
not gonna go into too much detail here

318
00:25:53,059 --> 00:25:57,610
just to give you an overview these other
protocol primitives you could request

319
00:25:57,610 --> 00:26:03,029
and other peers version reply with this
version number the purpose of this is

320
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:07,960
another machine is running a more
up-to-date consecration version for

321
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:11,600
example you could request from from it
and then that's how information

322
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:16,549
propagating the p2p network and then the
two highlighted in red here goes up

323
00:26:16,549 --> 00:26:21,600
euless requests and replies to those
other messages that are responsible for

324
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,600
dynamic updates off neighbor list of
piano the list at at the infected

325
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:33,939
machines and I think I'm gonna skip the
other ones ABC 6 and 50 those message

326
00:26:33,940 --> 00:26:39,679
types they are for announcements of
these white nodes the proxy proxy notes

327
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:49,049
because i'm ok so this is what it looks
like on the wire we already decrypted

328
00:26:49,049 --> 00:26:52,590
that for you so you're looking at the
wrong by its present a binary protocol

329
00:26:52,590 --> 00:26:54,439
so you won't see any text in here

330
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:59,149
but the information that highlighted in
blue that's what you see at the top of

331
00:26:59,149 --> 00:27:03,928
the slide so there is the type the type
number two is a request they have some

332
00:27:03,929 --> 00:27:11,059
random padding just 24 signature-based
detection detection two things are

333
00:27:11,059 --> 00:27:17,940
interesting are the other two fields
here every infected machine has a unique

334
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:23,990
pseudo-random I D it's this has that you
can see here the body actually comes in

335
00:27:23,990 --> 00:27:27,440
handy when you try to estimate the size
of the boat that if you have access to

336
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:31,919
this information you can just collect
these bodies and then count the number

337
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:37,509
of infected machines and there's also
the SessionID and the purpose of that I

338
00:27:37,509 --> 00:27:42,509
think that makes sense when you look at
the next light so the next slide is the

339
00:27:42,509 --> 00:27:47,039
respective playlist responds and that
has to have the same SessionID as the

340
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:52,110
request by this they make sure this is
just one of many examples how they

341
00:27:52,110 --> 00:27:56,500
hardened their custom protocol they make
sure that you cannot send unsolicited

342
00:27:56,500 --> 00:28:01,409
response to an infected machine
otherwise if they wouldn't have that

343
00:28:01,409 --> 00:28:05,460
that machine would just take the
response and maybe you know at these

344
00:28:05,460 --> 00:28:10,909
piers to its local list and there will
be an angle for poisoning attack what we

345
00:28:10,909 --> 00:28:13,850
call the poisoning attacks they want to
avoid that they want to make sure that

346
00:28:13,850 --> 00:28:20,918
and he responds has to match and that's
what these sessions and well in this

347
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:24,840
case here we're not showing the binary
data we already passe that so you can

348
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:31,590
see the pillars contains consists of
entries that have the body about 1890

349
00:28:31,590 --> 00:28:39,259
addressing a port the port or UDP ports
the protocol UDP base which is standard

350
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:44,160
and fairly fairly common with protocols
so

351
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:50,000
knowing how on a high level how this all
p2p protocol works how can you use that

352
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:54,670
in an attack because the challenge
obviously is the distributed

353
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:59,200
infrastructure here in a centralized but
net you would just take out the central

354
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:03,200
command control so that doesn't really
exist here or if you would take it out

355
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:08,370
the bad guys can easily reintroduce one
using peer-to-peer technology so in this

356
00:29:08,370 --> 00:29:12,409
case we actually we have to attack the
p2p live so how do you do that with the

357
00:29:12,410 --> 00:29:16,780
information that we just talked about
all the goal is we want to isolate all

358
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:20,100
the infected machines destroy all the
links between those machines so they

359
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:25,280
cannot talk to each other anymore and
instead introduce our own notes as the

360
00:29:25,280 --> 00:29:30,780
only players that those machines gun can
talk to a know about so essentially 12

361
00:29:30,780 --> 00:29:37,129
and this is just an example picture here
so when you look at this as a graph you

362
00:29:37,130 --> 00:29:40,950
basically want to remove all these edges
between the nodes and introduce new ones

363
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:45,640
and also introduced the white machine
here so that's a machine that we control

364
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:50,410
and basically turn the distributed p2p
network backed into a centralized one

365
00:29:50,410 --> 00:29:57,260
that can easily be control ok so we
would call this white thing here we

366
00:29:57,260 --> 00:30:05,280
would call that a single and in reality
you have more so

367
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:11,520
when you do this what does an infected
machines see on this slide you see the

368
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:16,560
local populace of an infected machine
these are appears neighbors that knows

369
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:20,720
about that I can talk to and essentially
what we want to do is we want to turn

370
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:27,130
this into something like this so this is
a poison pill list of legitimate entries

371
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:31,350
are removed and we introduced to that
are pointing to 22 sinkholes obviously

372
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:35,860
these IP addresses are not real example
addresses but this is essentially what

373
00:30:35,860 --> 00:30:39,969
we want to achieve and we can do that by
exploiting certain weaknesses in the p2p

374
00:30:39,970 --> 00:30:51,900
protocol and manipulating of Appeals so
let's take a step back again so if you

375
00:30:51,900 --> 00:30:55,590
are able to do this if you're able to
attack the p2p network you're able to

376
00:30:55,590 --> 00:31:00,949
sing call it introduced Iran peer to
peer destroy all the other links

377
00:31:00,950 --> 00:31:05,140
what does that mean for the body is the
bottom our system still able to push to

378
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:07,730
announce the answers

379
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:13,420
unfortunately yes because the command
channel the actual command channel is on

380
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:16,770
top of the peer-to-peer network is an
overlay network it's an additional

381
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:22,600
network on top of this so let's assume
we manipulated the bottom layer here we

382
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:29,540
control that this green dashed line that
is how appeared talks to the to the back

383
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:33,180
and it would reach out to one of its
proxy note the white ones and that would

384
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:38,580
then translate the message into a nation
ended up upstream so even if you think

385
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:43,610
all the ppl air this would be possible
and that's of course bad because if if

386
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:47,189
that is possible but most attention you
know pushed an update

387
00:31:47,190 --> 00:31:53,200
somehow tried to mitigate or attack and
the effort would be pointless so we have

388
00:31:53,200 --> 00:32:01,160
to make sure that we control this this
channel year as well and well it's

389
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:05,150
essentially a very similar attack
because this is another beautiful air on

390
00:32:05,150 --> 00:32:12,620
top of the other ppl so it's a very
similar attack before I

391
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:17,290
explained how we thought we did that
attack that there I have to talk a

392
00:32:17,290 --> 00:32:21,210
little bit more about these proxy notes
the white bones what you see at the

393
00:32:21,210 --> 00:32:26,050
bottom of the slide here is the red
machine that was I think I was so sad in

394
00:32:26,050 --> 00:32:29,409
the Netherlands and that machine most
part of an automated process this

395
00:32:29,410 --> 00:32:35,490
machine would constantly monitor the
health status of the botnet another time

396
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:39,300
the number of what the white notes the
proxy knows because the worst thing that

397
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:43,610
can happen is that there are no white
proxy nodes in the network anymore

398
00:32:43,610 --> 00:32:46,860
because that would mean that the
machines couldn't be

399
00:32:46,860 --> 00:32:52,969
or command it anymore so if that number
would drop below a certain threshold Red

400
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:58,880
Machine would automatically promote
either infected machines to new proxies

401
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:03,610
to new white notes and it would do that
by providing it with a signed

402
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:07,020
message----- an announcement the red one
and the white machine would then take

403
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:14,370
this message and propagated in the p2p
network to announce itself so yeah and

404
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:19,580
then also every infected machine
regardless of whether they're the white

405
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:24,389
ones of three months so any infected
machine maintains a list of up to 20

406
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:30,610
proxies just back up and one of those
will be the active proxy so if that

407
00:33:30,610 --> 00:33:34,689
active proxy for some reason would
become unreachable detecting machine

408
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:39,200
would switch over to one of the other
ones so all goal of course was to poison

409
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:44,550
this list the proxy list if you will
poison that as well kill all the

410
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:49,909
legitimate entries and introduce our
point is to machines that we control and

411
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:54,679
you can do that by making sure that none
of the proxies respond anymore and then

412
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:56,540
you introduce your own one

413
00:33:56,540 --> 00:34:01,680
and that would then costs which to your
proxy that did require some

414
00:34:01,680 --> 00:34:07,380
collaboration with with ISPs because
they had to we were not able to promote

415
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:12,160
ourselves to practice of it they had to
provide us with machines that used to be

416
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,129
proxies in the past

417
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:22,590
at that time so these guys were really
smart I mean they designed a pretty

418
00:34:22,590 --> 00:34:28,970
sophisticated but that so they said okay
even if you know despite all these how

419
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:33,230
to measure it might still be possible
that somebody manages to poison the

420
00:34:33,230 --> 00:34:36,570
network so what do we do it if that
happens and they introduced the backup

421
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:41,270
channel and it's that is distant ugh and
also DA's dance for domain generation

422
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:46,630
algorithm I think Mike mentioned it on
one of the slides briefly so what does

423
00:34:46,630 --> 00:34:56,290
it every week it generates one thousand
domains to randomly and if conductivity

424
00:34:56,290 --> 00:35:03,560
with a good job it would then consulted
eg a result the domains go to that IP

425
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:07,930
address and we'll get back and download
the new CD dealers with fresh fresh set

426
00:35:07,930 --> 00:35:13,169
of peers they use six different
top-level domains to suffer until these

427
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:20,510
for their domains that use condo.com
orkut net is in info there are based in

428
00:35:20,510 --> 00:35:25,350
the USA and with some collaboration with
the takeover was possible to make sure

429
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:29,549
that nobody could register this domain
anymore why we're doing the operation

430
00:35:29,550 --> 00:35:38,960
the takeover but also don't are you
showing the picture we opted for the

431
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:45,070
Safeway and registered all these demands
for a certain time window and I know

432
00:35:45,070 --> 00:35:49,610
several hundred to make sure that those
are not available to the bottom i say

433
00:35:49,610 --> 00:35:50,030
more

434
00:35:50,030 --> 00:35:54,880
ok so

435
00:35:54,880 --> 00:36:00,960
how do you combine these things in an
attack so leaving the DGA backup

436
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,869
genocide that was taken care off this is
what about the healthy but it looks like

437
00:36:04,869 --> 00:36:10,769
the first thing we wanted to do was we
wanted to control the command and

438
00:36:10,769 --> 00:36:14,419
control channel for the one that the
channel it was used to push demands that

439
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:18,450
was the most important thing so the
first thing we did was to control of

440
00:36:18,450 --> 00:36:22,419
some of the property notes here so the
blue ones those were controlled by us

441
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:28,029
and then we burned a centralized
infrastructure you we killed those those

442
00:36:28,029 --> 00:36:33,049
principles service here one was located
in Canada and the other one was in the

443
00:36:33,049 --> 00:36:37,980
ukraine they were taken down in the same
time in a coordinated effort and that

444
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:43,200
men that none of the viewers could talk
to their active proxies anymore they

445
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:46,078
wouldn't be able to reach the back
anymore and then they would search for

446
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:51,009
new proxy and eventually end up at one
of the blue notes that we control so

447
00:36:51,009 --> 00:36:58,650
that China was already blocked now it's
still possible to hook into the network

448
00:36:58,650 --> 00:37:02,279
and propagated a binary operator
configuration update and propagate their

449
00:37:02,279 --> 00:37:07,390
network so we had to singled out as well
that later and that's what we did so we

450
00:37:07,390 --> 00:37:13,410
introduce our own peer and then over
time slowly degenerated into this and at

451
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:20,359
this point we had full control over it
and we still do today

452
00:37:20,359 --> 00:37:27,710
alright so thank you

453
00:37:27,710 --> 00:37:33,849
so these are some stats restore from
shadow server who gratefully sported the

454
00:37:33,849 --> 00:37:39,680
entire operation image on the top that
shows an infection that you can see that

455
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,740
basically any developed country
infections what's more important to

456
00:37:44,740 --> 00:37:50,500
graphic the bottom on the day when we
did the takeover we started out I think

457
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:54,390
something like three hundred and fifty
thousand unique IP addresses I have to

458
00:37:54,390 --> 00:38:01,319
explain this group here try to keep the
number of infections around 200,000 and

459
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:06,970
also important to realize that unique IP
addresses in let's say a 24 hour time

460
00:38:06,970 --> 00:38:11,799
period doesn't mean there are so many
infected machines you have to take a

461
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:17,869
look at the bodies but what you can see
here is that there are still you compare

462
00:38:17,869 --> 00:38:23,560
the numbers from yesterday that's right
hand and of the graph to the numbers

463
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:27,790
from when we did the operation that
still 10% infected machines left I mean

464
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:33,029
it's good that they're that 90% have
been remediated cleaned up and I know

465
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:37,500
the systems have been reinstalled or
whatever and we also have to thank AV

466
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:42,830
day they did a tremendous job they
provide a removal tools and probably

467
00:38:42,830 --> 00:38:46,170
some of these machines have been cleaned
up using these tools but they're still

468
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:52,589
10% left which means we have to keep
this up as long as necessary and with

469
00:38:52,589 --> 00:38:57,440
that before I handed back over to Elliot
and you will talk about the legal part

470
00:38:57,440 --> 00:39:10,589
of the investigation the question has
just been handed over to you

471
00:39:10,589 --> 00:39:19,299
so wanna talk to you for just a little
bit about what some of the evidence look

472
00:39:19,299 --> 00:39:23,759
like it we collected on the scoop one of
the first things we noticed as they were

473
00:39:23,759 --> 00:39:28,319
running a version of black hole black
hole version they were running 20 back

474
00:39:28,319 --> 00:39:32,920
to something called an iframe checker or
I for check we were able to get access

475
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:37,249
to some of our partnerships with
industry to some back end page is

476
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:42,459
revealing useful nicknames for a slight
changes dead at relax man which at least

477
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:45,539
give us an idea who you know who we look
at who are the people on the forums are

478
00:39:45,539 --> 00:39:50,450
doing us where they at they brought
everything in-house so it was very

479
00:39:50,450 --> 00:39:53,999
unique is might mention of this group as
they looked at it from the outside like

480
00:39:53,999 --> 00:39:57,999
it when organized crime operation they
owned every part it put everything under

481
00:39:57,999 --> 00:39:59,029
one roof

482
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:04,630
very very good for them standpoint very
good for US law enforcement standpoint I

483
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:08,869
want to share just a little bit here you
see starting from this moment all drop

484
00:40:08,869 --> 00:40:13,339
managers with him we're working are now
working through this panel right this

485
00:40:13,339 --> 00:40:17,190
panel being the Business Club which is
one of their principal servers they were

486
00:40:17,190 --> 00:40:21,549
running so what are the Business Club
look like we have logins special

487
00:40:21,549 --> 00:40:26,788
temperatures login were able to tie back
to Bogut shelf we started doing searches

488
00:40:26,789 --> 00:40:31,410
of email addresses discovering
references to Business Club we started

489
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:38,049
seeing them exchanging emails with
business card accounts and one of the

490
00:40:38,049 --> 00:40:41,940
really great things they did was keep a
very accurate list of all the fraud so

491
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:46,539
there's a larger systems have been
charged in this was on another server

492
00:40:46,539 --> 00:40:49,849
hosted on business club called this
visit Coast weekend in this lecture

493
00:40:49,849 --> 00:40:53,739
system kept track of every fraud what
the bank account was who the victim was

494
00:40:53,739 --> 00:40:57,160
who was responsible for arranging the
drops who's cashing it out and it was

495
00:40:57,160 --> 00:41:00,348
reassuring us to find the victims that
we knew I have appeared on this charge

496
00:41:00,349 --> 00:41:04,269
this was really good evidence and gave
us great in decide into how quickly they

497
00:41:04,269 --> 00:41:09,689
operated how much money they were making
so how do we figure out who these guys

498
00:41:09,690 --> 00:41:14,969
are well fortunately fortunately they're
criminals all the time so one of the

499
00:41:14,969 --> 00:41:18,239
things we try to do as law enforcement
is work ourselves or we can kind of

500
00:41:18,239 --> 00:41:21,420
attack those seams between their
personal life and their criminal life

501
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:22,570
and fortunately

502
00:41:22,570 --> 00:41:27,540
mister bogus have fond user of the PM's
like to use the same bpm the login some

503
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:30,650
of his personal counts as you would
administrate the back end of some of

504
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:38,340
these servers now just criminal means
alone were unable to attain the results

505
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:42,400
we wanted in fact to do the takeover the
Tillman described previously required

506
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:46,510
really really complex use of the civil
statutes here in the USA a great team

507
00:41:46,510 --> 00:41:50,610
from doj system Inis but you know we
weren't able to just say this is a crime

508
00:41:50,610 --> 00:41:53,890
when you finish we actually had to take
this into a civil court room get in

509
00:41:53,890 --> 00:41:57,910
front of the judge and basic explain
what was going on order him to cease

510
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:02,740
activity get approval to start up the
servers are we wanted to do some other

511
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:05,330
process to make sure we could receive
the communications and control

512
00:42:05,330 --> 00:42:08,600
everything was passing back and forth
the idea being we didn't want the

513
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:12,400
victims traffic to make its way out on
the internet we didn't want to see these

514
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:15,640
people continue to be victimized and we
certainly didn't want to leave open the

515
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:19,520
possibility that either the actors can
choose to destroy the users computers or

516
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,240
push crypto locker on them

517
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:23,819
encrypting their sister you know the
computer is effectively doing the same

518
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:35,910
thing this is our friend so far and if
cats I know many of us are so nice young

519
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:45,200
ladies with and he also loves aquatic
life this is his boat and this is where

520
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,100
you win money

521
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:53,960
surprise today is the highest award ever
offered for cybercriminals $3,000,000

522
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:57,600
information leading to his arrest and we
chose to go this route instead of

523
00:42:57,600 --> 00:43:00,710
waiting instead of letting him continue
to victimize people for a couple of

524
00:43:00,710 --> 00:43:04,190
years hoping you'd go somewhere to get
out of that would put the case out there

525
00:43:04,190 --> 00:43:07,530
we put the evidence out there would
publicize this we tell you who he was

526
00:43:07,530 --> 00:43:11,630
and we hope that some of his friends
back home visit us so that we can make

527
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:18,210
them very very wealthy why does this
matter so quick story I told you earlier

528
00:43:18,210 --> 00:43:22,580
about some of the work we did to
proactively try to get ahead of the

529
00:43:22,580 --> 00:43:27,390
frauds to recover the Hans to work to
get a slower merely reacting to these

530
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:31,040
frauds we can better protect USA and
international victims from these

531
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:35,250
large-scale account takeover fraud
because you know a lot of $10,000 may

532
00:43:35,250 --> 00:43:39,140
not be too much money loss of a million
two million five million six point nine

533
00:43:39,140 --> 00:43:42,089
million dollars is the kind of thing
that can bankrupt the company and we

534
00:43:42,090 --> 00:43:44,140
absolutely want to see that happen

535
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:51,680
starting about October November of 2012
2013 excuse me leading into our takeover

536
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:53,759
which happened June 2014

537
00:43:53,760 --> 00:43:58,780
up until dire and dry Dec started coming
online and especially dire so now we're

538
00:43:58,780 --> 00:44:05,620
in we saw Sprague's starting September
October 2015 we had one year in the USA

539
00:44:05,620 --> 00:44:10,299
and senior large account takeover fraud
so you know I think we showed us as we

540
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:14,000
absolutely can disrupt these operations
are important but can only be done in

541
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,950
concert with private industry

542
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:21,040
law enforcement international partners
all working together at one time so we

543
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:24,890
want to do now is take some questions
from you guys we've got a central

544
00:44:24,890 --> 00:44:29,440
microphone right there we got about five
minutes left so we'd love to hear from

545
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:36,620
you all you want to know

546
00:44:36,620 --> 00:44:51,270
that shows the number of infections
there these intermittent dips all the

547
00:44:51,270 --> 00:45:00,190
way down to the chart those
representative of common during the

548
00:45:00,190 --> 00:45:04,570
apparent that you see in computers are
turned off overnight and then weekends

549
00:45:04,570 --> 00:45:09,010
and so on so this is a very very common
pattern that you see when you track

550
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:17,230
whatever network and if you ask a
question we actually have some patches

551
00:45:17,230 --> 00:45:21,370
for you from our armored vests we we're
so we ask when is run up here and we'll

552
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:28,450
give you one question next these guys
have any connection to DTE or DCE or

553
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:33,129
some of the other financial extortion
groups that are happening right now no I

554
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:43,140
wouldn't say they do how was your
experience with russian law enforcement

555
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:49,799
agencies because according to create
apps their internet basically their

556
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:55,700
imperial we talk to them we continue to
talk to them would love to see some

557
00:45:55,700 --> 00:46:07,270
cooperation you know that spreads my
second say sorry legal concerns other

558
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:15,160
researchers trying to the same things
involving control servers to be

559
00:46:15,160 --> 00:46:22,410
so go find your local field office law
enforcement agency tell me you want to

560
00:46:22,410 --> 00:46:25,899
do partner often mean every country's
got different laws when you start doing

561
00:46:25,900 --> 00:46:30,120
things in places gets incredibly tricky
i think is a really important area to

562
00:46:30,120 --> 00:46:34,720
grow and be just have to be very careful
you know and I think we're the best ways

563
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:38,740
jump on the task force's when your local
le agencies and find out there working

564
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:45,479
on and go after to make sense maybe to
add to that I mean in my experience

565
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:49,650
people who are researching the same
topics they tend to gravitate gravitate

566
00:46:49,650 --> 00:46:54,390
towards each other we knew it was
working on this I mean it's perfectly

567
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:58,660
possible that somebody else was doing
their research in their basement but I

568
00:46:58,660 --> 00:47:02,350
think we had a pretty good idea of who
else was tracking and researching this

569
00:47:02,350 --> 00:47:08,750
and the coordinate with these people
while you were working on this how much

570
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:13,390
other stuff was happening that was
successful and being not successfully

571
00:47:13,390 --> 00:47:18,069
pursued by your organization or others
in this is a big successful visible

572
00:47:18,070 --> 00:47:22,270
activity but I also wonder how much was
still going on even while you were doing

573
00:47:22,270 --> 00:47:30,400
this I think it's hard to say hundreds
of operators into space and all of our

574
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:34,750
small but this was one group that was
because of the targeting of corporate

575
00:47:34,750 --> 00:47:40,300
accounts too had a huge financial impact
over years think it wasn't specifically

576
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:48,420
mentioned but within us' estimates are
on one billion but it targeted Asia and

577
00:47:48,420 --> 00:47:55,410
basically everywhere there were attacks
and they would would actually run their

578
00:47:55,410 --> 00:48:00,470
operations 24 hours so it was you know
it started in the morning in Australia

579
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:02,308
and went on to the

580
00:48:02,309 --> 00:48:08,549
the late afternoon in USO it was always
busy and obviously they made a lot of

581
00:48:08,549 --> 00:48:15,170
impact but it's even possible to just
quantified which cited wonderful how

582
00:48:15,170 --> 00:48:22,989
much activity varies but it's only one
group there are more so quick question

583
00:48:22,989 --> 00:48:27,049
with slovak now being heavily wanted do
you think that you'll start seeing him

584
00:48:27,049 --> 00:48:30,269
running an operation this size again or
do you think he's gonna go try and do

585
00:48:30,269 --> 00:48:31,390
something else

586
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:35,410
yes it was a question right and we do
this and he'd pop right back up what one

587
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:39,078
of the reasons we burned his nicknames
and his presence and everything else was

588
00:48:39,079 --> 00:48:41,689
to try to make it that much harder to
the criminal ecosystems really

589
00:48:41,689 --> 00:48:45,779
interesting and he's a liability now to
any group egos and works with so we're

590
00:48:45,779 --> 00:48:49,849
worried about that I'm sure he's
probably not leaving a great life right

591
00:48:49,849 --> 00:48:56,599
now but we haven't he's not on my radar
popping up to anything yet that question

592
00:48:56,599 --> 00:49:00,309
because it's an important one and I want
to stress again how important it is to

593
00:49:00,309 --> 00:49:06,180
combine a technical with illegal
operation i mean we've been taken over

594
00:49:06,180 --> 00:49:09,578
by the nets in the past without
involving law enforcement and what we

595
00:49:09,579 --> 00:49:14,009
suppose we learn from these cases is
that they can recreate But Nets and we

596
00:49:14,009 --> 00:49:17,959
took over within 20 minutes so without
involving law enforcement it's more this

597
00:49:17,959 --> 00:49:23,089
point we know that these days

598
00:49:23,089 --> 00:49:26,369
type of law enforcement perspective
you're dealing with hundreds of

599
00:49:26,369 --> 00:49:32,119
thousands of us' computers was there any
particular method was a trail near kind

600
00:49:32,119 --> 00:49:37,619
of way of figuring out how to deal with
PII PII indicators and things like that

601
00:49:37,619 --> 00:49:41,489
yes I'd love to spend a lifetime
basically we chose to get a pen register

602
00:49:41,489 --> 00:49:45,759
to drop any PII we didn't retain its we
didn't have to get approval to do a

603
00:49:45,759 --> 00:49:49,079
wiretapped in order to have all that
information so we had to carefully

604
00:49:49,079 --> 00:49:53,249
tailor how we ran the sinkhole to make
sure we weren't dealing with that answer

605
00:49:53,249 --> 00:49:58,709
your question it does yes we've gotta
stop now I'm gonna go we have a boost

606
00:49:58,709 --> 00:50:02,149
the bureau's got a boot would love to
resign you all up I'm going over there

607
00:50:02,150 --> 00:50:04,890
to get some more questions and if you
ask us a question please come up with a

608
00:50:04,890 --> 00:50:06,089
patch for you thank you very much
