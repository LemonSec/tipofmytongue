1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,919
from false positives to actionable
analysis behavioral intrusion detection

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,510
machine learning and the stock pipe with
Joseph sign please make sure that your

3
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:12,840
cell phones are turned off silent or on
vibrate we do not need to hear ringtone

4
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:22,880
thank you

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,579
thanks for coming in the table here's a
little long when did the white paper

6
00:00:28,579 --> 00:00:32,579
that that accompanies the talk is called
defensive scale building I central

7
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:37,890
nervous system to the sock and I think
that's the main takeaway wanna leave you

8
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:41,640
guys with today is is just basically
work we've been doing last few years

9
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,550
taking the latest in a distributed
architectures and and blending it with

10
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:50,610
with cyber security analytics

11
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:55,339
the goal is to kind of go through my
research background give a brief intro

12
00:00:55,339 --> 00:01:00,589
and then dive into little bit like
business language basically a type used

13
00:01:00,589 --> 00:01:06,020
to help communicate data science ideas
across interdisciplinary teams and it

14
00:01:06,020 --> 00:01:10,580
really does try to communicate complex
ideas to business stakeholders and

15
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:14,658
people who write the check at the end of
the day and also dive into kind of like

16
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:19,970
the open source communities version of a
really cool computing architecture

17
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:28,119
called a land architecture so and just
kind of give you like to have a level

18
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:32,310
said it was working on the slides that
the company that we are doing all this

19
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:35,780
work forecast be that was was acquired
by sparks are sort of REE REE

20
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:45,359
appropriate all this content and try to
make everything consistent so just so

21
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:49,949
just starting to get a little set on it
and how I got here and why I think

22
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,759
artificial intelligence and cyber
security is such an interesting problem

23
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:59,039
from a security perspective I was I was
playing around with John the Ripper lot

24
00:01:59,039 --> 00:01:59,770
crack

25
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:04,139
fifteen years ago first DEFCON I ever
tell it was DEFCON aid and and I went to

26
00:02:04,139 --> 00:02:09,220
a talk by a guy named i John Erickson he
wrote our expectation gave a really

27
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:13,450
crazy talk call that number theory
complexity theory cryptography and

28
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:16,739
quantum computing and it's just it was
just as they could survive I was very

29
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:22,140
impressionable at that age and it just
it's sort of plan this year as a young

30
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:25,670
researcher i've i've been trying to
understand like the security community

31
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:30,059
and answer the deaths of the
interdisciplinary nature of some of the

32
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:33,420
really cool research that you guys do
and so I think I think it's basically

33
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:35,670
just kind of standing cool security
problems

34
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:41,819
has her let me down this was reared
research bath so why is kind of

35
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:45,380
interested in securing as a hobby was
working on a network operations center

36
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:50,239
as building tools like em RTG first
generation and Ms systems like as using

37
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:56,050
like HP OpenView CiscoWorks in what
we're doing a lot of layer to profiling

38
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:59,690
up switched and routing traffic and
kinda protocol base lining stuff like

39
00:02:59,690 --> 00:03:07,609
that and and so when I R streets exposed
to machine learning was really was more

40
00:03:07,610 --> 00:03:10,700
49 physics

41
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:16,079
the dynamics of certain processes that
occur in physics and so and so here in

42
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,680
the sliders that there's a few kinda
time series of the chaotic effects that

43
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:27,310
that that we're starting out really
large scales and we're using just some

44
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:32,810
different techniques one of their
standard tools machine learning learning

45
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:36,239
tool set for instance really using a
Markov chain Monte Carlo to make

46
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,049
predictions on on on sir different
physical models one of the models I was

47
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:44,970
most interested in was most interesting
to me that kinda like let me down a

48
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,799
rabbit hole towards Kennedy fence in
artificial intelligence was it was a

49
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:51,870
monoculture casick fast IMO

50
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:59,799
dynamo is is described in kind of the
middle picture here as if if if we

51
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:06,549
understand this toy model for the Dynamo
dynamos is is a is a fluid that that

52
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:10,820
that moves in the earth scored sort of
more than iron and and and the dynamos

53
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:15,600
basically the effect that generated by
the superfluid moving and generating a

54
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,260
magnetic field so they're able to kind
of predict the properties of this

55
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:24,849
evolution of this fluid what we can make
predictions on when the first goal is

56
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:28,789
going to shift and and this actually as
pretty deep implications for like

57
00:04:28,789 --> 00:04:30,700
climate change

58
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:35,909
and and a long-term macro like like
macro- scopic US tax that impact our

59
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:40,960
whole earth and so it kind of became a
really interesting question like how far

60
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:47,810
can machine learning get us in terms of
predicting like Black Swan major outlier

61
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:51,990
events like when when the next cash
rates go ahead and that's just sort of

62
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:56,980
interesting question that I started
learning more about and then I started

63
00:04:56,980 --> 00:05:00,860
studying climate change to an inmate my
my my advisor at the time show me this

64
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:05,310
graph shows you basically modeling we're
using machine learning to help us make

65
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:09,450
predictions about future future climate
evolution and he kinda pointed out this

66
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:13,680
graph which is it's a pretty pretty
morbid in some sense but this is a graph

67
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:17,260
of extinction in intensity per species
overtime for the last like half a

68
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:22,000
billion years on planet earth and in the
five annotated events are so the five

69
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,800
labeled extinction events where that the
Topeak here we've seen like think

70
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:32,250
there's there's one like large period of
heightened volcanic activity along time

71
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:39,540
ago where 95% of all unique species are
wiped out and and I don't know I just

72
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:43,410
it's sort of a weird weird connection to
make to these sort of look longer term

73
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:48,340
are studying these phenomena and using
the tools of a lot of time series

74
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:52,900
prediction tools and other kind of
machine learning methods to help us make

75
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,719
predictions on a nun really big
questions and eventually as he was led

76
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,130
to see how researchers in cyber satirist
grabbing some of these tools and

77
00:06:02,130 --> 00:06:07,440
applying them to really you know really
interesting use cases so I'm kind of

78
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,520
dive into the the cybersecurity say
things just want to start with with

79
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:18,299
motivation on on what why defense is so
hard working in a sock is really

80
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:26,200
challenging and how how we can augment
defensive were closed in the light of

81
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,930
some of the asymmetries in office and
defense and and probably my favorite ice

82
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:35,990
in a cemetery to highlight on these are
just keep key takeaways from from two

83
00:06:35,990 --> 00:06:40,550
keynote at black hat one was much as
well as refiners and I and i think im

84
00:06:40,550 --> 00:06:43,790
sure to LIKE grabbed all this data
actually from practical

85
00:06:43,790 --> 00:06:49,700
analysis but basically this this is just
sort of a breakdown and and and analysis

86
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:55,289
that DARPA did on the number of lines of
code for just off their offensive weapon

87
00:06:55,290 --> 00:07:00,130
eyes code vs defensive products like
firewalls and and in and it's it's sort

88
00:07:00,130 --> 00:07:05,060
of a proxy in a way here too much like
what he's really trying to explain in my

89
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:11,050
mind is is that there's an asymmetry
between the the the the unit cost for

90
00:07:11,050 --> 00:07:15,100
for being on defense vs the unit costs
are beyond off thats

91
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:20,260
offenders put a lot less resources into
know what we'll see PHP scripts that are

92
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:25,409
no weapon eyes that are like couple
lines of code and and and and and in the

93
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:29,180
other extreme end of things you'll see
like a checkpoint firewall which is 10

94
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:35,060
million lines of code so this this
asymmetry really highlight a property of

95
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:42,750
defensive techniques that I want to sort
of emphasize as a as a philosophy so if

96
00:07:42,750 --> 00:07:46,550
this is the way that the teams I've been
working without ever really approached

97
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:50,840
kind of reckoning reconciling this
asymmetry between offensive and

98
00:07:50,840 --> 00:07:56,369
defensive it starts with real simple
generika quote I stole this from the Joe

99
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:01,400
Rogan podcast this is this is from
undefeated samurai here he lived a long

100
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:06,260
time ago and he wrote a book called book
of five rings in in in the dakotas once

101
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:11,060
you understand the way broadly you can
see it in all things and I think we we

102
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:14,960
try to I try to take a little negative
this and apply it to to the work I do

103
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:19,109
and I mean this is sort of a loose
connection but it would he would talk

104
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:23,680
about is what once once you see you know
how to master sword you see that that's

105
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:29,670
that same kind of art in in in in a key
ceremony are and you know like bonsai

106
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:35,169
trees and just got an interesting duties
he would fight to the death and never

107
00:08:35,169 --> 00:08:39,098
lost a battle so I can have all the way
I take away from this book is basically

108
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:45,330
he sees the world as this kind of
fractal fractal velocity

109
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:49,910
describe what I mean by that and the
time series of studying the reason I

110
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:52,870
should use this word is this was really
baked into language of the research I

111
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:57,030
was doing so we were we were studying
these days time series that over like

112
00:08:57,030 --> 00:09:00,980
long periods of time they have this
fractal property meaning that if you

113
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:05,530
zoom in on a particular section the time
series there's there's certain there's

114
00:09:05,530 --> 00:09:11,880
certain information that scales across
the different levels of zoom you have

115
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:14,430
kind of a better way to put it

116
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:22,939
for example is like a fractal is is it
is an object in nature that exhibits

117
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:28,340
sort of repeating pattern on many scales
my grades are cliche example you may

118
00:09:28,340 --> 00:09:34,440
have heard is if you look at the number
of leaves in a forest that show the

119
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:38,860
number of leaves on a tree gives you a
sense of the distribution of the

120
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:42,560
population size of the trees in a forest
service at it said to similar

121
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:47,520
information on many scales also like
your cell phones for instance that the

122
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:50,790
fact that are the antenna inside our
cell phone is leveraging a fractal

123
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:58,660
geometry to optimize up did just energy
ratios so so so in our on our contacts

124
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,699
and I'll explain when I mean by this
sort of in a concrete mathematical

125
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:06,960
formula the second is that we try to
take this approach to scaling defensive

126
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:11,510
tactics at a very is is a core part of
philosophy

127
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,290
really with respect to kind of how much
is highlighting this asymmetry between

128
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:19,240
offensive defense and so I know how this
is manifested for us like when we do

129
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:23,030
this modeling and kind of commercial
applications are just one off custom

130
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:30,540
analytics we we we end up having sort of
reusable use cases in reusable code

131
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:34,740
really is kind of comes down to like
appropriately modeling and decoupling

132
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:40,060
like the complexities of certain certain
traditional rule-based systems so so we

133
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:43,780
use this idea that the behaviour IOC
like a behavior-based indicator

134
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:47,650
compromise to be sort of generalized
what it means to have an alert from

135
00:10:47,650 --> 00:10:53,860
snort or a behavior-based like a sort of
a sequence of weird exploit chains that

136
00:10:53,860 --> 00:10:58,610
are kinda just never that that
particular pattern has never occurred in

137
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:03,850
your entire corporate data and so we we
leverage these kind of ideas like the

138
00:11:03,850 --> 00:11:08,470
behavior indicator compromise to map
more two techniques you know tactics

139
00:11:08,470 --> 00:11:09,520
techniques techniques

140
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:13,790
procedures the TTP is that the threat
actors vs the actual lower-level

141
00:11:13,790 --> 00:11:18,339
kind of indicators that are easy for the
threat actors to change just one line of

142
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:25,430
code a simple sort of tweak and I just
I'm not gonna try to get to Matthew

143
00:11:25,430 --> 00:11:28,739
would you guys just to give you a super
sent a sense of what I mean by sort of

144
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:34,090
the fractal nature of abusing this this
idea so we have to use cases that we can

145
00:11:34,090 --> 00:11:38,560
apply this this simply just kind of
thing for me 1.1 as an existing a nap as

146
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:43,239
a piece of code and and it's just
service special permutation of women in

147
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:46,930
my behavior indicate a compromise in
this case we're just using it to come

148
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:51,270
come up with an anagram scored a texture
and dimension to name names is very much

149
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:56,460
like that most likely talk about example
in machine learning for cybersecurity so

150
00:11:56,460 --> 00:12:00,990
I don't want this too much but basically
use this formula for for the use cases

151
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:05,410
around domain name detection and then we
use a very similar format just it's it's

152
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:09,170
based on the same notion of of
leveraging our data but it's just

153
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:13,430
implemented a lil bit differently and
this this sort of this model is applied

154
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,770
to exploit change detection is
completely different use cases

155
00:12:15,770 --> 00:12:20,300
completely different behavior and and
and this kind of lets the defender be

156
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:27,920
more sort of fractal in and exposing
kinda cool just interesting signals in a

157
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:33,319
way that easy to blend together and in
the right layer of computation so so

158
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:36,780
when this is all said and done what we
end up with is this the central nervous

159
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:44,600
system approach that I mean I it's it's
sort of a naive analogy but the point

160
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,990
solutions are really good at certain
things that they're designed to do like

161
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:56,720
like if a fire I gives me an alert and
and then I can alert from a store and i

162
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:59,680
also have something interesting about
those two alerts that I can say

163
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,280
statistically like the fire I fire box
cutter download that was you know

164
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,790
there's there's so she has some external
IP address and we've we've also seen

165
00:13:07,790 --> 00:13:12,410
that IP address with periodic traffic
there's only one using the entire

166
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:15,969
network of 10,000 users that stopped the
IP there's all this sort of a little

167
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:19,750
weak signals of data driven evidence
that we can combine was sort of the

168
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:20,540
static

169
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:24,980
signal from the point solutions and and
basically blend blend together and

170
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:32,570
overall overall score 44 the behaviour
so dive back into this picture a little

171
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:35,900
bit later on but but from a machine
learning perspective what we end up

172
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:40,160
doing with this this GE like how we
score a cluster always sort of blend all

173
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:46,370
the signals together is is typically
this is this is either learn through

174
00:13:46,370 --> 00:13:51,120
some supervised learning a lot of times
it's almost hard to beat

175
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:57,460
what a security analyst will engineer
here is strictly for this jeep so anyway

176
00:13:57,460 --> 00:14:01,600
so that's just kind of this is the sort
of loose introduction that the key

177
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,630
takeaways you really want out like leave
you with a three-man soundbites hope

178
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:10,830
their the practical and and not to like
there's not a lot of Master Sword

179
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:16,080
complicated ideas I did but but the
first one I try to articulate here was

180
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:25,020
the fractal defense just sort of a way
that kinda random stuff so the the cyber

181
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:30,040
security analytics paradigm is something
I've been working on for a while now and

182
00:14:30,040 --> 00:14:35,250
I've noticed like I'm notice a couple of
issues like one a lot of a lot of the

183
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:38,540
engineers who work with who don't
necessarily being secure security domain

184
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:40,670
expertise to the table

185
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:48,130
have a hard time deep decoupling like
through the Internet possible behaviors

186
00:14:48,130 --> 00:14:51,930
that that that are that manifested in
two different stories you see we see in

187
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:58,030
the news and so i i cant call this guy
making mistake of looking at the threat

188
00:14:58,030 --> 00:15:01,949
surface as sort of a continuum of
different behaviors machine learning

189
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:07,740
perspective because a lot of literature
out there will end without mapping a

190
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:13,130
particular machine learning our them to
to sort of a security primitive and I'll

191
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:16,160
show you guys what I mean by that

192
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:23,140
so just like one is to just motivate a
way to describe what it means to rank

193
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:28,360
order different cyber security analytics
and I would use this kind of language a

194
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:32,019
lot to just help help

195
00:15:32,019 --> 00:15:37,550
just bridge the communication gap
between like data scientists security

196
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:40,800
researchers and business stakeholders I
mean a lot of times when you work on

197
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:46,550
these problems that in in in in
enterprises where where this the number

198
00:15:46,550 --> 00:15:51,040
of users is is is so large that sucks
just don't don't have enough time to

199
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:55,998
even really think about this kind of
always playing this game of catch-up and

200
00:15:55,999 --> 00:15:59,910
so that this is just a way to insert the
cybersecurity an election the

201
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:05,730
conversation and help roadmap in the
bigger scheme of all the activities so

202
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:11,559
and just kind of want to walk you
through how to do this you know

203
00:16:11,559 --> 00:16:16,699
basically as a as a philosophy
perspective I mean this is so then we're

204
00:16:16,699 --> 00:16:21,069
with acne Corp I mean this is as a
consultant I would do this a lot we

205
00:16:21,069 --> 00:16:26,229
would get like a list of a jump ahead
here and show you for like 10 or just

206
00:16:26,230 --> 00:16:32,699
you know dealing with our conversation
on on how we want to kind of better

207
00:16:32,699 --> 00:16:38,990
better mitigate particular attacks that
we don't have coverage for yet so we

208
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:43,660
sort of enumerated high-threat surface
and and understand just sort of listing

209
00:16:43,660 --> 00:16:47,309
the use cases their top of mind for
security for the business stakeholders

210
00:16:47,309 --> 00:16:52,639
so this is a play this game a lot I
would get a room and we'd say okay these

211
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:57,519
are the five use cases are most top of
mind for us i mean and they they run the

212
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:02,059
gamut I mean there's so many things and
a large environment we see I mean I just

213
00:17:02,059 --> 00:17:09,230
kinda sorta scattered some of the most
common common things I've worked on or

214
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:15,159
are just a popular area recently so I
kind of think of getting this this big

215
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:19,459
grab bag of use cases that sort of is
trying to enumerate the threat surface

216
00:17:19,459 --> 00:17:25,919
and and we kinda just stick to your
favourite list of abuse cases and and

217
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:30,139
the next step is to determine coverage
and impact risk which is a fun exercise

218
00:17:30,139 --> 00:17:33,820
for your business stakeholders and I
don't think it's it's really practical

219
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:38,240
for promotion shops really large shops
like I know Microsoft has a bunch of

220
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,899
data on on the cost of breaches and so
if you're able to catch up it's it's

221
00:17:42,899 --> 00:17:44,600
it's it's pretty actionable

222
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:50,600
for the business side of things but I
think security intuition security

223
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:55,559
researchers and analysts know you know
like detecting commanding control and

224
00:17:55,559 --> 00:18:01,020
generalized is just like as a less of an
impact than texting someone thats

225
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:08,139
walking the entire oh you tree with with
like pat pat ticket footprint little bit

226
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:15,630
ahead before that and then the third
step is to to sort of express this stuff

227
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:19,919
in a couple simple dimensions so that we
can then come up with a ranking for for

228
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:26,409
the different use cases in the debt
service so so this is kind of just

229
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:31,870
taking all these these little these use
cases I mean we can we can think of

230
00:18:31,870 --> 00:18:37,449
millions of different possibilities but
at the end of the day in my mind it just

231
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:39,539
comes down to do

232
00:18:39,539 --> 00:18:44,360
coming up with like a basic formula
basic approximation of what it means to

233
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:48,799
have one of the return on investment for
investing in one of these use cases and

234
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,710
then wrote a simple formula down here
would you lie I used it a couple

235
00:18:52,710 --> 00:18:56,690
companies I don't think this is right
but I i just want to put it down as a

236
00:18:56,690 --> 00:19:00,390
way to kind of motivated the
conversation and debate on what what

237
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:01,740
what is important

238
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:07,700
44 really measuring the value of a
cybersecurity and a leg and when I hope

239
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:13,299
so for example the way this this started
happening is what we would do is we

240
00:19:13,299 --> 00:19:18,320
stand up a couple of analytics in in the
through the wind side of detection so

241
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,710
you have like command-and-control
detection and maybe exploit change

242
00:19:22,710 --> 00:19:27,760
detection and then we would sort of
operations analytics and have the sock

243
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,669
team just as part of escalations
everyday triage the output you think of

244
00:19:32,669 --> 00:19:37,730
what one roll out put it like one of
these custom solutions we would measure

245
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:41,880
that caught the time it took four for
basically the validation of other

246
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:45,860
security researchers say this is true
positive or false positive so in the end

247
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:50,059
the way we see like when we give them a
try pdata who has information on average

248
00:19:50,059 --> 00:19:50,678
would take

249
00:19:50,679 --> 00:19:51,730
researcher at

250
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:55,560
power to validate when these when
analytics in the land like if we had

251
00:19:55,560 --> 00:20:01,750
like a nadie Active Directory based
machine learning driven analytic on

252
00:20:01,750 --> 00:20:07,640
average we are taking the the shop I did
this there was about 20 hours per per

253
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:12,570
row of output for the past half past the
ticket detection in in latin the land

254
00:20:12,570 --> 00:20:17,629
and this is this kind of let me just
sort of it crudely approximate what it

255
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:31,530
would have meant by by value so so in
terms of value to me that the most

256
00:20:31,530 --> 00:20:35,820
important thing from a practical take
away working with the sock was not only

257
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:39,939
impact risk but just the cost of
validating the dispute or the technology

258
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:45,840
the analytic itself and so that the
value of the solution is actually on the

259
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,730
on the y axis and and on the x-axis is
sort of that the cost of the validation

260
00:20:49,730 --> 00:20:55,470
and and and in my experience there's
there's I mean this is such a crude

261
00:20:55,470 --> 00:21:00,400
approximation of a complex problem with
many dimensions so one what one way to

262
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:05,380
sort of a segment of Mentor Graphics out
adding another access is just to kind of

263
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:11,360
break in the information from the
signals foreperson the different

264
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,810
components of your infrastructure and in
particular why I think validation cost

265
00:21:15,810 --> 00:21:20,060
is so high and why I think this is a big
issue in general and on defense is big

266
00:21:20,060 --> 00:21:25,300
because of the lack of visibility into
the land and and so one of the

267
00:21:25,300 --> 00:21:28,830
organizations as I was doing this on as
you know I think the number of uses

268
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:37,399
around 250,000 users and and they have
such large data centers that these data

269
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:41,660
centers have like thousands of users
traffic but but because its architect in

270
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:46,060
such a way that it's it's like a giant
black hole like it's it's like it's like

271
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:49,980
all switch traffic so you don't you lose
a lot of signal for sort of the loud

272
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:53,890
like the lateral side of things in the
land when you're on when you're doing

273
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:58,160
modeling a particular machine learning
modeling I i try to target a sweet spot

274
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:02,710
so we kind of kind of approach where
where we think

275
00:22:02,710 --> 00:22:08,440
machine learning is gonna give the best
output in terms of augmenting human

276
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:13,860
workflows and that means like just met
minimizing the cost of validating so so

277
00:22:13,860 --> 00:22:18,750
so after all said and done and just
different organizations will have three

278
00:22:18,750 --> 00:22:21,740
different permutations of this graph but
there's there's always a sweet spot and

279
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:25,860
there's always a way to basically
prioritize our ranking saying I know I'm

280
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:32,668
gonna start of I have five a year 222222
sign a team that adding some existing

281
00:22:32,669 --> 00:22:39,309
and new coverage for maybe I said to use
cases that are top of mine are

282
00:22:39,309 --> 00:22:48,510
prioritizing based on sort of this
dismal so just sort of the it's it's

283
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:51,860
it's more of a communication tool very
kind of loosely defined and there there

284
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:57,418
there's a lot of there's a lot of
dimensions here that I i totally you

285
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:02,299
know omitted so I let this slide is
actually thanks to Monsey Mirza at

286
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:07,220
sparked by a comment is graphics I think
this is my be on a blog already but he

287
00:23:07,220 --> 00:23:13,880
he kind of put this together as a way to
show he uses this to kind of explain 222

288
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:18,770
customers when when we're talking about
modeling the threat surface really have

289
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:23,149
to take into account adversary
capability and I i think working with

290
00:23:23,149 --> 00:23:29,580
machine learning researchers who have to
read about the gamut of extreme attacks

291
00:23:29,580 --> 00:23:34,240
that are certain nation state driven all
the way down too much much less benign

292
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:39,820
and and less adversary skill it becomes
a challenge to decouple the adversary

293
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:48,129
the adversary model from from from the
rest of the album in some sense so my

294
00:23:48,130 --> 00:23:51,860
position is always to service start from
low low to high especially if you're a

295
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:56,010
machine learning researcher and and try
not to model the nation state this is

296
00:23:56,010 --> 00:24:01,309
really where you need the most advanced
technology in combination with extra the

297
00:24:01,309 --> 00:24:09,600
best human work closely from from low to
high and so the other kind of thing we

298
00:24:09,600 --> 00:24:13,469
run into a lot when where I mean I gosh
no just over last year I probably built

299
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:14,940
like 20

300
00:24:14,940 --> 00:24:21,270
not me personally but just that the team
are working with twenty to twenty-five

301
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:25,000
machine learning algorithms specific
models we had to implement we had to

302
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:29,070
benchmark the majority these models and
cyber security don't even have any data

303
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:36,200
so we should have given you sort of
stuck in a weird position where can I

304
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:40,530
okay maybe I can simulate data
small-scale try to generalize or you can

305
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:44,899
try to collect open source intelligence

306
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:49,200
and you know built some statistics off
contagious but the cool thing we've

307
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,570
we've been fighting over the last year
especially kinda thanks to DARPA and

308
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:58,000
website called predict or is it really
spearheading in my mind what we do sort

309
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,120
of the next step in the evolution of
defense and particularly like leveraging

310
00:25:02,120 --> 00:25:05,719
some of these these these techniques
from the machine learning community that

311
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:12,030
really rely on good annotations for
samples and and so few

312
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:15,889
datasets here that I think are trying
give a big kudos to these are really

313
00:25:15,890 --> 00:25:19,800
awesome dataset so if you're working on
any of these kind of problems in general

314
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:24,740
are you really have to model the human
like isolated human behavior and and she

315
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:28,980
said that the diverse footprint they
have a cross email arms across LDAP data

316
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:34,550
across firewall when it is such a
complex mix of heterogeneous

317
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:37,960
technologies that it's it's it's almost
not worth simulating it's better just to

318
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:41,870
get get something existing and and
something that's really been handled

319
00:25:41,870 --> 00:25:50,169
appropriately with a lot of resources so
this also contentious on just a topic i

320
00:25:50,170 --> 00:25:55,670
think is really important to to to
emphasize that has as someone who's a

321
00:25:55,670 --> 00:26:00,490
stakeholder or someone who's on the
defensive side of things like you'll be

322
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:06,070
more and more in the space of dealing
with these next gen solutions and how do

323
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:10,780
you benchmark them and part of what I've
seen working with socks and and dealing

324
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:17,270
with the constant fire drill just
evidence collection and and and dated a

325
00:26:17,270 --> 00:26:24,360
day-to-day escalations there it's hard
to to to to leverage the information

326
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:28,740
from from the socks were closed in the
machine learning in the machine learning

327
00:26:28,740 --> 00:26:32,870
path without some sort of normalization
like typically like will all work with

328
00:26:32,870 --> 00:26:35,689
one researcher who keeps all their
evidence notes in sublime and then

329
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:39,400
another research will keep all the notes
in Excel and and and there's not not

330
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:43,490
like sort of a normalized format like
like that describe sort of the output of

331
00:26:43,490 --> 00:26:47,780
evidence collection that's that's
annotated specifically for machine

332
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:54,809
learning that's just something you can
gel on and then and then just just too

333
00:26:54,809 --> 00:27:00,950
to emphasize that further said his black
at Kino last year with the real problems

334
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:05,200
securities requirements are
non-functional so that it in my mind for

335
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:09,529
machining perspective this is the first
step to making something functional is

336
00:27:09,529 --> 00:27:13,950
to define like took two to describe a
well-defined behavior you want to model

337
00:27:13,950 --> 00:27:17,200
and then and then at once we know what
that behavior is like experts say

338
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:22,269
detection I can go to the mall were down
and just pull down all the whole set of

339
00:27:22,269 --> 00:27:26,320
expectations for last year and and and
and and validate that with a with a set

340
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:32,418
of known examples so that's sort of what
I mean by Disqus emphasizing that the

341
00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:39,149
functional requirements we get so so it
wasn't like to have a business side of

342
00:27:39,149 --> 00:27:43,668
things but just the big takeaway from me
from that that that said that apart the

343
00:27:43,669 --> 00:27:48,850
content is just it's been a very
effective tool for communicating across

344
00:27:48,850 --> 00:27:56,389
teams so hopefully that's for you and
then finally here we get to the meat of

345
00:27:56,389 --> 00:28:00,389
the technology so what platform we've
been doing all the machine learning on

346
00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:07,149
well it's it becomes a problem of doing
this at scale and and what we want to do

347
00:28:07,149 --> 00:28:15,129
is help augment or just provide a way to
to to make this this loop between

348
00:28:15,129 --> 00:28:22,230
security analyst and and the sock we
just wanna wanna make augment this

349
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:28,649
worked well as best as possible way I
like to think about this in a generic

350
00:28:28,649 --> 00:28:32,979
terms is when I work with security
researchers like they have this very

351
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:36,259
expressive kind of search path they go
down like you kind of give them

352
00:28:36,259 --> 00:28:40,879
different evidence you know depending on
the use case and and and they're sort of

353
00:28:40,879 --> 00:28:47,689
this very giant kind of tree of
information that they build based on

354
00:28:47,690 --> 00:28:50,619
evidence and pivoting off certain things
like all of the sudden it had something

355
00:28:50,619 --> 00:28:52,230
interesting that we saw

356
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:58,369
gate . PHP and I just going back and
forth of little indicators you will

357
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:03,340
eventually see this this like decisions
decisions

358
00:29:03,340 --> 00:29:07,340
treat process that takes place and so
that's that's kinda like the goal here

359
00:29:07,340 --> 00:29:07,709
too

360
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:14,600
to capture a part of this decision tree
this human domain expertise in and and

361
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:22,299
code in in in in a platform and so
that's what I'm excited to talk about it

362
00:29:22,299 --> 00:29:26,570
particularly in the context of security
because I haven't seen this language

363
00:29:26,570 --> 00:29:31,439
mentioned a lot and it's the first time
I saw it originally I think was one and

364
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:39,289
Nathan Marz talks on storm 2011 storm is
is an open-source architecture for doing

365
00:29:39,289 --> 00:29:45,450
real-time computing at scale it's it's
kinda like it's a bit so I guess it's

366
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:49,309
the biggest followed java project I get
but it's it's a it's a really cool

367
00:29:49,309 --> 00:29:55,070
platform for doing it distributed
computing real-time problems and Nathan

368
00:29:55,070 --> 00:30:01,689
was dealing with this this this this
problem of calculating different an

369
00:30:01,690 --> 00:30:05,690
electric Twitter add scale on on on
really large amounts of data so kind

370
00:30:05,690 --> 00:30:09,539
where where where I can first heard this
to the term was originally claimed by

371
00:30:09,539 --> 00:30:14,390
Nathan Marz to describe a general
generic problem-solving approach that

372
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:18,200
scales to extremely large data
processing tasks so he was then and this

373
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,929
is a quote from his talk show a Twitter
we have our backs they're constantly

374
00:30:21,929 --> 00:30:25,480
override the real-time layer so that if
anything ever goes wrong it's

375
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:29,279
automatically collected within a couple
hours that batch real-time approaches

376
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:33,590
really general it works for pretty much
any problem it's recommended that it

377
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:40,418
it's a deep topic and we like Twitter
and a lot of kind of classic non-secure

378
00:30:40,419 --> 00:30:45,250
use cases are using this boy is more to
kind of bland the best of both

379
00:30:45,250 --> 00:30:50,289
computational paradigms which is back in
real time and and to use it in a way to

380
00:30:50,289 --> 00:30:54,940
have the most accurate picture of the
analytics you can

381
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:58,120
insecurity we can kind of like leverages
architecture in a little bit different

382
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:05,709
way so that the breakdown of the land
architecture of kind of the weight

383
00:31:05,710 --> 00:31:10,000
Nathan Marz describes it is is just day
is just as a set of functions so three

384
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:16,510
functions that describe three different
views of how to process data in in in

385
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:18,960
different paths and and if you if you

386
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:22,440
check out his talks have a whole list of
sources that they are not going to show

387
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:26,200
you where exactly you can see these but
you'll they're the really interesting

388
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:34,000
talks and he he he sort of like he's one
of the stock has called for saturday in

389
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:38,380
the no sequel community and and it's
it's about the fact that and this is

390
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:42,700
what I've seen working on Sam's first
generation seems to last for the last 20

391
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:47,559
years they've they've got done good up
to a point but there's a bottleneck and

392
00:31:47,559 --> 00:31:51,520
and the computing pin it's the
bottleneck in the Sam is is basically

393
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:55,039
that the data processing path that's
really a computing paradigm that's been

394
00:31:55,039 --> 00:32:00,590
is 20 years old today they makes the
transactional nature of databases and

395
00:32:00,590 --> 00:32:05,039
and historical updating and all the
stuff that happens in databases for them

396
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:08,789
they mix all this and kind of one
computation path and we're learning from

397
00:32:08,789 --> 00:32:12,929
like shops like Google and and and and
people were doing this that really large

398
00:32:12,929 --> 00:32:18,929
scale is is if we sorta decoupled the
computation in a very special way you

399
00:32:18,929 --> 00:32:23,840
you minimize all the complexities of
update in right into your real-time path

400
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:27,990
and this makes these systems much more
fault are much more resilient and more

401
00:32:27,990 --> 00:32:31,870
importantly they scaled to the prof trip
to the the size of the data sets that

402
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:41,709
debt are important to make actionable
analytics for security so so so this is

403
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:45,710
a no elaborate a little bit more on this
in the in the white paper but basically

404
00:32:45,710 --> 00:32:50,330
that the point here is that a little and
architecture in this is our weapon

405
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:55,029
building and in one form or another just
using different systems you know at

406
00:32:55,029 --> 00:33:00,919
first it was proprietary parallel
databases now view spark a dupe storm

407
00:33:00,919 --> 00:33:05,940
the patch ecosystem and what it is it's
a it's a way to kind of put a bunch of

408
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:11,190
components together in a processing path
that is extremely resilient and can take

409
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:15,909
like take the just the size of of a
corporate perimeter traffic set that's

410
00:33:15,909 --> 00:33:20,110
updated every day

411
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:23,678
some of the cool things i've seen these
architectures doing for instance like

412
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:30,070
one of the one of the last project we
were at where they not only did they can

413
00:33:30,070 --> 00:33:34,070
use it as an injection path but because
there's sort of a research resource

414
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:38,280
manager and basically something at the
at the back end of all this like a brain

415
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:42,059
that is kicking off threads in a
computing cluster that they distributed

416
00:33:42,059 --> 00:33:48,860
parallel basically parallel computation
path where certain threads would

417
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:52,928
actually be turned into crawlers or
worker processes that were touching

418
00:33:52,929 --> 00:33:58,919
large parts of our internal data stores
grabbing grabbing all just open file

419
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:04,980
shares and looking for compliance
violations for PII detection so so we

420
00:34:04,980 --> 00:34:09,540
use these callers to 24 argument some of
the common friends ecstatic similarly

421
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:16,969
for like watering hole detection
crawling content and web pages so so

422
00:34:16,969 --> 00:34:20,580
there's there's a there's a lot of ways
you can kind of once you have this

423
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:25,179
architecture stood up there there's
there's a ton of parallelism and just a

424
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:31,250
powerful things you can do it and and I
think that when the key things we see in

425
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:37,219
and really standing this technology up
in a shop where they actually want to

426
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:41,299
make use of the analytics it's not just
some standalone piece of code that date

427
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:45,119
assigned as worked on it to get shelve
but actually operationalizing all this

428
00:34:45,119 --> 00:34:51,129
stuff and and feeding directly into into
Security Operations Centre feeds really

429
00:34:51,129 --> 00:34:55,270
complex question that we didn't really
touch in in the in the white paper is is

430
00:34:55,270 --> 00:35:00,580
how to how to stabilize our models and
how to age and a new Adam and personal

431
00:35:00,580 --> 00:35:03,350
analytic and particularly taking into
account

432
00:35:03,350 --> 00:35:10,380
much as much as notes on the asymmetry
of options and defense we're going to be

433
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:13,660
dealing with concept drift mean I labels
are gonna change over time so this

434
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:17,270
particular part of the
operationalization is really important

435
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:24,509
for ensuring that we are making the best
analytic choice possible

436
00:35:24,510 --> 00:35:29,190
in an automated fashion everything
Marius for the side this is actually one

437
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:33,800
of the engineers who is just super cool
to work with an architect at all the

438
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:40,540
stops this is a commandeered the slide
and I just think for me just thinking

439
00:35:40,540 --> 00:35:44,700
about this land architecture I mean it's
such a such a deep topic to just try to

440
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:48,060
gloss over the fast but it's it's it's
more out again it's it's more about

441
00:35:48,060 --> 00:35:53,470
philosophy thing and and I think one way
to think about it I can show you guys

442
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:54,100
how it

443
00:35:54,100 --> 00:36:00,810
visualize it like visualizes in actual
computation in a second but but I think

444
00:36:00,810 --> 00:36:04,840
for instance a great example what you
want to do in a batch path which is

445
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:08,140
super simple I do I promise to an area
analytic that's that's looking at a

446
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:12,900
balanced is we we can use a statistical
whitelist step sonar patched up we

447
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:17,750
calculate we take each IP address each
external IP address any checks on domain

448
00:36:17,750 --> 00:36:20,970
name and we just your popularity check
we say what is that number of unique

449
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:24,660
users thats talk to this number of
unique internal IP that's talked to this

450
00:36:24,660 --> 00:36:29,170
domain on this ip address this is just a
super simple calculation you can have

451
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:32,960
periodically updated once a day in your
bachelor and then and that little

452
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:37,190
statistic kinda let you analyze the
different levels of trainers notice that

453
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:41,390
in how bad traffic like you can say okay
let me just study all new domains that

454
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:45,529
have less than 5 users that this is the
first day we've ever seen data in right

455
00:36:45,530 --> 00:36:48,290
there you can already start to kind of
zoom in on on certain types of badness

456
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:53,800
III just I think this should be baked in
the secure products in general I don't

457
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:56,470
think there should be any reason why
we're just leveraging streaming

458
00:36:56,470 --> 00:37:00,640
streaming online solutions for
everything like it's the perimeter can

459
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:08,549
leverage historical data and I would
love to see it and firewalls so i cant

460
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:15,060
13 theoretical like caveat to mention
here as I mean this is this is a high

461
00:37:15,060 --> 00:37:19,270
level we're kind glossing over some of
the the depth doing this type of

462
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:23,970
computation in a highly scared scalable
distributed system there are certain

463
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:29,439
connotations that don't scale across a
parallel processes and this is kind of

464
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:34,760
far from ICS perspective this is the
classes P complete and and see and and

465
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:37,870
and think of our room is of class in C
it means it

466
00:37:37,870 --> 00:37:42,970
taillights embarrassingly peril and and
certain closer to certain problems where

467
00:37:42,970 --> 00:37:47,649
you have to sort of emerged state all
industrial one threat of memory or one

468
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:52,680
place like a median for example just
they don't they don't they don't hurt me

469
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:58,779
paralyzed across a cluster so so yeah so
I think we just a couple more minutes

470
00:37:58,780 --> 00:38:05,360
just kind of give you like a sense of
how this stuff manifests we can really

471
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:12,270
do any demos or anything we do have this
long boot but just what what what what

472
00:38:12,270 --> 00:38:15,300
when you build a land architecture and
you stand this type of thing I but

473
00:38:15,300 --> 00:38:17,760
you're able to do is is come up with it

474
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:24,360
expressive waste a Model T teepees and
not just not just a simple rule but more

475
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:28,310
like a a structure where there's
encoding in our edges where there's

476
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:32,360
there's a particular behavior we wanna
matte model so so for example if i if I

477
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:38,570
want to my analytic to study these these
properties of mobile command control

478
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:44,130
when a thread after a sort of they
simply moving the sea to every so often

479
00:38:44,130 --> 00:38:48,430
well I can kind of I can kind of
expressed this and in this general

480
00:38:48,430 --> 00:38:53,819
framework of the behavior in indicated a
compromise on the land Architektur

481
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:59,760
really like another sort of example just
walk through really quickly because like

482
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:05,540
the perimeter pit where basically a DMZ
a facing asset is is compromised and

483
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:10,870
then it's used to establish a beachhead
with manual will see someone talked to a

484
00:39:10,870 --> 00:39:15,190
domain controller eventually something
along those lines to see how this how

485
00:39:15,190 --> 00:39:18,820
this is all kind of visualizing we can
we can hunt for these type of cheapies

486
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:24,280
and processing framework that person
takes a bunch of data doesn't look like

487
00:39:24,280 --> 00:39:29,980
anything does a simple in an automated
way is constantly in real time updating

488
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:34,880
the new sessions tracking users mapping
and IP addresses over time and finally

489
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:41,370
at the real time step a check to see if
there's something funny is going on with

490
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:45,990
a particular so part of our our social
graph and that's exactly what I was sort

491
00:39:45,990 --> 00:39:47,089
of showing in

492
00:39:47,089 --> 00:39:52,660
originated in the intro is kinda hunting
for for a way to express what it means

493
00:39:52,660 --> 00:39:57,180
to find when these clusters high risk
communication cluster and it's it's sort

494
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:02,058
of exactly this thing at the end of the
day it's it's it's about putting putting

495
00:40:02,059 --> 00:40:06,960
rule like that the best part of the rule
systems like the fire I boxes in the

496
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:12,369
storage boxes in combination with with
behavior driven technique so so each one

497
00:40:12,369 --> 00:40:16,779
of these efforts here is either is
either a classical point solution alert

498
00:40:16,779 --> 00:40:21,369
or it's a behavior-based it can be a
machine learning algorithm or just like

499
00:40:21,369 --> 00:40:27,200
a simple feature so this is for the idea
of scaling up and down the defensive

500
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:41,450
ladder so and I think we're at a time I
don't know maybe I mean just just to

501
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:44,759
talk more about like the theoretical
side of things a little bit from true

502
00:40:44,759 --> 00:40:46,630
through that like the artificial
intelligence

503
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:52,509
angle I mean I think it's just such a
cool question to to think about what it

504
00:40:52,509 --> 00:40:59,210
means for machines think and and a lot
of theoretical people have put a ton of

505
00:40:59,210 --> 00:41:05,660
work into it saying what it really means
to like how far we can go with him with

506
00:41:05,660 --> 00:41:10,960
a supervised learning algorithm in
machine learning and particularly if

507
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,779
you're you come from this Community
probably aware of these things are the

508
00:41:13,779 --> 00:41:17,650
No Free Lunch theorems I just I think
it's important to be aware just to take

509
00:41:17,650 --> 00:41:21,579
much as example of the lines of code and
realize that that pretty much implies

510
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:24,969
we're always gonna have adversarial
drift so adversarial Jeff to really

511
00:41:24,969 --> 00:41:28,640
means that the label change over time in
which case we're sort of in the problem

512
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:33,249
space is no free lunch just sort of one
kind of theoretical thing to take away

513
00:41:33,249 --> 00:41:38,288
the other kind of thing I I like to
think about is like sort of what it what

514
00:41:38,289 --> 00:41:43,200
are the limitations of artificial
intelligence in in general and I when I

515
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,239
know some of these crazy counter
examples like I think so random papered

516
00:41:47,239 --> 00:41:51,780
a site is up Travis Goodspeed packets
and packets basically shows that it

517
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:56,520
given a communication medium we can
always embed a covert channel into that

518
00:41:56,520 --> 00:42:04,280
communication medium to avoid shopping
and so in some sense is it we can serve

519
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:09,320
phrase that is well communication
contains steganography is that even a

520
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:15,360
tractable tractable problem 44 machine
machine learning and why I think this is

521
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:19,910
the right way to to phrase it it's not
equivalent to the halting problem but I

522
00:42:19,910 --> 00:42:23,670
think the whole compromise is sort of a
good I i I feel like we're constantly

523
00:42:23,670 --> 00:42:27,740
running up against the halting problem
in cybersecurity I i really saw someone

524
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:31,850
from barrack road ahead this on their
Twitter hair and how she always is

525
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:36,630
basically your day job is looking at a
rapid web apps and she's like pretty

526
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:39,870
much I'm cheating at the halting problem
I'm trying to get the program's gonna

527
00:42:39,870 --> 00:42:45,390
crasher exploitable III like that
philosophy I think there's something to

528
00:42:45,390 --> 00:42:51,029
be said about what is the limit of an
algorithm in terms of detecting take our

529
00:42:51,030 --> 00:42:56,230
for any of these things that exploit how
far can we go and and and for sure we

530
00:42:56,230 --> 00:43:00,160
know the halting problem the reason and
put it up here is it the hard promised a

531
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:03,580
miss because it was one of the first
problem is proving our Mickley

532
00:43:03,580 --> 00:43:10,860
undecidable which kinda crazy I mean to
prove this

533
00:43:10,860 --> 00:43:16,750
in 1936 what sort of interesting from
like sci-fi artificial intelligence

534
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:20,240
perspective is it is actually an open
question whether any such a known

535
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:23,330
physical processes are involved in the
working of the human brain and when

536
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:27,090
they're humans can solve the problem so
maybe that's why security officer so

537
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:31,000
much better than computers is I think
we're sort of running up into these

538
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:38,140
these places where it's sort of known
theoretically that that that our thumbs

539
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:41,700
aren't usually that just the sole
solution to these problems and that's

540
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:46,910
why I human algorithm augmentation is my
my my my perspective is we want to build

541
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:50,920
these things to really augment the the
humans as best as possible and and sort

542
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:57,990
of close those loops in the sock so yeah
thats I think I think we're good on time

543
00:43:57,990 --> 00:44:01,319
now is open up for ya

544
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:05,760
so that that the sound bites here just
leave the key takeaways are mean I hope

545
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:11,400
this was was was useful fractal defense
secretary Alex ROI and land architecture

546
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:18,560
and I mean I guess and there's so many
sources like the white paper's a lot

547
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,060
better source it's a little bit more
technical it's kind of an academically

548
00:44:21,060 --> 00:44:27,130
there's so many sources to say hi fi I
know I overlooked some people the site

549
00:44:27,130 --> 00:44:33,850
and slides but this is just huge like
that i think is important in this

550
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:39,779
promise basin yeah so let's just hope it
up for questions I think there's like

551
00:44:39,780 --> 00:44:49,980
Mike if people wanna ask questions they
have to come to the front and I guess

552
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:56,220
there's surveys if anyone if you guys
just leave your survey on your desk

553
00:44:56,220 --> 00:44:57,049
