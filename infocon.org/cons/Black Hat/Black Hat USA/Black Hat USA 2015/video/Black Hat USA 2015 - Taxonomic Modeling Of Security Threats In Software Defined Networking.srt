1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,140
William one again

2
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:23,810
grid computing seventy years the world

3
00:00:23,810 --> 00:00:36,760
research at the top left and because
stocks

4
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,800
accelerator near the building

5
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:57,920
as I was some numbers if I not just the
system and that's why this is

6
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:12,850
just a historic the lab went on to
receive the local later

7
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:21,429
I tried them by installing

8
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:31,150
and by AG

9
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:33,900
go to the ER

10
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:51,270
well and on my return to lab found out
that the doctor to dry up where the

11
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:52,770
previous night

12
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,890
and the data had not yet

13
00:01:56,890 --> 00:02:04,490
now that day I learned that they would

14
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:08,929
I went to a whole new computer

15
00:02:08,929 --> 00:02:20,620
eventually and that should be home to
his place you'll feel this

16
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:36,480
forward to today he is

17
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:54,130
like

18
00:02:54,130 --> 00:03:47,459
was the AM and I could allow enterprises

19
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:57,150
will reach $2

20
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:18,590
brought this insurance however by a
number of challenges

21
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:21,250
stages

22
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:23,550
first of all

23
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:33,560
position will require additional efforts
to find that not all enterprises will

24
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:50,110
continue to fight the cutie shoes but
also will be dealing with 500

25
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:58,220
you

26
00:04:58,220 --> 00:05:07,760
we will have been there's a job and
right now it is quite quickly be brought

27
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,700
up so they can put them out there

28
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:28,060
markets be with such right now he would
be the 31st we

29
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:42,940
do this but

30
00:05:42,940 --> 00:05:56,469
2012 as the threat of the way

31
00:05:56,470 --> 00:06:06,340
Wiley however will have three

32
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:17,409
I wanted to be a novelist

33
00:06:17,409 --> 00:06:34,810

34
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:50,810
architect she's separately to face these
bottom line

35
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:53,040
disconnected

36
00:06:53,040 --> 00:07:11,080
year but also with each other

37
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:20,760
to the lady will be

38
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,330
oxy

39
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:35,750

and and or tax would be

41
00:08:21,320 --> 00:09:02,110
be what not

42
00:09:02,110 --> 00:09:12,810

43
00:09:12,810 --> 00:09:37,189
user fees

44
00:09:37,190 --> 00:10:07,059
structure

45
00:10:07,059 --> 00:11:02,920
we might actually be with you

46
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:13,510
leche potential

47
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:16,810
eight

48

50
00:12:37,820 --> 00:13:20,380
he

51
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:56,710
yeah this is he the controller

52
00:13:56,710 --> 00:14:14,910
ur

53
00:14:14,910 --> 00:14:50,439
basic cable review it would be harvested

54
00:14:50,440 --> 00:15:37,810
need to the privilege by the quiche

55
00:15:37,810 --> 00:16:07,569
attacking the eagle drive and use

56
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:34,339
controller and why you

57
00:16:34,339 --> 00:17:18,990
not to use that controller the
controller $10 fee we should not be

58
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:40,450
called me and she can be large the
causes

59
00:17:40,450 --> 00:18:50,290
each year doctors and well established
the time he

60
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:56,240
control

61
00:18:56,240 --> 00:20:06,830
you know he is he

62
00:20:06,830 --> 00:20:53,909
disease

63
00:20:53,910 --> 00:21:52,370
with additional cash were controlled
lead not work or will you accept texts

64
00:21:52,370 --> 00:22:43,070
while controlling such

65
00:22:43,070 --> 00:23:28,950
using presented to you or what I have
developed this is

66
00:23:28,950 --> 00:24:36,800
the base model who this company

67
00:24:36,800 --> 00:24:48,940
and ulysses

68
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:57,100
say that's all we have to do it because
the relationship with his big launch

69
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:25,490
launch control controller talking about
I'll be access this file actually so he

70
00:25:25,490 --> 00:26:08,220
should be structured so that would be
disturbed

71
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:44,750
you are there will be pleased with this
is for the best but she's
