1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:13,710
so my name is Michelle Harris and and
I'm not even an entire production / I'm

2
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:20,010
pretty sure that I get it wrong what
we're going to talk about today is

3
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:25,449
actually using the hardware feature that
had been tested in the field of computer

4
00:00:25,449 --> 00:00:30,490
compatible CPU for quite some time but
you know baby that was not necessarily

5
00:00:30,490 --> 00:00:36,360
something that he wouldn't it be weird
but I talked about how we can you save

6
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:46,809
for better security out or whatever
their intended for me it was basically

7
00:00:46,809 --> 00:01:02,530
you know they will perform in statistics
on top of it running into crisis call if

8
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:08,920
you want to do

9
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:11,450
right

10
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:20,920
so do a quick rundown of what we really
like them of their respective who look

11
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:26,110
at so first of all you gotta do is going
to give you a brief introduction

12
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:33,630
coming from entering counted on the end
of CPUs well I'm going to keep you would

13
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:37,770
like to get them to be like that come
back to me but it's just a made

14
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:43,079
compatible CPU that vote to a large
degree and talk about holidays before

15
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:51,270
was wondering how to can be used for the
detection of medication for regenerative

16
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:57,380
programming yeah we won't be talking
about what we have read it but they're

17
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:02,048
much as BB pointing out of some of the
things that people have done this and we

18
00:02:02,049 --> 00:02:06,079
will be talking about using the
performance monitoring coming days to

19
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:14,670
detect an attack on hollywood hot girl
Hannah briefly discuss what we can do

20
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:22,138
give kids also last will be looking
ahead how we can use it before 11

21
00:02:22,139 --> 00:02:30,490
contests to basically take me to get
cash tax so

22
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:35,520
gonna give you guys bring back our time
together people now that acknowledged

23
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:41,170
that police and I've been embodied
within you doing and security for a very

24
00:02:41,170 --> 00:03:01,529
long time and I mean yeah right i text
software innovation research leading to

25
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:09,750
the development of a weirdo in this
business I have a master's degree in

26
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:17,670
economics has been hoping for me since
92 so I have a lot of experience with it

27
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:26,359
so

28
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:30,980
show more of the story story we've done
something reaching their feet may

29
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:39,850
actually know what we talked about for
some degree ok so I'm gonna shower and

30
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:44,630
the like and where these performance
counties where you come from right so

31
00:03:44,630 --> 00:03:52,340
you get a better understanding of the
Pete dafeet is and what is possible

32
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:57,650
there then secretly differences between
different different ratios and all the

33
00:03:57,650 --> 00:04:04,920
things we do you like the best
information for this manual and

34
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:13,708
basically these days they pretty much
document almost all of it and a very

35
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:19,750
social reformation when you want to
fight him to be so easy and it's only a

36
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:34,770
supreme being around in the Six fixable
compatible CPU in nineteen nineties the

37
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:42,510
mid nineties and Intel Pentium process
is an implementation of it which was

38
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:48,050
documented time basically published

39
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:55,750
he's excited how these things work by a
bigger something that he w you wanna

40
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:11,669
explain how these words in the
definition of this and they basically

41
00:05:11,669 --> 00:05:22,729
came out and started a standard initial
Fisher and the entire

42
00:05:22,729 --> 00:05:29,789
recount is but they were implemented as
machines are especially great massage

43
00:05:29,789 --> 00:05:39,279
and they were bored readable hydeia
massage function but only 30 no break

44
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:48,050
rank and the baby mmm XP 55 she
instructed by the IDPs see all of you

45
00:05:48,050 --> 00:05:51,830
who read this before 11 30 days and you
could also do it from reaching three

46
00:05:51,830 --> 00:06:01,128
basic and also sleepy 5550 IDPs see eg
basically read content content with just

47
00:06:01,129 --> 00:06:09,809
ride trading higher resolution plan that
begin formation for the and so they will

48
00:06:09,809 --> 00:06:17,699
get together because they changed you
don't change to pay these fees of a

49
00:06:17,699 --> 00:06:23,189
human did like you want to be greedy 32
they've invented and so on so we beseech

50
00:06:23,189 --> 00:06:33,209
based pushes is like paper that they
need to improve balance on these i ka

51
00:06:33,209 --> 00:06:34,289
mp3 each

52
00:06:34,289 --> 00:06:41,659
you have to be impeached and on the bush

53
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:53,688
you get 1840 GMT and then somebody tell
basically change to have lunch and

54
00:06:53,689 --> 00:07:00,399
programmable function being on the added
you get to programmable PMC free space

55
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:04,789
you can be programmed to morning
different performance to match and you

56
00:07:04,789 --> 00:07:09,248
get three points in congress so there is
some variation

57
00:07:09,249 --> 00:07:13,909
implementation of these things to the
feed if it is not consistent across all

58
00:07:13,909 --> 00:07:20,199
during a meeting some of the things you
need to take into account which actual

59
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:24,529
hardware running on PCP or anyone and
then query the fifty to see what

60
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:29,839
creative lol good to you and using tried
using the peaches 2.1 repeated that

61
00:07:29,839 --> 00:07:37,589
person in that CPU so in general the
performance monitoring counted as can

62
00:07:37,589 --> 00:07:46,199
monitor two main categories of things in
terms of the bands as well as you

63
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:52,379
mentioned so intent events like these
days so you really need to look in the

64
00:07:52,379 --> 00:07:56,539
manual description of other Internet or
any mic architecture that you're

65
00:07:56,539 --> 00:08:01,789
interested in but in general I didn't
have done this is that there are the

66
00:08:01,789 --> 00:08:07,110
deficit of performance you manage that
can be used with being she is that I can

67
00:08:07,110 --> 00:08:12,359
actually meant that these essentially
part of the architecture and not give a

68
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:16,959
specific anymore so they DA's optically
bends

69
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:28,219
meant to be a lot more consistent than
lot especially when I really like you do

70
00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:37,599
see a particular event available on a
given my track it so it is still a solid

71
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:43,879
piece doing nothing to give in adding to
this like the kind of moderation is my

72
00:08:43,879 --> 00:08:49,670
question for so that day the radiation
and

73
00:08:49,670 --> 00:08:56,449
CPUs you have a lot of models specific
performance events that weekend that you

74
00:08:56,450 --> 00:09:02,440
can monitor and everything like some of
this stuff like for example one of the

75
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:10,450
British Pound branch predictor fails to
predict branches that you can get a

76
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:12,220
based on that

77
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:18,020
know what I think that will believe that
have number of instructions accorded the

78
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:26,910
number of Easter Egg Drop received cash
lords and all these things available to

79
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:31,969
you and these things are not greedy lil
by other means direct the have this

80
00:09:31,970 --> 00:09:36,040
information without using the CPU
performance called it from stock up

81
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:42,390
ready for anything on the system and
another equality change that you can

82
00:09:42,390 --> 00:09:46,130
actually have a form of monetary
interests that would be triggered when

83
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:52,760
conditions he's mad when it comes to
even before me so you can be back on and

84
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:59,080
say I want to see if you to be
interrupted every time a number of 100%

85
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:04,950
of this distribution has taken place so
for all of us is this the BMI

86
00:10:04,950 --> 00:10:10,010
quite peaceful

87
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:19,480
control registers hitting the 504 number
to go into the details of it if you want

88
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:27,500
from a man quickly the CIA for campaign
like basically the prediction intervals

89
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:42,430
and basically that allows us to push the
morning and basically the predicted mode

90
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:50,030
the shower contains the bid to enable
the performance so in the end of this

91
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:56,540
week and he seemed corruption and this
basically means that this instruction

92
00:10:56,540 --> 00:11:00,660
available at any production level you
can't take this and you can make sure

93
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:07,310
you can make it such that if you want
real estate from hating on this EP 10

94
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:12,989
you will basically get a ball and that
can be tracked to see if i dnt was used

95
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:20,380
by hundreds software so this is usually
like if you think you can be defined by

96
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:26,340
TBM te dije and you can use it for
readership of things and I'm some kind

97
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:35,730
of the sample is basically that he made
sure how much and can be used and by

98
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:37,970
using this game

99
00:11:37,970 --> 00:11:49,300
receive all or not it and basically
infected and Mel Gibson of the IDP

100
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:55,630
entries Russia and Georgia

101
00:11:55,630 --> 00:12:03,220
to college you go to get into this
particular using diabetes section but I

102
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,440
feel basically

103
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:13,100
construction great time with my day that
you want to read and this account in

104
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:21,460
that money to counter so if you like my
resolution reads Rory solution reason

105
00:12:21,460 --> 00:12:26,350
all that but all this information is in
the manual I'm sorry the tickets you

106
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:34,660
wanna make sure that all the stuff that
we have a caller basically before an

107
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:41,469
index and then slight differences
between the results are returned more

108
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:49,570
than that but yeah everything and I did
he actually is basically there's no

109
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:53,130
indexing anything I did you see if you
read the timestamp

110
00:12:53,130 --> 00:13:04,600
structured interviews and the game 6 of
the same result but slightly different

111
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,640
format

112
00:13:09,640 --> 00:13:21,670
like this ok now going back to figuring
out why

113
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:30,910
well but my priority because he's a CPI
and CPI Rd instruction price different

114
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,410
leaf

115
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:42,209
Commission about the the British voice
hey this is how my basic information

116
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:45,920
that they sending them to all the
different things related to the

117
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:55,420
performance 13 and the game you can
manually added your idea what

118
00:13:55,420 --> 00:14:02,189
information you can get and how you can
get it in which supported and how you

119
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:23,950
can use it to the TV program guide and
they all the available soon

120
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:29,720
this message table so fall events and
things like that

121
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:35,350
unfortunately analyst in order to go
into this dish TV's

122
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:40,840
if you own a position and that should
give you enough information to make an

123
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:45,970
inference after work it is doing and how
we planned then work on that and see

124
00:14:45,970 --> 00:15:02,570
what is usual for runtime fitting

125
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:10,780
days basically 360 and all the
programming going to be settled by

126
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:17,220
controlling you should be able to get
everything 20 and show this is the kind

127
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:22,950
of state that keep you in after his show
to shut up you shut up the PMT sure

128
00:15:22,950 --> 00:15:28,360
recording manage we need to take steps
so I quickly ran onto a sexy lady other

129
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:33,920
words so basically to setting up forced
to shut up the MCS regarding the first

130
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:46,380
of all we can either we can like
conquering the contest by clicking the

131
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:55,750
controller ADC to the particular so
easily you can do this by Citi global

132
00:15:55,750 --> 00:16:03,340
control in the top 20 or resale
individual events elective for the

133
00:16:03,340 --> 00:16:14,800
proposed and the congress controlled by
30 you can be simply and basically if

134
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:24,740
you like using the technique with the
family before where the CPU interrupted

135
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:30,670
when he said among the performers have
been generated that if they need to be

136
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:45,949
best so dunno BBS we basically a though
each pH 01 2012

137
00:16:45,950 --> 00:16:55,600
number of events which we need to occur
to the each other because it also so if

138
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:01,930
you have a DVD about you often that a
number of events after 30 you'll get an

139
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:21,099
inside and outside so like most
operating systems will try to the

140
00:17:21,099 --> 00:17:32,480
functionality to basically and human
health function and can be used to

141
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:43,180
basically be here and if you wanted to
do it you can be appropriate local

142
00:17:43,180 --> 00:17:48,290
family that Big Daddy D&B

143
00:17:48,290 --> 00:17:59,420
what you have to look in that pic
already and I am sorry for the iPhone 4

144
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:12,740
p.m. I became very happy but you can so
used to maybe brutal ish the publication

145
00:18:12,740 --> 00:18:22,000
no one who is like 230 so if you should
be bak have said they saw how to

146
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:30,950
humans eat before the many things come
to those to raise money that called

147
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:40,630
itself so we need to set up that
performance and this can be fed up

148
00:18:40,630 --> 00:18:47,650
struck you that which you've been
reached a pretty good content and

149
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:57,400
basically so you have a fundamental
equity trust and reputation so each of

150
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:04,440
you figure out what you must do you want
and what what what they eat and then you

151
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:14,030
said and she drew the event that you
want and desire according to manage once

152
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:21,129
you have to set up the little bit and
then you should also make sure that the

153
00:19:21,130 --> 00:19:34,440
best looking for a little over 3000 and
all the EMT conduit East Asia can be

154
00:19:34,440 --> 00:19:39,500
scary said that and maybe you'll also
need to clean up by a shot if you have

155
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:44,250
to be up if you are using PBS so

156
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:50,540
how well that the p.m. just before
migration like really quite powerful

157
00:19:50,540 --> 00:19:58,010
what is the price back well using this
was truly free really because he seemed

158
00:19:58,010 --> 00:20:04,290
liberated and probably the season things
like that

159
00:20:04,290 --> 00:20:14,960
largely well there are i mean they're
all instruction timing under the coming

160
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:22,560
to play like for example 148 philosophy
of a conveyed to them during a 48 be

161
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:29,510
read by their very minimal impact of
actually using it in real life not hers

162
00:20:29,510 --> 00:20:34,090
I mean obviously if you like

163
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:42,659
combative 2012 matter what else it will
be it will have an impact but really you

164
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:49,380
for real usually like usually quite low
cost depending on how you depending on

165
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:57,450
how you doing so can be free and we can
get the discount obviously and you can

166
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:06,030
also see the duration between two events
if you want to do so from the cost of

167
00:21:06,030 --> 00:21:15,460
using the PBS system costs refused
receiving the same problem could be like

168
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:20,750
you know five minutes against flesh and
they like your decision-making off the

169
00:21:20,750 --> 00:21:27,440
SEC 101 that

170
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:37,440
we have different incident account for
different type of the time for about 30

171
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,080
seconds

172
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:49,090
different kinds of activities so doing
an interruption in with one of these

173
00:21:49,090 --> 00:21:56,929
will you take something like return
missus

174
00:21:56,930 --> 00:22:01,560
contraction predicted by then you get
out

175
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:09,450
400050 seconds and this will be tested
with a bad case scenario we force tasked

176
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:19,310
with cast which causes return this
message because internal shadow stack is

177
00:22:19,310 --> 00:22:28,480
invalidated another tax returns as
opposed to taking the task so it's not

178
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,090
too bad

179
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:41,970
termos another particular interest in
his last will cast the cache memory

180
00:22:41,970 --> 00:22:50,430
accesses not found in the last couple of
catching typically three but you get

181
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:53,810
around

182
00:22:53,810 --> 00:23:07,990
you're talking about so there is no such
thing as a free lunch you can't hold

183
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:16,190
their event but you can use to interrupt
accordingly the event you're actually

184
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:21,080
getting in trouble on every

185
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:36,220
unlikely to be reasonable strategy to
minimize the performance penalty if ever

186
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:44,570
talk about down so I'm idea when you put
all those things together all weekend me

187
00:23:44,570 --> 00:23:51,080
myself going back so basically we can
use probability

188
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:57,530
section and mitigation and basically
used to be good comment on the truck

189
00:23:57,530 --> 00:24:03,310
right then every event and basically
that way

190
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:08,659
expressing costs will be basically
segmented into the number of fossils

191
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:19,580
that are discussing and we can also
leave but most likely 303 between go to

192
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:24,960
school because basically the number of
events and therefore reduce the

193
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:31,690
performance penalties and we can also do
this process level so we can basically

194
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:35,980
use this money money her execution

195
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:43,870
statistics generated by the city
policies that could be used for only

196
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:53,270
like like like you back and you can also
make you can also set up so that it can

197
00:24:53,270 --> 00:24:57,809
be evaluated or create only at certain
points

198
00:24:57,809 --> 00:25:04,470
operation not all the time and you can
also add in Kampala turn that basically

199
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:08,740
allows you to generate statistics on one
of those things you have to do the

200
00:25:08,740 --> 00:25:16,040
compiled and generated so this is also a
good and interesting way to study the

201
00:25:16,040 --> 00:25:23,260
more you know more performance wise it
was fashioned like that rather than

202
00:25:23,260 --> 00:25:28,260
looking for something that's going to
happen to you can you get the program at

203
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:32,790
compile time so that the generated code
will be generating you benefit of

204
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:38,690
receipt will be achieved that you get
enough for them and in runtime you can

205
00:25:38,690 --> 00:25:47,000
do it by type of books that fit into
your pants down and we can stop it we

206
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:58,720
can evaluate those points and so like
Jeremy be using them even using like

207
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:07,390
watching the possibilities better to do
that on rarer offense rather than on

208
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:11,680
most frequent just wanted to say that

209
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:17,000
return to topics in this life again and
again the rest of the story so you

210
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:26,120
remember one like this one is it ok
basically we're going to have quickly

211
00:26:26,120 --> 00:26:30,659
briefly look at what kind of rough
indication that you can be there can be

212
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:37,010
used and I'd really want to get into
this too much but I mean I'm sure you

213
00:26:37,010 --> 00:26:43,930
have to meet with so rubbish dinner you
see something you like reading how

214
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:52,820
Robert 30 going up even more
deliberation of it and dicing said it

215
00:26:52,820 --> 00:26:57,510
that if you like that area

216
00:26:57,510 --> 00:27:05,870
executable code context but from that
areas and drop is basically a web-based

217
00:27:05,870 --> 00:27:13,739
did not only did just basically you
don't know whether or not they can be

218
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:20,240
defeated in many ways under the right
circumstances and can be quite handy the

219
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:29,180
third thing so I'm not greeted like bob
doesn't solve the problem entirely and

220
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:34,480
we brought all the teams like dumping
their programming like this according to

221
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:39,640
programming using doing all the defeat
up to go to prove everybody basically

222
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:43,950
using the features the memory of
presentation about this new setup this

223
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:52,090
machine so

224
00:27:52,090 --> 00:28:04,120
ok those days some of these guys
basically they put the game on Saturday

225
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:16,979
basically won the myself who had Chinese
for this so what it does and what he

226
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:25,340
does his last month according to be a
stack of CPUs and dads

227
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:32,389
recent calls and the point of it in the
morning and then they will they be a

228
00:28:32,390 --> 00:28:37,440
call us at that point they will
basically issue entitled to that

229
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,020
driveway to read the performance of
engine coolant Lord basically this case

230
00:28:42,020 --> 00:28:48,379
ABI style a stack of the last 16
branches recorded and then see the last

231
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:55,039
16 runs recorded is consistent with the
standard flow for that but he gave me a

232
00:28:55,039 --> 00:29:04,970
call with a phrase I thought highly
deviated from that year

233
00:29:04,970 --> 00:29:15,049
to install this particular case what we
call instrumentation used this technique

234
00:29:15,049 --> 00:29:16,580
to get by

235
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:26,418
16 launch so you can look at hopefully
it will get nothing so this is a way to

236
00:29:26,419 --> 00:29:33,830
get it out yet so great about it I
goodbye to optimize when I use it here

237
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:40,189
that basically anything critical planes
in the OAS read back to see the pool

238
00:29:40,190 --> 00:29:44,919
float that point within 90 days to go
before the 16th largest back that it is

239
00:29:44,919 --> 00:29:52,150
consistent with the law that if you do
manage to get that and interesting when

240
00:29:52,150 --> 00:29:56,539
we just keep adding from college crowd
track and basically what they're doing

241
00:29:56,539 --> 00:30:00,559
here for a prediction is that that
usually they usually before missing

242
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:07,080
content from 30 and then looking for the
right position here talking about so the

243
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:14,590
return address that by the CPU and you
are likely to get rid of it should

244
00:30:14,590 --> 00:30:23,299
because that you're attending to a Rock
City on not unusual that I returned to

245
00:30:23,299 --> 00:30:29,960
their base before the British guy gets
so the position in this game

246
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:33,929
will not have pretty

247
00:30:33,929 --> 00:30:38,690
beforehand to the season a career
because in the normal operation of the

248
00:30:38,690 --> 00:30:43,789
feet on the liberation of code it's not
her lyrics to these points and you don't

249
00:30:43,789 --> 00:30:47,850
like normally you don't return to the
gas directly and in normal operation

250
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:57,668
that CPU so this is an example of using
limitation 30 to get somewhere I talked

251
00:30:57,669 --> 00:31:05,510
a bit about for that we turn this is a
difficult task which is this is a way to

252
00:31:05,510 --> 00:31:13,510
eliminate this problem by limiting the
scope using 0 before we proceed I just

253
00:31:13,510 --> 00:31:20,379
say you could actually use the
instrumentation that came out I used to

254
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:23,909
do the same thing for you if you wish to
do so

255
00:31:23,909 --> 00:31:31,470
advantage of doing that kind of used to
get a much deeper stack and 64 you wish

256
00:31:31,470 --> 00:31:38,659
to do a stack of 200 you have no issue
you just need to instrument like you

257
00:31:38,659 --> 00:31:42,429
doing so

258
00:31:42,429 --> 00:31:48,009
the game activities using there will be
a stack like 157 with how we can use

259
00:31:48,009 --> 00:31:57,779
p.m. sees as well for the same purpose
but ok so basically that's roughly the

260
00:31:57,779 --> 00:32:02,789
basic idea of what people have done with
propagation and special effects of

261
00:32:02,789 --> 00:32:07,840
Propecia beyond sick and producing a
beach know I've seen some other people

262
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:13,529
do I mean I mentioned here but they have
they have done some staff section and

263
00:32:13,529 --> 00:32:21,619
things like that I value of seeing as
defense begins dropping and they've done

264
00:32:21,619 --> 00:32:29,759
it he said well so the only way you can
you feel that it was something that we

265
00:32:29,759 --> 00:32:34,519
want to make sure that examples and he's
like this I'm like to be to be by far

266
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:46,249
the only thing that you can do you have
anything to add before he ok so now we

267
00:32:46,249 --> 00:32:51,759
have we will look at how we can meet
again slowly will probably grow happen

268
00:32:51,759 --> 00:32:59,679
using the performance counters show
basically throw him a stop is based on

269
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:07,519
32 a recession that has published in
this paper about living in ddr2 RAM and

270
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:16,990
a brief discussion that and then Moxie
born and honestly what happened to be

271
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:23,419
doing their own helmet off right are now
in a different room basically exploited

272
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:28,429
fish and I believe that they believe
they basically modify the apt

273
00:33:28,429 --> 00:33:36,889
she's using me for being on how much to
get a little more and then quite

274
00:33:36,889 --> 00:33:41,619
recently there was a few people were
indications that that basically

275
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:50,389
exploited the dilemma from desperate and
speed up I think I don't really have a

276
00:33:50,389 --> 00:33:57,449
time to go into and defended by the
bottom line is that he has a memory if

277
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:03,169
you if you read like basically the same
memory like the memories lost enough

278
00:34:03,169 --> 00:34:10,780
then you can be closed between adjacent
memory in the same memory chip itself

279
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:20,869
basically the same memory and post
belief in the same proximity so that

280
00:34:20,869 --> 00:34:26,859
basically discussion need to call the
video showed up and they think so picky

281
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:38,500
three so basically you like that hmm
realigning to robust and then decide

282
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:43,449
their own and then basically you read or
write that Obama condoms reduce fatal

283
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:47,960
accident and then he knew road when you
called me back the contents of the robot

284
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:54,589
eternally get recharged again and he
said Josh doesn't stay forever you have

285
00:34:54,589 --> 00:34:59,900
a special tool to throw the refresh the
clintons to make sure that the Mondays

286
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:03,460
consistent

287
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:14,330
the quartet they published to try and
think we should

288
00:35:14,330 --> 00:35:17,500
talking about it

289
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:29,840
memory a great time and to avoid the
automatically refreshes on the default

290
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:34,780
is 60 seconds and you can

291
00:35:34,780 --> 00:35:36,770
so

292
00:35:36,770 --> 00:35:44,710
this is important because this is
important because we like do you have to

293
00:35:44,710 --> 00:35:52,070
be revealed that there's a special game
so it has to occur within the discretion

294
00:35:52,070 --> 00:36:24,940
to issues like that have similar issues
like a hammer affecting the thing in the

295
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:33,660
future as well so do you not just to be
sure to cause issues you basically have

296
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:38,330
to lead a lot of physical memory MRAM to
be that you had a bypass any CPU caching

297
00:36:38,330 --> 00:36:45,370
and show you can read fast before the
deal and refreshes between attrition and

298
00:36:45,370 --> 00:36:50,560
then you need to know which address to
read to coerce a bit flip in the distant

299
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:53,450
memory area at a significant

300
00:36:53,450 --> 00:37:03,520
crossing boundaries and basically what I
double sided hammering where they were

301
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:09,009
actually using like attacking tour
memory life slipping one the one in the

302
00:37:09,010 --> 00:37:16,390
middle and obviously the one you love
you that much

303
00:37:16,390 --> 00:37:22,868
likes to notice that on many occasions
so far seen

304
00:37:22,869 --> 00:37:30,519
loaded into the matrix that is listed
here by denying I don't want to be a

305
00:37:30,519 --> 00:37:46,890
little more hours as well yes and some
destination by the Dallas to completion

306
00:37:46,890 --> 00:37:54,900
and came out with it because they feel
that they can be mitigated or dumping

307
00:37:54,900 --> 00:38:04,730
himself at least to a large degree by
shut down to meet one of the other

308
00:38:04,730 --> 00:38:07,910
things that came up I solution with
increasing pressure but this has

309
00:38:07,910 --> 00:38:12,149
problems if you look at the legal paper
mache tend to do so it had to be

310
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:23,539
completely rule out any problems so it's
not be and basically increase their fish

311
00:38:23,539 --> 00:38:33,750
ready to party and refresh memories for
that period of time to finance

312
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:41,500
for this was something that we opt for
specification something that was

313
00:38:41,500 --> 00:38:53,240
supposed to be prevented if you read a
lot from this particular place in memory

314
00:38:53,240 --> 00:39:12,109
cause pressure that these are memories
of us being talked about ways to disable

315
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:16,300
flushing the cash for that because if we
run we had reached the memory of the

316
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:17,360
memories cash

317
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:21,480
you're not reading from the greeting
from the physical memory reading from

318
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:26,590
the cash so if you have any traction on
this topic but you should make sure that

319
00:39:26,590 --> 00:39:38,600
you do this and we needed a solution
between Fairfield /

320
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:46,790
not really that simple things because
you can work around it and like this

321
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:51,800
that you can flash the cash

322
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:57,980
getting to that but not like this year
and was offered a solution but I mean he

323
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:03,520
did he wrote me when you put practical
figured use doesn't actually on my way

324
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:22,250
to be sure you cannot find the physical
actress 1652 to gain security and this

325
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:35,240
is good because it's a need to know
basis for evaluating on because one of

326
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:40,810
the like i mean this obviously not the
way to cross the boundaries of this

327
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:51,640
place for the guys did was that baby 25
the base table entries like Michele

328
00:40:51,640 --> 00:41:00,560
solution to detecting and mitigating
issue basically because the clashes with

329
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:02,970
the data in the cache /

330
00:41:02,970 --> 00:41:17,540
wondering when we could lower cash so
you can run without any intermediate

331
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:26,460
refreshing because what has to happen in
addition to all and all for it and

332
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:37,440
pushes this fall and financial costs do
not miss anything

333
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:47,180
and successful or potentially addictive
than we can possibly shut down the temp

334
00:41:47,180 --> 00:41:56,078
mediation basically we have to meet him
in 25 medication and wanted me to get

335
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:00,880
into identification through this night
mitigation is actually one of the area

336
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:07,150
very talked about like this no problem
of not like detecting it wrong number of

337
00:42:07,150 --> 00:42:13,619
false positives because what we're doing
he said with what looks like what he do

338
00:42:13,619 --> 00:42:22,200
you delay the offending ted says that he
will form below to the nutrition 2011

339
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:25,980
happened we did the same machine tool
because getting progressively reducing

340
00:42:25,980 --> 00:42:37,960
delays the basic idea is that was
important we use every 10,000 cash

341
00:42:37,960 --> 00:42:45,680
commissions and if that happens twice
very short time we r BND look at more

342
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:56,399
down the memory reached so that the next
repression of all will arrive in

343
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:04,010
yet so that will cross the refreshing to
land the 2016 hammering the problem and

344
00:43:04,010 --> 00:43:11,920
idk she is essentially we're talking
about the family dog getting one species

345
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:14,329
such an attempt by introducing a bill in
the right place

346
00:43:14,329 --> 00:43:18,680
reading the rest of course it is fresh
and so we had to rush through this

347
00:43:18,680 --> 00:43:24,770
because it's good to a slide show

348
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:33,579
do it if you see an attempt to read data
this week the memory address and raise

349
00:43:33,579 --> 00:43:38,609
the memory of depression and he will
have to start over again from that point

350
00:43:38,609 --> 00:43:49,160
onwards and this rate of false-positive
quite unlikely and stuff first we have

351
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,339
to differentiate

352
00:43:50,339 --> 00:43:56,770
kids like all the will behave kind of
kids those are good kids that basically

353
00:43:56,770 --> 00:44:02,490
loaded driver and execute nicely and
will be taken this driver is not so well

354
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:09,549
behaved kids that are located itself
memory and

355
00:44:09,550 --> 00:44:15,210
execute itself from that is not very
well behaved and it's a great way to

356
00:44:15,210 --> 00:44:21,530
hide yourself from scanning we are not
going to talk about the will be going to

357
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:31,370
talk about the idea here is that
executes will trigger p.m. seized and

358
00:44:31,370 --> 00:44:44,020
execute code so we automatically get us
we know that could have been executed

359
00:44:44,020 --> 00:44:54,170
here we can traverse well known in those
March if it's not then we have a suspect

360
00:44:54,170 --> 00:45:01,140
we think this might be a rootkit suspect
can be dealt with by standard methods

361
00:45:01,140 --> 00:45:08,520
the problem was just searching the RAM
is quite possible to obfuscate memory so

362
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:13,050
you don't identify is cool but when you
actually haven't interrupt their know

363
00:45:13,050 --> 00:45:18,420
that his execution at this point yes oh
yeah that'd be a bad memory retention

364
00:45:18,420 --> 00:45:22,340
memory reach me look like a double and
seemed like what the funny thing that we

365
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:27,030
look at the statistics about the court
that actually excuse and see if to be

366
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:31,310
executing from these areas begin
operation of the operating system and

367
00:45:31,310 --> 00:45:42,580
then there's something fishy going on
that so all my just debts to offer

368
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:46,730
trying to retire which triggers

369
00:45:46,730 --> 00:45:58,000
but we ended up using email to this
because they are much rarer than retired

370
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,870
but virtually impossible to employ

371
00:46:00,870 --> 00:46:12,180
cash it's at some point and also the
penalty vs other things is that in

372
00:46:12,180 --> 00:46:23,290
humans tend to get the casualty loaded
and we don't see them do twice

373
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:27,710
actual processing referred to another
thread but we just recorded here wasn't

374
00:46:27,710 --> 00:46:37,400
event pass it on to another president at
it do stand-up testing for obviously we

375
00:46:37,400 --> 00:46:44,720
have a false negative problems we could
identify any coding using outside

376
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:52,839
promoted inside as well the problem is
that execution outside of out of much

377
00:46:52,840 --> 00:47:05,290
use in your comments will have too many
positives and performance father also be

378
00:47:05,290 --> 00:47:11,100
realized only probabilistic detection
there is no way to guarantee that we

379
00:47:11,100 --> 00:47:17,569
could actually trigger one of these
however it is unlikely

380
00:47:17,570 --> 00:47:20,130
that any route could actually doing
something with surviving here without

381
00:47:20,130 --> 00:47:27,540
being detected with this method although
there is a chance the creek or areas see

382
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:31,520
processing could be attributed to be
more rigorously tested we have not done

383
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:38,210
this but there's you have the option
that means to do basically any kind of a

384
00:47:38,210 --> 00:47:48,180
module and we would trigger and find out
that have potential sample much hype as

385
00:47:48,180 --> 00:47:54,740
a half thousand times to find a keeper
for her because we think that might

386
00:47:54,740 --> 00:48:12,290
trigger at some point rate by 25 26 27
28 29 although that meant I'll have

387
00:48:12,290 --> 00:48:18,350
another problem the problem is that we
need this is good drivers typed up front

388
00:48:18,350 --> 00:48:23,779
and center it is strictly required we
don't have to tell this doesn't work and

389
00:48:23,780 --> 00:48:25,270
this is feasible

390
00:48:25,270 --> 00:48:30,030
too much going around to it

391
00:48:30,030 --> 00:48:33,670
all those things like

392
00:48:33,670 --> 00:48:42,370
compilers this is probably very rare I
hope from the point that we have to take

393
00:48:42,370 --> 00:48:50,560
the cold outside of various traditional
and I'll just have to take over to check

394
00:48:50,560 --> 00:48:57,850
your questions you can ask yourself is
whose just technology we have helped

395
00:48:57,850 --> 00:49:03,330
offset technology where you can run and
occasional memory could have known good

396
00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:14,250
signatures to sort out whether you could
also have known that signatures

397
00:49:14,250 --> 00:49:21,260
method could be seated we're not the
only client using the other would could

398
00:49:21,260 --> 00:49:30,230
could override however I did you see my
statistics tell any tackles 21 we might

399
00:49:30,230 --> 00:49:34,490
actually know somebody's trying to
protect us

400
00:49:34,490 --> 00:49:39,180
avoid detection by these beads

401
00:49:39,180 --> 00:49:43,980
and we might actually get a chance to
change the image and directed at

402
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:49,140
Bradwell and also plz regulation baby
mmm 10 another layer of complexity to

403
00:49:49,140 --> 00:49:56,740
the whole process so we won't have any
time to cover the cash tax so that'll

404
00:49:56,740 --> 00:50:01,959
have to wait for another 5 free but this
lady will be on the website so you have

405
00:50:01,960 --> 00:50:09,640
to have the slightest idea as to what he
does so if that any questions at this

406
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:30,140
point I'd like today if we questioned if
that is OK to live action is the third

407
00:50:30,140 --> 00:50:37,690
level cash and shares of course and all
virtual threats by pretending that means

408
00:50:37,690 --> 00:50:43,950
that accessing memory from one call will
be able to be spotted and other core

409
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:48,118
because she was placed into calc for the
first quarter the second call will be

410
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:53,829
able to see this because memory accesses
faster so much of the time records in

411
00:50:53,829 --> 00:51:02,299
the memory you can know the victim so
basically what you the flyer the

412
00:51:02,299 --> 00:51:03,750
detectives from Flushing

413
00:51:03,750 --> 00:51:09,760
and you wait a second and then you try
to read it and if the reader fast

414
00:51:09,760 --> 00:51:14,490
somebody else used as memory and have to
slow nobody used to so you get

415
00:51:14,490 --> 00:51:18,899
information about other processes you
know the privilege levels outside of a

416
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:25,450
cent books I thought he outfitted p.m.
thanks maybe and yeah that's the kind of

417
00:51:25,450 --> 00:51:32,069
information again gotta buy cytotec 7
p.m. TV you can grab some degree as well

418
00:51:32,070 --> 00:51:40,620
how are we doing for kind by the way I
was so so something something very

419
00:51:40,620 --> 00:51:45,259
quickly I think we've shown that
performance counters can actually say a

420
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:52,190
lot about things that are going on
inside you that not normal and directly

421
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:57,930
related to malicious activity normal
activity in the very least and give it

422
00:51:57,930 --> 00:52:12,000
to a commercial activities like a
double-leg you get up on the website I'm

423
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:15,170
sure like a couple of days

424
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:18,290
life and that should be ideal but we can
talk box
