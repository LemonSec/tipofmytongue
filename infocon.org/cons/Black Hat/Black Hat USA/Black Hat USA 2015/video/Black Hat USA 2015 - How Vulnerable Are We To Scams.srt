1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
you are in recession how vulnerable are
we to scams by dr. Markus Jakobsson in

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:21,080
nineteen fine young the police I request
they formed a plus for them thank you so

3
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:27,909
much to talk about scams and metrics
associated with the camp today first to

4
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:33,420
give you some background here is a
collection of things start and upward

5
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,640
into consumer their britches and hacking
of course that lead to PII credentials

6
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,420
being stolen and that leads to identity
account takeovers and prudential fraud

7
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:51,399
marlin fishing just pretty much the same
thing and then their scalps traditional

8
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:56,649
scams scams in people's mind the
Nigerian scams but there's a big change

9
00:00:56,649 --> 00:01:03,199
underway in terms of what we're seeing
with respect to scams wall sconce result

10
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:09,539
in victim initiated payments so this
talk focuses on the camps and other

11
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:15,259
things that relate to social engineering
so if you look at fishing for example

12
00:01:15,259 --> 00:01:21,759
traditional fishing has a yield which is
the success rate has a yield of between

13
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,860
three and five percent now of course
it's very different for different types

14
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:32,200
targeted phishing which is what's called
spearfishing has much higher rates it

15
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,650
has rates of about ten times more you
could also get much higher yields with

16
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,780
what we might call sneaky phishing
attacks so

17
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:47,590
let me extend by saying started by
saying what is not a sneaky so if you

18
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:51,790
get an email that says that you got 48
hours to log in and get some information

19
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:58,960
not to make it everybody alive no status
of phishing attack however if you get an

20
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,610
email so that you're an eBay user ID you
getting an email from another eBay user

21
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:09,800
asking you about a purchase you made and
you have to click on a button and your

22
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:17,250
credentials of course eBay no study it's
you and you know get a response will

23
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:21,519
recast as a phishing attack that is a
sneak attack because even though

24
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:26,600
structurally identical somebody receives
an e-mail follow the link and Thursday

25
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:27,780
postured

26
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:33,950
sufficiently high grade but in the minds
and hearts of the user's this is totally

27
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:39,829
different so technically phishing attack
emotionally not so much and that's what

28
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:44,930
I mean by sneaky sneaky attacks also
have an order of magnitude higher yields

29
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:52,590
than traditional attacks so traditional
scams are not speaking at all in fact

30
00:02:52,590 --> 00:02:57,950
you might have read a paper by Cormac
Herley Microsoft from a few years back

31
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:04,170
where he talks about why Nigerians say
that they're from Nigeria right in fact

32
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:08,839
that is to scare off everybody who will
probably figure out that they're being

33
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:14,450
scammed anyway and we'll just be
pointless work for the scammer to talk

34
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:20,548
to and only keep those who are truly
gullible so that's a thing of the past

35
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:24,870
that's when the scammers advertise the
fact that they're scammers only to get

36
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:29,340
the true victims to come to seek them
out

37
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:35,750
not happening so much more and the
recent scams are getting targeted what

38
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:44,920
is happening is that scammers purchase
or just have data PII and credentials

39
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:50,579
probably from breaches since thats
there's a lot of such data and they fit

40
00:03:50,580 --> 00:03:56,860
into the system and they create much
more credible scams again writing it by

41
00:03:56,860 --> 00:04:02,870
about an order of magnitude in terms of
their yield of the attack so that's one

42
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:08,680
part of the stock another part of the
stock is to look at the sad consequences

43
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:13,799
of such an improvement of yield on the
psychological side namely there's a

44
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:17,989
corresponding improvement in the yield
of having things go through the spam

45
00:04:17,988 --> 00:04:24,060
filter spam filters depends so much on
what the end user does that it reflects

46
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:33,419
the end users opinion of the message so
to size up the problem there are three

47
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:37,520
parts really one there's a
consumer-facing part where the consumer

48
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:44,430
end up a diet has been measured about
four billion a year in the US alone and

49
00:04:44,430 --> 00:04:48,720
that is probably an underestimate
because it's not like insurance where

50
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,510
people reported when it didn't happen
it's the opposite

51
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:56,210
people don't report it when it did
happen because they figured what

52
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:57,320
difference does it make

53
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,890
but so this is a pretty decent estimate
it still and then there are still

54
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:05,890
portion of the consumer problem where
somebody else picks it up like a bank

55
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:12,270
ends up paying the costs of the deceit
when the consumer falls victim to it

56
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:17,000
they're not crisp numbers on that but
people believe that does something of a

57
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:22,820
similar or larger size and then there's
underpriced problem where the victim is

58
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:30,200
an employee of a company and entities
that suffered of course the company and

59
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:33,390
nobody knows the size of that because
it's simply not reported its

60
00:05:33,390 --> 00:05:37,960
embarrassing it's bad for the
stockholders to know it's silent but so

61
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:43,969
imagine those three parts and then keep
in mind that the consumer part which is

62
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:50,650
the one that is the most measured one
out of 30 adult Americans every year

63
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:59,419
falls victim to this the reported losses
every year is about $2,300 per person so

64
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:06,190
so it's not small it's not money now it
depends very much on what kind of scam

65
00:06:06,190 --> 00:06:11,640
were talking about how much money there
is the 2300 is damaged or many scams

66
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:17,169
that only harvest a few hundred dollars
then their scams that truly pumped money

67
00:06:17,170 --> 00:06:21,320
out of extensive one notable wine list
of romance scam with the average of

68
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:27,860
sixteen thousand dollars that's to begin
a life-saving the other victim many of

69
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:34,490
which are middle-aged women you might
think that this would be a scam that man

70
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:38,780
would fall for more but that's a mistake
meant think it's ok to go and meet

71
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:44,739
somebody in a bar women not so much they
feel much more comfortable on line and

72
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,849
therefore there for us

73
00:06:48,849 --> 00:07:00,539
this paper is looking at what what is
the block rates from the scan messages

74
00:07:00,539 --> 00:07:06,378
being sent out by the attackers being
filtered by the message service

75
00:07:06,379 --> 00:07:13,069
providers Gmail Yahoo Microsoft and then
being filtered again by the end user

76
00:07:13,069 --> 00:07:18,659
stand you for reading the message saying
now just fake we're looking at a good

77
00:07:18,659 --> 00:07:24,479
deal so the first part of the
presentation is the block trades for the

78
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:30,058
email service providers and hear many of
you might be surprised at gmail is

79
00:07:30,059 --> 00:07:36,379
actually not leading you got block
writes about 200 for Microsoft and Yahoo

80
00:07:36,379 --> 00:07:40,059
and then you got really weird placards
for Gmail and I'll get back to exactly

81
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:46,269
what this means between 10 and 98% and
it really depends on does the attacker

82
00:07:46,269 --> 00:07:50,919
know what to do or not and this is not
something I knew when I started this

83
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:54,719
study it's something like we could just
fell into and realized at the end of

84
00:07:54,719 --> 00:08:02,039
this while this is how it must work so
you got heels that are pretty decent and

85
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:08,800
this is not for mass messages that we
custom made in order to go through we

86
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,430
took scan messages have been around for
several years to give them a fair chance

87
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:18,490
we did not add an eastbound portion we
didn't do anything super Sneaky we just

88
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:24,759
tried to get it through the second part
speaks about the human component here

89
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:31,999
what are the block rates there well you
got the very Nigerian scams you know I

90
00:08:31,999 --> 00:08:36,959
managerial princess you know gotta money
I want to give it to you and small

91
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:42,468
portion of people think that is a good
idea about 4% of the population thinks

92
00:08:42,469 --> 00:08:44,980
it that's worth considering

93
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:52,100
you got an order of magnitude higher
right for what I call the sneaky and

94
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:58,410
I'll get into example with the sneakers
campus let me talk about how this

95
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:03,660
experiment was carried out the first
part about the email we created a number

96
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:09,149
of email accounts those tonight show on
the left side which are sender accounts

97
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:13,350
and those Today Show on the right side
which are recipient to come there these

98
00:09:13,350 --> 00:09:20,339
are just 12 accounts that were created
fresh by us they were Microsoft account

99
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:26,130
hotmail yahoo accounts and their Gmail
accounts and then I got a repository

100
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:34,439
about $300,000 messages from those I
took and sampled a few hundred that are

101
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:40,079
several years old I didn't want to very
nuanced I didn't want the ones with span

102
00:09:40,079 --> 00:09:44,599
portion and didn't want anything that
was extremely unusual but they're about

103
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:51,220
4,500 scan messages that were selected
at random from this crowd after these

104
00:09:51,220 --> 00:09:57,510
criteria but light and then in essence I
sent the scam messages from this account

105
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:04,339
to the recipient comes there's one thing
I learned to meet you can't do that on

106
00:10:04,339 --> 00:10:10,230
Yahoo and you know because they got an
alcohol-fueled and if you are a scammer

107
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:16,290
well if occurred at all trust her five
or ten or more than 15 emails that you

108
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:21,889
send at least two different emails each
one which is rather scant me they look

109
00:10:21,889 --> 00:10:29,220
it up they kick you out so in order to
simplify my work here I went for Yahoo

110
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:30,240
only

111
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,750
now I've talked to the people at Yahoo
and they said yeah sorry about that but

112
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:42,100
I'm happy so I created now only three
counts down the center comes they sent

113
00:10:42,100 --> 00:10:44,800
to yahoo accounts are sent to Gmail
accounts and they sent to Hotmail

114
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:49,660
accounts and they send these scammers
suggested I've collected and this random

115
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:58,920
at time intervals are between two and 10
minutes randomly selected now I added

116
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:05,550
one more thing and this might not be
entirely fair I i responded from others

117
00:11:05,550 --> 00:11:10,719
have been succumbs I send a simple
message text immediately you might ask

118
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:16,660
why did I do that this is not what a
real scandal get well actually real

119
00:11:16,660 --> 00:11:20,850
scammers would like that and some of
them seek it out and their ways to seek

120
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,380
it out but they typically don't get it

121
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:27,610
not without creating some recipient
accounts of their own that will respond

122
00:11:27,610 --> 00:11:34,370
thanks but they also don't send 427
different scan messages within a short

123
00:11:34,370 --> 00:11:39,220
period of time to take one and if
they're locked down which they will know

124
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:44,300
because there's no yield and also their
own recipient accounts they sent to want

125
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,569
to get it so they know they will just
changed its bad points and they will get

126
00:11:48,570 --> 00:11:55,240
through so what i doin what scammers to
it's different here but this is too to

127
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:01,579
get on most reasonable estimate of what
the block rates are now is an

128
00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:07,560
interesting part now my configuration of
two of the Gmail accounts failed and

129
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:14,459
they did not the response so I have one
gmail account to send responses and I

130
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:18,000
have all the Hotmail accounts and all
the concerts and this automatic thank

131
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:25,230
you and the reason that is interesting
is that's how I learnt what gmail doing

132
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:33,520
the Yahoo and Hotmail accounts about
two-thirds of them were blocked

133
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:38,569
so in other words the yield in just in
terms of delivery is 30 percent give or

134
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:39,370
take

135
00:12:39,370 --> 00:12:46,260
forty-minute really matters whether the
person responds or not it's a person

136
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:53,939
responds to block radius 10 percent
whereas if the person doesn't respond

137
00:12:53,940 --> 00:13:00,830
it's a 98% pocket fantastic so you could
seeger Yahoo and Microsoft a look at the

138
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:08,830
content to a very large extent gmail
email looks at the reputation of this

139
00:13:08,830 --> 00:13:14,650
under in terms of what recipients are
due to his or her messages of course

140
00:13:14,650 --> 00:13:20,949
that is bad news when this becomes known
and scandalous probably already know

141
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:25,420
because what's congress will do is they
will see their comments by sending out

142
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:29,709
messages to their own accounts and
respond or they will find accounts that

143
00:13:29,710 --> 00:13:32,860
automatically sends responses and there
are lots of them and they will send

144
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:37,690
messages to those and get responses
automatically and then they will be good

145
00:13:37,690 --> 00:13:41,210
for a while and that's a problem with
the Gmail

146
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:46,570
then there's one portion of this about
how it works that I did not investigate

147
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:50,460
and that's another common component of
this band filters that's what's called

148
00:13:50,460 --> 00:13:56,110
velocity if somebody sent a million
emails their problem that if somebody

149
00:13:56,110 --> 00:13:57,980
sounds in a day

150
00:13:57,980 --> 00:14:02,840
system messages they're probably could
know this is something of course that

151
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:11,430
scammers and they sound rather low
amount every day to avoid the velocity

152
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:16,670
checks and also the more they target
people and their staff to broadcast it

153
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:23,319
to the entire humanity and the more they
could only send to their actual victims

154
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:28,810
so let me talk now by the way I'm very
happy to take questions if anybody have

155
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:34,930
questions about this part before I go
into the second part human part but I'm

156
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,498
also find to take questions

157
00:14:36,499 --> 00:14:44,990
anybody's got questions and you have a
question

158
00:14:44,990 --> 00:14:48,950
grabbed the microphone

159
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:56,170
there's a microphone somewhere in the
middle so with the gmail account for

160
00:14:56,170 --> 00:15:01,180
that blocking does it actually block in
response to the sender or doesn't block

161
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:07,589
in response to the actual email the
content of the email very little content

162
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:14,280
consideration you could see that in the
difference here does does does

163
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,520
understand did not respond

164
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:22,319
ninety percent of the scammers
deliberate so they do have contact jacks

165
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:30,360
but those who did worse than one that
did respond you got a 2% delivery so it

166
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:36,110
makes a tremendous difference what you
do as a recipient or rather it makes a

167
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:41,380
tremendous difference to the sender what
it's typical the recipient do for Gmail

168
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:46,090
and it might be the same for Yahoo
Hotmail I wish I had the same

169
00:15:46,090 --> 00:15:50,550
configuration error was there and we
have done similar things but I can only

170
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:58,390
speak about email got it thank you thank
you

171
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:03,900
well as spam filtering company Cloudmark
in terms of outbound spam we've been

172
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:09,270
watching Yahoo for a while and they are
better than they used to be in terms of

173
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:12,600
blocking outbound spam so what you see
now is this the better version of Yahoo

174
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,930
and I also like to ask

175
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:22,239
Hotmail and Yahoo those block rate did
you try those with not sending a

176
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:26,990
response in the same way as to 98% gmail
and in that you know is there evidence

177
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:30,920
that that might change their block rate
to improve them so the question is did I

178
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:35,199
check not running response for the
Microsoft and Yahoo accounts and no I

179
00:16:35,200 --> 00:16:40,420
didn't I wish I did this was really a
fluke this was a configuration mistake

180
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:46,050
on my part and on my co-authors part we
meant for everybody to send responses

181
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:49,910
and we were puzzled at first and then
overjoyed when we realized what happened

182
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:54,610
but by then it was really too late to
start all over and do it for hotmail and

183
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:59,760
yahoo so it's a lovely experiment to try
and anybody interested in trying it i'm

184
00:16:59,760 --> 00:17:05,430
happy to give you guidance what to do
and to share some of these cameras are

185
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:11,220
just you might need to do this but I
don't know so let me jump into the

186
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:16,110
second part of the talk which deals with
human component of this which means

187
00:17:16,109 --> 00:17:21,770
house cami is an email to a person who
receives it with us comfort spam filter

188
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:27,199
hasn't filtered out now what you could
do of course you could show a bunch of

189
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:31,990
people and message and ask them how
risky business

190
00:17:31,990 --> 00:17:38,460
this is essentially what fishing IQ
tests do and they do

191
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:44,980
enormously marvelous this slip bad job
because these are leading questions are

192
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:48,520
leading questions and people are really
looking for things are looking for

193
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:51,240
spelling errors which is a thing of the
past

194
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:54,580
they're looking for bad your house which
you know under normal conditions that

195
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:58,559
would never discover but maybe if
they're at the height of their awareness

196
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:06,009
well in other words fishin' IQ tests
that show people something and ask them

197
00:18:06,009 --> 00:18:11,190
is this good or not simply don't work in
a good way of figuring out has been

198
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:15,820
developed for fishing to determine the
heels of fishing this is called

199
00:18:15,820 --> 00:18:20,918
naturalistic fishing experiments the way
it works is that you are the official

200
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:25,340
now the only difference between UN
officials will lead to differences one

201
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:29,090
is that you don't go to jail and the
recent you don't go to jail if you don't

202
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:33,149
collect the credentials but you do
verified you find tricky way of

203
00:18:33,149 --> 00:18:38,489
verifying the credentials to people when
they think that they go to real site

204
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:44,320
where they don't and that's where you
really measure the success rates are

205
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,769
various phishing attacks and you
couldn't figure out beautiful deal curse

206
00:18:48,769 --> 00:18:53,970
using naturalistic fishing fishing there
couple of big problems with these

207
00:18:53,970 --> 00:19:02,570
internal review board IRB still hate
them because this are very complicated

208
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:07,149
studies and a potentially do put and you
sure at some risk or perception of risk

209
00:19:07,149 --> 00:19:12,350
and that's a touchy issue they're very
difficult to decide how to verify

210
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:16,629
somebody's credential without actually
touching it and moreover without being

211
00:19:16,629 --> 00:19:19,908
able to touch it you must be able to
prove to them that action could not see

212
00:19:19,909 --> 00:19:24,289
your credential but I guess I know that
you entered correctly and this might

213
00:19:24,289 --> 00:19:28,158
seem like some kind of mind possible how
can you do that let me not get into that

214
00:19:28,159 --> 00:19:33,100
there's a bunch of studies I can give
you examples and references afterwards

215
00:19:33,100 --> 00:19:37,459
but this is how you really want to do it
if you want to baseline truth and you're

216
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:40,090
not official you're not a scam

217
00:19:40,090 --> 00:19:45,360
short of that what you have to do is
something else then these fishing IQ

218
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:50,959
tests that is better than that but not
as laborious as these other tests and

219
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:56,289
one contribution of this study is to
nail down a method to work a whole lot

220
00:19:56,289 --> 00:20:01,950
better and this is how it works you show
people messages

221
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:09,289
and you ask them what type of risk is
this primarily associated with him so

222
00:20:09,289 --> 00:20:13,549
you should have a bunch of things and
for each one they have a Chinese menu of

223
00:20:13,549 --> 00:20:17,360
potential risks and they have to choose
what they think is that not possible

224
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:25,120
risk I'll get and give you an example so
here's a message you have exceeded your

225
00:20:25,120 --> 00:20:29,399
mailbox quota your account will be
blocked a.m. tomorrow unless you request

226
00:20:29,399 --> 00:20:35,229
more space you can request more space by
clicking here and of course the user

227
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:41,990
will click direct will see something
that looks very much like their normal

228
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:47,980
login will enter their credentials and
will be fished this is a phishing attack

229
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:56,419
but is not a traditional you got $40 so
this is what I term sneak it right so if

230
00:20:56,419 --> 00:20:59,669
we want to measure this how would it
work and we would show this to people

231
00:20:59,669 --> 00:21:05,740
and then we will get into Chinese menu
so the options here that are given is

232
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:12,070
the recipient might get a computer virus
might lose his password there is this

233
00:21:12,070 --> 00:21:17,090
might be a scam and end up stealing
stealing money there is no risk there is

234
00:21:17,090 --> 00:21:21,289
a pin may get unwanted advertisement and
finally the recipients account may be

235
00:21:21,289 --> 00:21:26,760
blocked if she does not pay attention to
what are the options I give the subject

236
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:32,090
and they have to pick which one is the
most possible to get this the correct

237
00:21:32,090 --> 00:21:38,459
answer of course is the recipient may
lose is possible that that's what people

238
00:21:38,460 --> 00:21:42,769
should answer if they really know it but
we don't wanna say that anybody who does

239
00:21:42,769 --> 00:21:49,860
not answer this would have been
victimized thats mystic in fact there

240
00:21:49,860 --> 00:21:55,539
are lots of reasonable force here to the
recipient may get a computer virus and

241
00:21:55,539 --> 00:21:59,590
this may be a scam aimed at stealing her
money why do I call those reasonable

242
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:05,639
care to arguments quite reasonable one
is that they they lead to the same

243
00:22:05,639 --> 00:22:07,199
result for the under

244
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,970
for the end user says this is bad I'm
going to stay away for it it doesn't

245
00:22:11,970 --> 00:22:17,570
matter why they stay away from it so
they put the wrong reason has a right

246
00:22:17,570 --> 00:22:22,418
response that's one of the reasons why I
call this a reasonable answer the other

247
00:22:22,419 --> 00:22:30,210
one is that we may know the technical
specifications attack but what does it

248
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:36,139
matter if you know Joe on the streets
north or not he knows this is bad if he

249
00:22:36,139 --> 00:22:40,549
calls you know if somebody steals as
credit card users at any cost fishing

250
00:22:40,549 --> 00:22:44,629
well it's got the wrong word but it's
got the right idea somebody did

251
00:22:44,630 --> 00:22:50,529
something that so these are reasonable
answers for those reasons now they're

252
00:22:50,529 --> 00:22:55,809
also need the source there is no risk
that surely at Navan so the recipient

253
00:22:55,809 --> 00:23:01,980
may get unwanted advertisements yeah
that's naive in this context and also

254
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:05,360
the recipient account may be blocked if
she doesn't pay attention

255
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:09,219
super neighbor they're really fallen for
it that's the wrong answer if anything

256
00:23:09,220 --> 00:23:15,309
but let's call it no doing this to a
large number of people and look at the

257
00:23:15,309 --> 00:23:22,080
rates for this particular one you got a
naive read about one in three remember

258
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:30,610
traditional phishing attacks have about
a three to five percent yield this has

259
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:37,250
an apparent yield a 30% about an order
of magnitude higher mix ups this is a

260
00:23:37,250 --> 00:23:44,169
sneak attack now let's do the same two
other attacks this is a traditional

261
00:23:44,169 --> 00:23:52,059
Nigerian scam Syrian princess I want to
share my wealth with you what portion of

262
00:23:52,059 --> 00:23:56,760
people think that seems plausible
they've been given a similar Chinese

263
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:01,750
menu of options of course customized to
this particular attack it doesn't speak

264
00:24:01,750 --> 00:24:06,860
of you may lose access to your account
but it's it's really credible under

265
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,539
someone's

266
00:24:07,539 --> 00:24:14,539
the different options 6% that echoes
very well what we know about traditional

267
00:24:14,539 --> 00:24:19,320
Nigerian attacks now comes interesting
things

268
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:27,859
targeted scams and sneakers caps then
that you've read jumps up to 63% so for

269
00:24:27,859 --> 00:24:36,320
targeted attacks what it could mean is
that somebody breached a database and

270
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:41,428
then know for example that you're an
Amazon Prime shopper and sometime in the

271
00:24:41,429 --> 00:24:46,769
past you bought a pair of sneakers right
it's not so far-fetched in fact and I

272
00:24:46,769 --> 00:24:52,389
saw on doesn't sell all the goods are
sold on Amazon there lots of mom-and-pop

273
00:24:52,389 --> 00:25:00,059
stores many of them use software like
ship works she works has no capability

274
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:05,340
of forgetting any customer ever isn't
there so if a database like that gets

275
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:11,080
breached whether by malware hacker

276
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:16,820
very juicy customer information I used
this example because my wife got one of

277
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:21,759
these she didn't fall for it because
she's ridiculously paranoid because of

278
00:25:21,759 --> 00:25:25,849
my accident this and because I've
challenged a bunch of students in the

279
00:25:25,849 --> 00:25:30,570
past that they should try to fish me do
their best and my wife is also fair game

280
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:37,090
so she doesn't fall for this but this is
happening and it's happening a lot it's

281
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:42,158
better babe reaches you are so that a
lot of sneak attacks one common sneak

282
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:47,320
attack that also feeds on breaches in a
sense it's sending out an email to

283
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:51,389
people saying their anthem you sir
whether the recipient is another user or

284
00:25:51,389 --> 00:25:59,019
not they have a pretty big market share
we have been bridged and your dad i SAT

285
00:25:59,019 --> 00:26:04,169
there but we will provide you free
identity protection service for two

286
00:26:04,169 --> 00:26:04,919
years

287
00:26:04,919 --> 00:26:11,229
sign up here elegant way if you're not
entities you get people coming to you

288
00:26:11,229 --> 00:26:14,799
and giving you all your information

289
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,860
social security number

290
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:22,520
as you know bank information you name it
and that's rather successful not because

291
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:26,889
it's targeted necessarily did this
attackers and only to know that you're

292
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:31,420
not a loser I just know that a good
chunk of the population is and what it

293
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:40,559
sneaky sneaky because this comes out of
nowhere to the typical consumed a part

294
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:46,649
of this study we ask people for a bunch
of demographic information to see if you

295
00:26:46,650 --> 00:26:51,799
know men are more vulnerable or people
more vulnerable than young the only

296
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:56,918
thing that was really interesting as we
also asked people do not a sports caps

297
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:00,820
some people said yes and some people
said no and then we looked at the

298
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:06,790
performance between these two groups
there was no difference it's kind of

299
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:11,270
amazing don't just say that they're not
to detect this candid equally last year

300
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:19,049
as though she said they don't and if you
consider it it's not one guy gets here

301
00:27:19,049 --> 00:27:24,690
but it's a series of scams that you have
to stay free from we let people look at

302
00:27:24,690 --> 00:27:34,049
eight scalps actually some of them some
of them or not

303
00:27:34,049 --> 00:27:39,650
some of them were targeted looking at
others word and then we'll look at what

304
00:27:39,650 --> 00:27:47,850
portion of the population of our
subjects had correct or reasonable

305
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:52,840
answers to all of these know the answer

306
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:59,270
12% so you know of course double the
number of exposures and you'll see this

307
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:04,030
rate falling against you get any number
you want to hear it doesn't matter but

308
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:14,149
it speaks of the risk of the typical use
rocker context it particularly sad how

309
00:28:14,150 --> 00:28:19,720
bad span for work and filters do not
really protect

310
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:22,909
the reason is very simple

311
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:29,980
they're they're they're made to block
spam and scam is not a sense but surely

312
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:37,990
targeted so that is making it difficult
problem that the wrong tool is used to

313
00:28:37,990 --> 00:28:43,380
address to address a nasty problem you
can get more information in the paper

314
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:48,789
and if you have any questions I'm very
welcome to answer them
