1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,060
you're here for a presentation I panel
about how the Wassenaar arrangement

2
00:00:05,060 --> 00:00:11,050
export to Asian software affects the
security industry the panel will be

3
00:00:11,050 --> 00:00:19,529
moderated by Kim Zetter without further
incident without further ado good

4
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:20,410
morning everyone

5
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:24,570
you probably already know what that
arrangement is that I'll give you just a

6
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:29,630
brief introduction and then I'll
introduce our panelists and I just want

7
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:33,170
to say up front we want this to be
participatory so we don't want to leave

8
00:00:33,170 --> 00:00:36,700
questions for the end if you have
questions that come up for you at any

9
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:42,930
time comes microphones and we'll take a
break and take your questions so the

10
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:46,650
bison are mangement is export control

11
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:50,879
got a treaty but it's an agreement
between 41 nations including most of

12
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:58,040
Western Europe and the USA and it's not
a binding agreement I'm tired now

13
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,390
legally binding agreement what happens
at the forty one member nations that are

14
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:08,750
expected to pass export regulations or
rules or codify in their own nations

15
00:01:08,750 --> 00:01:14,870
that would either lock the exportation
certain products and services or require

16
00:01:14,870 --> 00:01:22,670
a license for them and in 2000 and 13
December 2013 by starvation was amended

17
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:29,380
surveillance software exactly was called
intrusions offer to the roles and now

18
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:34,589
member countries are in the process of
implementing their own rules to comply

19
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:38,840
with that he was already implemented
some that went into effect earlier this

20
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,500
year and the Aus Department of Commerce
is a division of it is currently

21
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:49,040
proposing its rules and if any of you
been following it costs a lot of

22
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,240
controversy because of the broad
definition of what they're using for

23
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,640
intrusion software and all the other
products that would be affected around

24
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:00,760
it so they've had their first round of
comments

25
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:05,530
and they've announced last week that
given the number of comments that they

26
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:10,050
received so far they will be going to a
second round of commenting and and

27
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:14,290
presumably that will result in a second
proposed rules were only gonna talk

28
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:17,420
about the proposed rules we have because
that's all we can address at this point

29
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:23,200
so I want to introduce our panel about
an excellent panel here can be a more

30
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,880
perfect I'll discuss this because the
people here have broad experience and

31
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:31,570
expertise in a lot of areas around
Boston are in that touch on it and are

32
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:34,980
affected by it I'm gonna start with my

64
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:51,180
also develops and brokers exploits 30
days and otherwise for its own using for

65
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:59,289
sale or at least it did until recently
announced last month that he was halting

66
00:04:59,289 --> 00:05:04,229
the sale of exploits after hacking team
was hacked

67
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:09,370
there were confirmation but we'd all
suspected or known that the company was

68
00:05:09,370 --> 00:05:15,760
selling its intrusion software to
repressive regimes and using it to spy

69
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:23,380
on activists human rights activist and
political activist it's particularly

70
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:27,440
apropos for what we're talking about
today one of the main reasons for

71
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:33,190
amending the bus and our management or
cited reasons is happy teen and its life

72
00:05:33,190 --> 00:05:40,260
and so i think is going to have
particularly interesting important all

73
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:44,380
of this and so feel free to ask everyone
questions when they come up to my

74
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:53,180
pleasure said and will break but i wanna
start which is an overview of the big

75
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:58,170
lot of confusion about what fasten art
says and what it actually would do and

76
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:02,230
how to interpret it and so I want nato
to start with a smile can ask Colin to

77
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:07,950
step in after here to tell us exactly
what what does it say what are the most

78
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:18,039
problematic parts of it and how those
parts could be interpreted so I make her

79
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:23,060
design and staff attorney Electronic
Frontier Foundation is Kim said and I i

80
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:29,040
do some work in this area may need to be
counseling security researchers I also

81
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:37,860
submitted comments today to commerce
department in July on as well as in

82
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:43,750
concert with Colin timetable and a
number of other people so the Boston our

83
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:49,529
arrangement and I think colony became
can give a history of it

84
00:06:49,529 --> 00:06:54,399
and what it actually controls but the
reason that that we're here the reason

85
00:06:54,399 --> 00:07:02,039
that were in this place is because of
companies like hacking team JAMA the

86
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:06,969
preacher sure these are companies that
human rights community has had a problem

87
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:13,748
with prolonged sells software to two
governments who do you really nasty

88
00:07:13,749 --> 00:07:22,399
things with the western democracies you
push the companies that are selling this

89
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:41,749
kind of software do you want happy
that's all you want to make sure so so

90
00:07:41,749 --> 00:07:49,949
the history of this controls go back
about a decade maybe I can hear you ok

91
00:07:49,949 --> 00:07:56,449
so this controls date back to about half
a decade in which it had increasing

92
00:07:56,449 --> 00:08:01,199
visibility into the into the
facilitation of human rights abuses by

93
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,689
Western surveillance technologies
increasingly this became evident during

94
00:08:06,689 --> 00:08:11,529
the Arab Spring in which both by
research methods but also by just those

95
00:08:11,529 --> 00:08:16,119
use of information we started to see
specific needs those specific names such

96
00:08:16,119 --> 00:08:22,360
as insist in Libya such as as tobruk or
in Bahrain such as

97
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,879
I can't even fucking became evidence of
what people knew which was that there

98
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:33,180
was a new and emerging market for the
the surveil the sale of sophisticated

99
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,828
technologies in order to allow
governments that were necessarily

100
00:08:36,828 --> 00:08:41,049
tech-savvy to conduct their own
campaigns of intrusion into violence

101
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:45,180
against their citizens not only their
own citizens but actually often

102
00:08:45,180 --> 00:08:49,540
diasporas abroad because of that
especially because the Diaspora

103
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:54,240
component there is increasing pressure
on governments to to start to to

104
00:08:54,240 --> 00:09:01,269
restrict the sale of these to certain
states so actually a step back and and

105
00:09:01,269 --> 00:09:04,600
note that in fact the Jew controls that
we're talking about are not the first

106
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:10,180
controls that were conducted for the
sake of privacy implications actually in

107
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:16,699
the 2012 funnier if there was a
restrictions on AMC coaches and actually

108
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:21,170
incidentally catcher catchers that came
into effect

109
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:24,990
quiet in the United States he said under
what's called the service here to just

110
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:30,500
listening control that's actually really
strict control when we start to use some

111
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:33,899
of these terms will use terms like
presumption of denial which means

112
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:37,930
effectively don't even bother to try to
get a license from us because we're

113
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:42,300
probably not going to prove it actually
this had already been in effect in the

114
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:48,399
United States House of 2013 so you know
that that sort of benchmarks that the

115
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,709
beginning of the of the use of what had
been predominantly sort of an anti

116
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:57,839
nuclear proliferation treaty and TE
conventional weapons treaty as as a

117
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,339
mechanism in which to control for the
the proliferation of

118
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:05,689
surveillance technologies and
technologies that human human rights and

119
00:10:05,689 --> 00:10:11,040
foreign intelligence purposes so what we
have as we have currently two proposals

120
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,189
that have been implemented in the EU and
are being considered in the United

121
00:10:15,189 --> 00:10:20,420
States when is the intrusions offer
control and it's really important that

122
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:24,729
we talk about these things we do so in
detail because this was actually highly

123
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:28,259
complex and a lot of the discussion at
least initially there's been a maturity

124
00:10:28,259 --> 00:10:32,290
and increasing maturity but at least
initially was predicated on I think

125
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:36,670
misunderstanding of what these these
controls are so we have to we have to be

126
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:41,089
very careful when we discuss it actually
intrusions offer was a controlled a sort

127
00:10:41,089 --> 00:10:44,829
of periphery of technologies around a
true from soccer well for the sake of

128
00:10:44,829 --> 00:10:53,849
time to tell me this was the first
control actually that was presented by

129
00:10:53,850 --> 00:10:57,149
the British government the British
government had been increasingly

130
00:10:57,149 --> 00:11:00,459
pressure domestically and
internationally because of the presence

131
00:11:00,459 --> 00:11:06,969
of companies such as gamma they had in
2012 actually gone to great lengths of

132
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:11,949
using encryption controls to be able to
to regulate the flow of them outside of

133
00:11:11,949 --> 00:11:19,089
the UK and led to another market
concurrently we had during the plenary

134
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:24,209
withstood the discussion of the IP
network surveillance control and this

135
00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:28,719
came out of france due to the
involvement of emphasis in in in Libya

136
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:36,519
the very highly publicized involvement
of incessant Libya providing substantial

137
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:40,050
network equipment substantial
surveillance equipment to the Kentucky

138
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:44,120
government again when we talk about
these sorts of things were using

139
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,689
specific terms that these two terms are
defined sometimes the definition of

140
00:11:48,689 --> 00:11:52,519
problems talk about that but when I say
IP network surveillance I'm not talking

141
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:52,780
about

142
00:11:52,780 --> 00:12:00,480
just dpi there's a there's actually a
seven if this and this and this and this

143
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,560
and this and this

144
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,349
the Defiant what IP network surveillance
is for the purposes of these controls in

145
00:12:07,350 --> 00:12:11,320
and we should we can talk about that and
people can look but I want to make that

146
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:17,550
very clear so they started to come out
and implemented in the EU and where were

147
00:12:17,550 --> 00:12:21,339
out is they were not implemented in the
united states in fact the united states

148
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:26,160
is generally the first the first date
implemented the way that the USM forces

149
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:30,630
at the way that the US interpreter
interprets it generally actually defines

150
00:12:30,630 --> 00:12:34,610
what it means for the rest of the world
but what you saw was a very sort of

151
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:41,150
public publicly evident inability to
understand how to conduct this really

152
00:12:41,150 --> 00:12:48,800
really come out of the progress of the
united states and so impact in one case

153
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:53,500
the Department of Commerce who is
responsible for the implementation in

154
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:59,310
consultation with a broader range of
agencies you put out something when they

155
00:12:59,310 --> 00:13:02,920
implemented some of the roles that came
out that year and they said the cyber

156
00:13:02,920 --> 00:13:07,130
security rules will come september
september passes and nothing and nothing

157
00:13:07,130 --> 00:13:13,880
and nothing and nothing until very
quietly it drops in May May 2008 I think

158
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:18,160
that's a very very beleaguered this is
where we're out where we sort of have

159
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:21,860
this Department of Commerce trying to
figure out what these rules are that

160
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:24,940
came from Europe

161
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:32,730
not on me when you are confusing to say
the least

162
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:47,130
the Commerce Department of Commerce
Department is is usually guided by my

163
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:57,810
industry to call technical chinese Vice
Bureau of Industry and security on these

164
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:07,709
regulations regulations that we've got
our music industry hey I can talk about

165
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:15,460
why that's probably a little bit later
and we got a 68

166
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:22,339
everybody industry and their mother is
the name that he needs to be calling

167
00:14:22,339 --> 00:14:28,939
putting tito submitted comments and it
was a resounding what the heck did you

168
00:14:28,939 --> 00:14:32,599
guys just do and that's where we are

169
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:37,329
commerce has since the close the
commentary and done what a lot of people

170
00:14:37,329 --> 00:14:44,089
urge which is say we know we screwed up
on this one we're going to revise the

171
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:51,089
rules and we'll have another comment to
that are already there were at the

172
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:55,870
crippled stage talking commerce stream
how to make these rules

173
00:14:55,870 --> 00:15:01,129
implementable without computer screens
so let's have a quick question for

174
00:15:01,129 --> 00:15:07,459
Atlantis what the problem areas are does
anyone know if when Boston are was being

175
00:15:07,459 --> 00:15:13,540
amended was there the kind of kick back
in Europe around the member states when

176
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:19,990
they're deciding this ended a consult
seriously with any technology as part of

177
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:24,850
the reason why this is exposed as a
conversation is in part 41 the countries

178
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:27,309
of the USS legal regime are little bit
more difficult

179
00:15:27,309 --> 00:15:32,629
practices such as deemed exports that
complexity but also to a certain extent

180
00:15:32,629 --> 00:15:38,269
is actually brought this upon himself
and not necessarily a bad way which is

181
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:43,980
the US government more publicly debated

182
00:15:43,980 --> 00:15:49,060
these rules in the EU member states and
so for example the Department of

183
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:53,489
Commerce did not have to be believed
open up the sixty-day comment

184
00:15:53,490 --> 00:16:01,560
they did it very clearly engaged in a
process in order to solicit opinions and

185
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:06,890
to state what their implementation is
and so the fact that this is a argument

186
00:16:06,890 --> 00:16:12,340
in the United States is a product of a
more open deliberative process that

187
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:17,540
seems to have existed in Europe it is
possible as I for starters I know the

188
00:16:17,540 --> 00:16:22,040
japanese government had gone through
consultations there is a language

189
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:28,670
barrier that that is is difficult there
but this is in part just born out of

190
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:33,319
Commerce going through public I just
wanna remind all the panelists answer

191
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,110
any question

192
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:39,560
jump in and also an interview questions
so I think we should move on to so what

193
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:42,959
exactly are the problematic areas and
the repercussions are possible

194
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:48,730
repercussions from them I know that it
can get really detailed so let's give it

195
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:53,610
a little higher on the details so that
we can not get too bogged down between

196
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:59,610
might want to exploit are not exploit
and all that you want to jump in first

197
00:16:59,610 --> 00:17:03,760
also have to say I speak for myself

198
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:09,200
current players I'm a scooter researcher
my concern of this is how to curtail my

199
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:17,030
ability to do research as a hobby or
more public areas are what caused the

200
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:22,099
diamond exports so for instance in the
BAS language there are talks about the

201
00:17:22,099 --> 00:17:23,409
technology required

202
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:30,110
development tools and proprietary
research and indeed exports and see what

203
00:17:30,110 --> 00:17:40,219
they could become problematic is yes I'm
also not a voyeur so I write for any

204
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,580
corrections on me

205
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:45,669
also ask mister I don't want to have to
consult a lawyer before I go to work to

206
00:17:45,670 --> 00:17:51,540
know I'm going to the gym but deemed
export as I understand it in the ER

207
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:59,190
definition includes oral tension so for
instance and also applied to every

208
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:03,640
situation that is not public or not
immediately due for publication and

209
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:09,600
technology required for the development
of engine tools includes I own abilities

210
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,709
and techniques for bypassing type of
controls might be hiding from an

211
00:18:13,710 --> 00:18:20,960
antivirus engine wear this runs into
very sticky details is if if I find him

212
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:26,070
guilty in Joesph whatever because none
of these regulations just like anything

213
00:18:26,070 --> 00:18:33,360
about what classes where the size of the
user base and I use that to say you know

214
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:33,760
what

215
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:38,330
here's a picture called it we need to be
aware of the need to defend against and

216
00:18:38,330 --> 00:18:44,669
maybe start work life time to go to the
disclosure process and open myself up to

217
00:18:44,670 --> 00:18:50,420
cancel risks that way but I know where
she's like this I can't get into that

218
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:56,269
for non-us person and I work with a
coworker Nov 05 hehe

219
00:18:56,269 --> 00:19:06,609
I am running afoul of these regulations
as they understand them and as I said

220
00:19:06,609 --> 00:19:11,989
one of those one of the more problematic
areas here is that techniques were

221
00:19:11,989 --> 00:19:19,269
controlled so if you want an elegy even
if I control even if the code is not

222
00:19:19,269 --> 00:19:23,769
controlled the comments are probably
control because you're describing how to

223
00:19:23,769 --> 00:19:30,879
techniques and technology before you get
to that there's a there's a there's a

224
00:19:30,879 --> 00:19:33,320
there's no point in prison if I'm wrong

225
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:38,458
the proposals and make a distinction
between exploit and 0 day exploit so

226
00:19:38,459 --> 00:19:43,869
anything that you described about mir
incorrect so they don't differentiate so

227
00:19:43,869 --> 00:19:49,759
I think we're kind of going into which
is firstly which is one of the one of

228
00:19:49,759 --> 00:19:53,019
the things that we're talking about is
as a part of the rules

229
00:19:53,019 --> 00:19:57,049
intrusion software regulate doesn't
regulate intrusion top of the control

230
00:19:57,049 --> 00:20:03,839
doesn't regulate itself it regulates the
basically the seat to infrastructure and

231
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:07,899
as as a part of that it regulates what's
called technology for development of

232
00:20:07,899 --> 00:20:13,389
intrusions so this is what was given to
the Department promise this is something

233
00:20:13,389 --> 00:20:16,928
in which all the summer people are
trying to figure out what is the what is

234
00:20:16,929 --> 00:20:17,750
the

235
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:23,330
what isn't true sometimes there is an
exploit what is the ad technology for

236
00:20:23,330 --> 00:20:27,889
the development of intrusion soccer this
is exactly what we're doing is referring

237
00:20:27,890 --> 00:20:33,220
to is intrusion software vulnerability
is technology for discussion include

238
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:40,240
vulnerability and exploit so when this
came out the Department of Commerce very

239
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:45,230
again to their credit and gave him an
epic you process and they took questions

240
00:20:45,230 --> 00:20:50,570
on a weekly basis posted to an FAQ often
it made people more confused but

241
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:54,080
sometimes it was clear maybe the more
confusing point is they said look

242
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,889
actually if not all of them

243
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:06,610
exploits they have to be this extended
criteria but if they do remember

244
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:12,540
intrusion software is not is not
actually what's control so what they do

245
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:16,620
say 20 days doesn't factor into but
what's interesting because as a

246
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:21,449
component as they say so the way the bus
networks is member states have to

247
00:21:21,450 --> 00:21:26,930
language specifically but they have
flexibility in the way in which they

248
00:21:26,930 --> 00:21:31,140
implemented what the like sort of if
there is a presumption of denial how

249
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:36,490
hard it is to get a license who can't
get their flexibility in that respect so

250
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:42,210
it is ahead as we are going to propose
that as a part of it we have a licensing

251
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:46,690
process that has a disclosure require
disclosure requirement actually kinda

252
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:52,400
including potentially the disclosure of
sorts but when the defense of it says is

253
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:59,130
we're going to have a denial in the case
of intrusions offer systems that include

254
00:21:59,130 --> 00:22:04,840
0 days a rootkit capabilities so it's
not that they're regulating 0 diz

255
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:11,280
themselves they're saying if a product
has the possibility of supporting root

256
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:18,420
root root 0 there then you're going to
be a presumption which is a death

257
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:22,530
sentence for an expert that's very vague
because friends and Metasploit you can

258
00:22:22,530 --> 00:22:26,530
just drop in a zero-day exploit written
as a display module now and that's

259
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:33,530
Tribune so boy has capabilities for your
tax place by that definition every

260
00:22:33,530 --> 00:22:37,290
single penetration testing framework on
the planet by that definition by it

261
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:42,340
being a framework has 30 day
capabilities and didn't say whether

262
00:22:42,340 --> 00:22:48,740
included it so I wanted to stay on that
part I care under UN and it really is

263
00:22:48,740 --> 00:22:54,800
well above talked about how this might
affect research and communication with

264
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:59,810
workers also I wanted to address one
other issue in terms of implementing

265
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:05,310
your own security software on your
system presumably that's going to have

266
00:23:05,310 --> 00:23:09,320
some kind of effect as well but did you
want to talk about the bug bounty

267
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:14,530
program said how this is going to affect
disclosure processes in general

268
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:23,230
and bug bounty programs in particular
our incentive or ability to structure it

269
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:29,180
is a subset of vulnerability disclosure
overall and the way that threatens the

270
00:23:29,180 --> 00:23:32,840
primitives vulnerability disclosure
alright something with the other

271
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:39,370
panelists have been discussing if I
could simplify what would it is what we

272
00:23:39,370 --> 00:23:43,139
need by me give you an example

273
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:51,820
rear have heard as it's been past few
months earlier in 2013 you mentioned

274
00:23:51,820 --> 00:23:56,939
that I was pushed forward to Microsoft
but none perhaps one of those programs

275
00:23:56,940 --> 00:24:02,230
were specifically designed to word
security researchers for coming up with

276
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:08,870
new exploitation techniques the language
in the litigation bypass County $100,000

277
00:24:08,870 --> 00:24:13,459
bounty that Microsoft has paid out five
times since then I have to learn about

278
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:19,060
the language is nearly identical to the
language that you know everything about

279
00:24:19,060 --> 00:24:25,450
exactly what is control so if you think
about it this is something that defense

280
00:24:25,450 --> 00:24:31,210
needs to learn about as far as early as
possible as opposed to which can use

281
00:24:31,210 --> 00:24:34,730
existing tax return

282
00:24:34,730 --> 00:24:44,270
example I'm pretty sure to become last
night on this example of an existing

283
00:24:44,270 --> 00:24:49,129
medications bypass took me two years to
bypass all the protective

284
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:54,220
countermeasures on you know on a given
platform that existing techniques often

285
00:24:54,220 --> 00:25:00,500
doesn't necessarily need to invest in
learning about how everybody reads learn

286
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:07,660
about these techniques so an example
that would have been actually not even

287
00:25:07,660 --> 00:25:14,230
possible to launch had been past few
months earlier I mean I didn't confirm

288
00:25:14,230 --> 00:25:21,429
this with the TWC lawyer who helped me a
couple of weeks ago that I don't think

289
00:25:21,429 --> 00:25:25,890
it would have been possible so
distinctly this is getting a new where

290
00:25:25,890 --> 00:25:31,540
Jimmy Bullard the disclosure that alone
research as I want to add actually

291
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:36,480
something about let's say microsoft word
designing medications and as part of

292
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:42,370
that they were they had a team that was
investigating new techniques and and

293
00:25:42,370 --> 00:25:46,629
that team included a non-us person so
unless Microsoft publishes those

294
00:25:46,630 --> 00:25:50,299
techniques those application techniques
which I don't think microsoft is the

295
00:25:50,299 --> 00:25:54,580
type of company to be publishing
techniques as I understand it they would

296
00:25:54,580 --> 00:26:00,610
be violating the BIS proposed rules by
having their researchers in-house

297
00:26:00,610 --> 00:26:03,740
communicate to their defensive
researchers are working on improving

298
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:09,070
medications if any of those two teams
included a non-us person that gets us to

299
00:26:09,070 --> 00:26:14,040
the export as well because it deemed
export it to you

300
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:19,159
you CenturyTel for national nationalism
so that's one of the ways in which to

301
00:26:19,160 --> 00:26:25,340
export provision of this is damaging to
even inside the same company

302
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:29,750
communication about these these
techniques that you would need to

303
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:35,180
actually implement defense I'm wondering
if you know where to look we're all

304
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:38,880
talking about worst-case scenarios and
I'm wondering why I understand the need

305
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:45,310
to have precise language and the house
narrowly defined terms and all of this

306
00:26:45,310 --> 00:26:49,610
but are we making a big deal about this
and also

307
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:58,439
the question is you know it's only an
export license what's the big deal so we

308
00:26:58,440 --> 00:27:04,679
have a doctor in the united states that
the short in his voice for Vegas there's

309
00:27:04,679 --> 00:27:11,530
a criminal statute that a person can't
tell whether their conduct would lead to

310
00:27:11,530 --> 00:27:17,809
criminal penalties for not that statute
is unconstitutional so average person

311
00:27:17,809 --> 00:27:25,840
ordinary Italians and this is a betrayal
of ordinary soldiers can't tell if

312
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:33,990
whatever they're about to do is a
violation of that statute is

313
00:27:33,990 --> 00:27:39,299
unconstitutional on its face so we are
making a big deal how big this is

314
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:46,770
because it has serious legal and
constitutional law perspective so we

315
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:51,010
don't just have to get the definitions
precise we have to get the definitions

316
00:27:51,010 --> 00:27:58,370
understandable or they are for sale and
what are the repercussions insisted on

317
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:02,439
another note katydid something but I
wanted to ask if you don't understand

318
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:11,620
and you do violate oh no I mean what are
the potential

319
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:22,760
its criminal and civil penalties so
there you can go to jail and five years

320
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:31,110
since a willful violation commission and
omission noted as one of the big

321
00:28:31,110 --> 00:28:35,939
questions and I think you're trying to
get at it in terms of consultation with

322
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:40,330
the right technology etc when drafting
original version is I think they did

323
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:45,699
attempt to essentially threat model this
when they put it together what we're

324
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:51,020
actually pointing out is that there's a
few key elements they didn't understand

325
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:55,490
vulnerability disclosure because they
thought vulnerability disclosure would

326
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:59,840
be protected because they assumed that
every piece of technology involved in a

327
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,419
disclosure would eventually become
public they did not understand the

328
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:09,640
distinction between between a technique
which may not become and a vulnerability

329
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:15,030
or an expert or all the rest of the base
so that is essentially gas and their

330
00:29:15,030 --> 00:29:19,520
threat modeling this regulation that
essentially why we're in this place

331
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:23,580
where we're struggling to push back on
these definitions really crispy defined

332
00:29:23,580 --> 00:29:28,290
but also point out areas where they
misunderstood the mechanics of what they

333
00:29:28,290 --> 00:29:35,480
were trying to control its so I wanted
to inject point going back to the

334
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:40,880
drawing board of Law Center like as a
researcher I understand the desire to

335
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:46,690
control surveillance tools and I would
wish that the language is crafted more

336
00:29:46,690 --> 00:29:52,350
focusing on the aspects of the tools to
make them surveillance tools and they

337
00:29:52,350 --> 00:29:56,209
cause less collateral damage to
penetration testing tools and other

338
00:29:56,210 --> 00:30:02,020
things that may provide external
instructions to system processes may

339
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:08,280
export trade some data but once you
start getting towards the aspects of

340
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:11,300
tools that heightened team and democrat
produced it makes them especially

341
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:16,360
offensive like I don't know capturing
Skype audio streams and bypass

342
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,580
encryption that way there's no mention
of anything like that and these are the

343
00:30:19,580 --> 00:30:24,580
things that make these products
especially useful for these reasons and

344
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:27,000
it would in my mind

345
00:30:27,000 --> 00:30:32,070
more clear if they focused on that but
don't you think though that especially

346
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:36,720
when delivering real penetration testing
services figure things out there about

347
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:42,580
the tools that we're going to use that
might also be easily classified as

348
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:48,970
surveillance tools there definitely are
and having done it myself like I did

349
00:30:48,970 --> 00:30:54,730
remember like to add some flair
screenshot or a picture of the camera

350
00:30:54,730 --> 00:31:02,080
however I feel like most engaging since
capturing audio streams from the target

351
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:08,189
computer setup a time capturing video
streams capturing your personal

352
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:12,880
dedication that is not encrypted once
you're entering into bad category like

353
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:19,560
you know delivered as a report that did
that your customer you pretty upset for

354
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:24,810
invading the privacy of their employees
in the basement you can yesterday

355
00:31:24,810 --> 00:31:29,870
experts and data just to show you access
so these are things that are unique to

356
00:31:29,870 --> 00:31:34,459
be surveillance tools that I don't see
being

357
00:31:34,460 --> 00:31:38,250
running in common with it testing
testing engaging abort their tools

358
00:31:38,250 --> 00:31:47,570
after you so we have customers that will
ask us to reproduce the type something

359
00:31:47,570 --> 00:31:51,320
like she coming from the enemy state
right and we have customers that want

360
00:31:51,320 --> 00:31:56,189
this is just how much we can reach and
and I want to see how hard we can dig in

361
00:31:56,190 --> 00:32:03,710
the privacy of their employees like just
like you mentioned the facility building

362
00:32:03,710 --> 00:32:12,960
the to leak on radar threats and radon
does a lot of stuff along with

363
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:18,140
Countrywide actually does all the money
it's completely undetectable by

364
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:22,030
president of our style is different
things what the customer ends up getting

365
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:27,490
it in his report that shows not only
where vulnerabilities are but the pastor

366
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:33,520
compromise access to critical data and
it shows a different possible to use to

367
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:38,050
covertly short trade data and we're able
to hit hard and didn't even use that

368
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:41,770
level threatened Coast Customs
infrastructure we can provide the

369
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:49,290
customer with Metro threat I i
understand the value and I agree with

370
00:32:49,290 --> 00:32:53,860
you on the value of the attack path as
well and showing the choice of attacker

371
00:32:53,860 --> 00:32:58,679
makes to get to that data but I
personally feel that like in Avengers

372
00:32:58,680 --> 00:33:02,410
disengagement like a single picture of a
webcam is enough to demonstrate you know

373
00:33:02,410 --> 00:33:03,720
maybe not a live video feed

374
00:33:03,720 --> 00:33:07,840
you know or just saying look we have
full access to the system we've actually

375
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:14,049
traded two gigabytes of stuff data that
is mean you need to steal your xxx will

376
00:33:14,049 --> 00:33:15,210
trade yo

377
00:33:15,210 --> 00:33:24,409
exel traded to the actual P I have to do
that but by two-time detected that may

378
00:33:24,409 --> 00:33:30,150
match the regular expression for credit
card number for instance

379
00:33:30,150 --> 00:33:35,330
enough to show the access and capability
and there's a well-defined line there

380
00:33:35,330 --> 00:33:41,199
that could differentiate surveillance
tools that are used for surveillance

381
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,760
from the tools of the penetration of the
skin she uses everyday

382
00:33:45,760 --> 00:33:56,640
question so my question is to phone you
know one question is export restrictions

383
00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:01,720
on software just the idea of it in and
of itself just seems illogical you know

384
00:34:01,720 --> 00:34:06,450
your restricting say source codes is
someone's thoughts how do you enforce a

385
00:34:06,450 --> 00:34:14,830
global Internet and is this just
financial software you pay for so free

386
00:34:14,830 --> 00:34:21,179
and open source software things like
that and you know how do you how do you

387
00:34:21,179 --> 00:34:30,359
enforce an expert restrictions so it's
actually a two-fold actually partly as a

388
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:35,330
result of the work of the ear open
source software is considered speech and

389
00:34:35,330 --> 00:34:37,179
is not controlled by the ear

390
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:41,899
secondly there exists within Boston or
something called the general software

391
00:34:41,899 --> 00:34:48,469
that is a saudi control node says this
doesn't apply to and what it says is is

392
00:34:48,469 --> 00:34:53,359
that if this is available commercially
off the shelf it is not controlled by

393
00:34:53,359 --> 00:34:57,859
Voss not part of the reason we have this
point of controversy is that what the

394
00:34:57,859 --> 00:35:02,400
Department of Commerce said is there's
only one thing that is not in

395
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:08,450
put it in the general software nothing
corruption and and what the Department

396
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:13,009
of Congress said was I said actually so
we regulating corruption we see these

397
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:16,730
things we have a presumption that
everything that would be controlled

398
00:35:16,730 --> 00:35:21,660
under intrusion software already employs
encryption so we're going to remove the

399
00:35:21,660 --> 00:35:26,649
generous offer no cold place and
exemption tsu in the United States and

400
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:32,329
so in part what they start to do and do
in doing so they start to winnow it down

401
00:35:32,329 --> 00:35:36,549
to a select piece of software which is
things that are not this is the

402
00:35:36,549 --> 00:35:40,579
attention they usually are not
commercially that are not commercially

403
00:35:40,579 --> 00:35:46,369
available that they had they are sold to
a restricted user base and exercise some

404
00:35:46,369 --> 00:35:52,609
level of exclusivity and who can
consumer and so we're that starts to get

405
00:35:52,609 --> 00:35:58,680
away from this being sort of open source
cloud projects ideally into something

406
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:06,020
that is being sold to some somebody
privately restricted highly and sold at

407
00:36:06,020 --> 00:36:10,279
a very expensive rate this is the this
is the intention of the controls general

408
00:36:10,279 --> 00:36:18,400
two points one another to control the
size or call mention sale and likening

409
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:23,490
the suffered a speech i agree that
increase after is great but if only free

410
00:36:23,490 --> 00:36:26,368
softwares beach and only commercial
software speechless like in that two

411
00:36:26,369 --> 00:36:30,890
publications books or speech blog post
and tweet their speech private

412
00:36:30,890 --> 00:36:35,430
correspondence not speech

413
00:36:35,430 --> 00:36:45,940
shows that there is a wide for a wide
variety of protected speech and these

414
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:48,030
categories are not sufficient

415
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:55,730
you mentioned encryption I was wondering
the mechanism to implement these would

416
00:36:55,730 --> 00:37:01,130
comparable to the nineties when we had
the export restrictions on strong

417
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:03,010
encryption

418
00:37:03,010 --> 00:37:09,349
sounded like we have similar the
apartment communities and forcing it is

419
00:37:09,349 --> 00:37:14,819
it the same mechanism in place just not
covering encryption but software in

420
00:37:14,819 --> 00:37:21,210
similar so in the nineties encryption is
regulated by the rules that we're

421
00:37:21,210 --> 00:37:30,640
talking about our department of commerce
during get thats case on behalf of dan

422
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:35,900
Bernstein against the regulation of
encryption aight are awaiting the

423
00:37:35,900 --> 00:37:45,069
government reacting to something very
similar means the controls ever looking

424
00:37:45,069 --> 00:37:52,049
at today I got restrictions from back in
my case study

425
00:37:52,049 --> 00:38:01,900
leg holes today we should learn from
from those original could do worse is

426
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:07,130
how much control ended up doing the
opposite of what was intended which is

427
00:38:07,130 --> 00:38:12,249
weakening the security of Internet we
are looking at essentially the same

428
00:38:12,249 --> 00:38:17,808
possibility with unfortunately well
intentioned regulations and where I see

429
00:38:17,809 --> 00:38:22,489
this we're sorry this is where we have
regulators and lawmakers who are

430
00:38:22,489 --> 00:38:28,359
struggling and age where conventional
weapons could be regulated in such a way

431
00:38:28,359 --> 00:38:32,670
but cyber weapons are an entirely
different different object for very many

432
00:38:32,670 --> 00:38:38,729
reasons and I'm much more difficult to
control using expert export controls for

433
00:38:38,729 --> 00:38:44,239
technology if I went to send out we are
in danger that during the Prohibition

434
00:38:44,239 --> 00:38:51,449
era for exploitation and often research
and much like the provision about the

435
00:38:51,449 --> 00:38:54,150
whole that that occurred in the United
States for what

436
00:38:54,150 --> 00:39:01,400
12 miserable years we do not need we do
not need to suffer the consequences of

437
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:05,439
such a state I think at this point we're
we're at a point where we can we can

438
00:39:05,439 --> 00:39:10,868
stop up and also add to your provision
of metaphors I love by the way

439
00:39:10,869 --> 00:39:15,059
regulating something that you can make
in your home in the bathtub is

440
00:39:15,059 --> 00:39:22,089
problematic but I mean a stronger more
793 the net interpret censorship is

441
00:39:22,089 --> 00:39:23,320
damaging wrapped around it

442
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:29,030
that's applicable to the liver alcohol
reference there's a difference between

443
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:34,630
the moonshine what the professional
distillery is true but not in the scope

444
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:39,850
of these regulations basically there is
no distinction of ability and Joesph

445
00:39:39,850 --> 00:39:43,900
keeper and if I W or affordability and
windows or Android two billion people

446
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:47,790
use and that's fundamentally the
importance of this conversation over

447
00:39:47,790 --> 00:39:52,130
whether the general software note
whether what sort of license exceptions

448
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:56,380
are brought to bear because this is one
of the things civil society action

449
00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:00,910
engaged in this issue starting from the
issue and this was one of the important

450
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:05,790
point was there is a fundamental
difference between what you know I as a

451
00:40:05,790 --> 00:40:13,180
computer science was doing to do with my
friends back in back in high school back

452
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:16,680
in college and what happened to him is
putting up in the level of

453
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:22,950
professionalism support and what the bus
in our control framework allows for is a

454
00:40:22,950 --> 00:40:27,370
differentiation however with the
Department of Commerce has issued a

455
00:40:27,370 --> 00:40:32,509
proposed rule out of town over old does
not differentiate these two things that

456
00:40:32,510 --> 00:40:38,230
I had my reading of the last couple
nights ago but the text I need some help

457
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:44,680
sleeping and didn't make a distinction
either general softening attempts

458
00:40:44,680 --> 00:40:48,470
intends to make that distinction with
the

459
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:55,240
I wanted to talk about so we're talking
about a third of the difficulties of

460
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:59,859
regulating this and also does the
difficulty of nine who you are and the

461
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:05,960
user is so after it was exposed in the
heading to me know that you're told an

462
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:10,360
exploit to hacking team you announced
that you were going to and sell it

463
00:41:10,360 --> 00:41:15,100
exploits and you feel that though there
is a need for some kind of export

464
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:16,359
control

465
00:41:16,359 --> 00:41:21,150
and that can help you know we're in end
user is in part so talk about that I

466
00:41:21,150 --> 00:41:28,319
think I think there has to be meeting
2004 salable and everybody is going to

467
00:41:28,319 --> 00:41:39,690
perform research and we're gonna they're
gonna be breaking assistance watchers

468
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:44,710
resigned today getting what I think is
control should be really prevent

469
00:41:44,710 --> 00:42:01,930
legitimate issue because I care about
last year's I think that I think that

470
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:10,239
there needs to be some kind of framework
towards the end users Council guest

471
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:22,130
vocals sorry but I provide one example
that I love

472
00:42:22,130 --> 00:42:28,420
children example is what I didn't 2013
posted a message on board with your

473
00:42:28,420 --> 00:42:34,160
Firefox you know that was in my opinion
I don't think that's the reason we're

474
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:38,660
actually ended up being something really
good but they need people like i cant in

475
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:48,390
which they go beyond a result of 10
people like hiking today are are just as

476
00:42:48,390 --> 00:42:53,960
they don't even under contract but
candidly and and

477
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:58,230
they don't care they provide their
technology to that kind of technology

478
00:42:58,230 --> 00:43:05,440
run characters and dangers in the right
place so it's necessary I I am not sure

479
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:14,990
about the idea actually control control
guns and handguns object was your day is

480
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:22,118
also objects but we control the users
and so i think that the better framework

481
00:43:22,119 --> 00:43:27,500
maybe something that focuses on the
user's you know framework like what I

482
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:32,470
was doing really can also get a group or
whatever else is out there people you

483
00:43:32,470 --> 00:43:39,109
have to be licensed to have some kind of
a process used by the train working ugh

484
00:43:39,109 --> 00:43:45,990
I think the trying to regulate here it
is you know is it's really interesting

485
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:51,330
do it is going to have a really big
impact on securities or negative impact

486
00:43:51,330 --> 00:43:56,000
and it's not just researches the effect
that either its online service is in

487
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:59,040
response to mean we have got it

488
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:04,060
you know we deliver penetration tests
and all our team members we have enough

489
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:13,070
to stop Luxembourg if we were if we're
going out and infrastructure and we

490
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:21,000
identify a newborn ability we can surely
provide the information first overseas

491
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:25,370
the people in my portfolio project and
also let alone here what about instant

492
00:44:25,370 --> 00:44:31,220
response what happens if your business
overseas offices in your piece of

493
00:44:31,220 --> 00:44:35,060
technology this local but for some
reason you can't actually the technology

494
00:44:35,060 --> 00:44:38,160
because it violates something like shit
you not to respond to this incident

495
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:43,460
before it becomes critical for a license
Company time you apply for the license

496
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:53,000
the damage of time that is specifically
or not it is but I don't think that I

497
00:44:53,000 --> 00:45:00,030
don't think it's focuses so i'm waiting
for time so I just a lot of people

498
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:05,090
standing I want to get two questions
will go with you first

499
00:45:05,090 --> 00:45:09,340
actually come back on something you said
at the start of the whole basis of the

500
00:45:09,340 --> 00:45:14,140
Wassenaar changes was down to us we're
being spotted the Arab Spring and the

501
00:45:14,140 --> 00:45:18,020
journalists reporting on this camera
Busters three years now for the Arab

502
00:45:18,020 --> 00:45:28,170
Spring and nothing but nothing was done
about it so why why now so it's because

503
00:45:28,170 --> 00:45:32,730
the process is slow it's because there
wasn't sufficient amount of legal

504
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:37,990
mechanisms in some cases such as the use
of encryption controls to regulate them

505
00:45:37,990 --> 00:45:42,819
that led to them leaving the country
that's also an important point as to why

506
00:45:42,820 --> 00:45:47,490
unilateral controls and unilateral over
enforcement of controls is ineffective

507
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:53,419
compared to a harmonized multilateral
regime which the vast arrangement is

508
00:45:53,420 --> 00:45:55,960
supposed to do obviously people can

509
00:45:55,960 --> 00:46:02,869
moved to you know like China export but
this is the this is the this is the

510
00:46:02,869 --> 00:46:06,119
interest of providing a sufficient
amount of tools to create a regulatory

511
00:46:06,119 --> 00:46:10,970
structure in order to exercise at least
some sort of government oversight and

512
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:14,240
some sort of transparency and
accountability towards those those

513
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:21,430
coming so we have time for just one more
question just any word on threat

514
00:46:21,430 --> 00:46:26,169
intelligence services they claim to go
out and mine data or cross the web and

515
00:46:26,170 --> 00:46:31,540
the dark with and goes up to their
clients this

516
00:46:31,540 --> 00:46:39,500
ok we have time for another question
apparently turned away from people and

517
00:46:39,500 --> 00:46:44,170
come back out

518
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:49,400
insights by the panel think you guys my
question really is I'm glad to establish

519
00:46:49,400 --> 00:46:53,310
a conversation I'm glad we still have
the opportunity to talk about it what

520
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:58,080
are some things that we can do as a
security professional community to kinda

521
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:02,210
ramp this make sure that our voices are
heard that we protect the ability to do

522
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:05,790
threat collagens you guys give us a way
forward

523
00:47:05,790 --> 00:47:11,020
just want to step in both KTM and Colin
have gone through the comment

524
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:16,109
extensively that have come in and if you
can address in that responding that also

525
00:47:16,109 --> 00:47:20,109
what people have been doing that doesn't
help the kind of comment that the good

526
00:47:20,109 --> 00:47:24,740
can easily get dismissed because they're
not helpful or no one really empower the

527
00:47:24,740 --> 00:47:31,598
feedback that we're getting good so
actually I've been a proponent of these

528
00:47:31,599 --> 00:47:34,660
rules and I i sat in consideration

529
00:47:34,660 --> 00:47:40,490
going for it and thinking how am I going
to get lynched coming to black and and I

530
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:43,609
reached out to some friends and I
thought well is there still constructive

531
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:51,750
and the answer is yes the proposed to
comment period is closed but bis Randy

532
00:47:51,750 --> 00:47:59,600
wheeler is going to be at one tomorrow
that's engagement and so even if the

533
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:05,089
comment period is closed the likelihood
of any sort of outrage getting sort of

534
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:10,340
attention is very high in the meantime
in addition to that we now know that

535
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:15,440
there will be a second a second proposal
and so that will have its own comment

536
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:22,720
period in which you can put in what is
helpful is not necessarily people put up

537
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,930
I think the jailbreaking community
misunderstood or I guess they understood

538
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:32,250
and put up some very farcical comments
some known people in this or aside this

539
00:48:32,250 --> 00:48:36,950
community put up some hateful comments
but the vast majority were people saying

540
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:41,259
I am afraid of this this is not helpful
that's good

541
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:46,080
it provides public pressure but what is
even better is to say this is the

542
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:51,529
specific things that are prevents me to
do this is what you want to enable this

543
00:48:51,530 --> 00:48:56,450
is how I think that you can fix it and
so the more that people can speak to

544
00:48:56,450 --> 00:49:01,140
material concerns and how they affect
their security operations the more the

545
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:04,830
BIS will listen to you and what ends up
happening at the end of the day all

546
00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:09,500
those suggestions get put into a table
and the more the people are saying the

547
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:14,330
same thing the higher the back gets
attention and and and you should ask if

548
00:49:14,330 --> 00:49:17,520
you're going to be a tough run tomorrow
I don't know if it's a faux pas to cross

549
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:23,050
reference if if you're going to be asked
Brenda ruler directly what can I do to

550
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:25,180
help you to make sure that you have

551
00:49:25,180 --> 00:49:28,859
constructive and doesn't put more work
on you as well

552
00:49:28,859 --> 00:49:43,578
of Commerce business is required to to
come up with a rule that complies with

553
00:49:43,579 --> 00:49:48,930
the original I think that they are
obviously they're engaged they're trying

554
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:58,069
to get comments back however about that
they would need to apply in order to not

555
00:49:58,069 --> 00:49:59,829
fundamentally in P

556
00:49:59,829 --> 00:50:03,630
the defense of the internet itself in
all of the various ways the panelists

557
00:50:03,630 --> 00:50:08,380
here and there is a few in the audience
would would have as an example of how

558
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:13,240
the rule would affect them and what
effect you know defensive uses of office

559
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:18,970
technology I think once all of the
carve-out are presented it will be clear

560
00:50:18,970 --> 00:50:24,129
that we actually need to revisit
Wassenaar itself I do not think it will

561
00:50:24,130 --> 00:50:28,520
be sufficient to simply men and a man

562
00:50:28,520 --> 00:50:32,759
and provide part about we will do so you
know as a community and I think that's

563
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:37,380
important but I think that should ended
up raising awareness when you provide

564
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:42,810
all of the exemptions required to to
make sure that this does not impede

565
00:50:42,810 --> 00:50:46,440
defense that we are going to have to go
back to us and our and talk about

566
00:50:46,440 --> 00:50:51,570
different proposals to get at get it
something that is more substantive and

567
00:50:51,570 --> 00:50:56,720
narrow to you the to the cause at hand
which is protect human rights

568
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,600
ok so we're out of time unfortunately
but if you want to continue the

569
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:04,410
conversation I believe people will be
