1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
this session is switches get stitches
presented by calling Cassity Robert Lee

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:11,519
and Aaron Leverett and so thank you for
coming out and attending and one last

3
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:21,070
thing please remember to put your phone
on silent or vibrate thank you

4
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:29,099
clearly a bunch of the trash cans so
this is riches get stitches episode 3

5
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,809
the first episode was at 44 can attract
the next episode was a Chaos

6
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:38,559
Communication Congress where I did the
talk alone I like to talk to other

7
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:42,400
people particularly these two gentlemen
they wanted to contribute both some more

8
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:49,489
offensive techniques and some I just
lost my clothes back on so one of those

9
00:00:49,489 --> 00:00:57,949
questions we have is what happens when a
guy gets on stage to a developer from

10
00:00:57,950 --> 00:01:02,329
Scotland and a former Air Force cyber
operations officer and the answer is we

11
00:01:02,329 --> 00:01:07,759
have no idea what you're about to find
out without further ado do we want to

12
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:10,200
say we are now let's talk

13
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:16,280
oK so that's the background of how here
today the previous talks of switches get

14
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,930
stitches are cover some of the
vulnerabilities from the previous talk

15
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,960
quickly and then we'll be covering some
the defensive techniques to those

16
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:31,679
vulnerabilities and also some other
buildings just for this occasion so this

17
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,810
is one of the former vulnerabilities
this is a network switch its actually

18
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:40,720
this one in case anybody cares it's
protected against dust ingress it's

19
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:47,509
built for industrial environments but it
hasn't checked for kind of top 10 so

20
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:53,329
these vulnerabilities or fix Siemens was
very good with any hikers in the room

21
00:01:53,329 --> 00:01:56,809
identify any patterns in the in the
session IDs

22
00:01:56,810 --> 00:02:05,310
CDP as well as these ideas stood out to
me and a colleague of mine requirement

23
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:14,060
because they are sending basically there
are hacks and you can see the COA and

24
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:18,720
that's it out to us as a so I put up at
the top of the screen how you would

25
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,590
recreate

26
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,130
the the

27
00:02:22,130 --> 00:02:25,970
hashing of the password which is not
particularly billion that's weird

28
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:30,490
forcible wrote a little script to strip
those off the wire and return the

29
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:34,090
password very quickly but more
importantly these session IDs right so

30
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:39,140
we can move on to the next screen it
should be pretty clear to you that the

31
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:46,250
uptight it last half of the National I
discovered that by playing with SNMP and

32
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:50,780
looking at the the uptime of the device
through S&P and I wondered what this IP

33
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:58,030
address right CoA 18 hacks it suggested
to me 192 attracts but I got very

34
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:03,460
confused because when I looked at the
switch itself the IP address and then I

35
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:08,250
discovered it was the client-side IP
address this is trivial 44 side which

36
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:19,590
has now been fixed after version v5 and
continuing at the obsession at least the

37
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:26,880
open gear box sets will compete with the
tiny SessionID I've seen in a long time

38
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:32,010
its characters and it's all hexadecimal
and it just changes over I didn't look

39
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:37,049
at investigating sort of how the random
number generated I just wanted a really

40
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:42,410
small and very quickly however this one
is already fixed because and

41
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:46,240
configuration item you can I use
extended session IDs is just not owned

42
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,030
by the cult having talked to opinion
about this when the reason behind this

43
00:03:50,030 --> 00:03:54,040
was to sanction and maintain backward
compatibility so it's easy for

44
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:59,019
installers no break especially to swap
the hardware out and not add something

45
00:03:59,020 --> 00:04:02,490
else they need to test something else
they have to worry about just drop in

46
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:06,730
PlayStation just work there looking
looking to turn this on by default in

47
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:11,380
future revisions and it gives us a
really long session IDs let alone so

48
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:16,290
fallibility found immediately fix just
by looking at the documentation the

49
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:20,150
things we want to do with this talk is
capture the themes of vulnerabilities

50
00:04:20,149 --> 00:04:23,960
throughout these these kinds of
vulnerabilities are a little bit endemic

51
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,070
in these

52
00:04:25,070 --> 00:04:31,310
industrial Ethernet switches and in some
of the other devices that and the next

53
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:35,970
night we find them again and again
that's why this is an important talk to

54
00:04:35,970 --> 00:04:40,120
give you know some of these
vulnerabilities are getting fixed or

55
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,410
just configuration options what are
things were really looking for default

56
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:50,500
configuration so that when you give it
to the two hundred page manual with

57
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,090
advice they should really be able to
deploy it securely pretty much out of

58
00:04:54,090 --> 00:05:03,479
the box ok so if you can make it how to
get a script this is you can do a couple

59
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:06,740
of things with this from a vulnerability
point of view this is quite tight

60
00:05:06,740 --> 00:05:10,610
request forgery but it happens to be

61
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:22,050
logs and figuration of the device in
down the configuration file and you can

62
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:26,670
upload the firmware as well now the
configuration file also contains some

63
00:05:26,670 --> 00:05:31,760
proprietary hashed password so if you
have a previous configuration file you

64
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:37,150
can upload of your choosing and then
play around with the device and then

65
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:41,260
upload the old configuration file again
when you're done and no one really knows

66
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:48,349
that this happened patch but we have

67
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:54,430
have a story to tell you in terms of the
timing of patches and Siemens from the

68
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:57,540
middle of the field very proud of them
took three months to patch this stuff

69
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:01,880
and did a great job of it so if you're
interested in using that proof of

70
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:11,490
concept you can just go on down to the
to the search my because I think you're

71
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:29,420
up anyway so I'm looking at the switches
so I was looking at this week's wages

72
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:33,110
and said do you want to take a look at
it as soon as I get fined

73
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:38,590
ago downloaded version 5.1 of the
firmware and we discovered that a

74
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:42,190
favorite tool of choice here has been
works were pulled it down and look at it

75
00:06:42,190 --> 00:06:47,340
basically it's a large zip file and
opening up the zip file and take a look

76
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:51,750
at again the first four items there were
rather interesting than being the RSA

77
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:59,120
private keys of the switch and that is
for people who collect remedies under

78
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,660
aaron is a real fan attracting private
keys I just do as a hobby I'm sure

79
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:08,400
there's other people over here so we
found his private keys we had to be a

80
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,859
dick about how useful they were actually
used for the HTTPS traffic between the

81
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:17,580
management planes in and talk to the
ricin and configurable rest of it these

82
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:22,109
are the default private keys they used
to secure session so just when

83
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:24,970
downloading firmware anyone could
essentially man in the middle that

84
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:28,360
process which it has a hilarious
consequences of having deployed the

85
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,400
device in the field

86
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:34,190
how'd you upgrade the keys when somebody
already has these keys to rejoin nuclear

87
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:41,660
upgrading their we are so we had a word

88
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:46,020
with Siemens about this it was only four
key they came back to acetone yes it can

89
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:49,669
be changed by the web interface however
there's actually no mention of this in

90
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:53,210
the documentation was over something you
should do is ranks up there with hustle

91
00:07:53,210 --> 00:07:55,859
hard coded passwords of default
passwords and nobody tells you should

92
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:00,520
change so they eventually came back to
us and said he's a brand new version of

93
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:03,909
docking station and had a whole page on
you should change it and this is how you

94
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:11,380
change it and you plug in securely which
was very well done on their part in one

95
00:08:11,380 --> 00:08:17,800
of the G devices I also found private
keys this is the gemacht link 800 but it

96
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,000
affected seven out of nine the switches
in that family the private keys reviews

97
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:28,450
for an SSH server which could not be
enabled and for the HTTPS server in the

98
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:33,760
case of the HCPs communications it was
particularly egregious in my opinion

99
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,460
because the passwords rancor text
underneath so basically if you had this

100
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:41,160
private key in your collection and you
could get a pcap then you could get the

101
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:45,069
password and username that was enabled
on the device and continue to manage it

102
00:08:45,070 --> 00:08:52,310
from from that this you know they they
basically say to change this if you can

103
00:08:52,310 --> 00:08:56,640
but there are no other channels which to
upload this key right this was the only

104
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:02,420
one so you could use telnet or you can
use https and your HTTPS had had a

105
00:09:02,420 --> 00:09:08,699
self-signed be there that was now
compromise right yeah a little bit more

106
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:13,690
about that later this is a good
opportunity to talk about human rights

107
00:09:13,690 --> 00:09:17,470
in our favorite phrases from this talk
is the problem with team management is

108
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:23,560
you have to actually manage your keys
this is a good example the device I was

109
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:28,000
just talking about the caricom we're
sorry the team is actually manufactured

110
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,700
by CARICOM and caricom had the same sort
of vulnerability with a different key

111
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:35,830
they put a different key in the firmware
and there it is

112
00:09:35,830 --> 00:09:40,470
now this is interesting to me because GE
is buying products and putting its brand

113
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:45,090
on it but they're inheriting a
vulnerability from another vendor when

114
00:09:45,090 --> 00:09:49,680
they deploy this device and in
particular initially erik Compton said

115
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,030
this was end of life for this brand of
switch and GE was unable to get a fix

116
00:09:54,030 --> 00:09:57,760
and this led to a position where we
didn't get any patches for the for the

117
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,580
firmware for these devices for eight
months right which is particularly long

118
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:05,550
period especially when you consider an
ICS environments people can take a year

119
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:09,770
to three years to patch because you
can't afford to bring the process down

120
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:14,829
to replace yours which is right and this
is your network this is carrying all

121
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:20,610
your process data so one of the other
switches we looked at was the G&S ways

122
00:10:20,610 --> 00:10:24,100
we don't actually have one of these
essentially we just went looking around

123
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:28,930
and found the firmware for it and went
digging the things we found with this

124
00:10:28,930 --> 00:10:32,650
highlight the problem of just looking at
the firmware what we saw with honor

125
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:36,880
abilities are issues we can actually
test and in discussion we eventually

126
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,300
found out they weren't really issues but
they're interesting to discuss in a

127
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:46,829
narrative sense so this is a device
itself again we just been will get

128
00:10:46,830 --> 00:10:51,000
breaking down we've noticed that
essentially at the bottom there's two

129
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,210
miles we can extract them out and
basically it's a Linux server and

130
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:00,860
there's a nice director at the top
called search which we'll get to in a

131
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:05,300
minute but what intrigued me was the
password file

132
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:11,500
defining cuz I didn't you just look
around there's a password and looking

133
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:16,930
into that we found essentially
undocumented users and hashes

134
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:21,959
weren't referred to and they weren't
particularly strong and so a bit of Jack

135
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,550
the Ripper we could find out their admin
exists with admin password guest is with

136
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:29,900
the guest password this was documented
there's also code user which is used to

137
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:34,939
reset the password if you've forgotten
what it is we have to bring GE for that

138
00:11:34,940 --> 00:11:39,600
and as factory back door and I didn't
break route anyone's really interested

139
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:46,840
architect copy of this breakthrough for
me I got bored I say we then reported

140
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:54,680
this to ge said we have this past week
trial we've got the undocumented century

141
00:11:54,680 --> 00:11:59,050
and they did some investigating said
it's there but they're not actually used

142
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:02,729
which leads me to a problem that I can't
verify that anyone has one of these

143
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:06,880
devices they want to lend me or once
verified themselves that would be ideal

144
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,180
because even in the case where we have
some of these would like to see how

145
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:18,670
different devices how are configured in
different scenarios so that you know the

146
00:12:18,670 --> 00:12:22,160
default state of advice when you upgrade
the firmware or when you buy it is what

147
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,689
we're interested and there may be some
variation of these devices writes it

148
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:30,010
took me a little while to confirm that
that HTTPS certificate was the same on

149
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:33,340
every one of these devices because I
didn't have multiple of them so we're

150
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:36,640
interested in your feedback in the
future this is also probably a great

151
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:40,490
opportunity to talk about a tool called
little black box that I learned out from

152
00:12:40,490 --> 00:12:46,500
a gentleman called Jake Kitchell he's
here but he does a lot of great ICS work

153
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,820
and he suggested to be looking at a
Google Code project called little black

154
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:55,020
box and essentially this is just a
database of default coded keys like

155
00:12:55,020 --> 00:13:00,770
private keys for the stage for HTTPS for
other things and I find It really useful

156
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:01,960
after he told me about it

157
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:05,380
you download it it's got something like
two hundred cheese in it already

158
00:13:05,380 --> 00:13:08,700
those of us in the research community
can contribute more keys and we think

159
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:12,310
this is our little private key
collection right you get on site you see

160
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:15,869
a device it is default configuration
state all the engineers believe the

161
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:20,470
traffic is encrypted what's it's not cuz
I've got the default keys so look out to

162
00:13:20,470 --> 00:13:24,650
LA and use it for your own penetration
testing before moving on is just worth

163
00:13:24,650 --> 00:13:27,329
noting is that if it was looked at all
the users in that text but this is an

164
00:13:27,330 --> 00:13:31,070
industrial networks and there's a cane
juicer there I'm still trying to work

165
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:37,290
out what games are gonna play but for
those collecting private keys his use

166
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:41,849
India but injuries defense their
original documentation says this is

167
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:48,480
their change it wouldn't have to go into
a good place to talk about how should we

168
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:52,970
be generating default keys on devices we
do think it's sort of a case of a vendor

169
00:13:52,970 --> 00:13:54,840
says here's the default keyboard please
change

170
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:59,020
it's not as good as him they have a
better way of doing it Patricia argument

171
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:05,250
against against having non-default these
kids are specific per device is that

172
00:14:05,250 --> 00:14:08,960
there's not enough entries in these
devices and that is true however in

173
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:12,710
deployment I've never seen anyone just
plug one end and not connect a laptop to

174
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:16,240
it and I do believe that a modern laptop
is strong enough to generate enough

175
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,820
energy for key management for these
switches also a lot of these kids are

176
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:24,710
self sign that's got some serious
problems right you can provoke a

177
00:14:24,710 --> 00:14:28,750
self-signed key not to mention we also
have the whole air gap debate so should

178
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:32,130
you even be coming out to the internet
for a certificate revocation list in the

179
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:32,910
first place

180
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:35,790
well you're not that means you have a
certificate authority within your

181
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:40,099
utility and I don't know about you but
mostly engineers I know are already

182
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:44,870
overworked having that manages
certificate authority as well as doing

183
00:14:44,870 --> 00:14:49,220
everything else that they're doing seems
to be a bit of a challenge if you are

184
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:52,430
doing I would like to speak to you find
out how effectively that's working out

185
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:56,270
for you if you're not doing that that
are you connecting everything and

186
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:59,650
managing keys over the internet I think
it's an interesting question that's one

187
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:08,160
of the things we hope to promote you to
discuss through this talk anymore said

188
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:19,640
no I think you come up with something
he's okay so in the GE switches well we

189
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,020
could have done this talk we just talked
about an individual vendor and went

190
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:24,710
through all the vulnerabilities that
vendor but we wouldn't we want to show

191
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:28,060
you that you see the same types of
vulnerabilities as you go from one

192
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:31,979
vendor to another so this is a
cross-site scripting and its one of hate

193
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:35,880
that I found in this particular web
server it also affected caricom because

194
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:41,370
they had manufactured the web server and
essentially you could make up a

195
00:15:41,370 --> 00:15:45,910
perimeter in the HTTP requests and put
cross-site scripting

196
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:49,670
so you have to choose the right
parameter you can just make up a

197
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:54,050
perimeter and it would accept it and
there were eight different calls through

198
00:15:54,050 --> 00:15:57,290
HTTP in which I could do that I didn't
go to the to the

199
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:01,800
further step of writing an interesting
concept that was enough for me I want to

200
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:07,180
move on to more battery and embedded
announces so for example one of the

201
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:10,870
things I want to look at was for my
integrity i've been trying to learn more

202
00:16:10,870 --> 00:16:16,089
about patching wineries and following up
on the work of Mike Davis and call-in

203
00:16:16,089 --> 00:16:18,259
show me some new tricks by patching
wineries

204
00:16:18,259 --> 00:16:22,670
so this particular binary I want to
patch in a new key right I didn't have

205
00:16:22,670 --> 00:16:28,370
the password for that default SSH
private key and I thought to myself why

206
00:16:28,370 --> 00:16:32,069
wait for the vendor departure I can just
catch the binary myself was with the key

207
00:16:32,069 --> 00:16:35,319
that I know the password upright and to
do that I had to figure out what was

208
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:39,630
going on down there at the bottom is an
adverse 32 and then you can see that

209
00:16:39,630 --> 00:16:45,399
there's another checks on being use down
below but there's not there's a couple I

210
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:49,399
looked at multiple versions the firmware
now and a lot of them are zeroed out in

211
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:53,690
the middle and there's some variation of
the these numbers so it is possible to

212
00:16:53,690 --> 00:16:57,800
create a malicious from where and who to
bypass that really even just with brute

213
00:16:57,800 --> 00:17:04,089
force even if you haven't figured out
what it is so what are the other issues

214
00:17:04,089 --> 00:17:07,579
that we want to talk about with with
this team of healing switch and the

215
00:17:07,579 --> 00:17:12,629
caricom switch that bothered me was a
das rite normally if you're doing I T

216
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:16,290
security would think das so why or maybe
it's a buffer overflow that I need to

217
00:17:16,290 --> 00:17:22,899
figure out how to explain but I almost
didn't put this in the talk and then I

218
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:27,860
thought about two things one this is a
network device and the dots is not just

219
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:31,809
for the web server right essentially if
you docs the web server of this device

220
00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:37,190
the entire device reboots to all traffic
on this network will drop for 23 minutes

221
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:42,240
while the device reboots from this das
now I know about you but I find that

222
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,000
pretty disturbing a particular when
you're talking about process control

223
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:52,169
network imagine this was an h2s system
and the alarms where polling across the

224
00:17:52,169 --> 00:17:56,440
network and there was some sort of elite
then during the time that you're tossing

225
00:17:56,440 --> 00:18:01,860
the switch you can't receive your safety
messages telling you that I'm also not

226
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:06,649
particularly impressed with this
approach right essentially there's a das

227
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,140
in our web server

228
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:12,200
so turned off the web server that is
that is the response essentially that

229
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,950
we're getting from GE with this
particular device now for those of you

230
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:19,910
don't have one that means you have to
manage this device using town that we

231
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:24,680
all know that pastors and tell me that
text so I am NOT impressed with us

232
00:18:24,680 --> 00:18:32,310
the solution so this is the other reason
that we put this talk I suspect that

233
00:18:32,310 --> 00:18:37,790
marina and Jason today if they're not or
if you haven't met them he's going to

234
00:18:37,790 --> 00:18:43,290
their talk tomorrow they were great
paper right with some other people about

235
00:18:43,290 --> 00:18:47,550
how you can use in denial of service to
control certain types of processes so a

236
00:18:47,550 --> 00:18:53,260
chemical process you might add a reagent
to particular part of the process at a

237
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:58,820
particular time so if you wait for that
moment then you just lost the switch and

238
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:01,639
the control signal doesn't make it to
where it needs to be at the right time

239
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:06,770
and the processes altered slightly right
now it's not my place to talk about how

240
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:11,100
to make things blow up you'll see that
more in their talks but after reading

241
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:14,620
this paper it occurred to me that I
shouldn't just forget about the DAS I

242
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:18,209
shouldn't just let it go and not talk
about it so I decided to put it into the

243
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:24,990
top right ok the first one I when I
first started looking at the opening

244
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:29,650
here actually before we talk about
disarmament a response

245
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:34,600
first of all Syrians give us the
responses about three months to you took

246
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:38,959
about eight months and I want to thank
them for doing all the patching done if

247
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:42,510
you don't mind giving the vendors round
of applause I would appreciate that

248
00:19:42,510 --> 00:19:48,560
because I think they did a good job
getting but we do also particularly want

249
00:19:48,560 --> 00:19:51,649
to call out one vendor opened here
because I sent them

250
00:19:51,650 --> 00:19:56,620
granted an old a right so this wasn't my
vulnerability it was a SSH

251
00:19:56,620 --> 00:20:02,070
right it's been around for awhile I
tested the device and they switch over

252
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:05,860
to pass and they medicated but they did
that in one week I sent them vulnerable

253
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:10,780
to report it was encrypted they replied
to me encrypted they told me before they

254
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:13,639
had a patch how long they thought it
would take for them to get the patch

255
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,170
done and they did it in one week so
again I want a special round of applause

256
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:32,640
for open gear and they also gave us this
which right now they gave us a switch to

257
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,080
test i think thats great so this is a
question

258
00:20:37,080 --> 00:20:44,760
borrow theirs is available online but
it's got a development environment it is

259
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:48,230
essentially an open device allows you to
build your own from where for it there's

260
00:20:48,230 --> 00:20:58,270
probably one of the better probably best
that looked at initial deployment we've

261
00:20:58,270 --> 00:21:05,990
seen nothing authenticated vulnerability
refined essentially post occasionally

262
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:10,500
have to have access to the machine which
makes issues we found whilst potentially

263
00:21:10,500 --> 00:21:15,179
a high impact really really hard to do
anything at all so the actual sort of

264
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:22,120
real impact is low the chances of
getting anything done so the first one

265
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:31,989
we have is on their website itself and
it contains a link that allows you to

266
00:21:31,990 --> 00:21:36,240
download the sport information
information contains things like all its

267
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:43,580
configuration all the users all sort of
IP conflict stuff useful information and

268
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:47,669
a link that you can download it to this
page is only accessible by the room by

269
00:21:47,670 --> 00:21:51,480
the admin / admin can only see it
however the URL itself is directly

270
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:57,740
accessible outside of that User to any
user is authenticated on board can

271
00:21:57,740 --> 00:22:03,620
essentially pulled out misinformation
and it contains things like the complete

272
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:04,739
syslog

273
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:10,670
and configuration which includes things
like key location later on

274
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:15,250
likely tables and other such things so
if you have access to the switch and

275
00:22:15,250 --> 00:22:19,110
your load on this which allows you to do
with usury numeration or maybe did you

276
00:22:19,110 --> 00:22:27,530
vote if you're a malicious insider the
next issue they had essentially get file

277
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:31,280
that allows you to pull down any
particular file that you're interested

278
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:38,240
in that you have permissions so tickler
we have their password file which is

279
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,390
much more sensible than geez password

280
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:46,860
there's no room essentially they're only
shadows there's no game user at least

281
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:52,809
much better initial deployment in the
box however because we've just done the

282
00:22:52,809 --> 00:22:59,420
previous act we know where the private
key again another election but again

283
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:04,570
this attack is only allowed if you're
already authenticated on the box and you

284
00:23:04,570 --> 00:23:09,240
have permission to read these files on
the device anyway so useful bypass if

285
00:23:09,240 --> 00:23:14,010
you don't have SSH access but beyond
that there's not a lot you can do with

286
00:23:14,010 --> 00:23:20,670
this particular attack within started
doing a certain extra preliminary stuff

287
00:23:20,670 --> 00:23:23,450
would you do with sort of device or
websites

288
00:23:23,450 --> 00:23:27,040
cross-site scripting and these guys
initially thought

289
00:23:27,040 --> 00:23:29,610
baddest they have thought this through
and have come up with good protection

290
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:33,719
you can see what tried to stick it in
the system description and his comeback

291
00:23:33,720 --> 00:23:37,220
saying no you can't let up and this is
the same for all the input field

292
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:42,710
validation is strong this device they're
really thought about it now however

293
00:23:42,710 --> 00:23:49,330
being slightly sneaky twice essentially
allows you to have a country XML file

294
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:53,939
upload or modify on the book on the box
itself so for this particular attack I

295
00:23:53,940 --> 00:23:59,620
looked into the box and I put
essentially cross-site scripting in the

296
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:05,600
config XML and then went to the page
itself and then got gripping so

297
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,090
validation really strong knocks it down

298
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:12,409
out for validation just missing a trick
there and it's just this defense in

299
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:15,520
depth thing that just needs to get
nailed down but again

300
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:21,000
you need to have access to the boxes and
just do or really nails as a remote

301
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:31,360
attack last issue we found was that
request forgery so this is the books we

302
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:37,830
sort of capture or a new user account
and so having captured that which post

303
00:24:37,830 --> 00:24:44,470
so we can turn this into a potential
attack web page allows us to do a post

304
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:52,240
and then if we had time to also look
into your page to do it will allow you

305
00:24:52,240 --> 00:25:01,020
to create that so in this case we can go
see them locked in a fierce arafat so in

306
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:05,570
summarizing for this particular books is
a strong default state compared to its

307
00:25:05,570 --> 00:25:11,260
peers which owns the issues in the
Siemens box like my first 30 minutes

308
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:16,410
looking at switches in general and G
books in particular they thought about

309
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:20,950
remediated some of these issues cross
validation have not seen that on these

310
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:27,860
other boxes while sees issues do have
sort tensely high impact of ice

311
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:32,679
realistically you like sitting
exploitation you have to be somehow able

312
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:36,460
to get the admin tool you looked into
the box and go to your malicious website

313
00:25:36,460 --> 00:25:41,770
the same time that's a real time for
training issue to get beyond already on

314
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:45,720
the network or something like that these
are all postal ventilation issues that

315
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:49,860
we found we couldn't find anything and
the last when I really want to make is

316
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:53,060
having talked to open care about this
they've essentially been fixing this

317
00:25:53,060 --> 00:25:57,040
fixing these issues and develop a sprint
I'm so to three weeks rather than bender

318
00:25:57,040 --> 00:26:00,520
patch time which is what six to eight
months so in that regard I think

319
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,160
overview

320
00:26:01,160 --> 00:26:06,770
laws just for having really fast
response I'm really fast patching had

321
00:26:06,770 --> 00:26:10,690
not seen anything like it I think that

322
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:17,370
the press as well as dealing with them
and one of the other things I like about

323
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:23,870
their model about things like Colin sets
up the demo is that because they're

324
00:26:23,870 --> 00:26:27,870
taking open source approach to this it
solves one of the problems big

325
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:32,489
infrastructure right which is why buy a
device from these guys and the plant is

326
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:36,780
operating the next 30 years are they
still gonna be in business when I need

327
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:41,210
to change the security configuration
because you know Mike Davis's police

328
00:26:41,210 --> 00:26:45,340
he's out of out of silicon or something
right like things change right the state

329
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:49,419
of security changes over 30 years and
the attack surface changes so you might

330
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:53,950
need to change the device vendor no
longer exists so it's open source you

331
00:26:53,950 --> 00:26:56,610
can start to do that and I think that's
something we could be talking a little

332
00:26:56,610 --> 00:27:00,949
bit more about you can be talking about
codice croat vendors who do proprietary

333
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:06,550
work and I think that would progress the
way we purchase and deploy industrial

334
00:27:06,550 --> 00:27:15,530
system devices so you just gotta move
across a request for drinks so this is

335
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:22,040
the haitian page we threw up so we can
see it's got a really strong password

336
00:27:22,040 --> 00:27:26,960
password because that's where one and we
specifically want to create as admin so

337
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,950
to get quick look

338
00:27:28,950 --> 00:27:36,020
question withdraw the users in the
bottom two basic admin already we've got

339
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:41,160
testing personal admin person to begin
with so and admin person is locked in a

340
00:27:41,160 --> 00:27:56,330
minute

341
00:27:56,330 --> 00:28:14,500
essentially loading on that page to work
sacrifice calculator

342
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:23,220
it's a good opportunity for Robert so
depressed yet invited Robert along I get

343
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:27,309
up here and say the defense is doable
and talk about that one of things I want

344
00:28:27,309 --> 00:28:32,678
to know about what they're doing is a
lot of people have asked us meeting up

345
00:28:32,679 --> 00:28:37,440
in the journalistic asked active so what
does this mean to us what is what is

346
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:41,570
this really impact in our community and
and I think one of the important things

347
00:28:41,570 --> 00:28:44,750
are realizes we sort of have these
defender narratives of what adversaries

348
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:48,960
do or when we think of how adversaries
run their campaigns we generally think

349
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:53,299
from a defender mindset the people that
have actually done not just been testing

350
00:28:53,299 --> 00:28:58,460
an expert research but actual network
operations and often and intelligence

351
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:03,169
from the people that are the apt you
don't hear from them in the communities

352
00:29:03,169 --> 00:29:07,149
we have these defender narratives and
when you look at how operations are

353
00:29:07,149 --> 00:29:11,439
really run from targeting industry
control systems and structure it's not

354
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:14,889
just one team just one person goes
through and does this so you'd have

355
00:29:14,889 --> 00:29:18,529
another team the generally get you
access to the facility get your to the

356
00:29:18,529 --> 00:29:23,659
place that this researches so this is a
breaking into the facility environment

357
00:29:23,659 --> 00:29:27,500
everything said the research this is the
once you're there what do you do about

358
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:32,610
it research and from an intelligence
agency or government standpoint of being

359
00:29:32,610 --> 00:29:37,600
able to own the network infrastructure
that is the goal in industrial control

360
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:41,980
systems to be able to understand what's
going on so there is no getting the ODA

361
00:29:41,980 --> 00:29:47,500
on the PLC or the idea that doesn't
matter about getting the 20 day on the

362
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:51,260
controller what matters is owning the
networks and you can learn the network

363
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:55,019
if you want to do damage to it or if you
want to own the network to be able to

364
00:29:55,019 --> 00:29:58,559
steal intellectual property of the
process data things like that so what

365
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:02,700
they're talking about is as simple as it
may seem just trapping you know dragging

366
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:03,570
and dropping

367
00:30:03,570 --> 00:30:12,169
the final here this is a lot of folks
tried to do to do the most damage in our

368
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:17,050
environments and so figuring out how to
find that monitor that defend against

369
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:20,530
that is critically important if we ever
want to actually fight back against the

370
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:24,810
advanced adversaries so before I get
into the defensive you think you are you

371
00:30:24,810 --> 00:30:38,540
get so we run the scripts and now we can
see the admin user is admin login and

372
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:43,110
use it that way now again is a backdoor
account was created but it's not hidden

373
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:47,760
so keep an eye on these things can find
these things can find these things again

374
00:30:47,760 --> 00:30:55,900
it's hard for real attacker to use place
to give a shout out to read write well

375
00:30:55,900 --> 00:31:01,400
join us and switches get stitches not
live on stage he wrote a blog post a

376
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:04,600
blog post about another brand of switch
that he was able to answer back to our

377
00:31:04,600 --> 00:31:09,540
account into an authenticated without
you being able to see that the account

378
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:14,629
even exist so not only can you can hide
it you can go read that blog blog post

379
00:31:14,630 --> 00:31:18,670
as well and see that these are kind of
general classes of vulnerabilities that

380
00:31:18,670 --> 00:31:22,190
you find in these devices but since
we're not depressed just how vulnerable

381
00:31:22,190 --> 00:31:28,120
the networks are we want to give you
some hope so sweet when we look at

382
00:31:28,120 --> 00:31:32,149
industrial control systems as a whole
especially for those outside the

383
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:36,210
community we think of this impossibly
vulnerable always had a catastrophic

384
00:31:36,210 --> 00:31:41,880
thing rate ticking down the nuclear
facilities oMG we're all gonna die and

385
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:46,480
that's the truth to the vulnerable
aspect of this we're kind of depressed

386
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:50,640
ourselves and how vulnerable and paddle
out of these development cycles were for

387
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:55,150
this which is themselves but we don't
have to wait on someone else to fix it I

388
00:31:55,150 --> 00:31:59,810
think there's a theme of embodied is we
want the vendors help you know it's

389
00:31:59,810 --> 00:32:03,570
great when opened here comes back and
says not only are not gonna try to sue

390
00:32:03,570 --> 00:32:06,399
you for which is what here have another
one

391
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:10,250
find his own abilities that's awesome in
as a research community that's a great

392
00:32:10,250 --> 00:32:11,100
place

393
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:14,928
but not everyone is like that and we
don't need the vendors I think that's

394
00:32:14,929 --> 00:32:18,870
one of the sound bites to come out of
this is we don't need anybody else to

395
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:23,219
defend our environments we need
engineers operators ot security folks

396
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:27,500
who ever to take a look at the network
to understand the environment that their

397
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:31,929
end and monitoring for these occurrences
when we start seeing things like the

398
00:32:31,929 --> 00:32:36,380
firmware updates all that all talk about
some of the basic tools of basic isles

399
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:40,549
of identifying these things and and
again drove looking from that attacker

400
00:32:40,549 --> 00:32:44,770
perspective a lot of people love to
build up the nation state adversaries

401
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:53,530
oMG the PLA sa whoever you want to say
they are so powerful and so amazing and

402
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:57,299
they just have all the time in the day
to focus on compromising little me that

403
00:32:57,299 --> 00:33:00,929
they always get into pencil ways fail
and I think it sort of ironic that the

404
00:33:00,929 --> 00:33:05,190
defender community has somehow thought
that the government has less power point

405
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:08,990
and less management less bureaucracy
unless things a deal with you know there

406
00:33:08,990 --> 00:33:13,520
are ways to defend against these attacks
and especially for those people that

407
00:33:13,520 --> 00:33:17,559
know their environments that live inside
the process that deal with these

408
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:21,870
infrastructures around the world they
know their environment far better than

409
00:33:21,870 --> 00:33:27,689
any attacker could a significant portion
of any attackers campaign is trying to

410
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:31,640
learn that environment especially in
critical juncture when you're trying to

411
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:37,620
do damage or still in porn information
from these environments we look at the

412
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:41,020
ideal ara for those of you that aren't
from the ICS community we look at the

413
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:47,129
ideal layout of a typical sort of
generic ICS network we're hoping for

414
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:50,980
networks that are segmented out we'd
like to see you go in and there's

415
00:33:50,980 --> 00:33:55,280
multiple managed network switches to
build a pool data from there's multiple

416
00:33:55,280 --> 00:33:58,418
points on the network to be able to pull
off of the neck and gather packet

417
00:33:58,419 --> 00:34:02,190
capture to look at what's going on if
there's a process and the process be

418
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:04,929
wanna map those out to see how they look

419
00:34:04,929 --> 00:34:09,320
independent from each other that's what
we want to see but from the vast

420
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:14,600
majority of our experience and the
community experience walking into it far

421
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:19,210
more often looks very Schleck when you
go into these networks there are no way

422
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:20,940
actually

423
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:23,520
and what's going on in these
environments even for the people that

424
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:28,690
have their own them and operate them and
that is what tends to depress me is that

425
00:34:28,690 --> 00:34:32,520
our greatest strength in the community
the thing that gives us the most

426
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:36,699
defensible territory is the folks
understanding their environment and

427
00:34:36,699 --> 00:34:39,449
noticing the abnormalities in the
changes in it

428
00:34:39,449 --> 00:34:44,480
those process engineers and architects
of OT our operations technology folks

429
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:49,399
that know their environment can spot the
advanced adversaries very quickly it's

430
00:34:49,399 --> 00:34:54,569
not that complicated in truth it can be
hard with time management processes and

431
00:34:54,569 --> 00:34:59,040
management or whatever we like to say
it's not an easy thing but it's a doable

432
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:06,880
thing so in terms of the challenges the
environment I did just one of those

433
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:10,250
light up to say yes there are challenges
legacy equipment you know who owns the

434
00:35:10,250 --> 00:35:14,530
problem is that the Union owns the field
level is it the the company that owns

435
00:35:14,530 --> 00:35:17,630
her own infrastructure does the vendor
have to be the ones that match the

436
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:21,440
system there are problems of ownership
and management and regulations

437
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:23,920
everything else to deal with so that's
not a cop out to say it's just simply

438
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,270
using our problems but when we look at
doing in December network security

439
00:35:28,270 --> 00:35:31,560
monitoring in ICS and Chris's drugs
gonna give a great presentation about it

440
00:35:31,560 --> 00:35:35,680
here on the 101 of how to actually pull
this off and we will be at the ICS

441
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:39,060
village and other places doing this and
showing the vulnerabilities and teaching

442
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:42,799
on it as well this week when we look at
knowing the environment I threw up on

443
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:46,920
here before even get to the
vulnerabilities that he had we heard the

444
00:35:46,920 --> 00:35:51,500
community this past year about the
nation state officers coming right

445
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,869
instead of just the Stuxnet that
everyone was referencing on the slides

446
00:35:54,869 --> 00:35:59,520
every single time we get to wear black
energy and have XP graduation guys we

447
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:03,480
gotta move away from stocks which is
great but when we look at the

448
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:07,280
environments that were in infected a
small network with habits this piece of

449
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:12,300
malware that was one of the three sort
of ICS starting out where we look at

450
00:36:12,300 --> 00:36:16,890
even just short data and pull up in to
say hey what do i have on the network we

451
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:22,299
see a couple IP addresses and we see the
ports of their normal going to end is

452
00:36:22,300 --> 00:36:27,500
sort of basic as that can be it is the
truth that in ICS environment they're

453
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:31,150
very static we don't have people going
to LinkedIn and Facebook or at least

454
00:36:31,150 --> 00:36:31,670
they shouldn't

455
00:36:31,670 --> 00:36:36,260
we don't have the environment of trying
to check my latest Twitter feed to see

456
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:40,210
if anybody hashtag thought leader to me
or what everything that right we have

457
00:36:40,210 --> 00:36:45,190
static process environments and we can
map those out and understand them and so

458
00:36:45,190 --> 00:36:48,390
we look at like the post habits for
instance the post infection of this

459
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:52,069
network will use all these ports and
protocols and he's all these IP

460
00:36:52,069 --> 00:36:56,230
addresses that are normal in our
environment if I only use Modbus TCP or

461
00:36:56,230 --> 00:36:59,880
502 inside my environment there's no
reason for me to see I so t SAP and one

462
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:04,230
or two in the different ports being
accessed instantly be red alarm for

463
00:37:04,230 --> 00:37:09,000
anybody in these environments it can
really be that simple technology but

464
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:16,270
it's the people to that engineers are
numerous literate people trained to look

465
00:37:16,270 --> 00:37:20,940
for anomalies they look for anomalies
all day long in the process so security

466
00:37:20,940 --> 00:37:23,710
anomalies are another anomaly you can
train them to do and they're passionate

467
00:37:23,710 --> 00:37:28,470
about it as long as they believe that
there is a risk to the process so in a

468
00:37:28,470 --> 00:37:31,649
black hat for DEFCON kinda talked to be
able to sit up here and talk about

469
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:35,930
capturing data which probably seems like
there are two basic to get away with

470
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:39,879
what they've dropped 11 vulnerabilities
in five different switch family so now I

471
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:42,440
feel privileged enough to be able to
tell you that you should capture data

472
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:47,290
network switches I feel I've learned
that right to say that that inside of

473
00:37:47,290 --> 00:37:52,240
ICS environments for my ICS folks
watching not just your normal hacker but

474
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:55,709
the folks that are really out in the
field and data bases there are ways to

475
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:59,450
do it and people processes and
everything else can get in the way but

476
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:03,558
our limitation is not one of technology
it's not one of trying to wait for the

477
00:38:03,559 --> 00:38:06,910
vendor to patch it's not want to try to
wait for the latest blinky box in my

478
00:38:06,910 --> 00:38:11,490
network to block 30 day whatever attack
its people and processes that we deal

479
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:16,459
with to try to do defense and to try to
make it doable and weak safely capturing

480
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:20,150
network off these structures it's not
gonna break your network to be able to

481
00:38:20,150 --> 00:38:25,059
me report and capture data safely do it
testing lab environment etc but you can

482
00:38:25,059 --> 00:38:29,720
do it more importantly just for those
sort of tuning is specially recorded you

483
00:38:29,720 --> 00:38:34,970
afterwards my ICS brother and sisters
rate the 101 may not be sexy but it's

484
00:38:34,970 --> 00:38:39,009
what trips up those adversaries right
I've been the nation state script kiddie

485
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:40,530
on the government side of the house
doing

486
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:44,350
operations I can tell you that if you
can find this kind of stuff you can find

487
00:38:44,350 --> 00:38:48,710
anything when you look at Stuxnet havoc
black energy whatever on the network it

488
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:53,340
stands out the problem is people aren't
looking for not using the simple basic

489
00:38:53,340 --> 00:38:55,700
things we have to monitor these
environments

490
00:38:55,700 --> 00:38:58,480
one of the reporters access a very good
question is where the press conference

491
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:03,010
leading up to this was how rapid is this
you know how rampant asses how often

492
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:07,370
inside of our spiciest environments is
this tough occurring in the truth is no

493
00:39:07,370 --> 00:39:11,580
one really knows we know what's going on
but no one's looking at the data no

494
00:39:11,580 --> 00:39:15,319
one's looking at these networks and that
is the most depressing thing to me it's

495
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:19,170
not just the network switches that have
our abilities is the fact that we have

496
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:23,710
really empowered researchers release
more process folks and we could do it

497
00:39:23,710 --> 00:39:31,110
but we haven't you look at like this
Wireshark biodata friends of a small ICS

498
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:36,110
network that if you didn't know the
process beforehand it's not going to

499
00:39:36,110 --> 00:39:37,930
stand out who had expected

500
00:39:37,930 --> 00:39:41,990
right okay there's a nice little heart
beat up there on the pre hacks network

501
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:44,750
that isn't there in the post have
excellent work you can set alarming

502
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:47,750
conditions you can understand that
environment you can deal with that but

503
00:39:47,750 --> 00:39:50,540
it's kind of hard but what about the
vulnerabilities have been talking about

504
00:39:50,540 --> 00:39:54,960
today especially from a firmware update
firmware update specially thinking from

505
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:58,360
a government kind of standpoint that's
the one that bothers me the most

506
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:02,420
the person that can add upload from
where to environment and basically only

507
00:40:02,420 --> 00:40:09,040
entire network infrastructure looks a
little more obvious understanding your

508
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:16,759
network it's really hard to miss the
giant box is something weird if you have

509
00:40:16,760 --> 00:40:20,940
computers that are on your network that
are able to do for updates they should

510
00:40:20,940 --> 00:40:23,780
be happening during down times they
should be happening in times other than

511
00:40:23,780 --> 00:40:28,080
the live network process they should be
happening from dedicated computers if

512
00:40:28,080 --> 00:40:32,020
you can identify those giant jumps you
just click on the top of the plateau

513
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:35,680
find the IP address and the time that is
going and off you are on your and

514
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:40,000
service wants way there are ways for us
as a community to not rely on other

515
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:45,440
people to be able to do defense and our
environments and two things I want to

516
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:49,550
say and one is if you're an engineer and
you're not a security professional this

517
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:52,030
is change control this is change
detection

518
00:40:52,030 --> 00:40:59,900
you should be doing on your network
anyway right now my one thought process

519
00:40:59,900 --> 00:41:04,890
is especially the ICS community please
stop with the mythology stop with the

520
00:41:04,890 --> 00:41:08,799
defender narratives the adversaries
simply isn't as sexy and awesome as we

521
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:16,770
like to make him out to be not everybody
has the moustache we build up the

522
00:41:16,770 --> 00:41:20,090
adversaries to be a lot more powerful
than they actually are because that's

523
00:41:20,090 --> 00:41:24,450
what makes the headlines the hay
engineer X Scott Bauer in the network

524
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:28,240
and stopped it before it destroys the
process is not a sexy headline should be

525
00:41:28,240 --> 00:41:33,689
should be oMG I ran is going after the
power grid is what will see right there

526
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:38,760
are narratives that simply don't exist
the BTC pipeline in Turkey in 2008 has

527
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:42,780
been Bloomberg stories about how this
was a cyber attack and yes it was

528
00:41:42,780 --> 00:41:47,820
confirmed in russia the pipeline that it
happened but we believe in the community

529
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:51,030
we can prove that it happened but that's
the narrative the gets captured in the

530
00:41:51,030 --> 00:41:57,450
media headlines and we have to be able
to move our community further so

531
00:41:57,450 --> 00:42:04,259
realistically we could do defense and so
from this and a little clown noses up

532
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:09,860
here that the thing that they all this
captures is sort of security was done we

533
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:12,120
started doing the basics and we all got
to go home

534
00:42:12,120 --> 00:42:16,450
there was no cyber 911 there was no
cyber Pearl Harbor turns out we could

535
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:20,350
just do defense and now security
researchers everywhere unemployed and I

536
00:42:20,350 --> 00:42:25,839
would love that I would like a lawyer's
on the instead or anything else

537
00:42:25,840 --> 00:42:29,370
their security researcher at everything
was just fixed and we can we can

538
00:42:29,370 --> 00:42:36,560
actually go and approach that so the
kumbaya my contribution to this talk we

539
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:40,950
are the love children of in information
technology operations technology we

540
00:42:40,950 --> 00:42:44,689
actually can work together and find that
process we can take the I T security

541
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:48,480
people and teach them not kill the
network we can take the OT security

542
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:51,420
people and have them actually care about
what's going on with latest in security

543
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:52,820
and weak

544
00:42:52,820 --> 00:42:57,890
and do defense am all about breaking
shit I really AM I'm extremely thrilled

545
00:42:57,890 --> 00:43:03,009
about it and 11 vulnerabilities in five
switches families I one of them would

546
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:06,860
have been a talk the part that was most
frustrating was deleting slides this

547
00:43:06,860 --> 00:43:10,790
morning because I get to sit on the
email change of these guys and they

548
00:43:10,790 --> 00:43:13,360
talked with the latest vulnerabilities
I'm thinking of you are rules and bro

549
00:43:13,360 --> 00:43:17,260
signatures and things I can do to detect
it and there's nothing I can do to keep

550
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:22,280
up with everything they look at the
break was great and saddle the same time

551
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:27,120
that the only reason there weren't more
days was because they ran out of slides

552
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:32,540
in PowerPoint so we can do better we
should do better and I and i just want

553
00:43:32,540 --> 00:43:36,310
to leave the community with that thought
process with no matter the old days or

554
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:40,680
whatever that we think about defense is
doable and we as a community can do that

555
00:43:40,680 --> 00:43:44,890
the adversary isn't as sexy as we think
they are with that I'll turn it back

556
00:43:44,890 --> 00:43:51,910
over to you guys so I was going to say I
I have to admit as much as I like to be

557
00:43:51,910 --> 00:43:56,589
the guy I am kind of ashamed and I want
to echo this that I am ashamed of how we

558
00:43:56,590 --> 00:44:01,340
treat defense sometimes I'm ashamed of
how we respond vulnerabilities the

559
00:44:01,340 --> 00:44:05,600
discussion of suing researchers or
preventing research or not just doing

560
00:44:05,600 --> 00:44:09,500
the basics with network security it's
really shameful when you're talking

561
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:10,060
about

562
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:13,490
critical juncture in people's lives and
the things that matter the most

563
00:44:13,490 --> 00:44:18,029
not your uptime on the latest Amazon ec2
server but people's lives around a

564
00:44:18,030 --> 00:44:22,290
hydroelectric dam that stuff matters and
I don't need to take a switch onto a

565
00:44:22,290 --> 00:44:26,480
highway and Hackett journalists to show
you that that's the most important thing

566
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:36,570
about shame to find some of these
vulnerabilities and have to seek press

567
00:44:36,570 --> 00:44:43,790
to change some of these behaviors to
have to try and draw and to this

568
00:44:43,790 --> 00:44:49,430
discussion takes a lot of work right and
it shouldn't take too much work but also

569
00:44:49,430 --> 00:44:55,899
we want you to be a shame which might
seem a little bit challenging but there

570
00:44:55,900 --> 00:45:01,460
is a point to this when we talk about
Scott and ICS and DCS assumes all types

571
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:02,870
embedded systems i think is

572
00:45:02,870 --> 00:45:08,380
we use the term legacy and we use the
term legacy to say that they are

573
00:45:08,380 --> 00:45:13,040
vulnerable and they are old and the
technology is not built for this purpose

574
00:45:13,040 --> 00:45:18,279
and that's not what the word legacy used
to mean to leave someone a legacy and it

575
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:22,120
meant something it was it was a good
thing that you let them know what I'd

576
00:45:22,120 --> 00:45:26,220
like to do is reclaimed this term right
what I want to do is just take a moment

577
00:45:26,220 --> 00:45:31,040
to think about infrastructure global
infrastructure and large organizations

578
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:37,870
large countries have given us amazing
infrastructure throughout history right

579
00:45:37,870 --> 00:45:42,359
do we want to leave are you know
internet children with vulnerable

580
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:48,200
industrial system devices I i personally
say no this conclusion was taken a

581
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:52,609
little bit from a particular quote which
is a shame to die until you won some

582
00:45:52,610 --> 00:45:56,580
great victory for Humanity so I hope
you'll take this home right like be a

583
00:45:56,580 --> 00:46:05,420
shame to all these devices industrial
system networks are monitored I wanna

584
00:46:05,420 --> 00:46:16,430
just ran pretty much legacy devices but
they should be a good legacy not an

585
00:46:16,430 --> 00:46:21,279
embarrassment

586
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:30,750
that's it

587
00:46:30,750 --> 00:47:18,040
do you have any questions just scream at
me as usual

588
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:26,690
GE has critical systems but but the
question was about DECT critical systems

589
00:47:26,690 --> 00:47:31,650
and in 1904 all turned over to these
guys about that is nothing that we found

590
00:47:31,650 --> 00:47:36,540
up here for any one of the vendors was
unique of them center and the point of

591
00:47:36,540 --> 00:47:40,050
that is saying that is the
vulnerabilities that they found was a

592
00:47:40,050 --> 00:47:44,250
crossed a multitude of enters this is
not a one vendor problem this is not the

593
00:47:44,250 --> 00:47:49,740
purpose of shaming ger Siemens anybody
getting these patches exactly this is an

594
00:47:49,740 --> 00:47:53,750
infrastructure community-wide issue any
vulnerability that they looked for in

595
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:59,180
any given switch family that which is
upsetting so regarding the GCB critical

596
00:47:59,180 --> 00:48:05,839
system and yeah I most common I used to
work at GE and we're acutely aware of

597
00:48:05,840 --> 00:48:09,380
the fact that they have deployed
safety-critical systems I'm sorry to

598
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:14,380
disagree but I do about this is there
beer afterwards we talked about it but

599
00:48:14,380 --> 00:48:19,550
yeah i would i would agree with him that
there are locations especially hard on

600
00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:23,160
my military applications where G is most
certainly dealing with safety critical

601
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:36,180
systems but any other questions sir

602
00:48:36,180 --> 00:48:40,649
yeah yeah I mean you could imagine some
of these devices for me now works for

603
00:48:40,650 --> 00:48:45,390
IOT as well some of those
vulnerabilities will be similar or not

604
00:48:45,390 --> 00:48:49,210
but yeah and then last one before he
yells at me

605
00:48:49,210 --> 00:49:19,770
yes sir you have an MRC icon on the
laptop that yes we are not perfect

606
00:49:19,770 --> 00:49:21,720
thanks again
