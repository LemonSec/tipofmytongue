1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,060
I'm like dirty I am happy to be a black
hat I'm a medical guide and medicine for

2
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:11,410
thirty years I'm the CEO of lab MDN I'm
from Michigan I live in Atlanta I after

3
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:15,809
a seven-year battle with the government
and people that took our patient file

4
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:19,730
it's it's incredible that I'm actually
standing here and I appreciate your time

5
00:00:19,730 --> 00:00:24,970
the tension I'm going to talk about
what's gone on now that we've had just

6
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:31,810
in 2015 alone ninety three million
patients have been victims of identity

7
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:36,980
theft and the health care setting just
and 2015 but why has the Federal Trade

8
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:43,519
Commission decided to come after 11 D a
company that had at the most 10,000

9
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:50,399
patients potentially taken which I'll
talk about later and how they use that

10
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,899
this is not an ax training session this
is an education session about insider

11
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:59,640
view everything I've learned about how
the government really works and what I'm

12
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:05,360
learning is villainy wears many masks
none more dangerous than the mask of

13
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,659
virtue and that's what happened he came
up against a villain masquerading as a

14
00:01:10,659 --> 00:01:16,619
virtue of iPhone of unlimited means and
strength the suitor protector of the

15
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:21,750
people coming in as the FTC and lab MD's
battle with the FTC is a story of

16
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:24,729
government interference

17
00:01:24,729 --> 00:01:29,750
Big Brother run amok and bureaucrats and
lawyers totally lacking the technical

18
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:34,299
expertise for the positions of power and
that's probably the most important

19
00:01:34,299 --> 00:01:38,610
things I i talked about when I speak
about this is in medicine and technology

20
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,439
we need deregulate by people to know
what's going on the industry expertise

21
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:46,729
in that area otherwise the bull in a
china shop is put forty people out of

22
00:01:46,729 --> 00:01:51,429
work and when the company folded because
of this and it impacts every one of us

23
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:55,890
because this is essentially how they
roll I am NOT here again to act right

24
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:59,500
and actually feel like I'm kind of on
the Titanic screaming ice iceberg you

25
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:03,200
know and and I hope this talk shatters
your assumptions about the rights and we

26
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,440
think we have because the FTC like most
agencies have played books that are top

27
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:12,150
secret now to speed up time because I
got seven years of crap

28
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,310
to 45 minutes I got a three-minute video
that will save us a lot of time on it

29
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:19,950
selfishly I want you to see the medical
laboratory is going to play a video real

30
00:02:19,950 --> 00:04:22,029
quick and then I'll price let us
consensus to get to hear about us

31
00:04:22,029 --> 00:05:32,710
and we shouldn't back to leave

32
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:53,780
we

33
00:05:53,780 --> 00:06:01,690
that said sorry but the shameless plug
for multitasking video thank you so much

34
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:09,990
faster peace can take half an hour and
2009 then was the 2008 2009 then we're

35
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:13,940
just wondering where is it is it out
there we have this creepiness because we

36
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:17,330
don't find it I for full time I T people
in 10th house and we're looking forward

37
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:22,599
and we're not fighting then in 2010 and
January the phone rings and it's Alan

38
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,780
Scher with the Federal Trade Commission
who says hi we've got a file from the

39
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:33,140
viewers and we are gonna start on public
inquiry that was from the beginning of

40
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:38,130
the next day in the game started 11
pages single spaced arrived on our

41
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:43,060
doorstep and you know we are in heavy
regulated industry in medicine we have a

42
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:49,370
great relationship regulators I am NOT
anti regulation but I am very anti lack

43
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:52,550
of transparency guessing games
regulations we want to know what to do

44
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:55,669
and then we do it we want to scream and
then we fix it

45
00:06:55,669 --> 00:06:58,890
that's not the game is played by the FTC
right off the bat

46
00:06:58,890 --> 00:07:02,800
we're getting over one with demands the
lawyer clock is ticking

47
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,410
we have you know forty employees my
inner circle of management knew about

48
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:12,200
this and really freaked out lawyers were
in what the heck's going on right off

49
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:18,680
the bat the FTC is in the press and they
are saying that widespread data breaches

50
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:22,570
uncovered by an FTC probe this is a
pattern of the FTC using the media to

51
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:27,020
play like the Savior they were improper
release of sensitive consumer data on

52
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,760
peer-to-peer file-sharing networks
they've notified a hundred organizations

53
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,000
almost all personal information
sensitive data about customers employees

54
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,070
shared workstations computer networks
available on peer-to-peer file-sharing

55
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:41,889
networks so they are fast to the press
before they notify

56
00:07:41,889 --> 00:07:47,169
now I'm trying to figure out who
Tiburcio is we get funded EC we meet the

57
00:07:47,169 --> 00:07:53,469
FTC and and that face-to-face meeting
was very alarming because again I've

58
00:07:53,469 --> 00:07:57,248
grown up by the way in a law enforcement
world worth my parents or police

59
00:07:57,249 --> 00:08:01,539
officers when they met so my whole
childhood which now seems in my fifties

60
00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:07,949
to matter was with judges and police
officers and lawyers and so I'm

61
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:11,800
surprised by the behavior of what's
going on because they're just not

62
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:15,340
telling us what we're doing wrong or
what we're doing right and they seem to

63
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:20,179
be relying obviously I'm type versa and
I start doing research and I find that

64
00:08:20,180 --> 00:08:25,779
person has got is boasting of having
unique technology that can search

65
00:08:25,779 --> 00:08:30,909
incredibly quickly between 300 and 120
billion searches per day and they put

66
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:36,519
out a paper that says they downloaded
13.8 million files that their work with

67
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:39,890
Dartmouth on the paper and they're
monitoring 48 million work stations

68
00:08:39,890 --> 00:08:44,720
worldwide and they're trying to serve
the FTC now this is 2009 suppressant

69
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,170
pick up a thing is all going on behind
our back and I'm finding out

70
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:52,760
Homeland Security if twenty four million
dollars at dartmouth that used diverse

71
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:55,310
and there are bragging about this save
the world

72
00:08:55,310 --> 00:09:00,819
thing and evidently I have very bad
because I was one out of 13.8 million so

73
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:06,279
I wonder how does the FTC get this power
and I have to go back to basics civics

74
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:10,209
Raceway the executive branch the
judicial branch and we have the

75
00:09:10,209 --> 00:09:13,260
legislative branch with the founding
father split into so that we could be

76
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:17,529
laws were difficult to create over us
but about a hundred years ago about

77
00:09:17,529 --> 00:09:23,459
who's president or what party you are
from that's not what this is about

78
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:27,380
we have the fourth branch of government
the agency of mister process and what I

79
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:28,990
learned is that kept railing

80
00:09:28,990 --> 00:09:33,890
against my lawyer like how can they do
this the freedoms

81
00:09:33,890 --> 00:09:38,600
everyone sort of limitations of
government are are the separation

82
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:43,160
between the branches but in the agencies
they are allowed to have their own

83
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,170
courts their own rules

84
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:51,550
their self policing and that I consider
a face of power and caused my boy kept

85
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:55,050
saying doesn't matter if it's out
doesn't matter and I speak to other

86
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:56,020
lawyers in Dec

87
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:00,079
it was like I was diagnosed with a
terminal disease are like rollover Mike

88
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:06,180
but they don't say we didn't make it out
this is just incredulous and i can

89
00:10:06,180 --> 00:10:10,529
assume whatever centralization of power
a petri dish for corruption and grow it

90
00:10:10,529 --> 00:10:15,000
is I'm learning that the bureaucrats had
scant experience in world that regulate

91
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:18,820
that was very bizarre to me from
medicine

92
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:24,080
everyone in medicine that regulates as a
pathologist for histo tech and here we

93
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:29,630
have people that just gone to law school
and they're more concerned with the

94
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:36,430
interpretation the truth so how the
start so the official agenda the FTC is

95
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:41,270
section 5 of the FTC Act by crime risk
that says their job is to protect

96
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:45,660
consumers from unfair and deception now
I'm skipping a reception because that

97
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,189
wasn't our game we don't have patience
command they were added for unfairness

98
00:10:49,190 --> 00:10:54,070
and they're saying practices and fair
where causes or is likely to cause

99
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:59,100
substantial injury to consumers a nap
irresponsibly avoided cannot be

100
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,950
reasonably avoided by consumers and is
not outweighed by countervailing

101
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:07,320
benefits to consumers are competition
seems like fair enough but the problem

102
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:14,640
lies who decides what is likely to cause
who decides what is reasonably to avoid

103
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:20,300
who decides what is a countervailing
benefit they do and that was terrifying

104
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:25,240
to me and evidently I'm wasn't alone but
there'd been at this point 37 consent

105
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,980
decrees signed by various companies
throughout the country although no one

106
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:34,230
with medical say you have that much to
lose but if I'm holding cancer results

107
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:38,019
for hundreds of thousands of people and
it is out there that

108
00:11:38,019 --> 00:11:42,230
unquestionable and that I'm not doing
the job we're dead we're dead way

109
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:47,639
earlier than TJMaxx for Sony so I had to
figure out what what what my house here

110
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:51,089
in what to do because we were under
attack and sure enough one of the

111
00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:55,679
commissioners have reported this section
5 is his administrative process

112
00:11:55,679 --> 00:12:01,459
advantages in the past 20 years the FTC
has ruled in favor of staff meeting

113
00:12:01,459 --> 00:12:09,479
there in courts on appeal cases and the
win rate for appealing when they go

114
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:14,519
outside is is 50% to lose half the time
to get outside their own court so

115
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:19,439
there's something wrong but they run to
gas lighting they repeatedly say weird

116
00:12:19,439 --> 00:12:22,618
cybersecurity regulator where the
regulator really regular where the

117
00:12:22,619 --> 00:12:28,679
decider and quite frankly folks it's
such a treacherous road fight that most

118
00:12:28,679 --> 00:12:33,420
people roll and then you got this
reputation thing against you but it's a

119
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:38,649
lesser of two evils they want you to be
prayed and at this point they wouldn't

120
00:12:38,649 --> 00:12:42,879
tell us what we could do right or wrong
but every time we try to acquire they

121
00:12:42,879 --> 00:12:48,319
said you had to sign a consent decree
look at these prior consent decrees and

122
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:54,729
what the ecstasy ones is they want you
to sign the twenty-year agreement we're

123
00:12:54,730 --> 00:12:59,350
deep in the fine print says you've done
your admitting no wrongdoing but they'll

124
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:04,499
have press releases all over the place
that how they snagged another one and

125
00:13:04,499 --> 00:13:07,459
it's at your expense you are going to
have to pay about a quarter million

126
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:13,959
dollars a year and then you also open
all sorts of attacks if you don't comply

127
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:19,429
as you know whether you think LifeLock
deserves it or not the one thing I wanna

128
00:13:19,429 --> 00:13:22,579
get your for marital life like saying
that hit the press a couple weeks ago

129
00:13:22,579 --> 00:13:27,099
where they're going back against him
notice how they seal the argument so

130
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:30,529
lifelike getting attacked in the press
their stock goes down 50% but no one

131
00:13:30,529 --> 00:13:34,880
knows why classic so there was no way I
was going to sign

132
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,430
to create that just wasn't gonna happen
because it was reputations destination a

133
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:42,819
much greater level and I didn't know the
road I was gonna be embarking on was

134
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:47,710
gonna landed me here or on the radio TV
or writing but life's an adventure I

135
00:13:47,710 --> 00:13:51,430
guess I'm not sure that the paper i saw
this whole thing is to shake down and i

136
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:57,310
saw this whole thing as secret law when
you're not telling you what you have to

137
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:04,160
do it a secret and I had to figure out
what was going on here it was it was

138
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:08,390
amazing to me especially where I came
from in medicine and technology would

139
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:14,980
have this common enemy right now about
the bullies that are outside attacking

140
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:21,480
everybody where most of the time our
regular processes are collaborative this

141
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:26,080
whole punitive thing is just so far in
medicines I mean we just so you know if

142
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:29,680
if you play punitive no one's going to
pick up a scalper diagnosed anything i

143
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:35,520
mean there's just not perfection and and
they don't use you to put your head on a

144
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,510
spike and scare everyone else into
submission

145
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:43,270
but the FTC just want you to assume the
position and it was constantly from the

146
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:48,540
lawyers don't upset them and if you do
you're going to be a procedure and data

147
00:14:48,540 --> 00:14:53,370
and they do think they're doing God's
work that doesn't work I'll come at you

148
00:14:53,370 --> 00:15:01,620
so I find out again we have Homeland
Security involved Dartmouth and I am in

149
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:05,910
bed together sometime I was the case
there together and there is no doesn't

150
00:15:05,910 --> 00:15:12,110
matter because its potential for you can
get this and you can't have anyone

151
00:15:12,110 --> 00:15:16,610
harmed it is not to have anything out
there but the public hears breach here's

152
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:21,700
violation because what they're really
doing so I'm really I totally get it's

153
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:25,350
hard to believe it's hard for me to
believe so I reached out to I can reach

154
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:30,899
out two nite I found been writing since
and he came in he inspected

155
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:37,670
I mean if we did something wrong let's
fix it let's go and he came in and he

156
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:43,378
said this thing's not out of control it
we now know a subcontractor working

157
00:15:43,379 --> 00:15:48,959
through a government government contract
is got it

158
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:54,910
nowhere else legally a breach is not a
preacher preach here is not illegal

159
00:15:54,910 --> 00:16:01,459
bridge again it's not spreading anywhere
and just the way bob approaches years

160
00:16:01,459 --> 00:16:06,420
before was insane and I never trusted
but then I find him in front of house

161
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:11,699
oversight testifying the guy on the
phone with us in front of house

162
00:16:11,699 --> 00:16:15,740
oversight testifying in his next to him
his advisory board member General Wesley

163
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:24,929
Clark Howard and there's the FTC and
there's no I'm like holy cow this is

164
00:16:24,929 --> 00:16:28,809
unbelievable I'm in the wrong place at
the wrong time and we're just a small

165
00:16:28,809 --> 00:16:32,368
business so I'm trying to run around to
fix it like okay he did something wrong

166
00:16:32,369 --> 00:16:37,220
with sticks it there's no products out
there again this is 2010 so we go to

167
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:42,740
Websense and we spend tons of money for
some solution as they won't say what to

168
00:16:42,740 --> 00:16:49,309
do and we saw me go away we're playing
really nice in front of them but we just

169
00:16:49,309 --> 00:16:54,569
want to go away but if the moment comes
a sign a consent decree is not gonna

170
00:16:54,569 --> 00:17:06,349
happen but we feel like they're just
sign you can always keep an eye on you

171
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:10,510
we always will and we can open the
complaint up at any time so you have the

172
00:17:10,510 --> 00:17:14,279
forever threat and they're wearing you
down there is no court here there's no

173
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:19,789
justice there's no yes no and I just
couldn't do this I mean they asked to

174
00:17:19,789 --> 00:17:25,770
sign a consent decree and I couldn't do
it I just in many situations I know many

175
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:29,850
people should I don't judge corporations
it did but we were medicine and was

176
00:17:29,850 --> 00:17:34,110
going to set a terrible precedent I call
this the logs the long slog of Justice

177
00:17:34,110 --> 00:17:34,580
ma'am

178
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:41,029
and we started to fight and right away
they screamed and yelled when we told

179
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:43,590
them no we're not going to sign a
consent decree that they were going to

180
00:17:43,590 --> 00:17:49,168
sue us immediately made in serious they
tried to get us to sit for more just

181
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:53,980
excruciating positions one my VP was
there from like 10 in the morning till

182
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:58,510
8:30 tonight Wednesday cities where you
down these people are ticked off they

183
00:17:58,510 --> 00:18:03,299
have not heard no ever and we're
basically challenging their entire

184
00:18:03,299 --> 00:18:06,908
playbook and they have a very short fuse
about that they take themselves very

185
00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:11,789
seriously and off we went to court and
sure enough the court said nobody has

186
00:18:11,789 --> 00:18:15,190
really litigated your authority in this
area to do this although you apparently

187
00:18:15,190 --> 00:18:21,919
have done it a lot this is just if they
can make me sit down for a CID and the

188
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:25,830
FTC she responds where we've spoken on
panels we've conducted workshops we

189
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:33,360
publish diagnose it thats law so if you
don't check the FTC website folks you

190
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:39,918
better start doing that last time I
checked I thought congress made the law

191
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:42,000
but sure enough

192
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:47,950
congress has strapped their hands and
this is the big point they tied the

193
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:53,299
hands of course they don't want anyone
intervene with dinner with

194
00:18:53,299 --> 00:18:57,029
administrative processes to regulate
this isn't just the FTC this is almost

195
00:18:57,029 --> 00:19:01,110
all regulators until they're done with
you and that is not 24 abuse that's like

196
00:19:01,110 --> 00:19:01,860
a look

197
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:06,299
going to the head gonna cost $90
reputations destination you might as

198
00:19:06,299 --> 00:19:12,529
well roll and most companies role and
even as much as he went after them he

199
00:19:12,529 --> 00:19:17,730
could not enforce he could not stop them
from making me sick because prior

200
00:19:17,730 --> 00:19:22,389
Supreme Court rulings even back in the
forties said the government can make you

201
00:19:22,389 --> 00:19:26,820
sit down for almost anything because of
the words me think of the word plausible

202
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:32,149
plausible means possible anything's
possible

203
00:19:32,149 --> 00:19:37,500
the column might fly over the phone so
you can do it but had no choice and I'm

204
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:39,010
at this point out took off and like

205
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:41,730
the world's gonna know this is just
unbelievable I'm telling people not

206
00:19:41,730 --> 00:19:44,320
involved in law and they're just
thinking something wrong with me and the

207
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:49,210
only way I forgot I could really do this
is to write a book which is a big deal

208
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:55,000
so ticked off I wrote the book the devil
inside the beltway cuz I had to write

209
00:19:55,000 --> 00:20:00,750
this non fiction story to show everyone
what really goes on because if I just

210
00:20:00,750 --> 00:20:04,640
tell you that I just find it amazing and
the big thing we have to understand is

211
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:11,600
there going at us with persecution
through process now they have the books

212
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:17,240
coming out the Royal a tick over now and
2013 they have basically so

213
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:21,960
psychologically bombarded my staff
because we have different law firms will

214
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:25,040
spend hundreds of thousands of dollars
we've got Websense in there they are

215
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:30,360
just not happy there is a serious and
the books coming and it gets explain to

216
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:34,679
me what their leadership least
litigation strategy is the FTC take two

217
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:38,570
options when they go out and if they
think they have a super strong case and

218
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:44,659
want to take you right to federal court
federal court has to be in your location

219
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:48,810
but they could show you the rack and the
rash is the administrative process

220
00:20:48,810 --> 00:20:53,370
because interest rate of courts is the
quorum at the FTC office and it's the

221
00:20:53,370 --> 00:20:58,080
FTC judge whose web it was a web address
by the way you know email addresses FTC

222
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:04,290
done and they drain you dry with all the
finances and attention they take away

223
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:07,980
your business and the reputation the
press and they allow hearsay because

224
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:12,380
they make their own rules because
Congress as I can so that investigators

225
00:21:12,380 --> 00:21:16,840
say they have to tell you what they're
finding because they invoke their own

226
00:21:16,840 --> 00:21:21,790
privilege because they say they can and
the court because they say they can make

227
00:21:21,790 --> 00:21:27,220
it so they went to hershey the time
repetitions hesitations psychological

228
00:21:27,220 --> 00:21:31,320
warfare cooperative Press has no believe
this damage operations and we are toast

229
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:39,030
and what's really going on here is the
FTC is creating common law and the way

230
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:42,800
they do it is a get the consent decree
built precedent

231
00:21:42,800 --> 00:21:47,620
bill precedent by the battery of now
over 50 can centuries by the way when

232
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:50,189
they had the fiftieth consent decree
they had another party another big press

233
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:56,830
release EPA we beat up fifty companies
avoid the courts build that amount

234
00:21:56,830 --> 00:22:03,480
mislead and Stonewall congress when you
come in and play hero to the press has

235
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:07,900
no one looks the details these days
folks I mean it's really amazing how we

236
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:12,490
just have such a short attention span no
one wants to see who has the time to see

237
00:22:12,490 --> 00:22:17,970
ironically to me about this is the 50
biggest data breaches of health care now

238
00:22:17,970 --> 00:22:24,260
want to see action from anthem down to
North Carolina where US where nine ten

239
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:28,030
thousand maybe that's assuming what they
said is true which will talk about later

240
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:34,750
but that's because I am sorry just fire
and then comes the suit and that is the

241
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:38,780
FTC filed a complaint 11 D for failing
to protect consumer privacy how do I

242
00:22:38,780 --> 00:22:45,920
find this out the Associate Press called
me up to today and they have this huge

243
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:51,970
huge it was a growing it I heard you
look it up it's brilliantly written

244
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:58,290
notice it never says the word reaching
it but what did everybody here everyone

245
00:22:58,290 --> 00:23:01,310
in the labor is a breach of reach

246
00:23:01,310 --> 00:23:09,020
try to fight that to me is bullying
behavior and there are no shortage of

247
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:12,770
people who think that you're guilty
because the government accuses you so

248
00:23:12,770 --> 00:23:17,040
suddenly you have the fine I mean
employer scared you wonder what's going

249
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:19,409
on a private coming

250
00:23:19,410 --> 00:23:24,170
cancer luckily I had a lot of physicians
for such a long time we did get to we

251
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:28,160
don't have a lot of people that part of
this point but this is where they love

252
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:31,830
the dirty laundry and they get the
eyeballs on the set to hang the coming

253
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,840
out to dry

254
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:37,280
they're going to gain political points
and they create a crisis so they can

255
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:41,460
build corporations fairly and and
lawyers can build the courage to really

256
00:23:41,460 --> 00:23:48,330
go there's a lot of people in that world
there are you doing this but I had been

257
00:23:48,330 --> 00:23:52,310
working in Dec and when I found out that
Barbican this crowd was talking to

258
00:23:52,310 --> 00:23:56,190
congress all these years and testifying
I'm blowing the smoke I mean just gives

259
00:23:56,190 --> 00:23:59,150
you when congress does not mean you get
fifty more IQ points

260
00:23:59,150 --> 00:24:02,900
experts cybersecurity so they were
duping them on this and these guys are

261
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,890
taking this up hunk line and sinker so I
start calling an oversight not to save

262
00:24:06,890 --> 00:24:11,130
me but educate them because what would
shock you shot me is there's not a lot

263
00:24:11,130 --> 00:24:15,710
of conversation between the ADC they
don't know what's going on in a few

264
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:19,260
people run up and tell them because
they're afraid said nothing to lose at

265
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:24,720
the same time I met oversight law firm
does pro-bono work to do to want to do

266
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:28,180
accountability so when they thought they
were gonna you know take the lambda

267
00:24:28,180 --> 00:24:34,520
slaughter certainly we put a big
surprise I'm I hope that day we had a

268
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:39,160
big press release around I found out I
did have pro bono legal firm from

269
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:45,230
insiders and EC so the next step with
shock and awe 40 subpoenas doctors

270
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:50,840
vendors employees that left six years
ago people that works for me now and

271
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:55,290
they make $16 an hour posting payments
and they don't have a lawyer never had a

272
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:59,020
lawyer and suddenly they're sitting in
front of a federal investigator and we

273
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:07,430
need to get one this is just this is
nothing to any of the truth by the way

274
00:25:07,430 --> 00:25:13,890
they could decide that later but then we
go to court and they stopped 20 people

275
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:17,360
into the scheduling conference and they
say how upset they are about the book

276
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,649
because they don't like to be talked
about and then they say to the judge

277
00:25:21,650 --> 00:25:24,100
this is amazing the judge asked them

278
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:28,559
is there any place for businesses to
know to go to know what to do

279
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:32,129
quote unquote the record there is
nothing out there for a company to look

280
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:39,330
too and they're fine that so then the
depositions in the first deposition is

281
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:44,789
Robert Bob book what type person and he
drops a big surprise oh now we find out

282
00:25:44,789 --> 00:25:48,809
our files in four different locations
around the world and it wasn't don't

283
00:25:48,809 --> 00:25:51,700
downloaded in Georgia like he said in
writing

284
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:57,330
years before no just saw there he must
have misspoke and they downloaded San

285
00:25:57,330 --> 00:26:00,820
Diego now why do you think he said that
we think he said that because it turns

286
00:26:00,820 --> 00:26:04,490
out it's illegal to surveil and Georgia
without a private investigator license

287
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:09,900
so you know it doesn't help the
government to get evidence true crime if

288
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:13,220
they're working with the criminal that
does not look good and so all these

289
00:26:13,220 --> 00:26:18,500
people lost their jobs because then we
pulled it and we had a really dark 2013

290
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:23,390
I mean I persisted me for defamation I
had a personal family member pass away

291
00:26:23,390 --> 00:26:28,880
we lost the company people jumping ship
left to right it was just terrified and

292
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:33,730
men and some string of 14 I guess you
kind of say what a miracle in the sense

293
00:26:33,730 --> 00:26:37,360
that we had a whistleblower come out
many of the book which is amazing I mean

294
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,899
this is the part about life just being
an adventure in kind of being patient

295
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:44,870
and i got a call from a guy that used to
work there Richard Wallace and he was

296
00:26:44,870 --> 00:26:51,250
terrified and he was emotional and he
was apologetic and said I ruined

297
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:56,640
everything I've run this I did it we
took that we lied to everybody it's

298
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:03,690
nowhere it's not only is it nowhere does
anyone remember in the room when Obama

299
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:07,640
won in about a month later is all over
the news helicopter plans were found in

300
00:27:07,640 --> 00:27:14,690
Iran's I remember that that's a lie they
found Obama's helicopter plans in a

301
00:27:14,690 --> 00:27:22,080
consultants computer in Virginia but it
was too juicy not to rough up so they

302
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,230
changed their metadata made it look like
an IP address

303
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:32,450
called the media and the meeting went
nuts and BCC all over that got

304
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:36,410
congress's attention when we told them
that was alive and suddenly congress is

305
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:48,059
is investigating so now we have this
point we're in unchartered territory

306
00:27:48,059 --> 00:27:51,120
because most people don't even get this
far with the government now I have

307
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:55,530
congress looking into what's going on
I'm really enjoying myself quite frankly

308
00:27:55,530 --> 00:28:01,299
it's when you're you're taught that
there's no hope and alone in the world

309
00:28:01,299 --> 00:28:07,650
and suddenly you know you're not crazy
after five year it's good it's

310
00:28:07,650 --> 00:28:11,360
terrifying is that the FTC is wrong

311
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:16,790
these people that are asking why there
are saying they do billions of searches

312
00:28:16,790 --> 00:28:20,200
a day and they're monitoring of a
downloaded millions of files so they go

313
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:23,429
after that company and they said hey we
want we want to know we want everything

314
00:28:23,429 --> 00:28:28,419
a guy and what do they do versus says no
we don't want to give it to be

315
00:28:28,419 --> 00:28:32,809
associated by our clients thinking with
the Fed so that she seems like we'll go

316
00:28:32,809 --> 00:28:37,490
ahead then and just create a company
called the Private Eye Institute you

317
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:42,720
just do that now this is all documented
depositions under oath denies the CFTC

318
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:48,570
work with them their create the shop
does it seem strange that accompany that

319
00:28:48,570 --> 00:28:53,149
millions of downloads for years in this
world of cyber security leaks can only

320
00:28:53,150 --> 00:28:57,520
turn over 86 files to the government
does the government even think about

321
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:58,950
that that's kind of strange

322
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:05,309
absolutely not because the agenda is not
true it is gas lighting their agenda is

323
00:29:05,309 --> 00:29:09,889
to find a victim put ahead and a spike
and scared all of you into compliance

324
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:14,390
never never wear and it's not going to
work now in the meantime we're still

325
00:29:14,390 --> 00:29:19,240
trying to get the courts to intervene in
this craziness and now that we've got

326
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,200
this going on

327
00:29:20,200 --> 00:29:24,510
we think while the 11th circuit will go
back and it's just the big point about

328
00:29:24,510 --> 00:29:28,860
what the judge says here in these are
quotes from the record is the big deal

329
00:29:28,860 --> 00:29:29,350
is

330
00:29:29,350 --> 00:29:34,049
notice how the courts want to do
something and they're frustrated with

331
00:29:34,049 --> 00:29:39,850
this but they can I had to tie together
persecution to process congress says he

332
00:29:39,850 --> 00:29:43,918
can't intervene yet and so he's gotta
get whatever they want and most people

333
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:49,659
evidently aren't as competitive or crazy
he says it's already history of acrimony

334
00:29:49,659 --> 00:29:52,620
and I think they have the agency the
exertion of authority in a mean-spirited

335
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:57,789
way no kidding that's for starters the
FTC is going into the business of

336
00:29:57,789 --> 00:30:02,010
monitoring investigating and regulatory
security breaches and they have decided

337
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:05,730
to do that within what they believe is
there mister Vettori but I think there's

338
00:30:05,730 --> 00:30:10,100
been no amendment to section 5 to
specifically allow that but how do you

339
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:14,010
find that out you can't find it out let
you fight you can't fight it was

340
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:19,279
shipping lanes and time most people are
going to do that so they sell four point

341
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,429
the regulation and you'll notice that
the FCC net neutrality there right now

342
00:30:22,429 --> 00:30:25,600
the irony is all these agencies are
self-appointed their technology

343
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,039
regulation no one's it until now they're
fighting with each other who's got

344
00:30:29,039 --> 00:30:33,070
internet just got this is it is an
online security get a sec

345
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:41,600
FTC will just have to crawl through the
courts of millions so he then verifying

346
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:44,539
evidence is so you've got no information
as to how these documents were obtained

347
00:30:44,539 --> 00:30:49,090
that right that's correct your honor at
50 °c says he's like boy that's a sad

348
00:30:49,090 --> 00:30:52,360
comment on your agency that you would
wait until months before hearing and

349
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:56,899
months after Institute of investigation
you have not taken any effort to

350
00:30:56,899 --> 00:31:00,360
interview the people who you claim had
the documents that underlie the charge

351
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:06,100
of security breach that strikes me as
almost being unconscionable so you don't

352
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:09,750
know where the documents came from you
don't know how these people got the

353
00:31:09,750 --> 00:31:13,240
position of it you don't know whether
they originate from WebMD but you're

354
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:17,190
going to use that to show that certain
into bills were damaged by documents the

355
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:23,149
source that what you don't even know and
once again the FTC yes your honor but

356
00:31:23,149 --> 00:31:24,029
here's the thing

357
00:31:24,029 --> 00:31:29,940
port can do anything cannot there's no
one you can't get this result I don't

358
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:33,469
think you believe that this is a company
that willy nilly allows information to

359
00:31:33,469 --> 00:31:39,169
be disclosed we detect cancer I also
believe you don't think that is a good

360
00:31:39,169 --> 00:31:43,809
idea to make this provider unavailable
to patients I don't think they care

361
00:31:43,809 --> 00:31:48,379
folks they're fine with it they are not
apologetic even today and this story

362
00:31:48,379 --> 00:31:52,209
gets way where's there aren't that many
people doing this work

363
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:55,239
one of the regrets of the industry is
that there are so few people providing

364
00:31:55,239 --> 00:31:58,679
services someday you are going to need
one of those services I hope it's

365
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:06,369
available to you and he ruled in their
favor because the courts and Congress

366
00:32:06,369 --> 00:32:11,168
and Supreme Court says he can't
intervene yet so he can beat them up but

367
00:32:11,169 --> 00:32:15,830
the ruling is it's not right he has to
go by the law so you gotta tell them

368
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:17,629
what's coming they know what's coming

369
00:32:17,629 --> 00:32:23,699
most people suck come by now so off we
go to kangaroo court and kangaroo court

370
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,869
I say that because they make up their
own rules they sacked on deck and you

371
00:32:26,869 --> 00:32:29,539
have to know really what they are and
right off the bat

372
00:32:29,539 --> 00:32:36,809
the judge wants to know where is the
money where's the money and he asked is

373
00:32:36,809 --> 00:32:38,519
this is a non-government

374
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:44,219
affiliate entities are they find in any
way by taxpayer money no its not so he

375
00:32:44,219 --> 00:32:46,799
sent a person doesn't have any money
from

376
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:53,229
that's a lie they have money to get cash
from the FBI they got money from the TSA

377
00:32:53,229 --> 00:32:58,320
that a contract and months later
actually just three months ago barry in

378
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:04,330
a brief totally unrelated page 6 of 30
pages oh by the way your honor we

379
00:33:04,330 --> 00:33:11,080
misspoke judge also said hang on a sec
you don't plant evidence of harm but

380
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:14,678
your positions that doesn't mean no harm
occurred is that what you said that's

381
00:33:14,679 --> 00:33:16,080
correct

382
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,830
do you plan to introduce evidence of
actual penetration the network we're not

383
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:22,239
going to introduce evidence of that sort

384
00:33:22,239 --> 00:33:29,120
as were unable to determine if that
happened the same crazy it's all real

385
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:34,550
finally we want to know what are the
standards and we go to the court and we

386
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:40,430
asked the court make them tell us the
standards we all want to know and the

387
00:33:40,430 --> 00:33:43,580
court has to rule by the rules the FTC
makes the Commerce says they can make

388
00:33:43,580 --> 00:33:46,679
the rules so we have to play by the
rules at this point hopefully we'll have

389
00:33:46,680 --> 00:33:51,540
some blood nobody later and the court
says the court order

390
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:57,100
FTC tells us the court order provides
that respondent may not discovered legal

391
00:33:57,100 --> 00:34:02,370
issues in the past is currently using 24
section five and a security cases you're

392
00:34:02,370 --> 00:34:08,810
not supposed to know so then we they
rested which is great by the way I me so

393
00:34:08,810 --> 00:34:10,649
they rest their case you know nothing's
going on

394
00:34:10,649 --> 00:34:14,859
started going crazy about this
helicopter thing it's not my job to

395
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:19,830
what's going on and suddenly they plead
the fifth now this is how we do not know

396
00:34:19,830 --> 00:34:25,139
I better really move along this is the
most important part i for you but you be

397
00:34:25,139 --> 00:34:25,679
the judge

398
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:30,970
so we do the investigation we're trying
to hear what's going on there was a blur

399
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:35,629
is coming any lawyered-up he's got
immunity in there and I don't want this

400
00:34:35,629 --> 00:34:40,139
bipartisan vote I do not this is crime I
don't care for republican democrat I

401
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:44,970
voted for both but I will tell you the
facts are the minority side of the House

402
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:50,939
Oversight Committee block this we had
hard drives they wouldn't meet Rick they

403
00:34:50,940 --> 00:34:56,270
would think suzanne saxman grooms is the
trio of cover-up here she is a lawyer

404
00:34:56,270 --> 00:35:00,270
that work for Louis Lerner at the IRS
and she moves the House Oversight and

405
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:05,190
she's all about just keeping the lid on
taxpayer dollars paying to protect

406
00:35:05,190 --> 00:35:11,690
protect the truth from coming out about
government abuse that's your job that's

407
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:14,610
what she does and now she's in the
process oversight and actually now she

408
00:35:14,610 --> 00:35:19,830
does in the Benghazi committee she is
very good because we couldn't even get

409
00:35:19,830 --> 00:35:24,470
them to see him she kept dragging her
feet and then Jay Rockefeller sends out

410
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:27,629
a red herring letter to the press saying
this is unbelievable

411
00:35:27,630 --> 00:35:29,770
House Oversight interfering in the

412
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:34,430
CC's regulatory process which isn't even
true it was the judge that stopped the

413
00:35:34,430 --> 00:35:41,350
case to say try to get immunity from and
they stopped case but they want to send

414
00:35:41,350 --> 00:35:45,670
a red herring out the press because boy
we can depress know about this and the

415
00:35:45,670 --> 00:35:49,210
press there's not a lot of press
investigative reporters are planned

416
00:35:49,210 --> 00:35:52,360
large gone are working their tails off
they don't have time to research

417
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:57,000
resources are gone so I just sent her a
rep of red flags and Elijah Cummings is

418
00:35:57,000 --> 00:36:01,100
passing up the letter as well so these
are all red herrings for everybody and

419
00:36:01,100 --> 00:36:05,140
the whole thing is if you don't look you
won't find anti person is talking out of

420
00:36:05,140 --> 00:36:10,950
both sides of their mouth to congress
they're pulled and I'm sure but 222 the

421
00:36:10,950 --> 00:36:16,980
FTC 2000 we found three more files and
ignore the first four because Rick

422
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:21,060
Wallace is crazy what he did so they're
kill the messenger divide and conquer

423
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:25,830
their tents and we want to know what the
heck goes on because there was hardly

424
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:30,080
any media covered after i testified
before Congress was hardly any media

425
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:38,210
coverage after an AIDS clinic got up and
also testified that what was really fast

426
00:36:38,210 --> 00:36:44,310
to the time but I can just testify along
we found an aids clinic in chicago who

427
00:36:44,310 --> 00:36:47,320
was also called by Tibor same amount of
money

428
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:50,720
same time a racket and they wouldn't
play so what happens

429
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:56,910
incidentally there's a law firm in
Pittsburgh that gets the final and they

430
00:36:56,910 --> 00:37:01,490
call it the patient wow and they asked
them they're scared the bejesus patients

431
00:37:01,490 --> 00:37:05,350
had no idea that sucks out there maybe
because it's not and they want to know

432
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:10,080
if they'd like to participate in a class
action lawsuit they see the aids clinic

433
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:18,690
and then there's a subtle I thought that
would just make the press go insane and

434
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:25,280
we still use a further information how
can we find out who is the chairman of

435
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:29,650
the Federal Trade Commission and Jay
Rockefeller who is now leaving congress

436
00:37:29,650 --> 00:37:34,330
senator from West Virginia the time I'm
really tight as a matter of fact they're

437
00:37:34,330 --> 00:37:40,049
so tight that went for it was supposed
to be fixed broadband repair radon to

438
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:43,910
call it so they these games could stop
of redaction and not turning over and

439
00:37:43,910 --> 00:37:48,240
stonewalling and make people sue can
afford to sue the only person in

440
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:51,140
congress regards to party that voted
against it was Jay Rockefeller and

441
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,150
people went nuts

442
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:56,730
between Christmas and New Years finally
acquiesced but you wanna why he he did

443
00:37:56,730 --> 00:38:04,650
because it acts to fix it they don't
want transparency turns out she was the

444
00:38:04,650 --> 00:38:11,230
one notifying everyone through a staff
in in in in the congress beforehand to

445
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:16,230
create this whole divergence from the
hearing and we've taught them red and it

446
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:21,480
trying to correct their behavior
backroom tactics in silence and they

447
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:25,840
whistle past the graveyard and
corruption is the use of trust for

448
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:32,340
dishonest gain by thank you judge me the
guy is a good guy he's just powerless

449
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:36,400
because the FTC commissioners if they
don't like his ruling overturning you

450
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:39,030
can spend millions of dollars and he
could they can just go don't like it

451
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:45,200
when you have to go to court and you saw
that type of Blues rate when you do that

452
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:48,180
but he be a good guy

453
00:38:48,180 --> 00:38:52,129
prime outcry sick of having as good
cases overturned refer to the partner

454
00:38:52,130 --> 00:38:58,760
justice and Rec community in six weeks
first time and here's rick the people

455
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:02,950
that Tovar said try to attack because
records medicating themselves so stress

456
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:07,020
he's got a deal I he's been in some
trouble since this happened she's

457
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:11,740
imploded that's what they do to
whistleblowers folk they beat you and

458
00:39:11,740 --> 00:39:13,859
they change the subject and they come

459
00:39:13,860 --> 00:39:18,440
and they make you a bad guy here's the
bad guy getting into wars and head of

460
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:25,800
the FBI's years ago now congress after
he finally testified a man I gotta tell

461
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:31,800
us up rather than this is someone from
the cause of the crash report that

462
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:37,310
finally were released after Rick finally
testified about 10 weeks ago this house

463
00:39:37,310 --> 00:39:41,380
so just as most rather than late night

464
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:45,420
reports to be the company often acted
unethically and sometimes unlawfully in

465
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:49,880
its use of documents unintentionally
exposed and peer-to-peer networks at

466
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:53,630
least one type of employee under the
direction of CEO Robert Bob provided

467
00:39:53,630 --> 00:39:58,370
intentionally false information the US
government on more than one occasion 86

468
00:39:58,370 --> 00:40:01,080
companies get turned over this company
folks

469
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:06,740
almost a hundred notified by the FTC
here we are to save the day

470
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:09,970
publicly to provide a fourth Test Lab
fabricated documents are you as House of

471
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:14,339
Representatives according the
whistleblower diversify brigades address

472
00:40:14,340 --> 00:40:18,070
downloaded and disclose the blueprints
the president's helicopter allegedly did

473
00:40:18,070 --> 00:40:21,830
so in order to see press attention
committee found that the statements made

474
00:40:21,830 --> 00:40:26,390
by 10 percent under oath about this
could not be substantiated after

475
00:40:26,390 --> 00:40:30,600
obtaining information hiv/aids patients
at a clinic in chicago how low will you

476
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:39,230
go really and the FTC just stands there
silently hand in the cookie jar quiet as

477
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:45,570
a mouse coming to no one's rescue hoping
they don't get caught when the clinic

478
00:40:45,570 --> 00:40:49,700
refused to hire to oversee the company
gave information to a lawyer that work

479
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:53,120
with a company who filed a class-action
lawsuit that eventually settled for a

480
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,790
substantial amount of money

481
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:59,050
information about to burst the FTC
through a shell organization no surprise

482
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:02,540
since it was only nominee verified but
nonetheless relied upon receipt for

483
00:41:02,540 --> 00:41:07,180
enforcement actions now emily is right
there were possible they obtained

484
00:41:07,180 --> 00:41:10,339
non-public advanced knowledge of FTC
enforcement actions which attempted to

485
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:14,490
profit they knew ahead of time he's
coming up with their time with the FTC I

486
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:19,240
better hired them so they get a contract
has their cause they're kind of like

487
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:23,040
anybody's you know he likes

488
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:29,140
these guys and by this time have to see
lord you're pretty beat up but they only

489
00:41:29,140 --> 00:41:34,450
have one choice this is basically the
FTC praying that no one pays attention

490
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:41,750
but the lack of evidence is disturbing
and the screaming silence today thank

491
00:41:41,750 --> 00:41:47,940
you black for this platform is that
there are cronies not all cronies

492
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:52,360
academia privacy experts media big law
firms who are into it for the money

493
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:58,640
attention maybe a future job so you know
what let's not take him up on this one

494
00:41:58,640 --> 00:42:04,230
is just a big deal and then the FTC
dances around here in DEFCON last year

495
00:42:04,230 --> 00:42:10,110
and this year trying to seduce everybody
aren't we friendly let's play a game

496
00:42:10,110 --> 00:42:15,150
the real cybersecurity a regulatory
agenda the FTC has to be the number one

497
00:42:15,150 --> 00:42:18,530
self-appointed cybersecurity regulator
expand jurisdiction to medicine

498
00:42:18,530 --> 00:42:23,220
technology finance via building a
portfolio of consent decrees avoid the

499
00:42:23,220 --> 00:42:27,100
federal courts by persecution through
process play chicken little to contact

500
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,920
the media it's terrible

501
00:42:28,920 --> 00:42:32,200
the bridges are terrible we must get
everything together will take care but

502
00:42:32,200 --> 00:42:35,970
they doing a fine job by the way
especially after the opium bridge

503
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:40,669
they're not the solution they have the
wrong people

504
00:42:40,670 --> 00:42:44,420
overseeing cybersecurity is costing us a
fortune where revolt where we are

505
00:42:44,420 --> 00:42:49,670
vulnerable there the predators who
achieve nothing and know that when the

506
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:53,240
FTC calls you you're not in discussion
your not under investigation you need to

507
00:42:53,240 --> 00:42:59,399
know you're under attack the takeaway
here is this a breaches now to breach

508
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:04,770
the way you know legally when they come
at you so don't panic

509
00:43:04,770 --> 00:43:10,180
take your time if it gets out don't do
your homework you're gonna have the

510
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:18,080
sconce and you know a privacy expert go
at me when this first broke like that

511
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,970
terrible man of course he was
intellectually honest and she went to

512
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:25,480
see we're very

513
00:43:25,480 --> 00:43:31,580
away

514
00:43:31,580 --> 00:43:34,590
response plan that takes in
consideration the true agenda when

515
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:36,609
lawyers call know how to handle it

516
00:43:36,609 --> 00:43:40,670
they are exploiting your patriotism and
believe that they're gonna fight fair

517
00:43:40,670 --> 00:43:44,050
they're not gonna fight fair all law
firms are scary films are not the same

518
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:47,780
when the government not scared or
they're not on your side

519
00:43:47,780 --> 00:43:50,369
don't lose precious defense time with
them that he believed that these people

520
00:43:50,369 --> 00:43:54,780
play clean they don't they will explore
your pages in your experience you're

521
00:43:54,780 --> 00:44:00,770
smarter now don't fall for it but most
importantly you guys are the solution

522
00:44:00,770 --> 00:44:07,900
and they need this crowd everyone needs
this crowd just like in medicine it's

523
00:44:07,900 --> 00:44:12,420
like it's never gonna stop being there's
never be perfect security it's never

524
00:44:12,420 --> 00:44:17,250
going to be it's always going to grow it
always going to be happy complexes and

525
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:22,359
problems in the States but if you sit
there punitive alien attack everybody in

526
00:44:22,359 --> 00:44:26,000
medicine ever systemic wit you know we
have to look at the big picture we have

527
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:29,910
to look collectors I'm not against the
government having agencies or regulators

528
00:44:29,910 --> 00:44:34,200
I just think congress needs to pull
their power and killed this

529
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:41,100
administrative power so there's outside
authority so I think I miss her so I

530
00:44:41,100 --> 00:44:43,009
finished on time thank you very much

531
00:44:43,010 --> 00:44:47,369
we've got about five minutes for
questions and i know this press on sock

532
00:44:47,369 --> 00:44:51,490
me in anyone's time after this thirty
minutes and braker see after we finish

533
00:44:51,490 --> 00:44:54,020
here so I'm has questions and I'm going
to ask him

534
00:44:54,020 --> 00:44:58,130
abiam breaker see for at least half an
hour and feel free to get in touch with

535
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:02,160
me so I have a question there's
microphones being a partisan got a

536
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,410
microphone and introduce yourself

537
00:45:04,410 --> 00:45:17,279
yester so I think its answers that
Maicon MIP now Mike sent out on

538
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:23,770
so my question was did you ever engage a
prevalence in a response organization

539
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:29,660
not terribly but another one we actually
hired the guy who came in house after

540
00:45:29,660 --> 00:45:34,799
yeah we heard a guy in 2010 we went to
outsiders and then actually he lived in

541
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:38,450
Oklahoma and and he had a company out
there and then we brought him in and he

542
00:45:38,450 --> 00:45:46,100
joined the company at that way at
Websense in 2010 but that takes the bait

543
00:45:46,100 --> 00:45:51,560
see I don't want I don't mind us being
questioned but it takes the bait there

544
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:54,410
is no such thing as we could've done
right around they wouldn't tell us so

545
00:45:54,410 --> 00:45:57,779
what gives an instant response gonna do
in 2008 or nine or ten not that we don't

546
00:45:57,780 --> 00:46:02,360
have to have one we were we were
inspected all the time

547
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:06,390
expected by HIPAA were inspected
annually we have perfect scores most of

548
00:46:06,390 --> 00:46:09,220
the year and I'm not saying we're
perfect and I must say we should have

549
00:46:09,220 --> 00:46:12,839
been better but it takes the bait it's
not the top of the topic is they don't

550
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:16,890
tell you what you're doing wrong or what
you're doing right so how we gonna know

551
00:46:16,890 --> 00:46:21,319
when you build this when we spend
billions of dollars and cybersecurity we

552
00:46:21,320 --> 00:46:29,580
can spend and how they want to do what's
right or wrong but yes but in 2010

553
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:41,799
contacted by the security firm and they
wanted I've actually seen this scenario

554
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:48,780
couple times yeah become a popular show
me the way that I've handle it for me is

555
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:53,770
I try to bring in the FBI you know get
get in touch with the local office and

556
00:46:53,770 --> 00:46:57,290
say these people are trying to extort
money from me you know and then get some

557
00:46:57,290 --> 00:47:02,590
sort of FBI investigation did were you
able to get any traction there with the

558
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:07,240
end we weren't there something I can say
they're still investigation going to

559
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:13,299
forgive make it believe me I'll see what
I can you picked up but no at the time

560
00:47:13,300 --> 00:47:16,220
you know it's weird we're just a
different time now at seven years ago

561
00:47:16,220 --> 00:47:20,910
and now it's a different world is so
different I think we probably had more

562
00:47:20,910 --> 00:47:23,589
than now than we do then but

563
00:47:23,589 --> 00:47:27,259
versus like because there's a
jurisdiction issue there's a proven

564
00:47:27,259 --> 00:47:31,539
issue we actually suit and the book
there's a lot more we sued them and the

565
00:47:31,539 --> 00:47:35,579
Georgia Court said oh well there's no
law about this so we don't know if it's

566
00:47:35,579 --> 00:47:39,599
our jurisdictions or throwing your taste
your jurisdiction so you have to sue in

567
00:47:39,599 --> 00:47:43,599
another jurisdiction because we have two
similar law and similar law says it's

568
00:47:43,599 --> 00:47:47,489
where the perpetrator is the
perpetration pittsburgh has a telephonic

569
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:50,680
harassment law both of which is where
the phone is at the teller a search

570
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:56,419
using it for the harasser hours till it
comes back then I think be different now

571
00:47:56,420 --> 00:48:02,059
oh yes to your question yes I did have a
question I live here in Las Vegas Nevada

572
00:48:02,059 --> 00:48:08,979
and my question was obviously a lot of
what's happened what you've described is

573
00:48:08,979 --> 00:48:13,769
money oriented and the tightest money
and greed what is the one thing that you

574
00:48:13,769 --> 00:48:17,598
could play in your word that would
prevent a windfall of this happening in

575
00:48:17,599 --> 00:48:23,239
this industry if I think the industry
has to get very proactive and understand

576
00:48:23,239 --> 00:48:27,019
we're dealing with and take control of
it so that they don't take control so

577
00:48:27,019 --> 00:48:31,209
we're not reacted so definitely citing
examples like doing what you're doing

578
00:48:31,210 --> 00:48:32,729
and standing up for what's right

579
00:48:32,729 --> 00:48:36,629
technologists I think the technologies
have tons of information they have to

580
00:48:36,630 --> 00:48:42,059
speak out and and and and by telling
story like this happen to talk about it

581
00:48:42,059 --> 00:48:47,799
and I and i have again I'm not like no
government or no FTC I mean it's

582
00:48:47,799 --> 00:48:52,309
impractical but I do think that we have
to not let any government agency who

583
00:48:52,309 --> 00:48:55,630
does have this month centralized power
because they visit any one of the big

584
00:48:55,630 --> 00:48:58,380
corporations of using it to me get
centralized power you abused it right

585
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:01,309
and you mentioned before that there
won't be any doctors anymore what's your

586
00:49:01,309 --> 00:49:07,520
premise behind that continued

587
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:12,100
as if there were no positions if you if
you went after only perfectionist and

588
00:49:12,100 --> 00:49:17,799
write you know if professional standards
it can't work in this level of I mean I

589
00:49:17,800 --> 00:49:20,460
actually think technology actually is
where we were in medicine over a hundred

590
00:49:20,460 --> 00:49:23,960
years ago where we're at such an early
stage and there's so much and go on and

591
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:30,060
head of security in five ten years you
know but and punitive aspect of the

592
00:49:30,060 --> 00:49:33,720
government coming in is is not helping
the situation do you believe that it

593
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:38,910
should remain privatized is that I'm
open to collaboration because I think

594
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:42,980
the medical regulations very successful
it was collaborative we felt safe we

595
00:49:42,980 --> 00:49:46,720
need to keep them in check as while they
keep themselves and check because we

596
00:49:46,720 --> 00:49:50,350
have expertise in there i mean that the
HHS and have that kind of power or the

597
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:54,830
local regulators I mean it's just you
don't just let these guys make their own

598
00:49:54,830 --> 00:50:00,720
rules and have their own court that's a
step that has to change and and and have

599
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:05,089
the FTC has a couple technologists now
but I still think it is window dressing

600
00:50:05,090 --> 00:50:09,250
because I think that most of that the
lawyers are have all this power and they

601
00:50:09,250 --> 00:50:12,540
bury this end and leave the dead have no
voice but they've destroyed your company

602
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:16,850
or their big corporation doesn't have
any bad press even congress hasn't found

603
00:50:16,850 --> 00:50:21,230
out about it i mean i I'm kind of
surprised many congressional talks as

604
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:27,540
I've now had in meetings how much they
want to know it's kind of scary actually

605
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:33,170
did you another question sir I just wait
to you finish my personal experience

606
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:37,080
with the courts as well so I appreciate
your perspective think you have to tie

607
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:41,680
up a couple seconds here my only
question is do I came in here late did

608
00:50:41,680 --> 00:50:46,770
you mentioned anything about lobbyists
now and that's why I used to like a very

609
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:50,880
intelligent gentlemen but I have to ask
question did you utilize all your

610
00:50:50,880 --> 00:50:55,130
resources to go to battle are you
kidding me the company's dead

611
00:50:55,130 --> 00:50:58,030
not asking that I'm asking you to
utilize all your search all your

612
00:50:58,030 --> 00:51:02,390
resources than the company or money I
mean there's leverage in his resources I

613
00:51:02,390 --> 00:51:05,730
understand your plate I guess situation
that you're gonna get resources until

614
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:10,840
about maybe resources that maybe you
wish you would have gotten it tapped

615
00:51:10,840 --> 00:51:14,800
into over the last three or four five
six seven years becoming exhausted every

616
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:20,100
single I'm sure I didn't know I
shouldn't have to for a fair trial is

617
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:24,610
not about what they don't play fair you
should know that based on your own

618
00:51:24,610 --> 00:51:26,340
intelligence

619
00:51:26,340 --> 00:51:31,450
you're gonna go into a fight with a gun
you go with a knife you gonna loose

620
00:51:31,450 --> 00:51:35,109
I'm just giving the analogy because
you're smart guy I'm just asking because

621
00:51:35,110 --> 00:51:38,090
you seem like a very intelligent man
that's all well with all due respect

622
00:51:38,090 --> 00:51:43,190
that puts a burden on the accused and
that is that's a scary world if you

623
00:51:43,190 --> 00:51:46,240
think that's a really doesn't even
thought that's exactly why speak out

624
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:49,640
because if that's true that's gotta
change of course it's true we know it

625
00:51:49,640 --> 00:51:54,650
should have to go to go to see i
preciate it has come in thank you and I

626
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:56,120
appreciate your time thanks a lot
