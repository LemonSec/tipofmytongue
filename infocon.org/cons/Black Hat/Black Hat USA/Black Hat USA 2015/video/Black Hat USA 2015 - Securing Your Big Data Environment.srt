1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,840
loud enough thanks for coming over I
know I G goes into earlier talked with

2
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:18,250
charlie is crazy and black has just
keeps getting bigger and bigger words it

3
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:25,759
felt like salmon swimming upstream just
so many people so I mean it's great it's

4
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:33,239
great true ok for us anyways so this
talk about securing your data

5
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:46,699
environment and the guys you probably
have one for those in your wallet right

6
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:54,250
now but was involved at opera companies
insurance companies and other tech

7
00:00:54,250 --> 00:01:05,680
companies called the stars before that
action by Manning and surge in there but

8
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:16,840
anyways so I quickly went to enforce on
the target self so big data means a lot

9
00:01:16,840 --> 00:01:25,310
of things people and I think so I mean
you guys the cyber style / all over in

10
00:01:25,310 --> 00:01:31,369
the hallway people are using machine
learning out with those people using new

11
00:01:31,369 --> 00:01:35,600
streaming data from all over the place
and they're making and driving and

12
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,408
intelligent decision to make intelligent
decisions out from that shaming data so

13
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:49,570
there's this hog is less I guess you
what you might consider as threat

14
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:59,089
intelligence or brown and the Turks and
more on the platform itself so more and

15
00:01:59,090 --> 00:02:04,350
more companies are pushing a ton of data
into their big day an environment what

16
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:09,169
used to be the mainframes moved into a
bunch of relational databases and most

17
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:15,099
Oryx and everything is converging into
this massive data league that's called

18
00:02:15,099 --> 00:02:21,910
Big Data so this talk is more focused on
that like how would you secure the

19
00:02:21,910 --> 00:02:27,760
platform itself and what can you do
about that once that goal has been

20
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:31,720
achieved so it's it's it's more than
that I'll do a bunch of threat modeling

21
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:37,890
exercises I mean talk server propane
service deliver better and I think

22
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:45,619
finally answers questions on how can we
actually go about trying to secure this

23
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:50,830
platform will get what can we do about
it and how to effectively do it so it

24
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:55,480
will be focused on that and other
relating along talking to my personal

25
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,290
experiences research what I found was
successful

26
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:12,730
you know don't do this sort of thing and
again in the room and elsewhere Lee

27
00:03:12,730 --> 00:03:15,629
what's what's big data

28
00:03:15,629 --> 00:03:19,940
hundred definitions on everything it
means different things to different

29
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:26,609
people so just so quick level setting on
a big deal just means I'm extremely

30
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:33,200
large job data sad or size and structure
is beyond what traditional database

31
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:39,030
systems can storm process I'm sure you
guys had experienced a dev team's IKr

32
00:03:39,030 --> 00:03:48,099
does she go closer and you find out that
their data sizes maybe ten makes in size

33
00:03:48,099 --> 00:03:53,140
and its Excel spreadsheet so you know
again it means different things to

34
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:57,380
different people i'm i'm talking about
this has a very good enough

35
00:03:57,380 --> 00:04:06,829
mission on big data management and and
and the reason I try to pick on had two

36
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:11,200
beers it's it's probably the most
well-known association with anything big

37
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:19,170
data related its most common and values
to our platform so throughout this hard

38
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:24,830
job on the intermingling the terms on a
due date about it it's it's it's big

39
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:30,820
enough that it should apply to any big
department you know sequel bokram you

40
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:43,840
guys so again secure the platform itself
and like I said I had people are just

41
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:51,859
moving stuff into these data legs and
that includes you may have payment card

42
00:04:51,860 --> 00:05:00,990
data or medical data your child data
either PII different country regulations

43
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:07,410
EU regulation to everything and those
cats dogs is getting shipped off to

44
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:14,100
these data legs so what that would mean
to you know this is a platform that

45
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:20,710
would consider on par with any other
data store you have any enterprise and

46
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,590
you might have noticed I don't know how
it's in how it happened in your or

47
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:28,469
existing have a big deal about from
people are some couple guys and I heard

48
00:05:28,470 --> 00:05:32,720
about this thing let's burn it off and
before you know it goes from POC to

49
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,940
adapt to its a production people are
just putting production date in there so

50
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:46,980
you know it's you you have sensitive
data in there and another thing is again

51
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,050
because it has some sort of bailout
subject of different regulatory

52
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:56,360
compliance requirement so all that PCI
for example that you have to worry about

53
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,450
doesn't go away

54
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:00,650
you guys to do it if this environment

55
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:06,989
has cart or the data for example and I
think I like to turn example the third

56
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:18,280
reason the most and mainly because you
know the the way organizations are

57
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,219
moving forward

58
00:06:19,220 --> 00:06:25,820
the the new environment for new
techniques like for example or people

59
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:31,509
are you leveraging the cloud more and
more and what happens is you you're not

60
00:06:31,509 --> 00:06:37,400
in a situation where hey I'm gonna
designed more for him and you know I'll

61
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:41,669
have a bunch of requirements and will
plan and design and execute accordingly

62
00:06:41,669 --> 00:06:45,260
it does we're not in that day and age
anymore

63
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:52,560
things are happening so fast I think as
security practitioners or people

64
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,210
responsible for security in our
respective works what we want to do is

65
00:06:57,210 --> 00:07:04,989
support on her prize on how can we allow
this to happen and you know we allow it

66
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:10,820
to happen is if a bunch of people are
able to use it without worrying about

67
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:17,289
too much control time what I mean is a
big data platform is only as useful as

68
00:07:17,289 --> 00:07:23,889
analysis you can do under minus an
analysis is directly related to how much

69
00:07:23,889 --> 00:07:27,330
data sets can access and the second you
start putting constraints whether to

70
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:32,599
crypto access control whatever those are
some of the value proposition starts to

71
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:39,120
go away so you will want to expose this
platform and secured at the same time so

72
00:07:39,120 --> 00:07:44,460
you can kinda minimize those concerns
because if you even if you just go back

73
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:49,469
maybe two or three years ago when this
ecosystem and general wasn't considered

74
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:54,810
secure the only thing you're doing fine
and there was no on sensitive data you

75
00:07:54,810 --> 00:07:59,710
know maybe people just threw a test
stuff in there anything on sensitive

76
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:04,138
used to be in there and I mean you're
not really leveraging the platform but

77
00:08:04,139 --> 00:08:08,080
you know you see you guys heard
charlie's dog and some of the other

78
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,900
talks here the Internet of Things

79
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:16,690
so that means you'll have more devices
sanding extremely sensitive data is so

80
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:23,190
for example are in Charlie's talk here
is hacking cars any moving vehicles but

81
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:27,930
if you go back without insurance
companies for example to add a stake in

82
00:08:27,930 --> 00:08:34,330
those readers that's capturing your
vehicle information haha struggling

83
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:43,200
sensitive stars that eventually comes
back you can not effective in our taxes

84
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:54,850
exposed to so and vendors in in this
place they do a pretty decent job and

85
00:08:54,850 --> 00:09:00,690
sometimes just come back and say hey you
know we don't lock you down we expose

86
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:07,690
our AP highs we expose our platform
everything is sore so you can just had a

87
00:09:07,690 --> 00:09:12,529
career so whatever you want and just
customize apart from like how you say so

88
00:09:12,529 --> 00:09:30,620
and you look at this area you know it is
open source again it's untrue they have

89
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:37,930
taken over towards any patches and
augmented to customize it because all

90
00:09:37,930 --> 00:09:41,750
these vendors I mean therefore process
what they do is they are meant to

91
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:48,560
solutions take the native code base and
customize it and then resold prizes and

92
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:56,739
everyone else out there and why that's
and give you guys just copy examples so

93
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:08,580
if you go back and look at the cev
database there are only four reported

94
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:14,270
and six findings in the past three years
now that's a significant metric for your

95
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:21,569
risk for example I mean what that means
is if you go back to all Microsoft days

96
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:26,240
Microsoft had a bunch of bugs but there
were published as seen the use of

97
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:30,640
closers the vendors are demanding
founded and they did a bunch of things

98
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:37,670
that passion and no one was the wiser
but I mean this is reflective of the

99
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:43,930
ecosystem is truly open doors where the
box and was fixing them so some

100
00:10:43,930 --> 00:10:49,650
something think about it and if the
traditional RDBMS a system that used to

101
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:53,550
house a lot of your sensitive data
demonstrate like literally decades of

102
00:10:53,550 --> 00:10:59,680
regular I got you know i mean you know
we can make fun of Microsoft all day

103
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:06,199
long but since a doctor as deal see the
single server platform only had one

104
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:12,100
finding one thing to finish I think that
was also a shared library show and now

105
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:22,140
you take that back and look at all the
hard work of some and then your surface

106
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:31,390
area of exposure increased and it's
unknown and the last thing there's

107
00:11:31,390 --> 00:11:35,189
absolutely no standardization I mean you
know you you can make on who the big

108
00:11:35,190 --> 00:11:38,880
vendors are if you're trying to get our
package solution or if you're trying get

109
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:45,560
a true open source Apache package blood
and there's no standardization and what

110
00:11:45,560 --> 00:11:52,569
I mean by starvation as I know we will
protect your data has sorry take care of

111
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:59,470
this I am later but it but there
everyone does a different day you shift

112
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:05,410
of vendor it's true that truly hard to
do that again because there's no

113
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:07,480
standardization

114
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:14,170
and some metrics right this is this is
the latest data opium it sits on the far

115
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:23,319
right just this past year the mandated
reaches hand flashes quickly because it

116
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:30,100
just shows how much our Davis can
increase the volume and you can you can

117
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:39,030
add or take a no reason because Oracle
exploit or job

118
00:12:39,030 --> 00:12:47,050
middleware exploit this is Richard thing
to do and you know so I mean just think

119
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:55,760
about in the today I think in a way this
is just about ready to take off road

120
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,310
that tipping point so what would a
museum in as security factors here said

121
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:05,250
we always think oh man I wish I had a
inherited a greenfield and Carmen I

122
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:09,700
think this is one of those rare
situations where I didn't really

123
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:13,810
inherited Greenfield environment but
we're pretty close to starting point and

124
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:19,750
we can do a bunch of things that may not
be possible for so secure the platform

125
00:13:19,750 --> 00:13:26,070
and wait for the enterprise to push data
center environment and again

126
00:13:26,070 --> 00:13:31,990
Verizon metrics on how fast it takes
attackers to compromise and yeah I know

127
00:13:31,990 --> 00:13:38,130
if you guys for the latest on Verizon
report but sixty personally cases and it

128
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:44,300
just as a shin was breached and data
export trade with them so that's a

129
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:51,099
significant magic and think about if
data was fragmented and your sensitive

130
00:13:51,100 --> 00:13:57,650
data what you care about is all over the
place and attackers how do they know

131
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:59,840
they're there

132
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:05,570
trying to traverse environment now guess
you just made it easy for them

133
00:14:05,570 --> 00:14:12,850
everything is in a central place just
one place every everything so the

134
00:14:12,850 --> 00:14:25,330
problem is seeing significant challenges
will only increase so something just ask

135
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:41,000
later and where they think about that
sounds different kinds of things maybe

136
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:48,660
they're more Chartered damages
environment or things of that nature but

137
00:14:48,660 --> 00:14:54,770
I mean there there's a there's a finite
set of things in the universe that an

138
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:59,920
attacker wants to do they want to gain
access to your sensitive Mei you know

139
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:03,890
even if you think on the whole attacker
you go system right it I don't want to

140
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:07,750
generalize an attacker and especially in
a place like black hard but if you think

141
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:13,880
about it there are only three segments
one as the guys who have tried to break

142
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:19,939
into our environment because you have
maybe some monetary or some financial

143
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:24,190
relevant data that they can take out
reviews and get some financial gain and

144
00:15:24,190 --> 00:15:31,450
then a second set maybe this more falls
into the nation state territory now you

145
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:38,320
know maybe a defense contractor you have
something very sensitive take that and

146
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:45,550
then the tired category the laws they
just do it because it's fun right so as

147
00:15:45,550 --> 00:15:52,670
a defender if you boil down your problem
statement if you know who you are what

148
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:58,790
data is in your environment then you can
identify who is a potential category as

149
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:02,800
an attacker will come after you so you
can start to plan your defenses around

150
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:08,699
you know you know different types of

151
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:17,310
I am later at the network layer and
hosts level

152
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:21,469
cryptographic production address will
hit undersell over later and

153
00:16:21,470 --> 00:16:30,200
infrastructure secure jobs over the next
couple I just quickly run through it

154
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:37,480
typical would have seen through my
research like if I have to generalize

155
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:44,000
hey what does a typical big data and
barman looks like I'm gonna run around

156
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:58,320
through this and this is a through it
quickly and there's a white paper a part

157
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:07,250
of this just a typical environment right
do you have an extra entity may be at a

158
00:17:07,250 --> 00:17:11,290
partner or a customer is trying to get
into environment so you have an external

159
00:17:11,290 --> 00:17:17,970
internet based on attack vector than you
know maybe you have some sort of

160
00:17:17,970 --> 00:17:22,640
corporate trust boundary of New York
collecting all the messages may be

161
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:28,590
aroused or so message maybe there's some
sort of a bastion host or epoxy we're

162
00:17:28,590 --> 00:17:32,330
advocating and collecting events then
you have your corporate users the guys

163
00:17:32,330 --> 00:17:37,060
who actually use the cluster do a lot of
stuff or maybe there's an external user

164
00:17:37,060 --> 00:17:42,520
trying to a bunch of thanks and I i just
put in a random sampling on enterprise

165
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:45,820
roundtree like maybe there's some
business intelligence clients that

166
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:56,409
running some politics jobs either I am
component Active Directory curb and this

167
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,800
is important I just want to flash
through this alone because one of the

168
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:10,639
things that is asked hey you know I'm
doing my reassured John just starting to

169
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,740
get into this

170
00:18:11,740 --> 00:18:17,020
the Big Data tang and I did a comparison
of all the vendors and the space I

171
00:18:17,020 --> 00:18:22,389
really like the features of this one guy
but I really like the features of this

172
00:18:22,390 --> 00:18:27,720
other guy what do i do and you know
obviously have the cause and the pricing

173
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:34,460
decisions and this platform is very this
vendor is very true to open stores

174
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:42,110
everything is as close to open source as
this other guy they customize a hangover

175
00:18:42,110 --> 00:18:48,229
they have a lot of security controls
that I think I truly want to leverage so

176
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:56,240
you know a little bit and end of the day
I think it it's a good thing to think

177
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:05,070
about it ok to segment two clusters have
one class sure and maybe some 30 your

178
00:19:05,070 --> 00:19:11,000
sensitive stylus and another we're not
sensitive data and you know the clashes

179
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:14,400
can talk to each other and we'll talk to
a bunch of techniques are all over later

180
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:21,230
but it's ok to have a multiplier vendor
a distributed environment and doing

181
00:19:21,230 --> 00:19:24,510
exactly the same thing as long as you
know but ensuring that some sort of the

182
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:33,800
crypto bus or and access there and you
know again different ways people connect

183
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:38,389
your environment we saw the corporate
users you have your typical application

184
00:19:38,390 --> 00:19:44,330
in turn off surrounding retail jobs
running through different calls his GPS

185
00:19:44,330 --> 00:19:46,908
service

186
00:19:46,909 --> 00:19:51,399
different ways to connect you see this
guy in the corner I mention put that in

187
00:19:51,399 --> 00:20:03,459
you know when you look at the model and
the paper but people like yeah so this

188
00:20:03,460 --> 00:20:09,179
guy here there's a corporate user and
their asses to do your own directly into

189
00:20:09,179 --> 00:20:19,249
the client machine and they can access
your classroom jobs so I think I know ok

190
00:20:19,249 --> 00:20:28,029
but this time painting here is a pretty
good baseline implementation of most big

191
00:20:28,029 --> 00:20:33,690
data environment and you know that
threat model go through the protocols

192
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:45,080
that axis layers upon layers so finally
and this this framework has evolved and

193
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:56,039
Jess in the last couple years spending a
lot of time on those and controller

194
00:20:56,039 --> 00:20:57,070
control category

195
00:20:57,070 --> 00:21:03,418
things things you can do or think about
some of it and data management I am

196
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:07,710
later the typical data protection stuff
the network security and infrastructure

197
00:21:07,710 --> 00:21:14,609
security I'll highlight some of these
controls more than just because I think

198
00:21:14,609 --> 00:21:32,109
they're the most significant and most
value like I said I think exercise a few

199
00:21:32,109 --> 00:21:41,019
guys are getting started is just the
data classification exercise different

200
00:21:41,019 --> 00:21:45,830
fashions you have a whole team daughter
doing some of this work but if you think

201
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:54,100
about it and energy and controls
protecting data that

202
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:57,840
important to us or

203
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:05,209
and and off all those data types of the
most important because the day you start

204
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:11,520
this exercise the first thing that an
executive alaska so it's great so do we

205
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:17,200
have like 60 feels that oh yeah okay so
would you cryptographically protected

206
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,000
and every one of those fields and
hopefully that answer is no because I

207
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,260
mean there's no way you can start a
project or a work effort saying yeah

208
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:32,299
I'll protect sixteen different fuels
across our 10,000 database environment

209
00:22:32,299 --> 00:22:37,820
for example that will never happen to
what this truly is a prioritization

210
00:22:37,820 --> 00:22:44,580
exercise and a house on more details on
the paper but just a quick glance the

211
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:49,370
final score how in calculating it is
likely impact so what control weakness

212
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:56,649
for the first column as it can I apply
cryptographic control on the data field

213
00:22:56,650 --> 00:23:00,940
so there's some scores around it then
there's a value to an attacker's so

214
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:05,500
there's some there's some data that it's
easier for an entire country's household

215
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:11,710
card data is very easy to for them to
resale on the black market but if I have

216
00:23:11,710 --> 00:23:20,669
the blueprints latest Apache helicopters
and the USNavy or something then the

217
00:23:20,669 --> 00:23:26,490
value I mean there's no resale value are
different but you know what's a value to

218
00:23:26,490 --> 00:23:37,240
an attacker you know there there are
very effective phishing campaigns so if

219
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:43,450
if if I'm a customer I think about it if
I lose my house someone some entity out

220
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:49,700
there gets breached and our data yeah I
mean Yes thats impactful but as a

221
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:50,419
customer

222
00:23:50,419 --> 00:23:55,850
the first thing I okay I get the notice
I called my bank said hey can you work

223
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:59,959
hard and two days later I got a brand
new card doesn't there's a pain because

224
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:04,190
how to go change some of the buildings
and on I live in

225
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:13,210
it's at ok by if I lose and identity
like see my email address individual

226
00:24:13,210 --> 00:24:19,490
person I have more and that's more
impact of me so did you know and I

227
00:24:19,490 --> 00:24:25,850
talked about the impact of the customer
itself then there's different other

228
00:24:25,850 --> 00:24:34,139
fuels like it I have losses field I can
do business and open and I have more

229
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:39,269
details on how you guys can do this
assessment in your own organization in

230
00:24:39,269 --> 00:24:48,879
the papers so a dish going to record
control characters I will highlight

231
00:24:48,879 --> 00:24:55,399
those this feature like on that first
row this is probably the most discovery

232
00:24:55,399 --> 00:25:01,668
and the reason I say that you know
there's a bunch of data coming in now

233
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:08,389
for you to do anything to protected you
need to know exactly where that data is

234
00:25:08,389 --> 00:25:13,939
so for example a typical like dat is
coming and getting dropped in a cluster

235
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:20,620
of comedy limited or seek Winter Park a
format whatever your favorite for

236
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:28,120
matters but if you know that hey this is
a particular column that has her card

237
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:33,969
data or you know maybe I wanna tokenizer
or maybe I won't interrupt it unless you

238
00:25:33,970 --> 00:25:37,809
know what you're trying to protect it's
hard to do their protection control on

239
00:25:37,809 --> 00:25:45,330
it so you have to start exercise the
other that this really goes here is out

240
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:52,360
for example if you tell an executive hey
you know I just have you know a ten

241
00:25:52,360 --> 00:26:00,340
billion records of extremely sensitive
data

242
00:26:00,340 --> 00:26:05,530
executives to get stuff done so its good
from getting them

243
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:15,250
and it's also good trying to actually
control and data tagging anytime you can

244
00:26:15,250 --> 00:26:24,030
tag anything I'm stream so I listened
typical matters people just drive data

245
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:30,100
and data out why this is important to
you know you start thinking okay again

246
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:38,449
chain is pretty well known and so you
have to assume a lot of cases that an

247
00:26:38,450 --> 00:26:45,180
attacker a bad guy is already in your
environment so ok that's fine but the

248
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,560
true impact you

249
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:52,460
happens when they leave with that data
and you know there's a compromise so

250
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:55,630
it's all about trying to break the couch
and where do you focus your time and

251
00:26:55,630 --> 00:27:00,420
energy on if you go of it doesn't show
that an attacker is already in your

252
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:05,880
enterprise what do you do so when I
showed here are some very typical I

253
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:12,620
think I probably covered about 90% of
the matter is that they get robbed in

254
00:27:12,620 --> 00:27:19,780
this environment again it's it's all
about trying to funnel your problem

255
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:21,960
statement

256
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:27,340
attacker classes you know what your
sensitive data is and what's important

257
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:32,459
here and what you want to tag and then
you know what the typical ingress and

258
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:50,750
egress matter target you start you can
start so I want is you you probably will

259
00:27:50,750 --> 00:28:04,110
discover I should realize hey guys are
closure Jesus

260
00:28:04,110 --> 00:28:18,000
storage is so cheap charges are pending
for terabyte of storage very cheap but

261
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:22,690
as you start putting data in your
cluster by their training security jobs

262
00:28:22,690 --> 00:28:30,730
are movies your dad's running and
dialectics and also because that

263
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:34,600
discovery thing I just talked about when
you run a job

264
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:40,699
drugs as a job on the closer so you have
to decompress job and income you know

265
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:54,020
for sure back and tell if you have six
times its sixth time baghdad

266
00:28:54,020 --> 00:28:59,660
classification charged so that under
something in the financial industry if

267
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:10,720
an attacker and I'll table cards gets
breached its a big deal but if you look

268
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:16,130
at it from a pure attacker perspective
it's useless because I think about it I

269
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:20,340
love you going to say Amazon are you go
to any ecommerce site can you buy

270
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,360
anything

271
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:27,020
register the 16 digit or the $15 credit
card number now you need other

272
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:34,560
attributes maybe it's in the United
States plug in your credit card

273
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:42,030
you enter your five digit zip code value
may be an e-commerce site that things I

274
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:46,760
get asked what your tree digit number at
the back of your card or which expired

275
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:54,660
and the reason being that obvious
problems cluster ok great I just found

276
00:29:54,660 --> 00:30:07,870
on her card numbers are you know if I
find a record number and zip code

277
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:14,080
that's more important to me that someone
I want to truly protect first and maybe

278
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:22,409
I'll come back to rest later so quickly
running through III again use your

279
00:30:22,410 --> 00:30:26,850
entire Roman there's a bunch of things
and techniques I think you do I listen

280
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:34,100
tools are patchy fog patches and reopen
tours you can start putting it in your

281
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,199
environment

282
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:43,690
the big thing I want to focus on and I
am section actually taps so a lot of

283
00:30:43,690 --> 00:30:55,030
people don't have it it's just it's it's
a pat it's your password

284
00:30:55,030 --> 00:31:02,210
get you after you get you the Kerberos
ticket process and quiet and that's

285
00:31:02,210 --> 00:31:10,920
important as from attackers factor I
like to think ahead if I began using a

286
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:19,960
regular to my pleasure now and then I
run as you to get credentials

287
00:31:19,960 --> 00:31:23,280
that's our problem in you know that's
part of normal operations you want as

288
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:30,840
you sometimes do some jobs but now what
extent that threat scenarios to say okay

289
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:39,500
what is configured on all these systems
now to do effectively do that you

290
00:31:39,500 --> 00:31:46,690
probably have some sort of about SSH key
is going on now so what happens is I go

291
00:31:46,690 --> 00:31:53,179
in eyes and wants a one time one time in
there as an actor Salman militias actor

292
00:31:53,179 --> 00:32:03,050
I can go switch to my directory than I i
have complete access to my private keys

293
00:32:03,050 --> 00:32:11,620
rude than navigating to other servers in
the cluster as you

294
00:32:11,620 --> 00:32:19,590
and now because I have complete access I
also have access to all so now your

295
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:26,500
typical I can do it and I don't have any
other cute as far as I can use an

296
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:35,400
existing start impersonating someone
maybe I create a secondary icon so the

297
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:39,210
only time there's audit trail back is
the first time I logged into a cluster

298
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:41,440
and after that I'm gone

299
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:55,010
anonymous so I think this is tripped
over dioxin had different layers

300
00:32:55,010 --> 00:32:56,660
different matters you can do it

301
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:05,870
application talked about it at the AFL
level now the quick transaction summary

302
00:33:05,870 --> 00:33:14,178
on this if you have a large existing
cluster commentator and maybe its

303
00:33:14,179 --> 00:33:21,010
cardholder data to first and maybe you
want to do it

304
00:33:21,010 --> 00:33:30,059
transparent encryption do so it's not
like being transplanted it doesn't

305
00:33:30,059 --> 00:33:34,830
really protect you against certain
factors but Adam minimum bid because it

306
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:38,689
protects it underlines hard system and
if your leverage and external key

307
00:33:38,690 --> 00:33:44,020
manager those cute outfit that I just
talked about 10 encrypted and use some

308
00:33:44,020 --> 00:33:52,170
an attacker also need to fetch keys from
a national manager so it just separation

309
00:33:52,170 --> 00:34:05,260
from a protection bunch of highlighting
my favorite tokenization you guys heard

310
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,520
about it

311
00:34:06,520 --> 00:34:18,899
I think about reduction if you're be
ideal is expecting data to come back in

312
00:34:18,899 --> 00:34:31,270
a certain what you don't want to do so
maybe break $1.99 ago just turn into a

313
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:38,330
hundred twenty or so

314
00:34:38,330 --> 00:34:45,310
togas Asian I think cryptographic
techniques and I think some people call

315
00:34:45,310 --> 00:34:51,120
it for preserving encryption to i mean
for me I'm just collapsing everything as

316
00:34:51,120 --> 00:35:00,990
some level of format preserving crypto
highlight some things like the FB

317
00:35:00,990 --> 00:35:10,229
standard is awfully big tits it's the
final is awfully big dinner standard

318
00:35:10,230 --> 00:35:29,470
something running through 2020 5%
overhead to single digits so I can ride

319
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:32,540
linked with that twenty twenty-five
percent overhead it sits on a small

320
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:39,980
problem anymore everything becomes a big
problem because you have to stand up the

321
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:54,630
whole everything else so just security

322
00:35:54,630 --> 00:36:03,910
the good thing is almost every single
distribution out there now has again

323
00:36:03,910 --> 00:36:08,399
there's well-known published techniques
that data in transit or Taylors

324
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:14,850
protection if anyone says how you know I
don't want to add there's an overhead

325
00:36:14,850 --> 00:36:31,360
I think most effective ways I found it
to salad or III and its talk to me but I

326
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:37,500
think the confidentiality attributed by
the authentication a lot more

327
00:36:37,500 --> 00:36:42,580
interesting especially if they're the
way if you protect your data

328
00:36:42,580 --> 00:36:49,860
navigation everything's protected you
know some people starting at the

329
00:36:49,860 --> 00:37:01,220
authentication pieces probably the most
important aspect for me I think some of

330
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:06,850
the infrastructure secured this is one
thing I really if you look at every

331
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:14,270
single vendor out their distribution
they are you sure we do not support as

332
00:37:14,270 --> 00:37:24,530
healing and you know it's it's all about
enforcing that mandatory access control

333
00:37:24,530 --> 00:37:29,450
and a quick example once you start
labeling and enforcing that access

334
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:36,460
permissions and I think about it I like
my view all the talks today summoned

335
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:42,020
popping shells armored they're pushing
an exploit temporary location

336
00:37:42,020 --> 00:37:49,430
you know that that Tampa location or
certain places only have read and write

337
00:37:49,430 --> 00:37:57,230
access but yeah you know I can hang
around your class year all day long but

338
00:37:57,230 --> 00:38:08,900
if there's nothing they can do from an
exploit maybe that's so if there's a

339
00:38:08,900 --> 00:38:13,990
couple of takeaways this is definitely
one of the things I would strongly urge

340
00:38:13,990 --> 00:38:19,180
you guys should take a look see if you
can drawn as

341
00:38:19,180 --> 00:38:25,940
turn it on and on tired turn on you know
the permissive mode start looking at all

342
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:30,680
the logs that events all the warnings
and see if there's something that makes

343
00:38:30,680 --> 00:38:35,819
sense and start enforcing it because
you'll find so many low hanging fruit

344
00:38:35,819 --> 00:38:46,540
for example I found a couple things that
that's generating the crypto C Daymond

345
00:38:46,540 --> 00:38:52,960
when it's not supposed to because it
just inherited the native policy so all

346
00:38:52,960 --> 00:39:07,160
those low hanging fruit so it was you
know it looks like solar system or

347
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:13,940
something I don't know but what it
actually represent those big dots in the

348
00:39:13,940 --> 00:39:21,230
center I actually like that data
discovery and then doing the enforcement

349
00:39:21,230 --> 00:39:29,780
on the access control once you do that I
would you end up with is so remember

350
00:39:29,780 --> 00:39:34,799
that prior problem space prioritization
how do you do that the guys had two maro

351
00:39:34,799 --> 00:39:41,589
represent the most they have the largest
data and they have probably unfiltered

352
00:39:41,589 --> 00:39:47,470
access or more unfiltered access than
other if you are at least start focusing

353
00:39:47,470 --> 00:39:59,578
on some pics had the sirens started
going out like I said you know there's a

354
00:39:59,579 --> 00:40:05,190
book in place and there's there's a
white paper that I think get published

355
00:40:05,190 --> 00:40:17,160
shortly so please contact info is there
so doesn't bring me recap shiny

356
00:40:17,160 --> 00:40:25,149
landscape into your discovery in class
figures and solids encryption there's a

357
00:40:25,150 --> 00:40:29,470
bunch of race and techniques you can do
a new data

358
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:37,689
transparent encryption and if you're
more mature start doing application

359
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:49,950
layer protection encryption tokenization
whatever and then so dads and I know

360
00:40:49,950 --> 00:41:00,520
doesn't share feedback I think I you
guys will get you back obviously going

361
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:26,940
to make this better you know so

362
00:41:26,940 --> 00:41:38,910
so does reach out to me if you guys have
thanks
