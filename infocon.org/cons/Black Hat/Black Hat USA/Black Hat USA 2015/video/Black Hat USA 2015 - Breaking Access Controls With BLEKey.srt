1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,770
alright good morning till the morning so
basically the motivation for this stock

2
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:10,800
and a quick synopsis most access
controls are using Aurelio protocols

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,730
clear taxed and are very widespread
we're seeing us an 80% of the plants and

4
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:21,990
take a look at this market he does
physical pain testing he said hey that

5
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:24,459
would be really cool to build a device
that you know good let's play around

6
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:28,869
with this protocol maybe as wireless and
said i'm ok let's let's build something

7
00:00:28,869 --> 00:00:34,399
so we bought the thing and we're going
to tell you about it we're gonna go

8
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,890
through a bit of a history of RFID and
tell you sort of how these readers work

9
00:00:38,890 --> 00:00:44,190
what technologies are used that will
talk about the device rebuilt how you

10
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:47,960
can use it for penetration testing and
also how you could prevent against the

11
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:53,559
type of attacks that it can do quick
introduction my name is erika Van check

12
00:00:53,559 --> 00:00:58,940
embedded systems architect at Verde
future for a new car company that's

13
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:02,949
building a electric vehicle from the
ground up I've never got to say this

14
00:01:02,949 --> 00:01:08,310
before to talk but we're hiring so I get
to do that from 41 to work on cars come

15
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:15,159
find me and reach out and I Marcus AG 00
managing principal consulted a coupon

16
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:21,720
vision at whatever you want to call us
now work on the attack in Penn team we

17
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,979
do network security and also obviously
physical penetration testing we're also

18
00:01:27,979 --> 00:01:31,909
hiring hit me up on Twitter or go to the
recruiting booth where we're giving away

19
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:38,020
two hundred of these this week so I
wanted to talk a little bit about the

20
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:42,789
motivation behind building this Eric
fill you in a little bit briefly but I'm

21
00:01:42,790 --> 00:01:49,520
gonna go into more depth so as you see
on the left hand side here we have hid

22
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:56,158
prox reader and have a big bank and then
a refinery now these are the only these

23
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:02,060
are the only two places that you can
find this technology this is a spot with

24
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,469
Eric and the side there at Pearson
International Airport as we are flying

25
00:02:05,469 --> 00:02:06,940
to DEFCON

26
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:13,070
this is also an HIV prox reader is also
vulnerable so banks office is

27
00:02:13,070 --> 00:02:18,109
manufacturing facilities etcetera
worldwide in my experience I've done

28
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:22,810
work in North America done work in
Europe and in Asia that the utilization

29
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:29,430
across the continent is a bit different
but it's definitely everywhere so no

30
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:33,500
matter where it would go customers would
always be surprised when I cloned a

31
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:41,860
badge used our artistic RFID the 22 long
range reader badge and then clone it so

32
00:02:41,860 --> 00:02:45,770
I started thinking I said why we really
need to build something that gets the

33
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:50,170
point right drives the point home and
hopefully kills weekend once and for all

34
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:56,290
nothing against the man it was a great
protocol but it's past its time so let's

35
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:02,650
illustrate how these systems work really
really basic here this is an RFID reader

36
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:09,490
it sends out a signal and right now it's
a little sad because it's got no card to

37
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:16,610
to read so we're gonna introduce a card
and the card once introduced is

38
00:03:16,610 --> 00:03:23,060
energized by the reader and sends bits
back completely in the clear and the

39
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:31,020
readers like alright I got data and so
it has to do something with this data so

40
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:36,590
this is what we're interested in this is
called the upstream where it sends the

41
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:42,010
data from the card reader to upstream
device typically a door controller which

42
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:46,299
is what's pictured here and that data is
the bit stream that was on the cards

43
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:53,330
called we get so this is what we're
going to attack today weekend is clear

44
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:57,910
text as eric said it has been around for
decades and it's literally everywhere

45
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:00,540
but we'll get into that a bit more later

46
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:05,540
here's the whole system in one sliding
case went too fast for you there again

47
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:10,579
we care about weekends and read but
we're gonna ship yours for a moment and

48
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:15,290
Arizona fill you in a bit about the
history of of of readers now we're

49
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:19,450
picking on it seems like we're picking
on HIV today but that's just because of

50
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:19,760
their

51
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:23,469
prominence in the marketplace it's not
something brand specific they're just

52
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:26,910
everywhere and we see them all the time

53
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:33,820
other manufacturers are also vulnerable
to to this attack so start off with

54
00:04:33,820 --> 00:04:39,110
twenty years ago and their history
lesson and this is hid prox it is a

55
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:43,740
completely unencrypted system all over
so the card to the reader

56
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:47,000
there's no encryption there the reader
to the door controller also no

57
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,610
encryption they're also all over the
place these are two of the more popular

58
00:04:51,610 --> 00:04:57,070
layouts we have another one right here
which is without the PIN pad you'll see

59
00:04:57,070 --> 00:05:03,450
these in smaller configurations bigger
ones ones that look like this guy you

60
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:07,210
know just just all sorts of different
knock-offs if you saw a picture from

61
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:10,880
Pearson Airport also you'll see
different company names but they look

62
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,850
very similar the truth is they just
stick up sticker over the HID logo and

63
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,810
sell it as a different Brad

64
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:24,140
popular thing to do some do have this
2000 eradication and I should say that

65
00:05:24,140 --> 00:05:29,620
with two-factor authentication doesn't
quite work as you might expect when you

66
00:05:29,620 --> 00:05:33,990
push buttons on that pen pad it sends
bits back over the cleartext weekend

67
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:39,030
protocol in the clear to the door
controller so the tax were showing the

68
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:45,830
doesn't help you move forward about 10
years to HID iCLASS big note here is

69
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:51,060
they introduced in encryption between
the card in the reader the only problem

70
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:57,410
is well they've got broken back in 2010
guy by the name of me Loesch Mary act

71
00:05:57,410 --> 00:06:03,770
she discovered hey I can use some tricks
here and get the firmware out once I get

72
00:06:03,770 --> 00:06:07,560
the firm are out I can get this desk is
that they're using to encrypt the cards

73
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:12,360
and other using the same to you in every
reader worldwide so that's that's a

74
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:19,760
slight problem in symmetric key as you
might assume the big thing that they

75
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:23,830
said they still say that this is like
these are words we took from their

76
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:28,229
website like last week they still say
it's enhance security it's mutual

77
00:06:28,230 --> 00:06:33,210
authentication and it's not untrue but
it's kind of like saying tlass 1

78
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:37,330
play now is all these things but you
don't want to use it

79
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:42,359
these are super prominent and the real
key with our talk we're not talking too

80
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,880
much about the card encryption more
about the backend protocol these still

81
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,669
only support weekend and another format
called clock and data which is still

82
00:06:51,669 --> 00:06:56,549
clear taxes just a different signaling
protocol it's pretty much the same thing

83
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:02,660
just different bits on the front lines
now will move into the future as a

84
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:08,710
couple years ago I class as he came out
and this does support a new protocol

85
00:07:08,710 --> 00:07:10,888
called OST p

86
00:07:10,889 --> 00:07:18,090
open supervised device protocol and that
does offer an option called SCP secure

87
00:07:18,090 --> 00:07:25,070
channel protocol and that is encrypted
that being said it still does we get and

88
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:31,210
if you install it and don't specify that
you want OST piano wire at 40 SDP and by

89
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:36,349
dork nude or controllers that support of
STP or modules that convert between the

90
00:07:36,349 --> 00:07:40,400
two in still going to do weekend so you
might think hey I'm buying a better

91
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:46,849
reader but it turns out not the same old
stuff you just different dads on it on

92
00:07:46,849 --> 00:07:51,610
the card side they are supporting a new
type of card called high-class SU carbs

93
00:07:51,610 --> 00:07:57,099
and the whole theme of this though is
that no one looked into them too much so

94
00:07:57,099 --> 00:08:02,620
your mileage may vary on security of
this device but this particular reader

95
00:08:02,620 --> 00:08:06,120
it says in very small letters that you
might not be able to read multi-class

96
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,710
and you'll see me as I class as well

97
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:15,070
multi-class what that means is it can do
multiple different versions of the cards

98
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:20,349
so this reader out of the box with the
right configuration will do

99
00:08:20,349 --> 00:08:26,310
rocks I class I class II which means if
you use a proxy card on it it will

100
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:31,560
accept that as a valid credential which
sort of breaks the whole idea of using

101
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,789
encrypted credentials in the first place

102
00:08:33,789 --> 00:08:38,809
the main point being yeah this could be
a more secure option but you still have

103
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:42,208
to set it up right and make sure it's
been configured with those options

104
00:08:42,208 --> 00:08:45,520
enabled and with all the old stuff
disabled

105
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,230
so the real question here is as even use
one of these to get into their office

106
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:53,450
anyone I'm guessing a few people I see
some people are willing to put up hands

107
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:58,570
maybe some are but the truth is I walk
by you know ten or twenty of these

108
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:03,710
things every day on my way to work like
they're just everywhere and you'll find

109
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:07,750
one wherever you go now marc is gonna
talk a bit more about this protocol that

110
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:17,020
were exploding and where it came from
and how we can deal with it

111
00:09:17,020 --> 00:09:22,490
years ago or so he discovered this
special type of wire that had magnetic

112
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:28,880
properties and this wire was then
embedded into cards and based on the

113
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,090
presence of the wire or absence of the
wire in the car when he was pulled

114
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:39,340
through reader it created a bit stream
of ones and zeros so the protocol used

115
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:43,640
to transmit that information back and
became known as the weekend protocol has

116
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:48,960
got a lot of stuff named after him he's
a physicist and I think that he's passed

117
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:56,350
on but his protocol certainly lives on
today the constraints that are in

118
00:09:56,350 --> 00:10:01,210
current access control systems around
bit length as a result of the amount of

119
00:10:01,210 --> 00:10:05,450
wires that you could fit into a card so
we have this cycle of backwards

120
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:11,500
compatibility with this protocol that
dates back to the Apollo 11 era and it's

121
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:15,820
it's the reason that eight bits of data
as for a card code and 16 bits of data

122
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:21,230
is for a facility code typically in most
of these carts and into I class as well

123
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:27,540
so going towards twenty twenty years
later with a vicious cycle of backwards

124
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:31,290
compatibility where you know people use
something so they implemented in RFID in

125
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:35,230
then it and they didn't buildings and
its demand more demand and thirty years

126
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:41,290
later here we are with the same protocol
now to show you the protocol we can use

127
00:10:41,290 --> 00:10:46,780
his only two lines plus ground line one
would be on the top of the slide line

128
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:53,260
data data 101 the top data one on the
bottom vertically we have voltage so

129
00:10:53,260 --> 00:10:54,970
goes from zero volts 250

130
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:58,300
the lines are normally just how high up
five goals

131
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:05,010
and the horizontal axis is time so this
is how we read the region protocol to

132
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:09,610
bits 0 in a one and one on the falling
edge what's called the falling edge when

133
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:13,780
we when we read it with a
microcontroller we count 0 and on the

134
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:17,550
falling edge as time goes on and we've
received a one now in this data stream

135
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:25,050
so with 26 bit card when we put all that
together this is a logic analyzer

136
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:31,930
screenshot from an entire card we have
data from the car so what do we do with

137
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:39,349
this data well turns out we can do quite
a bit so as you see here with the

138
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:43,680
bitstream and I've highlighted the first
eight bits that's the facility Cody your

139
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,739
card and the interesting thing is a lot
of places order cards in bulk so if

140
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:51,890
you're a company with 30 employees
chances are your entire office has the

141
00:11:51,890 --> 00:11:56,890
same facility code so that significantly
reduces the difficulty to gas card

142
00:11:56,890 --> 00:12:03,130
number and then the next 16 bits that
were going to highlight here the card

143
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:03,750
code

144
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:12,630
9644 so in this particular facility I'm
betting that twenty 9643 and also 45 are

145
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:18,160
valid cards say I'm an employee I'm
disgruntled and I'm let go I know that

146
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:21,819
probably the next card also works to
open the door and you can take the state

147
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:25,680
of this is all you need to create a
clone or two

148
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,180
replayed on the lines if you have a
device like a leaky attached to the

149
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:35,400
lines it's this is a funny one that we
had to point out were taking a little

150
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:41,470
sidetracked here but this is a bit of a
facepalm this is a dual technology card

151
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:47,580
so it has an antenna for eyeglasses
high-frequency has an antenna for profit

152
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:52,620
which is low frequency to separate chips
and on this card that authentication

153
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:58,960
data on the encrypted portion and the
completely clear portion is identical so

154
00:12:58,960 --> 00:13:02,840
if in the situation we showed you before
we have a multi-class reader but are

155
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:06,250
using only you know saying cryptic
credentials but you have this

156
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:11,300
multi-class card you can read the
encrypted information I can take it back

157
00:13:11,300 --> 00:13:11,719
because I

158
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,230
glasses broke and store it on to one of
those cards and get into the building

159
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:22,189
now the bigger facepalm is that you see
those yellow box the data to 70 that's

160
00:13:22,189 --> 00:13:26,660
the card code 0599 for that's the
facility code you don't even need to

161
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:30,459
read it you just need to see it around
someone's neck and you can get in or

162
00:13:30,459 --> 00:13:38,000
replace the data with our be led so hid
I don't think they willingly do this but

163
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:44,649
we we access the site today and this is
the latest I class SEC card that you can

164
00:13:44,649 --> 00:13:48,639
buy from them that is the high-security
as an encrypted side or so I Class S II

165
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:55,670
and also again they've released this
dual dual technology card so it has an

166
00:13:55,670 --> 00:13:59,360
unencrypted side and it says right on
their website it communicates no

167
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:03,310
traceable identifiers during cart
sessions to prevent card data from being

168
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:07,989
divulged or clone by unauthorized
parties which is totally misleading to

169
00:14:07,990 --> 00:14:11,879
the customer because you sure you're
only using the encrypted side which is

170
00:14:11,879 --> 00:14:17,350
not been tested by security researchers
then yes it may be protected but if I

171
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:21,040
can walk by you with a device like that
and lifted off your bell I can get into

172
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:27,309
your facility so the moral of the story
here is that physical access to these

173
00:14:27,309 --> 00:14:33,189
readers physical access this information
is winning now we want to give some

174
00:14:33,189 --> 00:14:40,439
people some props this protocol weakness
has been around for twenty years in the

175
00:14:40,439 --> 00:14:44,480
design of of weekend they didn't
implement security because it was not

176
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:50,399
feasible at that time to put together a
device like this it was inaccessible it

177
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,850
was probably the realm of Engineers to
access this information and put together

178
00:14:54,850 --> 00:15:00,519
something that would emulate a card or
transmitted on the weekend lines but now

179
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:05,449
with the Arduino and whatnot with a lot
more accessible so I think a guy named

180
00:15:05,449 --> 00:15:09,508
Paige Mac you had some Arduino code just
posted right on the internet with Google

181
00:15:09,509 --> 00:15:14,879
I found it wow this is really easy to
read this protocol another guy named

182
00:15:14,879 --> 00:15:18,930
Carl Froch's colonias got a cycle
products gonna just experiments on my

183
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:22,250
class and he's really open about it and
he put all this information out there

184
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,240
rights white papers

185
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:28,170
icons like this but I sent an email to
give you all the information I needed to

186
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:32,630
turn in my class reader into a cloner
right on the wall pretty cool guy and

187
00:15:32,630 --> 00:15:38,470
then of course we must give a nod to
Zach Franken who made a device that was

188
00:15:38,470 --> 00:15:44,709
quite like ours called the get go back
in 2008 now obviously you're all sitting

189
00:15:44,709 --> 00:15:49,949
here today we're talking about this
today we we think that the Gecko wasn't

190
00:15:49,950 --> 00:15:54,120
released as far as we know and probably
don't have the impact that should have

191
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:58,029
because everyone still using this so
here we are again and we made a device

192
00:15:58,029 --> 00:16:04,439
that we think a little bit easier to use
and now has wireless so we made a be a

193
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:10,279
leaky so let's talk with the hardware
that we're releasing today as open

194
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:13,870
source hardware and that's the whole
reason why you're here is this little

195
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:17,920
device you probably can't even see it in
my hand at the back it's pretty small

196
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:25,729
its eighteen by 30 millimeters or 0.71%
two inches and there it is next to a

197
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:31,520
Canadian quarter which is the same size
American quarter but were 30% less

198
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:39,890
we utilize this module here it's a
Bluetooth Low Energy model for coming to

199
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:44,939
rate Jack and it's great because they do
all the RAF black magic for us know

200
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:49,070
antenna matching no viene has now if
you're done our efforts

201
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:55,050
a lot of work so we just think that
module put it down it has a Nordic NRF

202
00:16:55,050 --> 00:17:02,750
5182 to chip on it this is super popular
in connecting devices like that bit type

203
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:10,520
things it's a process that has not only
a cortex and 04 I'm course but also a

204
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:14,980
2.4 gigahertz radio and they provide a
software stack that turns out into a

205
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:20,069
Bluetooth Low Energy device so it's
everything you need in one ship and its

206
00:17:20,069 --> 00:17:26,869
FCC certified so we don't have to do
that now it's it's pretty simple it's a

207
00:17:26,869 --> 00:17:31,260
few passive components and some
transistors to drive the lines connect

208
00:17:31,260 --> 00:17:35,620
there's there's a battery holder on the
back really the other innovative part of

209
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:40,989
the design is the connector we used an
insulation displacement connector lot of

210
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:45,020
you are probably familiar with one type
of this connector which would be an rj45

211
00:17:45,020 --> 00:17:50,820
connector when you sat down you know how
those little teeth go up and they pierce

212
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:54,230
through the installation but they don't
actually cut the wire and all that's

213
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:59,150
what this does so you stick the wire in
you punch down the reader will still

214
00:17:59,150 --> 00:18:03,270
work normally you just made an
electrical connection without cutting or

215
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:07,900
splicing makes it fast to install it
also doesn't break the existing system

216
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:13,260
and it runs on a ser 1632 coin cell
which is a tiny little coin cell battery

217
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:19,540
is taking the back so this is our
high-tech Development set up our lab you

218
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:23,540
know you need really sophisticated
equipment to build one of the is not

219
00:18:23,540 --> 00:18:28,500
really you know this is Mark's desk and
we saw turn up the first ones literally

220
00:18:28,500 --> 00:18:34,090
here with a hot air rework station and
patience and this is the entire

221
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:37,720
schematic there's nothing else
imprisonment slides you know it's simple

222
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:41,360
again this will be released as open
source hardware we're gonna

223
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:46,678
so if you want to take a deeper look
into it you can do that

224
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:51,170
worth noting mark had no experience with
the program we use which is chaotic at

225
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:56,460
my dad he had never used before he did
the first version of the schematic and

226
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:01,400
then I came in and did the next revision
but pretty simple stuff you know you

227
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,710
don't need to be some electronics wizard
build a device that will break 80

228
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:09,000
percent of access control years out
there we went through some design

229
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:14,530
iterations here we started out with AV 0
this is just a nice way to test

230
00:19:14,530 --> 00:19:18,510
everything out make sure it works you
break out a lot of pain so you can try

231
00:19:18,510 --> 00:19:22,870
different things and maybe add features
and now it's easier to solder together

232
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:27,149
and just makes it easy to work with but
then we wanted to make it really small

233
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:31,500
because we wanted to fit inside of
readers and behind readers depending on

234
00:19:31,500 --> 00:19:36,660
the installation so we then went back to
the PCB program and trunk that bore down

235
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:40,760
at this point the space constraint is
actually just the battery holder it's

236
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:45,320
the size of the battery holder on the
back in order to get smaller it would

237
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:52,970
probably need to use a smaller battery
at this point you know sounds great now

238
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:58,100
we didn't screw something up really
badly and fun story in development of

239
00:19:58,100 --> 00:20:03,889
really devices it's useful to give them
different means the reason being mark

240
00:20:03,890 --> 00:20:07,510
and I are in the same room and we're
both playing around with these annoying

241
00:20:07,510 --> 00:20:11,350
when you have like 10 different devices
called be a leaky and you're like which

242
00:20:11,350 --> 00:20:15,830
one do i click to get to mine so you
know you give them just unique

243
00:20:15,830 --> 00:20:20,330
identifier unique names so Mark he was
working on one and keep giving it a

244
00:20:20,330 --> 00:20:24,790
unique name and he said the firm are
over we sent it off to our manufacturer

245
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:29,409
in China and then I got an email that my
12 year old self came out during this

246
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:33,910
yeah so it says we have updated the
former successful

247
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:42,200
sleepiness all two hundred and fifty of
them yeah we almost died like a bag of

248
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:49,450
Filipinos as but thankfully they were
very considering they may reflect all of

249
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:53,400
them really quick and ship them out and
we got the moment I'm so thanks you too

250
00:20:53,400 --> 00:21:00,690
tiny to sign their Draper deming
manufacturing done and yeah so what do

251
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:04,050
you do when you have one of these
devices well you put in the reader so

252
00:21:04,050 --> 00:21:10,600
this is the demise in this reader it
fits very nicely in aprox reader it

253
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:16,050
there's so much space and they're just
putting clothes whatever works great and

254
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:20,169
people were asking some calls with
reporters and stuff they were like well

255
00:21:20,170 --> 00:21:24,440
how long does it take must take a long
time to put this and so we did a speed

256
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:36,940
round which will show you and here we
are so we put the cover open and that's

257
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:42,630
the top cover then there's four screws
to be undone I swear this is not sped up

258
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:47,540
it just happened to be exactly a minute
and the four screws come upgrade or

259
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:56,240
inside and there's the wires as for them
we need 30 marks now lining out that

260
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,830
first wire which is one of the weekend
80 wires and he's punching out and down

261
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:12,899
and get the next one in there have been
falling out of my tools and I could have

262
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:22,610
shaved two seconds or 30 right lamar

263
00:22:22,610 --> 00:22:26,299
that's it all the wires are and now
we're gonna put everything back together

264
00:22:26,299 --> 00:22:32,590
we'll just have to ask is because we're
not worried about forensic right now and

265
00:22:32,590 --> 00:22:36,678
toss that top on and there you go one
minute and sure enough the door still

266
00:22:36,679 --> 00:22:41,380
works normally and disapproving here
that we can connect to the device still

267
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:45,460
it's actually in there also just in case
our demos don't work as proof that the

268
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:51,600
thing works if everything goes badly
least we have this so you know gone

269
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:56,559
right characteristic and someday and
there's no card present but he has the

270
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:01,490
button and door opens just great and
will show you it for real

271
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:07,690
hopefully in this section called the
attacks so let's talk about what you can

272
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:12,809
do with this thing and why am I might
want to play with one and in this damn

273
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:18,549
I'll we're going to do some role playing
here i guess im going to be Alice we're

274
00:23:18,549 --> 00:23:22,590
gonna use the cryptography actors so
many the innocent person mark is going

275
00:23:22,590 --> 00:23:26,540
to be the evil Eve and he's also gonna
bring stuff up on the screen to show you

276
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:32,530
what's going on as we go through so you
can see how it works so well he gets

277
00:23:32,530 --> 00:23:38,178
that ready let's talk a little bit about
this setup we have you know hid prox

278
00:23:38,179 --> 00:23:43,360
reader active strike for the door so its
electronic strike plate that is open by

279
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:49,418
door controller and behind it as a sort
of risky but will turn around there's a

280
00:23:49,419 --> 00:23:54,770
off the shelf hid her text or controller
like you see in any facilities in the

281
00:23:54,770 --> 00:23:59,639
stuff fun fact still using the same card
data that had that it had on it when I

282
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:08,910
bought from ebay yeah that's never do so
it's as real of a set up as we can get

283
00:24:08,910 --> 00:24:12,780
nobody wanted to let us break into their
building so we had to build their own

284
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:18,250
building so let mark as of right now is
a serial terminal this would not be used

285
00:24:18,250 --> 00:24:21,280
in normal deployments we just have it
for illustration purposes and it's

286
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:25,379
really useful for debugging so this is a
wired connection right now and when you

287
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:31,500
scan a card on the winner of a line pop
up there saying nine cards credit cards

288
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:34,960
and we have the raw data and then the
padded

289
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:41,460
right so that's the serial terminal side
and this is the Bluetooth plant so

290
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:44,700
obviously you're gonna wanna do this
wirelessly you don't have to open up the

291
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:50,169
device and connect to it so Bluetooth
reaching connected to the specific MAC

292
00:24:50,169 --> 00:24:54,260
address of this bleg and we have
whitelisting enabled on it so that you

293
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:58,220
know only certain MAC addresses can
connect but please don't please don't

294
00:24:58,220 --> 00:25:04,390
mess with us so we're connected to it
now and the simplest attack is gonna be

295
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:13,500
reading the card so Alice walks out and
she she's never really which is not the

296
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:18,750
fastest wireless protocol but there's
the last 10 cards she comes again she

297
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:33,880
scans are card you know goes into the
office and we can do another red cards

298
00:25:33,880 --> 00:25:45,560
and this doesn't look terribly exciting
until you realize that that number is

299
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:51,210
all you need to enter into a piece of
software like proxmire in order to write

300
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:55,890
a totally valid copy of the card so you
know once you have that information you

301
00:25:55,890 --> 00:26:00,360
can be Alice and walk around the
facility just as if you were her that's

302
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:04,969
the first really simple attack
motivation for the device but once we

303
00:26:04,970 --> 00:26:09,880
get back here like going to next and the
most obvious one that came up was

304
00:26:09,880 --> 00:26:15,240
replaying data we have access to those
weekend lines and region not only read

305
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:20,400
them we can also drive them so they
don't want to have to copy a card you

306
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:25,340
know an approximate hardware tool you
don't want on the software whatever mark

307
00:26:25,340 --> 00:26:29,350
in just over bluetooth is transmitted
command and he didn't send any of the

308
00:26:29,350 --> 00:26:38,899
last cards and turn out the door just
opened with no card present

309
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:48,890
climbs doors open and hitting about and
so it turns out that you can also do

310
00:26:48,890 --> 00:27:05,270
this from a cell phone please work from
a fire near yeah this is the rest of

311
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:11,270
testing Bluetooth devices in a venue
Holiday who will connect when we get an

312
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:18,860
appearance and we have too many devices
and parts and labor for the phone they

313
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:23,040
were using county MAC address filtering
so marc is currently strolling through a

314
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:28,510
giant list of all of your feedback it's
trying to find but you know that you

315
00:27:28,510 --> 00:27:40,770
took three thousand steps today so
that's a no ok found it got a very good

316
00:27:40,770 --> 00:27:46,940
I'm connecting but really connect
alright we're connected so I pick up the

317
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:52,840
attribute which is replay I tell it to
right and left which is equal the 255 as

318
00:27:52,840 --> 00:28:01,580
the command I hit Send and the door is
open

319
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:12,740
have access to each and every realize
that it might be nice to be able to do a

320
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:16,680
denial of service attack you know maybe
you're running through someone's

321
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:21,640
building and unit a card and then the
door opens you run through and nobody

322
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:25,860
else can get into that door for the next
20 minutes or whatever that sounds like

323
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:29,709
a good pitcher so putting this all
together is quite useful because you can

324
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:33,680
assign a special control card and
regularly do whatever you want with it

325
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:39,940
so for example let's say you just have a
card with this case you have a tender

326
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:44,230
beef as a text value in the cereal that
it's going to read the control card

327
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:48,310
controller card it's going to replay the
last card that was sent and thats

328
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:53,629
alice's you know card right here and
then after that it's going to lock out

329
00:28:53,630 --> 00:28:57,890
the reader or we're going to 20 seconds
that we haven't stuck up here waiting

330
00:28:57,890 --> 00:29:00,770
for it but I can't program built a
knee-length you'd like

331
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:07,490
so evil market then that are now Alice
comes back and he's joining in the data

332
00:29:07,490 --> 00:29:12,130
center she just can't get in the data
center though and like now

333
00:29:12,130 --> 00:29:17,320
HSM a big unbolted and like they're in
the Arab and trying to steal staff or

334
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:18,100
whatever

335
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:25,179
you know

336
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:34,780
three demos for if you've installed in a
reader out of sight out of Selby but we

337
00:29:34,780 --> 00:29:38,389
built the building of things I realized
I know this has another totally

338
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:42,320
different purpose what we installed in
our own reader that we bought off ebay

339
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:48,570
and then electrical tape back together
this is an HID long range reader you'll

340
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:52,889
see it on parking garages everywhere
this is the prox version of it there is

341
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:56,250
also a high-class version of it is just
more expensive and we don't have one

342
00:29:56,250 --> 00:30:03,380
right now that works is you plug you
know in the back the BLET is inside of

343
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:09,110
this does anyone have a proxy card on
them

344
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:14,309
so if it is a proxy there yet so now we
have his card data and if you read his

345
00:30:14,309 --> 00:30:20,210
name tag will figure out where it works
so this fits in a backpack its wireless

346
00:30:20,210 --> 00:30:26,720
it's totally portable move in with her
big round cards so obviously you know if

347
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,059
you can get an elevator with somebody
you can probably steal their potential

348
00:30:30,059 --> 00:30:34,549
also the speaker can be disabled by
pulling up jumpers I think it dips which

349
00:30:34,549 --> 00:30:39,870
is having on proliferation purposes so
you can vary stealthily go through and

350
00:30:39,870 --> 00:30:42,409
just grab credentials go back

351
00:30:42,410 --> 00:30:47,720
take that card data like we showed make
fake cards that are totally valid for

352
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:55,779
that building and do whatever you want
so where does that leave us right here

353
00:30:55,779 --> 00:31:00,559
so if you are in the overwhelming
majority that has one of these systems

354
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,809
what do you do

355
00:31:02,809 --> 00:31:07,809
first off probably not the best to
blindly trust lenders not that they're

356
00:31:07,809 --> 00:31:12,690
trying to mislead you but as we saw from
the 80 website information can be

357
00:31:12,690 --> 00:31:17,479
misleading and the people actually
installing the systems often times just

358
00:31:17,479 --> 00:31:23,499
don't know in my experience you know
when I write a report up send it over

359
00:31:23,499 --> 00:31:27,399
the client to bring a bender in the
matter is every system is is just as

360
00:31:27,399 --> 00:31:32,549
vulnerable there's no answer to that so
get a trusted third party in if you're

361
00:31:32,549 --> 00:31:36,668
installing one of these systems or or if
you're looking at ought to be near your

362
00:31:36,669 --> 00:31:41,849
system because they all they all they
all have those claims on their website

363
00:31:41,849 --> 00:31:47,968
know five years after I classes broken
the copy is still on the site so the

364
00:31:47,969 --> 00:31:52,179
first kind of real tactical thing that
you can do is make sure that tamper

365
00:31:52,179 --> 00:31:57,589
detection on your readers is turned on
its very simple as just a switch and in

366
00:31:57,589 --> 00:32:02,739
the new readers it's also the optical
sensors and some of them now this might

367
00:32:02,739 --> 00:32:07,429
be challenging because from our
experience oftentimes not enough

368
00:32:07,429 --> 00:32:12,320
physical copper wiring is run to the
switch to even hook it up because of

369
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:18,599
ignorance during the install process
that the RFP RFQ and so they're trying

370
00:32:18,599 --> 00:32:22,439
to get by as cheap as possible so you
have to make sure it's hooked up to make

371
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:26,369
sure you have enough wires and then you
also have to make sure that you're

372
00:32:26,369 --> 00:32:31,999
watching the console so I've been in you
know let's say chemical production

373
00:32:31,999 --> 00:32:38,509
facility where he consoles actually in
the cafeteria publicly unlocked and it's

374
00:32:38,509 --> 00:32:43,330
kind of stand-alone no one's watching it
so make sure that you're watching it and

375
00:32:43,330 --> 00:32:49,989
that the logs coming out of the systems
are monitored by someone maybe if you

376
00:32:49,989 --> 00:32:54,739
want to get fancy put it in your sim new
heuristics on it if Alice goes in every

377
00:32:54,739 --> 00:33:01,440
morning at 8 a.m. and uses doors ab&c
but then one day she goes into door D

378
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:07,090
and I 4 a.m. this should probably raised
alarm bells

379
00:33:07,090 --> 00:33:13,970
lastly you probably want to have video
surveillance trained on all of your

380
00:33:13,970 --> 00:33:20,320
significant entrances and exits because
these systems now as we've seen are not

381
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:26,639
you're not able to actually accurately
know that Joel Morales is using the door

382
00:33:26,640 --> 00:33:33,680
you need your camera to verify that
person's identity and I guess that

383
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:39,700
pretty much sums it up so I want to say
that you need decent security you

384
00:33:39,700 --> 00:33:43,990
probably want to change your access
controls completely unfortunately for

385
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:50,430
consumers there is not a time of
information thereon which systems are

386
00:33:50,430 --> 00:33:53,770
really secure we have to trust vendors
at this point I would like to encourage

387
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:58,480
them to embrace the security community
and allow us to take a look at these

388
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,410
systems more instead of erasing that
information from the Internet

389
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:08,920
just want to say thanks to a few parties
octave they produced 200 of these boards

390
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:14,909
I was pretty awesome and now two hundred
in the wild so you have a better reason

391
00:34:14,909 --> 00:34:20,440
to go to your boss and say look this is
out there is a huge vulnerability and

392
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,929
get one

393
00:34:21,929 --> 00:34:25,149
yeah and you can get one demonstrator
where do I get one mark at the

394
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:29,440
recruiting booth and you know I want to
thank my wife for putting up with that

395
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:36,840
messy desk and and and Todd and whatnot
for for all the support so Eric yeah so

396
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:41,200
it's been it's been a fun thing to put
together things where we look at some

397
00:34:41,199 --> 00:34:45,730
old protocol and yeltsin their hardware
that just makes it really easy until it

398
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:49,330
and things of course the black after
having a house in all of you for coming

399
00:34:49,330 --> 00:34:52,389
out and watching our demos that
thankfully worked

400
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:56,750
and thanks again by the way all the
coaching staff were gonna get happy

401
00:34:56,750 --> 00:35:00,519
doesn't describe some math specific MAC
addresses from it

402
00:35:00,519 --> 00:35:05,990
we're gonna push that always schematics
and everything will tweet out a link I

403
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:10,490
guess and if Black Cat puts out stuff
getting to follow us

404
00:35:10,490 --> 00:35:14,279
yeah also thinks that Jamie Campbell who
was the one that got me interested in

405
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:17,799
RFID wherever you are out there thinks
it is there somewhere and at this point

406
00:35:17,799 --> 00:35:24,190
we have a few minutes for questions
there's microphones in the aisles and

407
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:28,549
they've demanded that you go to the
microphones and talk so that the video

408
00:35:28,549 --> 00:35:48,140
gets the lights and power connection to
get rid of the battery so we thought

409
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:53,730
about that one reason was just an
install time obviously you know little

410
00:35:53,730 --> 00:35:58,740
faster than with three wires and other
one was we didn't want to do any melting

411
00:35:58,740 --> 00:36:04,529
it's a 12 volt circuit that used to
power the readers and down the 3.3 volt

412
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:10,559
board you're gonna need either a
switching and murder or a really hot LBO

413
00:36:10,559 --> 00:36:17,599
dropout linear regulator properly so the
problem there being a time of need it

414
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:22,319
really hot organ be introducing like 15
kilohertz which I know is into people's

415
00:36:22,319 --> 00:36:25,970
RFID readers and we don't know what
that's going to do but it might be bad

416
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:30,319
so this way you know we're limiting how
much noise are creating other than being

417
00:36:30,319 --> 00:36:35,519
on 2.4 gigahertz which is about the
proxy cards are using the middle here's

418
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:38,529
this limited to just the prox reader or

419
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:44,210
version three other smaller readers so
it'll work on on all of that I class

420
00:36:44,210 --> 00:36:48,660
that we showed you anything that speaks
weaken in fact if it doesn't use the

421
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:54,089
same weekend protocol a bit bit length
it's quite easy to go in racing seko 22

422
00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:59,930
deciphered whatever format it's using so
it it will work with anything that has a

423
00:36:59,930 --> 00:37:01,089
five-fold we get my

424
00:37:01,090 --> 00:37:06,510
or even clock and data for that matter
the middle apt

425
00:37:06,510 --> 00:37:12,750
system also requires the pin number can
you defeat that as well so you're

426
00:37:12,750 --> 00:37:20,360
talking if the reader requires a pin
number number and you get in right so

427
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:25,210
there's a few different ways of that
being done so the old icarly old

428
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:29,280
products ones when you hit a button it
actually just sense that number over

429
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:35,580
weekend so it's just an extra bit on the
card essentially it's on the card every

430
00:37:35,580 --> 00:37:39,560
time you hit a button so you can record
that and then extract the pin number so

431
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:43,840
that you know it and climate card so we
show up at the card type it into the pin

432
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:49,350
number I class it has this thing called
bio class that's used for two-factor

433
00:37:49,350 --> 00:37:55,310
it's an interesting concept they do
fingerprint readers and I iris scan as

434
00:37:55,310 --> 00:38:00,509
well the problem is that it actually
verifies the biometric data against the

435
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:04,670
card but the eyeglass encryption is
broken so you can make a card with your

436
00:38:04,670 --> 00:38:09,080
own biometric data on it but somebody
else's facility counting card number so

437
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:13,259
that you scan your fingerprint and it
thinks it's valid but actually you know

438
00:38:13,260 --> 00:38:17,990
you you faked it so in most cases those
two battery implementations are are not

439
00:38:17,990 --> 00:38:18,919
great

440
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:26,930
the pen is pretty easy to see if its
products like the one that we showed its

441
00:38:26,930 --> 00:38:32,580
left how fast is the weekend protocol
can you brute force the card

442
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:36,500
yeah that's another potential attack
actually so that signal that we showed

443
00:38:36,500 --> 00:38:41,960
you from the logic analyzer I believe
it's about 40 milliseconds each pulse

444
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:47,660
weekend as two milliseconds so we have
experimented with changing the timing

445
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:51,890
and it still works so that's another
attack is not in the firmware right now

446
00:38:51,890 --> 00:38:57,049
but we could potentially expose you know
as a Newbie least service say okay we

447
00:38:57,050 --> 00:39:02,600
know that silly quotes 200 so just brute
force hardcoded 1202 sixty-five thousand

448
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:07,069
five hundred and go and it will be much
faster than trying to do it you know

449
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:12,030
with a proxy mark 3 because this thing
waits for the card to be out of here

450
00:39:12,030 --> 00:39:12,790
before you

451
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:17,460
cards would take way less time doing it
on the lines really will come down to

452
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:21,080
the card reader how they've implemented
that if they're going to probably

453
00:39:21,080 --> 00:39:25,970
require some delay between cards being
read so you have to tune it depending on

454
00:39:25,970 --> 00:39:30,779
your viewpoint or control that using not
reader just did it will be expecting you

455
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:35,610
know give me in bed and then wait like
$100 seconds or whatever to give me more

456
00:39:35,610 --> 00:39:41,060
so the timing you can brute force at
whatever speed weed we had a code but

457
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:45,680
last night that where we weren't waiting
and actually it seemed like millisecond

458
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,870
we could probably get down to
milliseconds between cards yeah it was

459
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:51,549
like we weren't waiting at all

460
00:39:51,550 --> 00:39:57,980
a few blocks like that process it was
probably about a millisecond to the left

461
00:39:57,980 --> 00:40:00,210
to how long does the battery last

462
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:05,350
so without any power optimization right
now we worked mainly in features three

463
00:40:05,350 --> 00:40:09,529
days one of the cards could be in
control card that turn Bluetooth off

464
00:40:09,530 --> 00:40:14,040
quite easy it's just a simple call to a
function in C and that would probably

465
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:17,710
dramatically increase the battery life
and also improve your security because

466
00:40:17,710 --> 00:40:20,650
then at that point not broadcast
includes all the time they would

467
00:40:20,650 --> 00:40:24,630
probably ran up to him at least a month
easily the thing is the most power right

468
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:29,220
now is just advertising the blue chip
data which isn't necessary ninety

469
00:40:29,220 --> 00:40:32,939
percent of the time when you're not
trying to get data out of it so I am i

470
00:40:32,940 --> 00:40:37,900
turning that off a down but few days of
the batteries right now it is enough to

471
00:40:37,900 --> 00:40:46,570
prove a point but not ideal like three

472
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:52,290
last chance they're making us make you
go to a microphone I'm sorry and sorry

473
00:40:52,290 --> 00:41:00,130
that it will repeat it if you wanna just
just say that other people are we

474
00:41:00,130 --> 00:41:04,820
selling them we're giving them out at
Optus boots so there's two hundred of

475
00:41:04,820 --> 00:41:09,370
them there if they're all gone if people
weren't here and they want one of those

476
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:13,529
interests tweet at us and we're looking
at doing maybe another hundred run and

477
00:41:13,530 --> 00:41:17,690
we can sell them for whatever cost is
we're not looking to make cash really

478
00:41:17,690 --> 00:41:21,950
and you get off to see you make your own
as well if you just download the design

479
00:41:21,950 --> 00:41:30,100
file and thank you everyone for you
