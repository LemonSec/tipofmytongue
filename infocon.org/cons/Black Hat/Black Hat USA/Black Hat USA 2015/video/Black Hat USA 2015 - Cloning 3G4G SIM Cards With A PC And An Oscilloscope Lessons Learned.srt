1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,810
you are here in Manly he have to listen
to you talk about cloning 3G 4G SIM

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:11,268
cards with a PC and an oscilloscope
lessons learned and physical security

3
00:00:11,269 --> 00:00:16,529
please be sure to make sure that your
cell phones are in silent mode thank you

4
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:21,029
thanks for the introduction

5
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:28,180
joined to increase my colleagues in
China so basically a bunch of people so

6
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:34,519
we are my name is you and this is my
real name

7
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:47,680
here are some recent update from
American situation for russia these guys

8
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:53,239
sounding like a radically standing
season's greetings from time to time but

9
00:00:53,239 --> 00:01:00,390
this time it was saying that allegedly
and there's a midget THQ they have

10
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:08,940
stolen millions of encryption keys from
from a major SIM card manufacturer I

11
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:16,440
don't know but this is kind of
compromises serious cuz the only way you

12
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:21,130
know it's not the encryption keys that
burned into the SIM cards

13
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:27,490
okay so it's not like online app so
that's basically can I just pushed all

14
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:36,789
the updates from the internet but since
the SIM cards they are the only way to

15
00:01:36,790 --> 00:01:41,539
address these security compromises just
to recall everything cards because they

16
00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:50,030
replace everything ok but it is not so
relevant the outline wanna talk about a

17
00:01:50,030 --> 00:01:55,369
brief introduction to the different
generations of mobile technologies and

18
00:01:55,369 --> 00:02:01,229
the soyuz SIM card security and every
before introduction to college and

19
00:02:01,229 --> 00:02:07,800
authentication protocol used to use 3G
and 4G and then the way I was going to

20
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:14,450
present our work using such I know tax
essentially I mean to be more precise it

21
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:20,730
to his differential power analysis and i
was just juice and the results and some

22
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:28,700
time most ok so when running when
talking about sending the networks have

23
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,500
different generations of the first
generation

24
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,220
it's already a doubt that's what it's
like and this also but we actually

25
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:42,650
moving from 2d to 3d if I'm trying to be
moving to 22 Jan 22 G two is really

26
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:46,990
unfortunate starting from to do we
already using digital technology so we

27
00:02:46,990 --> 00:02:51,590
already have like coatings to do to
ensure like your life which has mission

28
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:56,950
and we can also use could become his
onto to protect the integrity

29
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:05,690
confidentiality of all the informations
and when we migrated to the 3G and 4G we

30
00:03:05,690 --> 00:03:14,450
can enjoy high-speed transmission so
what is a simple art museum stands for

31
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:21,179
universal subscriber identity module and
it's actually a smile God so far so good

32
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:27,150
so many ways because it as just a
computer minicomputer

33
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,510
small sites I mean so it's also powerful
as a computer but the standard can do

34
00:03:31,510 --> 00:03:36,489
some limitations such as encryption
maybe

35
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:46,720
and Christian are you gonna stay a yes
okay so what is starting side that has

36
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:54,950
seen it seems every number and then
that's all I missed I missed I which is

37
00:03:54,950 --> 00:04:01,709
actually responding to the country coat
operator and actually the idea number

38
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:09,040
corresponding to the 224 number and
there was some decrease on GSM the

39
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:15,040
secrets it's truly an encryption key but
starting from two regions 4G we have

40
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,390
more secrets that's right

41
00:04:16,390 --> 00:04:26,370
can be up to a dozen of secrets in group
must encryption key and some cards

42
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:33,510
values and also like 10 more primitive
security perimeters

43
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:39,630
it's all up to the operator all these
cars and seized it can be secret but

44
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:40,719
some some

45
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:47,270
operated they choose to use public
values for these ok so what is the

46
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:51,270
secret of Poland compromised then that
will lead you to a district in Columbus

47
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:57,270
SIM card and once we have the encryption
key i cant up on the communication maybe

48
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:02,539
I could also implement implanting
something like james also I'm not I

49
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:09,830
don't know but once we stay close this
team can also make phone calls and also

50
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:15,050
breaks the one-time costs as an occasion
I was sure that led to the end of this

51
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:22,190
presentation and the question is what
kind of script cryptography is in

52
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:27,240
command to the museum somebody's I would
give you a very short introduction to

53
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:35,180
cryptology in layman's term denouement
you talk about ecology it's actually a

54
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:41,070
combination of cryptography and
cryptanalysis ok so he is all about the

55
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:46,500
design of cryptosystems two pretty
important features such as

56
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:53,680
confidentiality integrity of the city
and Andhra Pradesh and cryptanalysis

57
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,150
it's the other way around this

58
00:05:55,150 --> 00:06:00,049
two breaks of cryptosystems ok and there
are many ways to break a proposal stand

59
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:05,830
such as we can take it easy for example
so did you think of this cryptosystem as

60
00:06:05,830 --> 00:06:10,849
a function acupuncture so there will be
some unknown and we can build including

61
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:17,510
how to pass its guide we can observe
that as many as we want to attend system

62
00:06:17,510 --> 00:06:23,150
systematically raped them as as a system
of equations and that the job is just to

63
00:06:23,150 --> 00:06:28,820
to resolve this situation and to
discover the secrets ok so what happens

64
00:06:28,820 --> 00:06:34,500
is the classic type of cryptanalysis and
more recently we are we are doing most

65
00:06:34,500 --> 00:06:40,139
advanced because the system is physical
we can just can

66
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:45,400
it's leaking more than the input and
output it could be power consumption

67
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:54,128
could be an electronic magnetic emission
queso and we are living in a world so we

68
00:06:54,129 --> 00:07:03,349
can actually do attacks more than most
which is what we do know what kind of

69
00:07:03,349 --> 00:07:11,699
cryptography is implemented you seem
it's essentially authentication + key

70
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:17,520
agreement so by by definition it's a
process that interest you and the

71
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,560
confirms a user's identity for example
so we have two parties Alice and Bob

72
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:29,650
share some secrets and Alice and Bob
want to indicate police say hello I'm

73
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:35,789
alleys but what we were not just believe
her because because he seems ok so each

74
00:07:35,789 --> 00:07:43,568
they should test whether alice is as
true as the Dallas are not so he west

75
00:07:43,569 --> 00:07:50,029
and some known some random values and
Elias Tuesday showed that both share the

76
00:07:50,029 --> 00:07:56,659
secret key can I just can't compute the
encrypted form of this trend announced

77
00:07:56,659 --> 00:08:03,180
ok then sent back this response to bop
bop also has two ski so she can do the

78
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:09,210
exact same competition and verify
whether a list is true or not is it the

79
00:08:09,210 --> 00:08:17,388
one claimed a not so this authentication
and key agreement agreement I don't I

80
00:08:17,389 --> 00:08:23,500
don't believe me this time because we
when we stake equal meant usually refers

81
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:27,740
to the TV common type of protocol we
have to potty stick equity on some

82
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,899
important key from scratch

83
00:08:29,899 --> 00:08:35,789
it's like we already have like share
some secret key secret master key and we

84
00:08:35,789 --> 00:08:40,729
derive some like session she but that
just technologists

85
00:08:40,729 --> 00:08:49,490
doesn't make much difference so we can
get just went on top of this protocol so

86
00:08:49,490 --> 00:08:56,560
so it's kind of another encryption of
Pop us one for example and then

87
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:02,040
encrypted Valley will be decision P ok
then everything else to us to

88
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:13,250
communication included on the decision
and you know the GSM actually is is just

89
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:20,190
the deal just kind of lost occasion
their key agreement protocol and I

90
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:26,370
cannot be any worse cuz you know they
actually they implemented this week

91
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:31,230
ocampo 128 just one which is mentally
flawed so the underlying improvement

92
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:37,089
especially thought and the protocol is
also flawed in the sense that that's

93
00:09:37,089 --> 00:09:43,160
only a 20 only comes as an occasion so
it's only the base station will also

94
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:49,069
indicates the SIM card but not the other
way around so that means subject to

95
00:09:49,069 --> 00:09:57,339
sporting base station tax and what's
more is that this comes in cards is also

96
00:09:57,339 --> 00:10:02,819
a GSM SIM cards it might also be
vulnerable vulnerable to side channel

97
00:10:02,819 --> 00:10:05,939
attacks there are some some work seen it

98
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:11,500
literature and let's see what state
secret security improvements of the two

99
00:10:11,500 --> 00:10:20,899
gents video over 3G as you can see now
starting from 3G we are now using a yes

100
00:10:20,899 --> 00:10:26,100
advanced encryption standard which is a
mathematically secure that is standing

101
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:37,030
by to buy the next day and last occasion
is now mutual

102
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:43,120
it's not only that the basis and we also
indicate the SIM cards and and doesn't

103
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:53,100
cut it also also included visitation
also included a dozen obsequious but

104
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:58,040
then then I will have a disgusting
doesn't more secrets implies better

105
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:05,060
security so that C is that we are going
to answer this question is this region

106
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:06,790
for you see medication

107
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:16,829
political let's take a look at this
situation for G aka protocol actually

108
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:22,370
there was some difference between 3G and
4G but the difference are not security

109
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:25,260
relevant so actually I always do that

110
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:31,620
details of the difference and we can
still he actually at at the same cut

111
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:38,170
side and also because they're actually
computes the same component essentially

112
00:11:38,170 --> 00:11:40,079
just 10 capitation

113
00:11:40,080 --> 00:11:51,130
and mutual authentication and taking a
closer look and this is what we are so

114
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:55,280
this this happens on the phone simcard
and this happens on the base station and

115
00:11:55,280 --> 00:12:04,120
we are only focused on the spot the left
part of what I was restarting the UC I

116
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:11,050
can show you have the Mazda key and we
have a secret key credit to credit and

117
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:20,140
we all have all these are meet us and
I'm and these values in the option of

118
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:28,360
some pretty big shoes to make it public
and some secret once they then told you

119
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:33,760
to cover them the strategy is nothing
new it's just a divide-and-conquer by

120
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,420
the way this is a French I'm not sure of
it

121
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:50,779
you know break like solving one single
huge problem is hot but if we could

122
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:58,600
somehow divide this one single problem
into subproblems and solving them in

123
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:06,310
dependency then we can do better in the
tax case if if we could do like this guy

124
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:12,569
for like every digit independently under
the cover them independently and then

125
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:18,889
combine that will lead to partition the
tax this judge's the classic styles

126
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:25,760
strategy and our job is just doing doing
the following this strategy and we will

127
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,420
recover all these secrets I mean

128
00:13:29,420 --> 00:13:36,240
OPC and all these arms and and sees one
at a time using power analysis and for

129
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:40,889
the israelis we were just do a standard
differential power analysis and for the

130
00:13:40,889 --> 00:13:47,500
rest of the rotational parameters we are
not where we are doing everything poke

131
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:51,769
alteration power analysis now

132
00:13:51,769 --> 00:13:55,760
yeah let me give you a very brief
introduction to such an attacks as well

133
00:13:55,760 --> 00:14:01,870
as you know that a cryptosystem in
addition to the input and output it also

134
00:14:01,870 --> 00:14:07,790
leaking information in many ways to
manage china's that's called this

135
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:15,579
channel side channels to be leaking
information strong power consumption OEM

136
00:14:15,579 --> 00:14:23,399
informational sheet or even across six
ok so we will what are you going to

137
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:31,910
exploit as the power consumption and
this is our measurement topped so we

138
00:14:31,910 --> 00:14:34,769
have decided by the way just to our home
made

139
00:14:34,769 --> 00:14:38,220
however called us so we have a spot
called the retesting call to read our

140
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:41,070
and we also have liked

141
00:14:41,070 --> 00:14:46,400
some sucky to measure the power
consumption of distinct ought to give it

142
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:53,160
a SIM card power supply and consumption
at the same time using just a scope ok

143
00:14:53,160 --> 00:15:00,750
let me also used a PC to do stick in the
processing of these captured the power

144
00:15:00,750 --> 00:15:09,140
consumptions and we also do the
cryptanalysis on this PC and also very

145
00:15:09,140 --> 00:15:18,360
busy brief introduction to DPA what we
got the UAS you know that if we focused

146
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:24,670
on a yes he's one hundred and a secret
key do you work force is just not it's

147
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:31,300
just almost impossible but if we could
just break down this single once single

148
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:37,069
click key to the key fragments
especially in to keep eyes as you know

149
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:37,960
that a yes

150
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:46,340
operates on make the basic operations of
latest updates on on bytes and so we can

151
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:55,000
do some easy and enumeration for every
key backed by to be you have only like

152
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:02,560
256 possibilities so we can just to try
all the plea possibilities for the other

153
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:07,560
part is what happens in practice so we
have this device and we do

154
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:15,160
traces our trees and this is this is
what happens in the boat so we make a

155
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:23,650
cheap gas I guess about keep at it and
we can also using power some more those

156
00:16:23,650 --> 00:16:28,610
about about this chip and we can also
computation get some competition

157
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:33,350
estimation about this intermediate
results based on the key gas and then we

158
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:37,600
can test whether our key guess is true
or not

159
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:45,630
hypothesis testing and more importantly
we can keep out independently

160
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:52,850
independently and then we come by gay so
these

161
00:16:52,850 --> 00:17:01,360
a more detailed introduction so let's
say we can make now we make a kickass

162
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:07,870
based on this kick ass can tablets all
that into all the possible possible

163
00:17:07,869 --> 00:17:16,760
results of all the values of these
values and all the power consumption of

164
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:20,919
the right spot this is a real and his
father as a hypothetical based on two

165
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:28,299
key guess so everyone wrote the
corresponding to put the second row we

166
00:17:28,299 --> 00:17:35,070
have another input so we can try as many
as we won't and the more you put the

167
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:38,899
number of the debate on what you have
and the more precise enough moisture and

168
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:46,080
attacking ok then we can calculate the
values are mean values between just

169
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:49,649
hypothetical value intimate values and
the power consumptions

170
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:57,169
computed a correlation if we could find
some peaks during this correlation trace

171
00:17:57,169 --> 00:18:02,059
then we can confirm that the key the key
gathered that the gas about this keypad

172
00:18:02,059 --> 00:18:03,950
keypad is correct

173
00:18:03,950 --> 00:18:08,520
otherwise it otherwise occupied this
wrong that had spread much like a white

174
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:16,960
noise where to attack you know this is

175
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,990
applause of the audience computation
apostle a part of this competition so we

176
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:29,260
attacked yet to get these two values and
and value of PC and we take you to get

177
00:18:29,260 --> 00:18:37,029
the rotation rotation of value and and
we are doing this many times so I will

178
00:18:37,029 --> 00:18:46,440
give to the first 22 attacks and all the
rest just like twice first of all we

179
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:52,549
collect power trace gave them to be just
identified identified the Sacramento Bee

180
00:18:52,549 --> 00:19:01,039
just using a single policies than me
just assuming ok so as you can see I

181
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:09,990
mean these paths they just responding to
the to the first on the way yes then you

182
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:17,419
know that when we do it if we discover
the secret key from front front

183
00:19:17,419 --> 00:19:23,100
encryption of these random values and he
had just run a number of the IND is

184
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:29,330
public but the product the challenge is
here we have two secrets we have to talk

185
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:37,029
about and we also have encryption key ok
so how to adapt the standard BPA 200

186
00:19:37,029 --> 00:19:44,960
this situation which is some challenge
ok so let me just if you're looking to

187
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,120
these parks the encryption of a yes
actually know that a yes doing these

188
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:55,949
random but its relations with the first
off it by XRD staying put we're pleased

189
00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:05,020
that the master key and the first round
tube station and then the second round

190
00:20:05,020 --> 00:20:13,639
the keeper funky monkey and do another
second-round operation ok so if taking a

191
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,040
few

192
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:18,810
can just absorbed OPC

193
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:24,659
to these parks so did the agreement
because by the leniency objects are we

194
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:33,030
can just arrived this year you just try
the case xoxo PC instead the case then

195
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:37,700
you can attack the first yes yeah to
treat kids just the way you view that

196
00:20:37,700 --> 00:20:45,600
the use another key key primary Street
which is between K&L PC and we can't get

197
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:52,969
to explore some of these two values case
then we get attacked the second iran to

198
00:20:52,970 --> 00:21:00,710
recover the second on key 898 the second
on the run the keys and the most keyed a

199
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:07,150
four-run child to do so by doing these
to launch attacks you can recover both

200
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:16,230
keep Kandal BC then the next challenge
is to recover the rotational parameters

201
00:21:16,230 --> 00:21:30,780
you look back so we are going to attack
these part I actually but by the time we

202
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:36,649
get to this point so this is already
known on the line telephone line is

203
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:45,620
already known just just this unknown and
we can ride this opted to as a multiple

204
00:21:45,620 --> 00:21:47,899
to process some residue

205
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:58,150
I N J independent amnesty question liane
independently first of all you first we

206
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:04,500
we are trying to recover J and here in
this case I is not relevant because you

207
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:13,790
know I just that I times eight know so
even if I am the value of I all the

208
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:19,570
bites down the same it's just up
imitations does the Bible not number of

209
00:22:19,570 --> 00:22:23,970
bits in a byte in eight so we attacked
his spot

210
00:22:23,970 --> 00:22:31,150
assuming that this is there is 0 user
reviews at the loss of generality so we

211
00:22:31,150 --> 00:22:37,870
just tried different guesses about Jay
and do a hypothesis testing days over

212
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:44,129
gas I i jus one and we we tried all the
resulting bikes and coordinate to the

213
00:22:44,130 --> 00:22:52,530
Frostbite slogan I'm put to trace and
sat next to get going to recover and

214
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:57,920
this time as ice that once we got Jay
Dardenne bites that just two

215
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:03,380
publications as right shift publication
so we can just wait to all the bags to

216
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:11,140
the tracey is observed their coat of
them at the time and the sequence of

217
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:16,680
correlations all the time axis ok
because I is essentially the number of

218
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:24,760
bytes shifted in the time its excess no
cuz I is just too is just a multiple 88

219
00:23:24,760 --> 00:23:31,750
Moscow for I so you just wave can
recover J&I sequentially and combined to

220
00:23:31,750 --> 00:23:40,950
get out too so that's pretty much it a
technical technical part of our results

221
00:23:40,950 --> 00:23:50,660
ok so we tried we succeeded aids cards
from different operators and

222
00:23:50,660 --> 00:23:56,830
manufacturers but he had a out
anonymized I mean to to to keep this

223
00:23:56,830 --> 00:24:02,980
presentation purity technical and some
of them to use doesn't that they use

224
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:07,880
different technologies first five the
use of 3d technology and the rust street

225
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:14,050
not Australia's budget acknowledges and
some operators they choose to keep your

226
00:24:14,050 --> 00:24:19,010
son is secrecy K and OPEC and the other
operators to use yours all secretive

227
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:24,410
values for parameters and then time time

228
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:31,660
needed to fully cover all these tickets
range from 10 to 80 minutes and twenty

229
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:44,250
or twenty up to 1,000 colleges and her
family so we are going to the form in

230
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:55,100
the middle is a normal thing so we have
a distance phone and its clone and we

231
00:24:55,100 --> 00:25:00,149
are going to make first of all we make a
phone call from the window to the right

232
00:25:00,150 --> 00:25:04,340
to the right and then and then after
that we are doing another phone call

233
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:17,870
from France close to 20 the phone

234
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:30,629
number number and if we change to
another phone I mean that if you switch

235
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:43,680
to do to its clone and dial the same
number just want

236
00:25:43,680 --> 00:26:04,440
and password of Ali Ali paying you know
that we pay greatest other the largest

237
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:13,560
party on a payment of Chinese payment
system it's like the Chinese version of

238
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:22,990
a paper first of all

239
00:26:22,990 --> 00:26:40,570
without any problem you can do you have
possibly can just log in and using the

240
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:45,419
user ID is the phone number and
undisclosed

241
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:50,470
on the Kelowna BC if you don't know
number you can always request I mean you

242
00:26:50,470 --> 00:26:55,090
say I hey I don't know number but i just
i I'm about to the US weather and

243
00:26:55,090 --> 00:27:02,649
priests and amino teepee so there'll be
peace and to this phone I sent to the

244
00:27:02,650 --> 00:27:10,280
clone and I just typing the OTP and now
i cant I can already be cited the

245
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:16,720
possible

246
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:28,809
days so so that hackers that in a new
password for for for this account and

247
00:27:28,809 --> 00:27:40,240
now we can just logging to decide
comment using your password

248
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:59,559
other cryptography we learned some
things about the design the crypto

249
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:04,540
stands so if you already have a block
cipher and you want to add more secret

250
00:28:04,540 --> 00:28:12,280
to block cipher to to enjoy better
security it is in general not possible

251
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:18,389
Casey get out at all secrets seems that
exhaustive search space seems to be

252
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:25,010
lodged up to stop to end the dilemma is
I have talked to some of these make us

253
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:30,150
and they're not to because we think they
are really cheap cuz they don't actually

254
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:37,429
make any money out of this so they they
don't want to invest anymore

255
00:28:37,429 --> 00:28:42,970
making any investments on the security
protection but you know that this kind

256
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:48,970
of thing cause death that they assume
that includes quantities if if there is

257
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:56,220
something security to imply possibly
greater impact and great financial loss

258
00:28:56,220 --> 00:29:02,730
so that's the dilemma and I want to
raise awareness of physical security for

259
00:29:02,730 --> 00:29:07,740
this kind of a small investors devices
because in practice the practical

260
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:13,210
security require both mathematically
secure servers and such as a yes but

261
00:29:13,210 --> 00:29:15,360
this this alone is not sufficient

262
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:19,689
we also need sufficient measures in
place against physical attacks such as

263
00:29:19,690 --> 00:29:28,780
side side channel attacks policies and
maybe for tax as well that's my dog and

264
00:29:28,780 --> 00:29:31,990
