1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,100
without further ado here to see the
battle for free speech on the Internet

2
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:17,470
by Matthew Prince of our chatting before
and I said I confess to him that I've

3
00:00:17,470 --> 00:00:24,660
been dreading having this talk for for
the last four months or however long you

4
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:29,480
known I was going to give it and and he
said you know why is that at the end of

5
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:38,230
the day no good comes of this can only
be make people more upset on one side or

6
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:42,860
another and you know there we've seen
over the last little bit a number of

7
00:00:42,860 --> 00:00:47,200
sort of feedback of people who are going
to be audience of one of the more

8
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:52,450
hyperbolic said that he was going to
bring his pitchfork with him so I'm

9
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:56,660
sorry scanning the audience looking for
pitchforks and so far so far I don't see

10
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:03,510
it which is which is going to tell you a
little bit about how we think of the

11
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,000
role of free speech on the internet what
challenges of free speech are on the

12
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,850
internet and what the right role for
infrastructure providers like CloudFlare

13
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:19,500
is as we're thinking about the content
that traverses our network and so when

14
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:25,570
we go people don't know what it was I
think most people do in case you don't

15
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:30,850
we launched in 2010 September will be
our fifth birthday our mission is to

16
00:01:30,850 --> 00:01:36,440
help build a better internet and so if I
encounter you at a cocktail party and I

17
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:39,149
and I think you're interesting that's
that's why would tell you we do as a

18
00:01:39,149 --> 00:01:42,800
company and I don't think is interesting
and I and I want to end the conversation

19
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:47,800
quickly said we make the Internet a
protect websites are mad guys over two

20
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:51,090
million customers actually closer three
million between five and ten percent of

21
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:56,140
all web request globally flow through
our network which means that there are a

22
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,850
lot of things that flow through our
network some of which are things that

23
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,479
you guys all know and love some of which
are things that that again would make

24
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:09,520
you blush or worse so I level what we do
and this is the grandmother clean up the

25
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:15,510
black hat friendly diagram as we put
ourselves in the traffic stream between

26
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:21,269
content not actually a host of that
content or something like you know one

27
00:02:21,270 --> 00:02:24,000
of one of the people on our team
described this is kind of a network with

28
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,130
assets

29
00:02:25,130 --> 00:02:28,510
where we can make your content are
protected from things like denial of

30
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:34,310
service attacks virtual wow that's in
the system and we do that all is a

31
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:38,100
service through a global network around
the world

32
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:43,980
inherit then to our business is that we
have to be trustworthy we have to be

33
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:49,079
something which people trust because if
we weren't there are any number of evil

34
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:53,270
things that we could potentially do we
could modify the content is actually

35
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:57,250
flows through our network we could spy
on people we can sell the data that

36
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:02,290
comes off of that network which would be
particularly untrustworthy things to do

37
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:07,329
when we'd be very quick hands to our
business and so we don't do those things

38
00:03:07,330 --> 00:03:11,730
inherent to our business from the
beginning what we knew when we launched

39
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:15,959
was if you were going to trust that all
of the traffic to your infrastructure is

40
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:21,440
going to pass or network that we have to
be trustworthy beyond reproach which is

41
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,070
sometimes really kind of difficult and
it's a strange place to start talking

42
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:25,730
like this

43
00:03:25,730 --> 00:03:32,600
talking about trustworthiness and and
talk about our our friends from from an

44
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:40,359
early class our customer it was actually
when they signed up and we had no idea

45
00:03:40,360 --> 00:03:43,180
the time what laws was or who they were

46
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:48,020
until customers started writing into US
customers are running into a saying how

47
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:53,610
can you possibly let this hacker group
beyond your network and there was a

48
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:57,990
period of about 23 days where low
seconds to use our network published a

49
00:03:57,990 --> 00:04:00,440
bunch of things

50
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:08,410
troubling to us you know the information
about police officers did it and they

51
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:12,590
had stolen from Sony and again all of
this behind our network we weren't the

52
00:04:12,590 --> 00:04:18,090
actual host of that it was going over
the pipes that we basically controlled

53
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:26,060
this was a particularly challenging
moment when they attack CIA dot gov and

54
00:04:26,060 --> 00:04:29,860
and took it offline and as I joked at a
time we made a lot of friends in the

55
00:04:29,860 --> 00:04:35,810
government that day and what it forces
to do was really think about what our

56
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:42,300
role was as a provider where we going to
be the content a lease that said oh this

57
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:49,100
is saying and we're going to take it off
because we judge it to be bad or are we

58
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:53,310
going to be the anarchist that said all
content is good and you should just

59
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:57,280
leave things up no matter what or was
the right line somewhere in between

60
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,520
those places and that's a question we
continue to struggle with and continue

61
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:07,010
to think about two very day and it's
it's in part because we in the planning

62
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:10,539
ourselves with some very strange friends
because we have become somewhat of a

63
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:15,760
Switzerland of the internet saying that
our position is that we're not going to

64
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:19,159
pick us one side or the other because
clothes made it so easy for

65
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,940
organizations to sign up

66
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:25,320
oftentimes we find ourselves with very
strange those using our network at the

67
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:33,400
same time so for example a mosque and
the Israeli Defense Force sometimes

68
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:41,330
there are attacks are launched at both
of these organizations and an armoire

69
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:45,219
playful days I would say he would
sometimes put the two organizations on

70
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:55,979
the same IP address sort of pro ukranian
forces and the sort of pro-russian

71
00:05:55,979 --> 00:06:02,229
separatists forces both these CloudFlare
a major newspaper publications that are

72
00:06:02,229 --> 00:06:06,620
that are essentially bypassing the
propaganda from the two different sides

73
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:14,190
of our polls close our customers state
of Missouri and hacking group Anonymous

74
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:20,860
uses when when protests over Ferguson
Missouri took off in the city of

75
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:26,120
Ferguson's actually customers well I'm
an honors actually need cost the state

76
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:31,289
resources to help protect them keep them
online and then on the same side

77
00:06:31,289 --> 00:06:35,800
anonymous if you were young hacker and
you want to surprise your chops knocking

78
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:42,379
off one of the major and onwards is is
is it as a way of kind of showing me

79
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:44,879
here you've got some credibility and so
again

80
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:50,340
group Anonymous uses us and and you know
even in this case

81
00:06:50,340 --> 00:06:56,779
Street and Goldman Sachs again radical
extremes on either of these you think is

82
00:06:56,779 --> 00:07:02,659
the good guys and the bad guy it's it's
pretty amazing that across the board

83
00:07:02,659 --> 00:07:06,889
these organizations are are using us to
help protect their network is actually

84
00:07:06,889 --> 00:07:15,560
kind of interesting story how they how
they came to be as a customer actually

85
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:22,069
started with a bell but we have in our
office back in 2011 and the bill would

86
00:07:22,069 --> 00:07:26,190
go off anytime someone would sign up for
the service and I remember very

87
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:32,240
distinctly chain of events that led to
Goldman Sachs becoming a customer and of

88
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,639
all the things that start off with it
was the bell going off announcing that

89
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:40,300
we had our first Turkish escort site
using cloud

90
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:47,909
that and and I really was not looking
for the stock so I tried this morning it

91
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:51,550
took the hardest part of putting stuff
together was finding a version of a

92
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:58,039
Turkish escort site which was safe
enough to display here but still some of

93
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:02,860
the challenges that we faced and and and
what was interesting was it wasn't just

94
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:09,379
one square site over the course of two
weeks we have a hundred and fifty

95
00:08:09,379 --> 00:08:17,190
Turkish escort sites they became a team
that's our asset is this like a segment

96
00:08:17,190 --> 00:08:25,210
of the of customers that we should start
targeting and he finally got the better

97
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:29,520
of us and so we got one of the web
masters in the church escort sites on on

98
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,549
the summary said you know how do you
ever hear about us we don't do any

99
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:39,510
marketing really we certainly don't do
any marketing to Turkish and then

100
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:45,110
secondly you know what's going on is
this is a superb customer somebody's

101
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:49,000
wife that's angry as you know what's
what's going on with this and they said

102
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,300
oh thank you so much

103
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:55,439
we've had this huge problem was the
first thing that's been able to help we

104
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:59,490
heard about you cuz one of our friends
moonlights as a webmaster for the

105
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:03,500
Turkish escort industry reached a crunch
and read about you guys are so we signed

106
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:07,610
up and and then in terms of the problem
with Turkey has a really fascinating

107
00:09:07,610 --> 00:09:13,100
country and as you go further west in
the country it's very European really

108
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:19,070
love what we do but they tolerate it as
you move further east in the country

109
00:09:19,070 --> 00:09:21,050
it becomes much more conservative

110
00:09:21,050 --> 00:09:28,160
move much more fundamentalist Muslim and
they see as sort of the epitome of

111
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,410
everything which is wrong with the
western world and so when they're bored

112
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:36,949
they launched these attacks against US
line and we've never had any thing that

113
00:09:36,950 --> 00:09:41,920
we could use actually defend ourselves
and you know you saved us but not a lot

114
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,810
of money and Turkish outscored so we're
just using the free version of your

115
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:50,189
services that ok he said sure and we
watch actually over the course of the

116
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:56,820
next year as asthma attacks against the
Turks escorts got better and better more

117
00:09:56,820 --> 00:10:03,680
sophisticated more interesting and
continuously learns from all of these

118
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,000
attacks and also exactly mister the day
a year later we have another

119
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:16,220
organization sign up when the Dutch
gentleman called from Azerbaijan saying

120
00:10:16,220 --> 00:10:21,910
that the contest was under attack and we
need to help them get online that I had

121
00:10:21,910 --> 00:10:27,189
no idea what your vision is anyone in
the audience is from Europe knows that

122
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:32,870
it is capable force it's sort of like
the Americans in the audience it's kind

123
00:10:32,870 --> 00:10:38,200
of like American Idol but with
nationalism where each country gets to

124
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:45,100
send their own representative to
participate in this song contest and

125
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:48,649
then there's this complicated voting
scheme a lot of which goes online where

126
00:10:48,649 --> 00:10:52,880
people can vote for it and and again
when when the gentleman from

127
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,720
Azerbaijan's explains to me over the
phone I just yet to sign up

128
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,600
didn't know is that Eurovision is the
second it's it's the largest

129
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,329
non-sporting of

130
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:09,238
my viewership it's only trumped the
Olympics and the World Cup when there

131
00:11:09,239 --> 00:11:15,160
when they're online it it gets twice the
viewership of the Super Bowl and what

132
00:11:15,160 --> 00:11:19,610
had happened was that they were down to
the finals of this there were six

133
00:11:19,610 --> 00:11:26,339
finalists in the contest and there was a
group that was upset that one of the

134
00:11:26,339 --> 00:11:34,709
final contestants 16 was gay and so they
launched it too has a vision off the

135
00:11:34,709 --> 00:11:40,899
internet for us we were able to help
protect them interesting about it was

136
00:11:40,899 --> 00:11:45,110
that system automatically recognized who
was mine and saxophone like we know

137
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:48,879
these guys in the Turkish outscored
attackers and it was the exact same

138
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:53,290
groups to be the exact same strategies
and if you look at Baku Azerbaijan

139
00:11:53,290 --> 00:12:00,238
strained muscle nestled right in there
with eastern Turkey what happened in six

140
00:12:00,239 --> 00:12:05,049
months later in the fall of 2012 is when
our friends at Goldman reached out there

141
00:12:05,049 --> 00:12:10,079
was a series of attacks targeting you as
financial industry launched one after

142
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:15,059
another after another knocking them
offline and see so it at another bank

143
00:12:15,059 --> 00:12:19,529
actually not Goldman called me on a
Saturday and said we need you to bring

144
00:12:19,529 --> 00:12:24,329
your best sales engineers to New York
and beer first thing Monday morning

145
00:12:24,329 --> 00:12:32,758
'cause were offline and we need help
getting back online sales engineers and

146
00:12:32,759 --> 00:12:35,540
so we the suit

147
00:12:35,540 --> 00:12:43,660
0 who usually shows up to work in camo
shorts and complain and I i got on the

148
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:47,819
plane and we all flew out to New York
and we walked into this makes us and we

149
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:53,680
actually ended up meeting with the large
space in the world and in that sense of

150
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,349
a 48 hour period and the very first
thing they did was they say they slid

151
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:02,620
across the table here's here's a version
of the logs and Sri looks at how the

152
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:06,499
church scored attackers

153
00:13:06,499 --> 00:13:11,249
and so you know and and this is
absolutely been reported by your times

154
00:13:11,249 --> 00:13:16,959
it turns out is probably the same group
probably in western Iran an organization

155
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,309
that's launched a series of attacks and
because of the fact that we had turkey

156
00:13:20,309 --> 00:13:27,358
escorts on our network learn from what
was going on and and help in the end

157
00:13:27,359 --> 00:13:31,329
protect much much larger attackers
because we see the attacks that are

158
00:13:31,329 --> 00:13:34,819
launched at the Israeli Defense Force we
actually are better able to protect a

159
00:13:34,819 --> 00:13:38,839
mosque because we see the attacks
launched at Goldman Sachs were actually

160
00:13:38,839 --> 00:13:43,889
able better able to protect you know
Occupy Wall Street so the very nature of

161
00:13:43,889 --> 00:13:47,789
what we're doing learns from every piece
of data which is coming through us and

162
00:13:47,789 --> 00:13:51,799
as a result recertifying bit if
something on our network that that's

163
00:13:51,799 --> 00:13:56,399
providing value to the network itself
and actually making it stronger as a

164
00:13:56,399 --> 00:14:00,539
result of it and that definitely helped
shape our perspective on how are

165
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:03,939
thinking about when content is allowed
to be on US forces not allowed to be

166
00:14:03,939 --> 00:14:08,919
honest most of the troublesome content
that uses a lot of speculation that some

167
00:14:08,919 --> 00:14:15,419
content that uses us we make money off
that is that is quite the opposite of

168
00:14:15,419 --> 00:14:20,569
the case and I would be carried around
on on on the shoulders of my office team

169
00:14:20,569 --> 00:14:26,978
if we stopped being some things like
Chinese gambling sites detox for higher

170
00:14:26,979 --> 00:14:34,960
sites sites this gentleman Brian Krebs
way way back

171
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:43,670
when when he left us and he said no
actually try this blog and turned out

172
00:14:43,670 --> 00:14:50,430
pretty well with security and a pic with
us always ard Oxfordshire sites are

173
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:56,670
called booter sites and this conference
two years ago and he gave a talk with

174
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:01,459
lynn change where he said you know
there's actually facilitating the Oscar

175
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:06,640
Meyer organization because these
organizations even though there's no

176
00:15:06,640 --> 00:15:09,850
more to actually launch the attacks they
are protected

177
00:15:09,850 --> 00:15:17,230
sort of the user interface and as a
result just stop providing services to

178
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:22,560
them then they would all attack each
other and essentially way peter out the

179
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:27,469
internet which is to a series of
interesting debates we've reached the

180
00:15:27,470 --> 00:15:30,750
point where r disgusting Nash
equilibrium and whether it would result

181
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:35,860
in which was actually at large cartels
are not think that something to be

182
00:15:35,860 --> 00:15:43,110
debated but the real key of this is and
this is what hurts and we recognize this

183
00:15:43,110 --> 00:15:46,770
is that it feels like we're being
hypocrites that we're protecting the bad

184
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:52,280
guys the same thing that happened when
we have no second our network and guys

185
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:57,319
are calling us saying how can you be
protecting the back and the argument is

186
00:15:57,320 --> 00:16:00,880
again when when Ryan was here

187
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:07,800
rudely during the Q&A session took the
stage and answered questions using his

188
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:15,459
Microsoft brian is here today he's
welcome to use him again only seems fair

189
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:22,870
trial on in this there's there's a
website actually which is dedicated to

190
00:16:22,870 --> 00:16:27,130
the sites which are on CloudFlare and
troublesome content

191
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:32,980
which is which is out there the
gentleman which is behind this site and

192
00:16:32,980 --> 00:16:37,430
it's kind of strange sight because it
alleges two things simultaneously one

193
00:16:37,430 --> 00:16:41,540
that we are on for the CIA

194
00:16:41,540 --> 00:16:45,819
while at the same time that were
anarchists not responsible to any law

195
00:16:45,820 --> 00:16:52,770
enforcement organizations challenging to
keep those two things consistent

196
00:16:52,770 --> 00:16:59,370
gentleman who's behind this previously
to other websites they started with

197
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:03,240
Google watch any other was Wikipedia
watch and if you think about it i mean

198
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:10,160
these three of us are somewhat creepy
organizations Wikipedia purports to be

199
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,920
the thought of truth for the internet
that's that's pretty heady stuff frugal

200
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:19,270
you think about how dependent you are
and we are silently sitting in five to

201
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:23,490
ten percent of all internet request
streams but I think so there's there's

202
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:28,620
something to this what it is really
important for these organizations to be

203
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:33,580
trustworthy entrusted because they do
said in a very privileged position and

204
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:40,360
and I don't own the fact that we are
critiqued and criticized it's it's just

205
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:45,659
like Switzerland you you sign up to be
the neutral party and inherently you're

206
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:51,790
gonna piss everyone off and hard thing
though is I don't know a better way to

207
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:57,280
do it and we have this debate all the
time because there's an easy thing to

208
00:17:57,280 --> 00:18:01,020
say you should check all the bad sites
after network it's hard to say what

209
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:05,650
exactly is bad and I think that's kind
of a dangerous precedent what's

210
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:10,560
happening on a level is that the
internet used to be extremely

211
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:12,840
decentralize

212
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:18,330
anyone could spend up a website anywhere
by some you know an HP servers in the

213
00:18:18,330 --> 00:18:22,260
data center next to one of many ISPs
that were out there

214
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:26,870
hardware and trying to protect it from
companies like Cisco and otherwise and

215
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:32,350
that that was how you spawn your
system's what's happening now is that

216
00:18:32,350 --> 00:18:37,059
there's a massive consolidation across
the industry and so it's sort of

217
00:18:37,059 --> 00:18:40,330
anachronistic to think that you would
buy a Dell server anymore if you were

218
00:18:40,330 --> 00:18:46,980
starting up to speed up something on on
ec2 or digital ocean or Microsoft Azure

219
00:18:46,980 --> 00:18:51,820
and while there will be some competition
in that space it's not going to be

220
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:56,270
anything close to the thousands of
people from you used to be able to buy

221
00:18:56,270 --> 00:19:00,929
server and it's a different relationship
once Dell sells you a server it's your

222
00:19:00,929 --> 00:19:04,020
server you get to do with it whatever
you want and doesn't have any real

223
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:09,760
ability to go in and see anything that
may think Michael Dell says Josh I just

224
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:16,289
really don't like you know WikiLeaks
there's no way that he can snatch that

225
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:20,970
your server hosting WikiLeaks on the
other hand when Amazon received a

226
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:25,309
slightly threatening letter not a court
order not a subpoena a slightly

227
00:19:25,309 --> 00:19:29,760
threatening letter from any junior
senator and they took place and kick

228
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:34,080
them off their network at a different
level of power that service providers

229
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:39,059
shall be really cognizant of what the
policies are of these service providers

230
00:19:39,059 --> 00:19:41,779
as they're making choices for it

231
00:19:41,779 --> 00:19:45,770
same thing is happening in the network
edge we're used to use services provided

232
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:49,940
by the sort of Cisco Arbor networks in
order to protect the edge of your

233
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,590
network increasingly that's a
consolidate around service providers

234
00:19:53,590 --> 00:19:58,299
like clouds low as well as its
CloudFlare Akamai Amazon a relatively

235
00:19:58,299 --> 00:20:02,960
limited number of providers and those
become choke points for the internet

236
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,830
itself and if those providers

237
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:10,470
have policies that don't let certain
content beyond their networks and that

238
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:14,179
haunted just might disappear from the
internet and that's what we worry about

239
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:19,149
that seems kind of crazy to be talking
about it some level but the trends that

240
00:20:19,149 --> 00:20:23,539
we see are that more and more and more
the network is ending up behind these

241
00:20:23,539 --> 00:20:27,649
consolidated choke points and as a
result it's really important for us to

242
00:20:27,649 --> 00:20:32,459
think about what the policies of these
these organizations should be because

243
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:40,000
they are places that can effectively
shut down content online and what is bad

244
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:48,000
right so this is combat center dot com
this is reporting on the chechen

245
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:56,330
rebel movement in chechnya very anti
Russian site it's labeled a terrorist by

246
00:20:56,330 --> 00:21:04,080
the Russian government supported think
it's a news organization on the other

247
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:10,810
hand the Boston bombers before they
attacked Austin posted their plans for

248
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:23,419
among us so they could garb and
corruption in angola the government is

249
00:21:23,420 --> 00:21:30,200
currently trying to hunt down the
individual that's behind this site who

250
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,140
is basically in hiding

251
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:39,250
they think this is a terrorist guy about
this is the world we don't know how to

252
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,830
pronounce this is one of the
organizations which is a student group

253
00:21:42,830 --> 00:21:46,419
the only country in the world that
thinks it is terrorist organization is

254
00:21:46,420 --> 00:21:52,520
China what they think is a terrorist
organization and as such and so are they

255
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:56,440
good or bad guy again we can pick all of
these different things and one of the

256
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:01,000
things which has been very apparent in
running clothes larry is that almost

257
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:06,090
every country almost every organization
has a group which is opposite them and

258
00:22:06,090 --> 00:22:12,199
that they don't like and again there are
people who personally I find absolutely

259
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:18,940
repugnant and the question is should
dictate whether or not that content

260
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:24,250
should be online there's one more this
is one of my favorite examples this is

261
00:22:24,250 --> 00:22:26,850
the Muslim Brotherhood which was

262
00:22:26,850 --> 00:22:30,350
for a while a terrorist organization in
Egypt and then they became the ruling

263
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:33,350
party of Egypt and now they're a
terrorist organization in Egypt as well

264
00:22:33,350 --> 00:22:39,139
so again how how do you pick who are the
good guys and the bad guys in these

265
00:22:39,140 --> 00:22:47,690
cases it's not just governments either
so it's a story of a group of princesses

266
00:22:47,690 --> 00:23:00,650
there's a popular forum site which had a
particular form which was dedicated to a

267
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:07,790
certain entertainment company's
intellectual property being portrayed in

268
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:14,629
compromising situations and the certain
entertainment company reached out to the

269
00:23:14,630 --> 00:23:25,900
forum and said DMCA trademark take it
down and in the forum said sir use you

270
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:33,500
know get a court order and so the
particular entertainment company reached

271
00:23:33,500 --> 00:23:43,360
out to the provider that was was working
with them and said

272
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:47,129
taken down and the particular CDN
provider

273
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:50,540
just doesn't seem right and
entertainment companies that how much

274
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:54,750
business do we do with you and how much
business as this law forum do with you

275
00:23:54,750 --> 00:24:01,090
so they took it down again the power of
being in the stream and the

276
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:05,899
infrastructure and is that the right way
to do it and no court order due process

277
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:12,920
just took it down from a business
concern another one and again this was

278
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:14,690
interesting

279
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:25,140
there is a certain genre fantasy fiction
that I can't say I understand

280
00:24:25,140 --> 00:24:35,530
and it turns out that it offends someone
at a very large infrastructure company

281
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:39,760
and through books and other things

282
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:46,910
organization and and one day just
arbitrarily they said you can no longer

283
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:59,020
sell any content on our network which
which portrayed people and I think I

284
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:03,290
think what sort of strangers I can kind
of I can kind of understand when we get

285
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:07,700
criticized because there may be sights
on us that portrayed people fantasizing

286
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:13,300
about having sex with animals are are
people having sex with children I really

287
00:25:13,300 --> 00:25:18,169
irks me but I'm not sure how are you
worried about the situation it's not

288
00:25:18,170 --> 00:25:24,690
like the dinosaurs and and and I can I
think that there's much more risk to

289
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:30,530
they today the other than on dinosaur
participate in this

290
00:25:30,530 --> 00:25:38,320
really quite what I think the strangers
why why this particular fetish is it

291
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:44,000
that is banned from you know being sold
on this particular network and you know

292
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:50,190
if if the next great novel turns out to
have this is a plot point we as a

293
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:55,670
society have lost out because you know
taken by t-rex doesn't make the New York

294
00:25:55,670 --> 00:26:01,680
Times bestseller list and that again is
the challenge of the world we're moving

295
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:06,410
into as we're moving into a world where
more and more of the content is actually

296
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:10,770
sitting behind viewers your
organizations organizations can exercise

297
00:26:10,770 --> 00:26:17,970
very substantial and and sometimes
really arbitrary rules on how they are

298
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:22,720
going to remove that content you think
about your e-reader and it's pretty

299
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:29,540
amazing that you can buy a book and then
the company behind that e-reader can

300
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:33,920
actually go in snatch that content to
you it's sort of the digital equivalent

301
00:26:33,920 --> 00:26:40,560
of burning books and and again I don't
think that this is is is you know I want

302
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:48,179
to reduce dust caps lock but we do need
to make sure that that when we're

303
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:52,290
trusting these organizations and
providers we understand what it is

304
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:56,580
that's motivating them hold them
accountable accountable for what are

305
00:26:56,580 --> 00:27:02,210
sometimes very arbitrary decisions which
is of course just a natural transition

306
00:27:02,210 --> 00:27:07,440
to this about a year and a half ago

307
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:14,289
my my assistant received this email in a
meeting with Mr Assange and mister

308
00:27:14,289 --> 00:27:23,330
prince went after which is today Mr
Prince regards Joseph the ambassador to

309
00:27:23,330 --> 00:27:29,428
WikiLeaks and that was sort of an
interesting email and I thought and I'm

310
00:27:29,429 --> 00:27:33,909
pretty good at clearing my inbox out but
it's one that kept in my inbox for some

311
00:27:33,909 --> 00:27:37,440
time that was going to be in London
anytime soon and I i've seen your that

312
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:44,549
Julian probably cannot meet me in San
Francisco and and so and so I I just

313
00:27:44,549 --> 00:27:48,629
hung onto and I showed people parties
and investments in London and I had a

314
00:27:48,629 --> 00:27:56,699
pointer to a pub and so I wrote back
Joseph almost a year after he had sent

315
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:00,320
the message originally and i said im in
London for the next five days it Mr

316
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:04,460
Assange has as any availability I'd be
happy to meet with him assume that they

317
00:28:04,460 --> 00:28:08,950
will be at the Ecuadorian embassy and a
republic within 30 minutes and said be

318
00:28:08,950 --> 00:28:15,929
there for 30 bring I D and so went to
the Ecuadorian embassy on a Friday

319
00:28:15,929 --> 00:28:20,250
afternoon and if you know London Ecuador
numbers he's actually in Knightsbridge

320
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:27,830
dinner really nice area of London from
Harrods and I i walked in to the

321
00:28:27,830 --> 00:28:32,389
Ecuadorian embassy passed through the
many failings of of MP's that that's

322
00:28:32,389 --> 00:28:35,870
around it and the first thing that I
noticed is that the Ecuadorian Embassy

323
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:40,620
is kept believe the same temperature
that they probably keep embassies in

324
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:46,500
Ecuador so if you thought that it was
all just comfortable living there for

325
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:52,740
the last while well mister tsongas been
there it probably and i know i scored

326
00:28:52,740 --> 00:28:55,490
into a small room in and then the next
thing you know

327
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:58,550
Julian Assange

328
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:05,930
more surreal moments of her and he looks
just as intense in person and he sat

329
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:09,760
down and he said well you know there's
sort of three things that I want to

330
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:17,430
discuss with you the first is we used to
use CloudFlare and about a year ago when

331
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:21,820
we first sent email requesting a meeting
we decided to eliminate all urs

332
00:29:21,820 --> 00:29:27,919
infrastructure providers from our stream
and and we were initially sent out a

333
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:35,560
press release saying you know we've done
this and and shame on the USS it seems

334
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:41,580
like you are doing the right saying
throw you under the nicest thing anyone

335
00:29:41,580 --> 00:29:50,629
has ever done for me in my life he said
you know as you might imagine we use a

336
00:29:50,630 --> 00:29:54,980
lot of anonymity proxy is as we surfed
the internet given given sort of

337
00:29:54,980 --> 00:30:01,550
situation and I've really been tracking
the rise of cloud over time because you

338
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:07,629
put the most annoying captured in front
of a ton of the web when you're using

339
00:30:07,630 --> 00:30:12,010
the tour network as a product request
can you actually make that better I said

340
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:17,010
sure I'll take that back to to our
product team and we try and make the

341
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:25,020
thing that really stuck with me and it
was absurd at the time but i i think

342
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:29,950
it's a great way to think about what's
happening to a lot of this

343
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:35,120
infrastructure companies online thing
was about crowdsourced or seismically

344
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,158
and I said

345
00:30:37,159 --> 00:30:44,690
and he said well you know how nation
states get started I said Mr Assange you

346
00:30:44,690 --> 00:30:49,759
have really lost me and he said well you
know before there were nation states

347
00:30:49,759 --> 00:30:55,039
individuals were on their own and the
week would get attacked by the strong

348
00:30:55,039 --> 00:31:02,820
and the strong would keep them up from
them or kill them or worse and

349
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:07,330
eventually the week get second and they
say we're going to band together and

350
00:31:07,330 --> 00:31:11,279
will provide a collective defense
together and we'll have people sort of

351
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:14,899
initially take walks and then that'll
turn into army someday we'll build

352
00:31:14,899 --> 00:31:19,399
castles and eventually turns into
language and turns into religion and

353
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:23,139
turns into culture it turns into a
welfare state to protect the you know

354
00:31:23,139 --> 00:31:28,099
the weakest among its system of taxation
on the upkeep of the system taxing those

355
00:31:28,099 --> 00:31:32,499
people that are there more wealthy and I
was like ok I understand what this has

356
00:31:32,499 --> 00:31:40,269
to do with us said well you know we have
increasingly I'm sorry I think about

357
00:31:40,269 --> 00:31:44,679
that from a digital perspective and to
that end I think of the First Nations

358
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:48,570
day to the internet at which point I
burst out laughing because that's absurd

359
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:54,059
except for those steps are stuck with me
and it still makes me think that as the

360
00:31:54,059 --> 00:31:57,070
in the privileged position where we are
where we have taken a whole bunch of

361
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:00,840
week organizations hold them together
provide data collected two cents

362
00:32:00,840 --> 00:32:08,749
starting with Turkish escorts and ending
with Goldman Sachs and others we we have

363
00:32:08,749 --> 00:32:12,580
a responsibility as infrastructure
provider to think about what our

364
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:16,539
policies are me very transparent and
very clear about those policies and more

365
00:32:16,539 --> 00:32:21,179
than anything be extremely consistent
and arbitrary when we think about those

366
00:32:21,179 --> 00:32:25,350
policies and and I think that's
something that more and more

367
00:32:25,350 --> 00:32:29,510
more of the organizations that sit in
this trusted position really need to

368
00:32:29,510 --> 00:32:35,660
appreciate and think about and began as
we watch this transition happen we're

369
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:42,440
moving from individual we parties
collecting behind cloud flares and the

370
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:46,850
Facebooks and the ghouls and the demise
of the world it's incumbent on those

371
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:50,629
users though since these effective
nation states to hold them accountable

372
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:54,559
for what their policies are and decide
what those policies are different

373
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,490
nations days of the Internet are going
to have different policies and so are as

374
00:32:58,490 --> 00:33:05,130
is not so much around free speech but
really around due process around an idea

375
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:09,559
that we should be transparent in what it
is that we're doing and we are subject

376
00:33:09,559 --> 00:33:15,490
or not and Marcus were subject to us'
laws and our response when we when we

377
00:33:15,490 --> 00:33:20,590
get a questionable site on our network
is to reach out to those law enforcement

378
00:33:20,590 --> 00:33:27,399
organizations and say what do you think
about this and other problems they don't

379
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,970
then you need to get a while right you
need to get something that shows that

380
00:33:30,970 --> 00:33:35,720
we've gone through a democratically
sanction process decide whether this

381
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:39,360
content is good content because there
are people who pay rates are a lot

382
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:40,399
higher than mine

383
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:44,580
you've all entrusted with determining
what is good and what is bad what is

384
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:48,490
right and what is wrong and when you
lean very heavily on that and those

385
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:52,130
institutions and where USA based company
and so we're gonna be subject to USB

386
00:33:52,130 --> 00:33:56,250
slot we're not hiding and we're not if
you're using us as a means to hide from

387
00:33:56,250 --> 00:34:00,460
law enforcement it's not a very good
strategy but at the same time that means

388
00:34:00,460 --> 00:34:04,549
that there's an organization on our site
that someone doesn't like I don't care

389
00:34:04,549 --> 00:34:10,190
how much customers call us and complain
about it you know if it's if it's a

390
00:34:10,190 --> 00:34:13,869
certain set of princesses in
compromising situations and tell a

391
00:34:13,869 --> 00:34:18,240
legitimacy quarter organization actually
says you have an obligation to take this

392
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:21,549
down and that's what we're gonna fall
and

393
00:34:21,550 --> 00:34:25,870
consistent policy that we have and i
think thats the only rational policy

394
00:34:25,870 --> 00:34:29,989
that's there because otherwise you end
up doing things like banning people

395
00:34:29,989 --> 00:34:36,489
fantasizing about having sex with
dinosaurs and again that's just weird we

396
00:34:36,489 --> 00:34:41,810
try to be consistent with this on the
other side of the coin as well and I'll

397
00:34:41,810 --> 00:34:48,330
give you an example that one of the
things I think I just lost my one of the

398
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:52,750
things that we have

399
00:34:52,750 --> 00:35:04,510
hello speak loudly one of the things
that we recognized was a challenge is

400
00:35:04,510 --> 00:35:09,190
that you know we provide pretty robust
enterprise detox mitigation service but

401
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:15,160
it costs a lot and there are a lot of
politically are artistically important

402
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:22,839
sites that can't necessarily afford to
pay for that that service so that

403
00:35:22,840 --> 00:35:27,570
content and so we said we should do
something to help protect these

404
00:35:27,570 --> 00:35:33,250
organizations that are doing the right
thing are working in the pool in the in

405
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:38,730
the interest of either our societal
interest or artistic interests and we

406
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:42,490
should protect them even if they don't
have the ability to pay as we launch

407
00:35:42,490 --> 00:35:48,410
something last year about a year ago
called project Galileo and the idea of

408
00:35:48,410 --> 00:35:53,100
project Galileo was really simple it was
that if you are a politically

409
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:58,040
artistically important site and you come
under attack will protect you and will

410
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:05,570
throw an entire resources keeping you
keeping you online

411
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:12,410
what we really wanted to avoid was just
in the same way we don't want to

412
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:16,490
determine who's bad and we don't think
it's appropriate for us to ensure news

413
00:36:16,490 --> 00:36:19,529
bad we also don't wanna media
organization that's determining who's

414
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:23,700
good at the right place for the
infrastructure provider for us to say

415
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:28,669
that's artistically important but that
isn't just important and so the solution

416
00:36:28,670 --> 00:36:31,930
that we came up with it was actually
pretty clever which is we were just

417
00:36:31,930 --> 00:36:36,770
reached out to a number of civil society
and NGO partners company is

418
00:36:36,770 --> 00:36:41,820
organizations that you all sort of
entrusted and we tried to span the

419
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:45,150
political spectrum here and said

420
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:49,589
before we accept someone into project
Galileo you have to vouch for them and

421
00:36:49,589 --> 00:36:54,619
if any one of these organizations
vouches for a particular organization

422
00:36:54,619 --> 00:36:59,029
that is under attack then we'll take
their word for it even if we personally

423
00:36:59,029 --> 00:37:05,770
philosophically disagree with what is on
that site and we've we've tried to live

424
00:37:05,770 --> 00:37:10,230
up to that and I think the best test of
this actually was almost the very first

425
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:16,529
test of it which was we got a call from
from our friends over at the eff and

426
00:37:16,529 --> 00:37:21,420
they said only the perfect galileo
customer or user for you

427
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:28,230
follows the very principle that police
should be able to censor the internet

428
00:37:28,230 --> 00:37:31,650
you know we had heard about it
originally from you know the folks at

429
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:38,140
Occupy Toronto at Occupy central needed
some protection and the site in question

430
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:43,740
is Papo de que and I remember our policy
team came to me and said hey we got our

431
00:37:43,740 --> 00:37:49,569
first galileo requests pocketbook and I
was like is is this another Eurovision

432
00:37:49,569 --> 00:37:53,819
thing is it is it like a popularity
contest I was imagining with a singing

433
00:37:53,819 --> 00:38:00,609
contest had no idea right we're not the
most politically astute individuals in

434
00:38:00,609 --> 00:38:05,308
fact what this was was this was the
democracy movement Hong Kong and there

435
00:38:05,309 --> 00:38:15,770
they were planning on having a election
essentially a referendum to ask whether

436
00:38:15,770 --> 00:38:21,200
or not essentially democratic rights
should be extended in Hong Kong and this

437
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:26,288
was something that hong kong governments
and and the Chinese government were not

438
00:38:26,289 --> 00:38:32,119
particularly fans of of happening and so
you know these were the organizations

439
00:38:32,119 --> 00:38:34,910
that came to us and said you should
definitely do it we said sure if you say

440
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:37,710
this is an organization worth protecting

441
00:38:37,710 --> 00:38:42,990
we we're not saying it's good or bad
words were we gonna do that originally

442
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:47,569
published been using Amazon Web Services
but the attack a gun so large that was

443
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:51,720
actually causing Amazon Web Services to
kick them off their Amazon bill was was

444
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:56,089
getting out of control so our first half
was actually convincing Amazon to get

445
00:38:56,089 --> 00:38:59,619
them back on line so the backend
infrastructure was hosted on Amazon

446
00:38:59,619 --> 00:39:05,310
Amazon did a great job of keeping that
online ahead of the scheduled vote we

447
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:09,820
saw a very very large denial of service
attacks that were hitting them largely

448
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:14,450
DNS and anti-reflection attack speaking
about a hundred and fifty gigabits per

449
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:15,149
second

450
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:20,510
pretty standard stuff stuff that today
you know we see probably on a monthly

451
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:25,390
basis at least it was large enough there
were like wow they really piss someone

452
00:39:25,390 --> 00:39:29,470
off we had no idea what was in store for
us

453
00:39:29,470 --> 00:39:35,890
originally it was going to be awesome in
Google actually helping protect vote and

454
00:39:35,890 --> 00:39:40,770
the FBI folks had brought in addition
called project shield which is a project

455
00:39:40,770 --> 00:39:45,080
under Google's per view that is similar
to CloudFlare does the office protection

456
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:48,848
is very similar to project Galileo where
does it for non-profit organizations

457
00:39:48,849 --> 00:39:54,270
unfortunate that Google team with a
little more politically savvy than we

458
00:39:54,270 --> 00:39:58,480
are and you just how big this attack was
going to be and at the last minute said

459
00:39:58,480 --> 00:40:03,980
we're not actually prepared to to do
this so you're on your own

460
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:08,680
that's the point at which we sort of got
scared

461
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:14,000
to make matters worse the public people
decided that you know because there

462
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,599
might be some sort of of outage that
they would extend the vote from three

463
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:22,859
days to 10 days that was the point at
which my ops team almost killed me

464
00:40:22,859 --> 00:40:28,680
Thursday night 19th of June in San
Francisco the 20th Jun Yin in in hong

465
00:40:28,680 --> 00:40:32,049
kong we actually brought cots in for a
team to sleep in the office because some

466
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:35,579
people had made us aware that this might
be a fairly large attack we ordered

467
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:41,250
Chinese food can be thought of as ironic
and and we waited for the attack in

468
00:40:41,250 --> 00:40:45,300
about an hour before the voting was
supposed to start the attacks started

469
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:51,589
about a hundred gigs a DNS reflection an
additional 300 gigs of NTP reflection a

470
00:40:51,589 --> 00:40:55,940
large later for attack with sinn floods
of a hundred million packets per second

471
00:40:55,940 --> 00:41:02,470
the really nasty park there were some
the layer 7 attacks boring HTTP flood

472
00:41:02,470 --> 00:41:08,868
there's a really interesting HTTPS
attack where they actually picked safer

473
00:41:08,869 --> 00:41:12,210
suites that were particularly
computationally intensive for us to

474
00:41:12,210 --> 00:41:16,470
resolve and a whole bunch of requested
that and I was like wow there's some

475
00:41:16,470 --> 00:41:21,480
smart people on the other side it was
really easy to defeat though he just

476
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:26,200
turned the cipher suite off the really
scary when there was the DNS floods

477
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:32,129
where we were getting over 250 million
valid DNS queries per second from

478
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:37,799
spoofed IP addresses that were being
request for Papa Doc prom and I was

479
00:41:37,799 --> 00:41:44,000
challenging for a couple of reasons one
was no way to really filter out you can

480
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:48,500
tell without a valid or invalid request
and so you can't separate those out the

481
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:52,640
other thing that was particularly
pernicious was a lot of the upstream DNS

482
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:56,670
resolvers saw this as an attack against
their infrastructure so they shut them

483
00:41:56,670 --> 00:41:57,099
down

484
00:41:57,099 --> 00:42:02,410
upstream from us so even if we were have
the capability to be able to respond to

485
00:42:02,410 --> 00:42:05,899
the attacks at this volume the upstream
providers would keep them offline and

486
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:10,230
they're still upstream providers in in
certain regions I was just in the UK and

487
00:42:10,230 --> 00:42:16,089
you still to this day can't resolve papo
DHA on Virgin's network because they

488
00:42:16,089 --> 00:42:19,369
just shut down the ability for it to
respond as well to give you some sense

489
00:42:19,369 --> 00:42:21,660
it was a hundred and twenty eight gigs

490
00:42:21,660 --> 00:42:27,368
just DNS requests coming into our
network all of which were were valid it

491
00:42:27,369 --> 00:42:33,410
was great to work with the teams at
OpenDNS who was here and and again has a

492
00:42:33,410 --> 00:42:37,750
really smart team that we work closely
with and then also a Google DNS we're

493
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:42,619
able to sideload into them with the
updated requests were make sure that

494
00:42:42,619 --> 00:42:46,500
they would continue to resolve that and
the papo team on the ground in hong kong

495
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:56,920
worked with these teams to to be able to
to do this what so just to give you some

496
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:00,250
sense this is sort of a graph of what
the attack looked like before we stepped

497
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:04,400
in it was like everything hitting Hong
Kong and it all basically went away from

498
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:10,109
hong kong I'll hit Oscars were based on
the USS what people didn't know at the

499
00:43:10,109 --> 00:43:18,990
time was first of all you know we'll be
able to stay online and we're very proud

500
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:25,009
of the fact that we were able to keep
this 3 customer on line 44 10 days there

501
00:43:25,010 --> 00:43:28,609
is voting 24 7 throughout it over a
million people voted in the referendum

502
00:43:28,609 --> 00:43:33,440
and you know that's culminated in the
protest the continued to go on in hong

503
00:43:33,440 --> 00:43:39,069
kong to this day and what wasn't clear
from the outside world was at the same

504
00:43:39,069 --> 00:43:47,150
time that we were defending this we're
also working with China to build data

505
00:43:47,150 --> 00:43:54,190
centers across mainland China and that
was really complicated and there was a

506
00:43:54,190 --> 00:44:01,670
point in time at which the the
partnerships that we had struck two to

507
00:44:01,670 --> 00:44:04,150
put this on line

508
00:44:04,150 --> 00:44:09,579
and and build those facilities online
which are now online

509
00:44:09,579 --> 00:44:13,940
led a partnership was really at risk
because of that and then that was a real

510
00:44:13,940 --> 00:44:17,910
threat not only to us but to our
business and what was it was pretty

511
00:44:17,910 --> 00:44:24,759
pretty compelling and surprising was the
thing that finally won the day was we

512
00:44:24,760 --> 00:44:30,369
convinced rightfully so the
organizations that were there were upset

513
00:44:30,369 --> 00:44:36,220
with us and and they were pretty upset
this was a Beijing newspaper that

514
00:44:36,220 --> 00:44:41,140
alleged that cloud for was a front for
the CIA just like Daniel Brandt and the

515
00:44:41,140 --> 00:44:47,490
club for watch guys finally convince
them that this wasn't political this

516
00:44:47,490 --> 00:44:51,649
wasn't saying this content is good or
bad this was an awesome endorsing yet

517
00:44:51,650 --> 00:44:55,539
this was simply doing what we said we
would do which is why I keep content

518
00:44:55,539 --> 00:44:59,559
online and what was interesting was one
anonymous actually turned around and

519
00:44:59,559 --> 00:45:02,789
tried to attack the hong kong government
the hong kong government became a

520
00:45:02,789 --> 00:45:08,869
customer as well and we protected them
from from attacks and so when we get

521
00:45:08,869 --> 00:45:14,770
criticism for sites which are on our
network what I hope that you'll bear in

522
00:45:14,770 --> 00:45:21,029
mind cuz undoubtedly there is something
that uses our network that you hate when

523
00:45:21,029 --> 00:45:24,190
I hope you'll bear in mind is that the
stakes in this or are higher than you

524
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:30,539
think if we hadn't made determinations
of kicking things off before it would

525
00:45:30,539 --> 00:45:35,180
have been much more difficult to have
the position that we are actually just

526
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:39,500
this neutral third party and the minute
that we start down that path there is a

527
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:44,089
slippery slope to a place where we are
the ones making that determination on

528
00:45:44,089 --> 00:45:48,599
what is good and what is bad and so
instead we think of ourselves again as

529
00:45:48,599 --> 00:45:51,819
is switzerland we think of ourselves as
that neutral party and nobody really

530
00:45:51,819 --> 00:45:55,779
likes the Swiss but they respect them
and I hope that that's kind of the place

531
00:45:55,779 --> 00:46:01,299
that we're at as well nobody really
likes us but I hope that you respect us

532
00:46:01,299 --> 00:46:06,160
you respect that our positions are
consistent and that we're gonna follow

533
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:10,980
what we think of as due process we're
going to hand off the decisions on what

534
00:46:10,980 --> 00:46:14,770
it we're allowed to do what we're not
allowed to do to the legislative

535
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:22,090
judicial the democratically instituted
policies that you all have chosen to say

536
00:46:22,090 --> 00:46:26,220
you're the ones that are are making that
determination and not simply my whims

537
00:46:26,220 --> 00:46:29,980
because I wake up one morning and decide
that you know having sex with dinosaurs

538
00:46:29,980 --> 00:46:35,690
is really gross that's fundamentally is
what we think of as building trust and

539
00:46:35,690 --> 00:46:38,300
that's what we're going to continue to
do and it doesn't win any popularity

540
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:41,490
contests but I think it's really
important and as more of the

541
00:46:41,490 --> 00:46:45,259
infrastructure of the Internet
consolidates behind fewer and fewer

542
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:51,050
players when I'm thinking about who I'm
going to use for my infrastructure I'm

543
00:46:51,050 --> 00:46:55,320
thinking more about how can I know that
you actually trust that organization how

544
00:46:55,320 --> 00:47:01,440
can I know that it's that the policies
are going to be consistent over time so

545
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:07,240
I've only left five minutes for
questions and it's working but if you

546
00:47:07,240 --> 00:47:10,479
have any questions happy to answer them
and if you'll just go to one of the

547
00:47:10,480 --> 00:47:14,160
microphones we can take it from there
spent thank you thank you all for coming

548
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:21,950
in and

549
00:47:21,950 --> 00:47:43,609
we don't have a lot of respect for their
legal system don't align with Western

550
00:47:43,609 --> 00:47:50,078
morals so the first so we have two
different challenges there so 11

551
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:56,040
challenge is we run an infrastructure
that has presence in a lot of locations

552
00:47:56,040 --> 00:48:01,109
around the world and in those locations
locally so for example there is certain

553
00:48:01,109 --> 00:48:05,680
content that we cannot announce from
inside China and that's the rules and we

554
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:09,700
will follow that rule for our
infrastructure that is located inside of

555
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:14,669
china and we do that in other regions
where their particular regulations but

556
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:18,740
that doesn't mean that one country
should have the ability to it's

557
00:48:18,740 --> 00:48:23,720
impossible for any one country two then
dictate what is or is not on the

558
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:31,270
Internet in as as a whole and so when we
do get process from you know any country

559
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:34,480
that is outside the United States there
actually is a process in the united

560
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:39,480
states where that court's order can be
affirmed by the courts inside the united

561
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:43,380
states and if it goes through that
process then we'll follow what the you

562
00:48:43,380 --> 00:48:50,220
escort says but basically if you know we
recently had a brazilian whore sent in

563
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:54,029
order to us there's a very established
procedure about how to Brazilian Court

564
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:57,930
communicates up to a USB cord was around
an intellectual property dispute that

565
00:48:57,930 --> 00:49:01,569
relate to us and we complied with the
order because it then ultimately came

566
00:49:01,569 --> 00:49:05,829
from aus court process in place we're
not having to reinvent the wheel

567
00:49:05,829 --> 00:49:10,339
we're just gonna follow what that that
process is from what our home country is

568
00:49:10,339 --> 00:49:14,240
and then in the regions that we operate
in around the world will make regional

569
00:49:14,240 --> 00:49:19,109
policy decisions about what content can
actually live in that region itself

570
00:49:19,109 --> 00:49:25,400
so during the keynote and during your
speech you mentioned that centralization

571
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:29,640
is becoming a bigger so I was wondering
if you given any thought to the

572
00:49:29,640 --> 00:49:34,489
innovations occurring with block chain
technologies and the decentralisation of

573
00:49:34,489 --> 00:49:42,359
these services and if so what are your
thoughts on that so so I i'm kind of up

574
00:49:42,359 --> 00:49:48,130
to mind on this one on one hand you know
if I put on my serve CEO of club where

575
00:49:48,130 --> 00:49:52,940
the centralization the internets great
because you know you're ultimately going

576
00:49:52,940 --> 00:49:57,170
to use CloudFlare or something like us
and and and we're basically be one of

577
00:49:57,170 --> 00:50:00,739
the only organizations that is going to
be able to protect you if I take off my

578
00:50:00,739 --> 00:50:04,660
CEO Robert Hatton I put on my just
citizen of the internet scares the

579
00:50:04,660 --> 00:50:10,430
living shit out of me because it puts an
enormous amount of power in a much

580
00:50:10,430 --> 00:50:16,440
smaller set of hands and and I just and
I just worry I see internally the

581
00:50:16,440 --> 00:50:20,210
debates around China for us it was a
hard debate it was a debate that we went

582
00:50:20,210 --> 00:50:24,700
to our Board said are we willing to
stand on our principles if it means we

583
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:30,078
lose access to you know this is gonna be
largest internet market the world and

584
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:33,489
you know the answer the answer was you
know again we're not there's no

585
00:50:33,489 --> 00:50:37,539
principle is simply that we're not
picking who the good guys and bad guys

586
00:50:37,539 --> 00:50:43,609
are and we will sort of take all of that
and if it means that that's how to do

587
00:50:43,609 --> 00:50:49,848
but it's you know it's tricky in terms
of technologies and I'd love anything

588
00:50:49,849 --> 00:50:55,809
that could better decentralize the
internet I think that and and i think

589
00:50:55,809 --> 00:51:01,700
that the the tends to be this sort of
sine wave where we go from consolidation

590
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:07,180
to dispersion consolidation dispersion
consolidation wave but you know I'm

591
00:51:07,180 --> 00:51:12,410
hopeful that there will be technology
that comes out at some point that makes

592
00:51:12,410 --> 00:51:16,609
it so that you don't have to rely on
Cloud flat as a citizen of the internet

593
00:51:16,609 --> 00:51:21,538
I'm hopeful that we we do have a way of
dispersing that technology the challenge

594
00:51:21,539 --> 00:51:26,130
though is it's really tough to stop
without a giant

595
00:51:26,130 --> 00:51:33,680
network in a terabit per second detox
attack and and Sol Intel we fix the

596
00:51:33,680 --> 00:51:37,269
problems that allow those types of
attacks to happen it's going to be it's

597
00:51:37,269 --> 00:51:41,229
going to be challenging and then network
effects a really powerful economies of

598
00:51:41,230 --> 00:51:45,210
scale a really powerful and so that
that's what's going to force a lot of

599
00:51:45,210 --> 00:51:53,779
this consolidation but I do think it's a
risk in the cortical poisons to the

600
00:51:53,779 --> 00:51:56,519
Chinese consider following on tibet
etcetera

601
00:51:56,519 --> 00:52:02,399
case you add content that has been from
one of the list let's say groups where

602
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:06,160
they have asked you here you cannot put
this up on your facilities inside China

603
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:11,269
but yet you are hosting or protecting
China and what it represents a new

604
00:52:11,269 --> 00:52:12,819
challenge for you they say

605
00:52:12,819 --> 00:52:17,109
comply with us inside China which I'm
assuming you do right but then you

606
00:52:17,109 --> 00:52:20,440
likely know but it's only data center
somewhere else soon wanna keep having it

607
00:52:20,440 --> 00:52:23,819
and then would they may be potentially
turn their own state sponsored resources

608
00:52:23,819 --> 00:52:25,549
against that

609
00:52:25,549 --> 00:52:29,890
to try to take it down as a customer
just use it as a presenting challenges

610
00:52:29,890 --> 00:52:37,720
so so that's so I have 0 minutes left
and that is a very did the structure

611
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:42,200
that we had dinner into in order in
order to have infrastructure that we can

612
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:47,680
use in in Chinese is is complicated the
short answer is that has no operations

613
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:52,618
in China we partner with somebody that
is in China and were able to then extend

614
00:52:52,619 --> 00:52:56,569
our network on their network but it is
their determination on whether content

615
00:52:56,569 --> 00:52:59,460
is allowed to be on that network are not
allowed to be on our network and we have

616
00:52:59,460 --> 00:53:03,720
no influence over over that because
again we should be determining what is

617
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:06,808
allowed and not allowed in China is
we're not the experts in that as well

618
00:53:06,809 --> 00:53:10,930
and so we've handed that off to an
organization that's there what's

619
00:53:10,930 --> 00:53:15,899
important though is that what's allowed
or not allowed in any region whether

620
00:53:15,900 --> 00:53:16,620
it's China

621
00:53:16,620 --> 00:53:22,250
or the USS for the UK and frankly we
have a lot more problems with internet

622
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:26,350
restrictions coming out of the UK right
now than almost anywhere else on earth

623
00:53:26,350 --> 00:53:33,660
more southern China that is that is a
that is a determination that that should

624
00:53:33,660 --> 00:53:37,620
be made in that in that local region and
again it's gonna be it will never affect

625
00:53:37,620 --> 00:53:41,940
our network as a whole of all the fact
that region and the loss of life within

626
00:53:41,940 --> 00:53:42,560
that region

627
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:44,620
thank you very much
