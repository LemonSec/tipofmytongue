1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:26,949
recently become selection as soon as you
can see on the street and their lawyers

2
00:00:26,949 --> 00:00:43,610
system virtual machine by her sister and
the kids to this this isn't the number

3
00:00:43,610 --> 00:00:57,460
you hear me speak here so many PC

4
00:00:57,460 --> 00:01:12,010
yes and I i treated for funds I'm a
member of the treaty which is the

5
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:30,009
longest offensive plays drums and rice
and exploit the mostly 2012 exploit also

6
00:01:30,009 --> 00:01:45,619
contribute to security checks to most
notable wanna know him already

7
00:01:45,619 --> 00:01:56,520
GDP supported it happened to you

8
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:10,179
autopsy on the city what is an obvious
problems existing in the gaza to fix it

9
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:21,489
when you come up with an engine for the
next beverages and show you how to

10
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:45,400
appreciate and enjoy it so readers
should consider

11
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:52,560
city of operation

12
00:02:52,560 --> 00:03:18,100
city Germany you need to do it so can
you go on and she

13
00:03:18,100 --> 00:03:31,849
City nice and they were all older lady
has some city workers so they can go

14
00:03:31,849 --> 00:03:34,579
inside

15
00:03:34,580 --> 00:04:25,210
2561 eccentric and actually I know where
they transformed a cult right side so so

16
00:04:25,210 --> 00:05:06,340
so so we gotta go so

17
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:30,400
by the reform to each other for each
gesture to do exactly what this vision

18
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:46,310
of the presidency so he does what it
does is stepping into the memory access

19
00:05:46,310 --> 00:06:29,400
which I said oh yes this is just a part
of life

20
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:44,580
you see 1128 Egyptian there's no place
like it better compete in resolving to

21
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:58,169
get it did appear on the factory

22
00:06:58,169 --> 00:07:22,229
is not easy because a lot of work to do
better understanding of city right but

23
00:07:22,229 --> 00:08:49,800
not in shape and sometimes you have to
do so

24
00:08:49,800 --> 00:09:37,810
he just looks at me she said she just
right

25
00:09:37,810 --> 00:10:02,449
just just just when you see we do you
buy orders told me she'd go the next

26
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:17,850
time he sees a good comeback ok and
that's what is very happy with that

27
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:44,520
because you could see so many programs
are some popular I miss you actually see

28
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:52,079
nothing else which is better but

29
00:10:52,080 --> 00:11:06,970
go no more so with that

30
00:11:06,970 --> 00:11:25,310
why because everybody can see here which
is a Windows

31
00:11:25,310 --> 00:11:55,270
bTW I need so it's not a pricey but I
did find out that she was fast but

32
00:11:55,270 --> 00:12:24,430
that's nothing so everything's so we
breed which one might just be that easy

33
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:45,849
so we had not enough which the popular
11 Monday last ones standing or Windows

34
00:12:45,850 --> 00:12:57,600
next month enjoy it so whatever time you
read this

35
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:29,949
because she was supposed to be allowed
to consume and each day this week a

36
00:13:29,949 --> 00:14:32,370
dozen or so until 2015 2016 don't see
you next go to support you will see you

37
00:14:32,370 --> 00:16:14,070
can go

38
00:16:14,070 --> 00:16:36,630
today so I'm gonna talk to you about our
idea and just when we doing this so just

39
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:48,000
to repeat what we want to have this
feature but we wanted spending yes and

40
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,259
then more just like things

41
00:16:52,259 --> 00:17:02,459
so luckily we learn lessons on that you
know what to do this

42
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:06,658
chatting with meanings

43
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:20,779
existing platforms or existing software
and try to take a month off and the

44
00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:26,559
second thing is that we need to open
source these things so people can get

45
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:34,870
involved and help us to improve the
products so we're looking for various

46
00:17:34,870 --> 00:17:42,908
places barriers and later laters and
something that looked like we haven't

47
00:17:42,909 --> 00:17:47,299
talked about using capstone to view this
thing because john has a very good

48
00:17:47,299 --> 00:17:58,269
disassembler but the thing that has so
hard to you can get in just an hour but

49
00:17:58,269 --> 00:18:12,360
understanding like James how things work
so

50
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:20,029
idea we use you so far

51
00:18:20,029 --> 00:18:25,519
you who don't know about his projects is
open source projects

52
00:18:25,519 --> 00:18:36,029
system simulators he's been around for
more than 10 years involved and is that

53
00:18:36,029 --> 00:18:48,279
it almost every weeks and we look at
these highly active support so in total

54
00:18:48,279 --> 00:18:58,979
week 18 so he set himself apart if you
just run cows in there it was like you

55
00:18:58,979 --> 00:19:14,799
mean that is what they viewed my system
so that I last windows using cross tools

56
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,379
so very good candidate

57
00:19:18,379 --> 00:19:32,539
however as I mentioned system on capping
there is has a Malaysian fall I halls

58
00:19:32,539 --> 00:19:42,460
before all motos memories in its have
some debugging tools that attaches and

59
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:51,409
everything's mix together like spaghetti
so it's quite challenging so why we came

60
00:19:51,409 --> 00:20:01,159
here on those is simply over Q we set up
this have this is the only two that have

61
00:20:01,159 --> 00:20:13,580
on the future that we need to support on
cut it is already in C songwriting ok

62
00:20:13,580 --> 00:20:25,860
accumulator so so happy optimization so
we can make you know I'll teach us well

63
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:37,090
but so are we done can we just take
nothing hours and that's it just for us

64
00:20:37,090 --> 00:20:41,220
and that's it

65
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:49,400
know if you ever work on cops at the
eastern states reflecting called and

66
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:55,680
taking out things you problems so we
need a lot of teacher do we need to

67
00:20:55,680 --> 00:21:02,350
understand the court and if you look at
their causes like premiums live called

68
00:21:02,350 --> 00:21:10,699
affiliation challenges we want to solve
so let me list some of the most

69
00:21:10,700 --> 00:21:17,300
challenging problem that we found a way
to UConn on top of you sort of first

70
00:21:17,300 --> 00:21:27,990
challenge is that as I mentioned it says
everything in there and the thing that's

71
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:39,950
we won only actually this Brett whats
can see we want that on top of it and

72
00:21:39,950 --> 00:21:49,380
some component that can help us to
emulate the memory access somewhere so

73
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:53,500
I'll chop is that we want to keep this
accumulation caught and remove

74
00:21:53,500 --> 00:22:00,900
everything else we understand on the
courts and just take our time and

75
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:07,020
hopefully the part of the Mannings easy
to understand and easy to work with

76
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:15,400
we need to keep the support or services
that they have already really deep

77
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:23,650
inside the objects rating some

78
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:30,160
and then we need to realize some of the
competence to keep this component why

79
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:38,250
because we want to update to upstream
pushes him whenever it released a new

80
00:22:38,250 --> 00:22:48,490
russians like whenever you want to fix
it as well and on the other hand anybody

81
00:22:48,490 --> 00:22:57,700
that we file free weekend report
upstream and then how to fix a second

82
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:08,560
challenge that setup emulators behalf
but they compiled into individual winery

83
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:17,460
expiry can only be used to similar when
I get that yes this is my time so you

84
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:24,590
have no way to and related so what we
want is that as we have one to have a

85
00:23:24,590 --> 00:23:33,110
single API a framework that can support
and we should allow the user to choose

86
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:39,590
what they want in the court just like
UPS Store just put into McFly's Legwand

87
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:51,790
is only if this is the case is very
simple like you have just a bunch of

88
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:57,860
minority you don't know what does what I
want to run on just run them later on

89
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:07,479
different art and see what they do so we
isolated also because Kim you have only

90
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:16,860
very rarely use variables everywhere
these reviews everywhere so this is not

91
00:24:16,860 --> 00:24:22,179
good because it's not trust you just run
the moon stunned just reuse the global

92
00:24:22,180 --> 00:24:31,650
state and so we isolate this bible
scripture to ensure

93
00:24:31,650 --> 00:24:41,160
our API design also allows woodwinds
tons of unique honest and Tom so you

94
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:46,960
can't just bought a lot of threatening
Unicom's of you can't get in front

95
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:53,660
awning stunned that animal if you're not
in a seminary also we modified immune

96
00:24:53,660 --> 00:24:54,740
systems

97
00:24:54,740 --> 00:25:08,090
turkey Collins is that you move has no
intimidation sure it has but it's come

98
00:25:08,090 --> 00:25:16,360
as a state that is that if you want to
some judges you have to at the airport

99
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:22,889
at times at the Accord and then they
will compile into the boundary from but

100
00:25:22,890 --> 00:25:30,150
you can also choose optimized

101
00:25:30,150 --> 00:25:40,780
on the chicks chicks that is like do
that the eliminations things so if we

102
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:51,260
just injections and then clean it out
will be able to do so in this aspect we

103
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:59,610
try our German this latest threat you
support like single step we support

104
00:25:59,610 --> 00:26:03,810
interment a non-member assets like
Britain dry you can text whenever the

105
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:11,659
memories treated rice and come back we
can change the dynamic clear front amps

106
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:17,590
relation times and we also be able to
handle exceptions like interrupt some

107
00:26:17,590 --> 00:26:27,490
call if the men will call them and set
up to execute the system can capture it

108
00:26:27,490 --> 00:26:39,840
out and execute challenge here is that
leaking memory at like crazy so when we

109
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:44,060
look at a cost you say ok this building
was opened by law

110
00:26:44,060 --> 00:26:49,159
there's no clothes dismal free so if you
just run the simple one right over him

111
00:26:49,160 --> 00:26:55,100
use tons of memory leak but this is my
fault tunes as a team you because you

112
00:26:55,100 --> 00:27:00,860
just run it once and then just caused it
and that's it

113
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:06,070
framework we need to fix it because we
want the user to be able to run the ball

114
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:11,919
times and maybe stay in the memory for a
long time and running on a mine was

115
00:27:11,920 --> 00:27:19,610
passing so we need to fix so we also do
you know and we also reflects on the

116
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:25,449
subsystem so we can keep track of this
point where they sell offs and clean up

117
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:37,740
3.0 when we should do so to summarize we
fought him you but we already own it has

118
00:27:37,740 --> 00:27:41,290
become an independent dreamworks

119
00:27:41,290 --> 00:27:44,620
small size

120
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:52,719
all right now we have to 2,000 2,200
thousand lab coat is lightweight memory

121
00:27:52,720 --> 00:28:01,800
just keep it clean up the memory can use
multiple are sometimes has to face all

122
00:28:01,800 --> 00:28:07,409
combinations and we can call our own
copy can be on top of it

123
00:28:07,410 --> 00:28:17,250
more distant to exploit nation's most
likely say but because what we feel our

124
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:24,680
practice that there's a lot of
PlayStation on a CBS but one of them is

125
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:34,750
340 part where you assume you have you
later as she is never a spot on the

126
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:45,450
other hand Sipi you can drive unit test
test test you can put it on her out

127
00:28:45,450 --> 00:28:56,200
nowadays so it's very friendly so now I
passed back to

128
00:28:56,200 --> 00:29:08,389
so you have to write ok so we have right
now we want to view your own and have

129
00:29:08,389 --> 00:29:17,760
set up by the way you can create and
easy to understand and the card in the

130
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:27,549
card provides a PNC so i cant open close
you can start and stop immigration you

131
00:29:27,549 --> 00:29:42,760
can start a mission in until you can try
and do it happen and you can turn a

132
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:44,820
certain number

133
00:29:44,820 --> 00:30:06,750
Jackson and they pay you to try to do
now so you can find some

134
00:30:06,750 --> 00:30:26,690
and his head down and have some API so
can you find out so you can teach each

135
00:30:26,690 --> 00:30:41,990
level you can do so by the protagonist
can use up to

136
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:57,530
so I just have to see open to initialize
the engine so here you can see that I

137
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:09,580
want to have an engine for 32 bit right
let you see map map

138
00:31:09,580 --> 00:31:23,678
inside britain at the UC member I can
use to try to call you want to do you

139
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:32,150
see break right you can be you can use
to try some believe the resistor and

140
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:34,620
finally you can start ammunition

141
00:31:34,620 --> 00:31:50,520
you see here for you I can done I decide
to get my car and I don't care about the

142
00:31:50,520 --> 00:32:05,010
motion to 1960 after that after that we
finish aggression out all dressed up

143
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:22,460
with you selected has that been out and
have a duty to consider can't it

144
00:32:22,460 --> 00:32:49,680
but britain is part of which shot so I
actually sick to go to be a memory after

145
00:32:49,680 --> 00:33:03,370
that I set up the resistor yeah I set up
and this one stop until this is it

146
00:33:03,370 --> 00:33:50,689
finally I read all the rest is finally a
little memory

147
00:33:50,690 --> 00:34:02,440
his ownership of go in a pattern so here
the parameter 1 bunch fresh and I don't

148
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:11,210
know what it's for sure somebody's
another question is how to know what

149
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:17,560
this so called us so the idea that
inspire you to write a script and here

150
00:34:17,560 --> 00:34:34,159
you can see that I show before I dishes
nice my computer memory riser shackled

151
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:44,350
to memory after that I set up the SP is
the apartment somewhere that I really

152
00:34:44,350 --> 00:34:50,380
something which is already setup and
after that because she'll go to some

153
00:34:50,380 --> 00:35:02,710
cases interpreting so I need to
interrupt so I can get when they dropped

154
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:13,220
so see what you try to do and I
transmission so you can see here what my

155
00:35:13,220 --> 00:35:23,839
topic

156
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:38,550
function for functions that is the
functional number of interest defiance

157
00:35:38,550 --> 00:35:47,960
site so I can when I had to drop as a
yes here so and change it from shall

158
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:58,530
find system went to function is simple
to do something right so now here I show

159
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:12,070
you what I don't escape which I to
emulate shoko see you can see here that

160
00:36:12,070 --> 00:36:20,550
this approach I to criticize negotiate
and connected somewhere some machine

161
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:33,930
somewhere on the internet this arrest 1
2011 about 12345 and after that it had

162
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:46,640
disappeared and after that it's shoko
opened and next out everything which is

163
00:36:46,640 --> 00:37:00,330
everything is possible and finally my
toes financial which is a subject which

164
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:07,759
means China to write the content of
pacify

165
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:18,780
and you can send it to somewhere so this
should try to instill positive I said it

166
00:37:18,780 --> 00:37:25,100
so you can see that

167
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:31,940
sleazy to go and see what you think a
three-shot additional script using pipe

168
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:43,040
is it better so you can say that I can
skip the same year ago I can just roll

169
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:50,920
ida go and see what's this chakra was
not a simple because you just go sell

170
00:37:50,920 --> 00:38:00,870
what if I could show which the ship open
the front entrance to the court that you

171
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:12,480
cannot just chose a simple inside
because I doubt she'll go only thing but

172
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:23,140
in this case we really should go so we
can see what happens I don't have a

173
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:59,830
problem and also the initial state in
eighty 64 bit and assets to emulate that

174
00:38:59,830 --> 00:39:12,230
put an end it's on like the ending
values so a lot of teams played this

175
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:24,300
challenge and they have some things you
have so a lot of pride up they just you

176
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:32,980
know they try to hear in this particular
case they put it simply caught

177
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:43,490
and then run that God and is also so
when I played instructions what I do is

178
00:39:43,490 --> 00:39:52,720
I find this x86 machines I try some GB
script and then I changed during the

179
00:39:52,720 --> 00:40:00,230
meantime in and let it run for wise but
during the times we already starting to

180
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:09,650
use so I decided to try some coding
unicorn that dosent things but thinks

181
00:40:09,650 --> 00:40:17,440
more to it if you just the same thing as
being too us we initialize memory map it

182
00:40:17,440 --> 00:40:29,480
provided to us by challans tried to set
up a stock's to press and then finally

183
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:51,060
just so let's just so so it is this was
a mall on the consoles is not very

184
00:40:51,060 --> 00:41:02,830
intuitive to say soar to rise when
caught so we we we got in there and see

185
00:41:02,830 --> 00:41:09,460
the best guys that Brian and in the
process and try to get caught in the

186
00:41:09,460 --> 00:41:15,780
process you know this play things during
you know you can clearly see how to

187
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:21,510
reach the change that's Rico so we just
want to make something similar and I

188
00:41:21,510 --> 00:41:32,119
just write a tough couple days ago and
hopefully work ok so which are using the

189
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:39,640
fate that has to be on top of capstone
to discipline assembly so let me put

190
00:41:39,640 --> 00:42:05,519
some coding

191
00:42:05,519 --> 00:42:15,399
we can assemble record year for you to
say what the cause is very simple you

192
00:42:15,399 --> 00:42:25,219
just move some values to restore to the
stacks with back to an album together so

193
00:42:25,219 --> 00:42:35,130
we just think was a bit you can see this
injunction move 123 star RCX chance here

194
00:42:35,130 --> 00:42:42,239
There I P also change the next junction
with 37 as you can see it highlight it

195
00:42:42,239 --> 00:43:07,809
and we just had and finally at I changed
at runtime cause supported by Unicon

196
00:43:07,809 --> 00:44:08,840
example in this case I X and IBX too so
we have to do more with Sam as well

197
00:44:08,840 --> 00:44:24,470
other PC is always so so the same idea
across

198
00:44:24,470 --> 00:44:29,939
pictures we can also memory here but I'm
like of time so that's it for them or

199
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:42,690
things so quickly go to be a nap and
then we go to the questions so right now

200
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:56,480
to stop this is that we support 871
biting space on him you two countries so

201
00:44:56,480 --> 00:45:01,600
that we want to support on the rest of
the team you support we have to run on

202
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:07,569
how to move both Imperial to disappear
fast we want to stripping out more than

203
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:14,360
Kim you example we want to improve their
assembler maybe some depression with

204
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:23,470
capstone sport we want more biting this
is promised by community has cups on we

205
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:28,779
want to synchronize with 14 when its
release and deployment that the future

206
00:45:28,780 --> 00:45:37,660
consequat ante because people still can
use so conclusion here's a summary of

207
00:45:37,660 --> 00:45:41,029
our unique on frameworks

208
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:47,029
we're serious about a meeting time to
these projects and make it the best so

209
00:45:47,029 --> 00:45:55,069
we hope that we can have how from the
community just like that song and we we

210
00:45:55,069 --> 00:46:03,249
can make this become the best and on the
other hand also benefit from it they can

211
00:46:03,249 --> 00:46:09,279
we can report upstream singing to court
and make it the bath system increases so

212
00:46:09,279 --> 00:46:39,619
does this fall

213
00:46:39,619 --> 00:46:57,439
yes oh yeah ok so you know how you
initialize it with 32 bit 64 bit

214
00:46:57,439 --> 00:47:14,828
the shellcode like mixed mode we're yes
sir when you're on your map you don't

215
00:47:14,829 --> 00:47:20,689
appear to support memory page
permissions is it supported do you

216
00:47:20,689 --> 00:47:25,549
intend to support it can you generate
faults you try to execute out of a not

217
00:47:25,549 --> 00:47:26,969
execute page and so on

218
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:36,819
yes this family is very soon when we
leave this because I Q U has system for

219
00:47:36,819 --> 00:47:42,219
handling the missions we just used only
for one so we can change it and what

220
00:47:42,219 --> 00:47:46,969
your process for making sure you say
synchronize with all the QEMU changes go

221
00:47:46,969 --> 00:47:52,130
on just constantly coming through their
badges and pulled him over at work how

222
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:52,690
long

223
00:47:52,690 --> 00:48:27,579
executions and you get to a point where
you can just leader register undefined

224
00:48:27,579 --> 00:48:34,650
and then operations happened in that
register you repeat question everything

225
00:48:34,650 --> 00:48:36,500
I've seen here

226
00:48:36,500 --> 00:48:43,140
executions you give registers about you
and then you run yes do you have in mind

227
00:48:43,140 --> 00:48:47,000
well do you have any plans to implement
some kind of symbolic execution in this

228
00:48:47,000 --> 00:49:01,990
so instead of giving it a value just as
it should be because it is so we don't

229
00:49:01,990 --> 00:49:18,529
tend to do that is ok but yeah a lot of
a percent yeah

230
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:30,850
hello i'm asking about to text you
emulate secure side effects like this

231
00:49:30,850 --> 00:49:40,890
performance counter the computation so
because now we just gotta give you tell

232
00:49:40,890 --> 00:49:50,279
us what if you lou has so he doesn't do
what you want that but does its place I

233
00:49:50,280 --> 00:50:00,770
think that you can do and see what we
should do so yeah so what is the problem

234
00:50:00,770 --> 00:50:05,170
you see you be future

235
00:50:05,170 --> 00:50:17,650
hi do you exposing your API the ability
to set the length of the instruction

236
00:50:17,650 --> 00:50:38,560
decoding pipeline so so far only allow
you to form or you can see how we gonna

237
00:50:38,560 --> 00:50:44,600
stand up but so far no thank you

238
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:48,819
but because it should be open

239
00:50:48,820 --> 00:50:57,900
extent we do whatever I want to state
that is suitable or we can put it back

240
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:08,720
as I can

241
00:51:08,720 --> 00:51:23,910
all questions asked where you could get
a chance to have some so we want to just

242
00:51:23,910 --> 00:51:38,339
so officially opened up so you can have
your to test us on the street and get

243
00:51:38,340 --> 00:51:46,240
back to me and asked the best choice
this officially released to the public

244
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:55,819
and just license

245
00:51:55,820 --> 00:51:58,250
thank you very much
