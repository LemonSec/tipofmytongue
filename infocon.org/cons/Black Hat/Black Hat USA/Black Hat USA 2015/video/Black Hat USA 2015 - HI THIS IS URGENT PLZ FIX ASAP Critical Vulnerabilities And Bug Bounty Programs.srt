1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,220
due to technical difficulties we are
joining the program already in progress

2
00:00:04,220 --> 00:00:13,649
that's ABC news anymore but it was
pretty fun for a while and I'm back on

3
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:20,189
and behavioral psychology quick agenda
in turn to some data because I mentioned

4
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:26,599
in the Data Analyst will talk about some
critical vulnerability as I've got three

5
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:31,779
new disclosures and three existing bugs
from other programs talked about today

6
00:00:31,779 --> 00:00:38,620
and talk about if you are around the
corner for a boundary you work in your

7
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:44,739
security seen how can you increase your
signal to noise or get through that nora

8
00:00:44,739 --> 00:00:49,718
is faster to find those hired on
volatility he's and basically hi how can

9
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:54,649
you get the most out of a bounty program
do a quick summary of what some called

10
00:00:54,649 --> 00:01:01,989
action and then if I don't have time for
questions this talk is not telling you

11
00:01:01,989 --> 00:01:06,110
about pan am NOT going to tell you if
you're ready for among banning what to

12
00:01:06,110 --> 00:01:10,650
consider anonymous writer treaty banning
if you have questions on any of these

13
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:16,520
things please see me after or during
dark on on here all weekend but this is

14
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:21,850
really just gonna stay focused on
critical moment so getting started

15
00:01:21,850 --> 00:01:30,470
let's start off talking about Google
Google has a vulnerability reward

16
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:36,070
program like all their VRG they
published statistics not all the experts

17
00:01:36,070 --> 00:01:41,570
on and this does not include the Android
reward program that was announced this

18
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:45,729
year does not include the patch reward
for around where they're rewarding

19
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:50,179
people for actually writing fixes not
just finding vulnerabilities and it does

20
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:54,900
not include the chrome reward program
what it does include is

21
00:01:54,900 --> 00:02:03,880
google.com youtube.com putlocker.com
Google developed acts and extensions and

22
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:08,758
Google Play iTunes or Chrome Web Store
so there's still a ton of attack surface

23
00:02:08,758 --> 00:02:14,829
there for people to be looking out and
if you look at this heat map I think

24
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:22,730
it's fair to say that less than 20% of
the submissions received cash rewards

25
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:27,820
and this is off of Google's website you
can go take a look at yourselves if

26
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:34,590
you'd like that whole big transaction
authorized end violence admissions in

27
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:40,220
the upper section right size bug filed
no room or does maybe not exploitable

28
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:46,650
bonds that are not security issues they
may be potentially out of scope but

29
00:02:46,650 --> 00:02:52,110
still valid issues that need to be fixed
it's down in the bottom right corner

30
00:02:52,110 --> 00:03:00,050
they use those rewards and there are
what make this entire program worthwhile

31
00:03:00,050 --> 00:03:08,190
for Google so looking at what that
little corner those those rewarded by

32
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:17,850
looks like broken out the majority of
their reported bugs $5,000 for the

33
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:24,370
majority of their payout was done and
$5,000 trunks and so if we're a little

34
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:29,120
conservative and we say they paid out
three hundred thousand dollars in five

35
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:32,790
thousand dollars a time chance that
would be $60 abilities that they felt

36
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:37,400
were important enough to receive their
third highest payoff because if you look

37
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:44,720
down that list about halfway down you'll
see they have some $10,000 abilities and

38
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:52,580
it's a $7,500 pants so they're getting a
lot very important things to fix across

39
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:54,140
their various products

40
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:59,989
and Andrew morning so I think it's fair
to say that number of researchers are

41
00:03:59,990 --> 00:04:07,280
are hitting big money with Google if we
look at additional data about the volume

42
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,360
of submissions that Google's receiving
over time is dropping which is natural

43
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,640
for being found and fixed there's fewer
vulnerabilities in the product

44
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:25,289
additionally Google developers are
learning from things are fixing and in

45
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:26,410
the future

46
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:31,950
you're seeing a trend line drop however
as the trend line drives what happens is

47
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:37,710
you you have to start increasing rewards
shoe is analyzed the researchers to keep

48
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:44,729
looking so I'm Google's own words based
on airs use surveys and this graph we

49
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:48,930
conclude that finding bugs in Google
products is becoming harder overtime

50
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:53,930
forcing the researchers to search for
more complex vulnerabilities and that's

51
00:04:53,930 --> 00:04:58,080
why they various points during their
program increasing rewards to

52
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,700
incentivize those critical signs to
still be found Google publishes some

53
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:08,250
data on the geographic location of their
researchers honestly it's not my

54
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:12,669
favorite way to visualize the Santa but
it gives you an idea of where their

55
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:17,570
researchers are coming from quite a lot
in europe in Brazil

56
00:05:17,570 --> 00:05:28,320
aus Asia so that's a little bit of
Google facebook also has a value and in

57
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,030
their 20 40 report they indicated they
had seventeen thousand and eleven

58
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:36,219
submissions which is a 16 percent
increase over the previous year

59
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:45,210
lot of submissions to go through about
receiving 17,000 bug reports in 365 days

60
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,520
and triaging all of those

61
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:54,389
61 a former high severity now they had
an additional number of Ballard bugs as

62
00:05:54,389 --> 00:06:00,720
well obviously they didn't just have 61
ballot box but they didn't publish that

63
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,280
data points so I can't tell you how many
they have and what their validity rate

64
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,530
of submissions is quite as visually as I
was able to recycle their minimum orders

65
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:12,030
$500

66
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:16,719
even something relatively low severity
has a decent pay out they rewarded

67
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,080
people in 65 countries to 12% increase
year-over-year

68
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:28,318
123 countries reporting bugs so they
have a global virtual test team at their

69
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,319
disposal to go find issues in their
application for them and get paid based

70
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:41,250
on the find so their payouts last year
for Thurs undetermined number of valence

71
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:46,379
emissions out of seventeen thousand or
1.3 million dollars paid out to three

72
00:06:46,379 --> 00:06:50,719
hundred and twenty-one researchers the
average curtail the average reward being

73
00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:57,770
1788 they paid their top five
researchers worldwide a quarter of a

74
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:09,020
million dollars I got her abilities or
massive massive massive quantities of

75
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:14,370
just you know chances are pretty good
those are some important vulnerabilities

76
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:18,469
and we're actually talk about a couple
of them later that hit the news so if

77
00:07:18,469 --> 00:07:21,729
you look at it they they get some
country-by-country date on their top

78
00:07:21,729 --> 00:07:29,650
five countries India are way higher
volume 196 million bucks came from India

79
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:36,650
in 2014 to the Google program placement
program egypt is a mercy with 81 bugs

80
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:47,370
United States hit 61 bucks UK 28-27 but
the stock is not about volume this is

81
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:51,360
about 50 bucks critical bugs critical
bugs

82
00:07:51,360 --> 00:08:00,259
higher what the average pants where in
India habitat was 1343 dollars over

83
00:08:00,259 --> 00:08:09,969
there many as 500 so they're going to
say goodbye and Egypt 1222 you ask 2004

84
00:08:09,969 --> 00:08:14,710
earn seventy so they're getting higher
severity of a lower number of

85
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:20,159
submissions in the USA UK does even
better the Philippines is down around

86
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:29,289
$1,000 for bug this totals out in those
five countries $619,000 that's only 48

87
00:08:29,289 --> 00:08:35,630
percent of their total spent last year
so they got a lot of good valid bugs to

88
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:43,820
go facts and several of those sixty-plus
bombs were were critical or severe get

89
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:48,899
her started a program last year and they
celebrated their one-year anniversary

90
00:08:48,899 --> 00:09:01,339
they had in 2014 73 vulnerabilities
facts out of 1920 submissions

91
00:09:01,339 --> 00:09:07,990
I figured out that's 3.8 percent of the
total submissions got fixed they don't

92
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:15,010
published on the criticality volatility
is so I don't have any data to share

93
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:18,930
with you that how many of them were
higher in value but they had 33

94
00:09:18,930 --> 00:09:24,180
researchers aren't $50,000 in their
program and at the end of the first year

95
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:32,019
they doubled their maximum increase that
now I should your previous chart showed

96
00:09:32,019 --> 00:09:35,019
that the Google submissions were
dropping over time as they were

97
00:09:35,019 --> 00:09:39,170
increasing their payouts and you think
after only one year and I get her brazen

98
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:45,649
their pants does their submissions drop
this is a really standard sort of

99
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:50,089
distribution for abounding program about
your program is new you seriously hi

100
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:56,560
spike and then it tapers off the nice
thing about this is you see we continue

101
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:02,209
to get vulnerabilities throughout the
year I spoke with the same likely to be

102
00:10:02,209 --> 00:10:06,089
relaxing around the bug bounty program
there and he told me they had some

103
00:10:06,089 --> 00:10:11,050
critical terrible didn't come in until
six to eight months into the program

104
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:16,529
took a little time to find them discover
the right person concept so they come in

105
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:21,069
every time so it's not necessarily in
the first 48 hours you're going to see

106
00:10:21,069 --> 00:10:31,099
the entire Earth burned below your
application they do Microsoft game

107
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,839
they're doing it a little differently
and they don't publish any data on the

108
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:41,100
volume of submissions for their
Valentines they have an online services

109
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:48,699
for office 365 and I'm sure they have 46
reported submissions but they only

110
00:10:48,699 --> 00:10:54,000
started in September 2014 so that's just
getting off the ground and 46 emissions

111
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,420
the reward amount are not published but
you can see a list of who was rewarded

112
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:03,280
and it anywhere from 500 to $15,000
depending on the severity of the

113
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:09,310
vulnerability they have a mitigation
bypass bounty program and the space walk

114
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:14,660
to $100,000 and this is for a novel
exploitation techniques protections

115
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:19,740
built into the operating system so when
you're talking about Google or did have

116
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:25,150
a facebook out whether local
applications you gonna knock my socks

117
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:31,990
you're seeing bounties on a complex
research charities in the operating

118
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:38,010
system on top of that they offer a
bounty 42 cents on top of the medication

119
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:43,310
so if you come up with a novel way to
bypass protection feature in the

120
00:11:43,310 --> 00:11:50,000
operating system that's litigation and
if you also come up with a deep sense

121
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:58,260
approach to fix that you can earn an
additional reward on top of that so with

122
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:01,700
the two different models that got the
online services and the software

123
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:08,190
counties they have some different ways
acknowledge me these things so for

124
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:10,820
either offer values or online services

125
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:14,450
the Hall of Fame indicates you received
a financial reward for your submission

126
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:22,270
in the software's face when the issue
for patch and goes into his security

127
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:27,090
boy's hand and has a CBE associated with
it there's an additional acknowledgement

128
00:12:27,090 --> 00:12:31,830
in the bullets hand with the CBE for
online services you still have the

129
00:12:31,830 --> 00:12:36,340
Holocene they also have an
acknowledgement she age or researchers

130
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:44,490
who submitted an issue that doesn't end
up receiving financial reports

131
00:12:44,490 --> 00:12:50,600
again you've got two different county
models and it may seem like one of those

132
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:54,209
world I kind of things but there's a
very different profiles with the

133
00:12:54,209 --> 00:12:58,899
research you should do the work and so
understanding this is also pretty

134
00:12:58,899 --> 00:13:03,709
interesting as you can see from the
software Cider House most of the

135
00:13:03,709 --> 00:13:09,520
researchers are in North America Asia
again and she is online services and you

136
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:16,670
have a lot of researchers in India and
so that players and you can't so many

137
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:20,500
submissions for India are going to talk
a little bit more later about some of

138
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:25,880
the unique challenges of getting great
high quality submissions from a very

139
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:33,000
diverse global crowd to russia may not
be their first language and and their

140
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:36,260
training maybe a little different than
what we're used to you so we'll talk

141
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:41,990
about that in a little bit just to show
some of the data on the payouts for

142
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:46,399
Microsoft and mitigation bypass category
you see people making anywhere from

143
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:50,560
twenty five thousand you believe the
large commerce hundred and twenty-five

144
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:56,569
thousand and this is some pretty
impressive work and this is all

145
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:04,870
available online so it turns out I have
a lot of data and so I'm gonna share a

146
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:10,350
little bit about some of our customers
we recently released the state of bug

147
00:14:10,350 --> 00:14:15,320
bounty report and we provided a
tremendous amount of data across thirty

148
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:18,329
months of running bug bounties on a
hundred and sixty six different

149
00:14:18,329 --> 00:14:22,579
customers we catalogs thirty-seven
thousand two hundred and twenty-seven

150
00:14:22,579 --> 00:14:27,989
submissions which just under a thousand
of them were not duplicate valid

151
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:36,529
vulnerabilities there were an additional
basically the near $40 emissions close

152
00:14:36,529 --> 00:14:41,370
to 20% were duplicates but their first
to find they're not you

153
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:46,080
findings you still have to handle those
and triage but we had about eight

154
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:53,830
thousand now in volatility is that were
original financially rewarded and that

155
00:14:53,830 --> 00:15:00,150
does not mean that there are only six
3621 that were important enough to

156
00:15:00,150 --> 00:15:04,939
receive money there's a number of bounty
programs that are actually not

157
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:10,420
disclosure programs where they're
providing a framework and and insurance

158
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:14,279
on a service contract the social
contract with the researchers did you

159
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:19,320
find in our product we won't see you
like we will work with you to fix this

160
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,630
we appreciate it

161
00:15:20,630 --> 00:15:24,540
we're going to recognize we're gonna put
on our Hall of Fame maybe we'll send you

162
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:30,310
a t-shirt or some sort of acknowledgment
and the researcher goes into that

163
00:15:30,310 --> 00:15:33,930
project knowing there's no financial
reward but it works on it anyway

164
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:41,540
sometimes their charity programs and so
the nearly $1000 vulnerability is $3600

165
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:47,130
ordered we paid out three quarters of a
million dollars seven hundred and twenty

166
00:15:47,130 --> 00:15:57,730
4839 the actor Gerard was $2.81 but our
top forward was $10,000 hundred and

167
00:15:57,730 --> 00:16:04,670
sixty six programs each one of them got
on average for critical or higher

168
00:16:04,670 --> 00:16:09,079
severity vulnerabilities some of the
mail maybelline 1 I've seen others that

169
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:15,140
cuts well it varies of course depending
on the security of the application but

170
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:22,569
pretty much every program is getting
really critical and we had a total of

171
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:26,170
seven hundred and twenty-nine high
priority and a hundred and seventy-five

172
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:31,390
that were rated as critical
high-priority critical here's an example

173
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:42,130
our what that means is are critical and
so for example in web applications would

174
00:16:42,130 --> 00:16:44,810
be something that allows remote code
execution

175
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:48,569
elevation of privilege you know

176
00:16:48,570 --> 00:16:57,000
injection higher tax has to do with
lateral scripting it's going to affect

177
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:02,120
the security of the platform and
processes so that's what we're talking

178
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:13,720
about talking about higher critical ones
and peaches and finding these box

179
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:20,010
people in this room at this conference
in their free time a freelance they go

180
00:17:20,010 --> 00:17:26,750
home that's not their day job to find
vulnerabilities and Facebook but but

181
00:17:26,750 --> 00:17:31,390
they enjoy it and if so this is
something that they do as a hobby if we

182
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:35,520
get a lot of former developers QA
engineers and I see Adnan's you decide

183
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:40,310
to get into security and get an
application security we see a lot of

184
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:46,050
university students especially in Asia
and Latin America and the Middle East

185
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:54,700
doing self taught and then we have over
18,000 researchers were evaluating and

186
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:59,310
this is what our submissions look like
by geography for the last few quarters

187
00:17:59,310 --> 00:18:09,340
we've got India Pakistan hitting the top
three or so talking about some big bucks

188
00:18:09,340 --> 00:18:18,290
with Google in April 2014 and this
year's carlson down and XXII

189
00:18:18,290 --> 00:18:20,330
vulnerability and production

190
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:26,919
exploited at the Google toolbar button
gallery and they have blogged about it

191
00:18:26,920 --> 00:18:33,120
if they receive to $10,000 payment for
this within 20 minutes report they they

192
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:40,030
fired it up they have to say that you
know maybe we can do something fishy to

193
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:41,940
read what we do this

194
00:18:41,940 --> 00:18:48,990
and his son and Google wrote back like
that they said will hate how much would

195
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:53,990
a cross-site scripting and this is what
Google sent them back they're like this

196
00:18:53,990 --> 00:19:00,389
this is what they they were giving
$10,000 production and it was terrible

197
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:07,668
so far County incentivize them to go
looking for something that they reported

198
00:19:07,669 --> 00:19:16,600
to Google to get fixed Facebook you know
1.3 million dollars and pants well

199
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:25,629
received $35,000 for report involving
OpenID he had found a vulnerability in

200
00:19:25,629 --> 00:19:30,610
OpenID sometime earlier and reported it

201
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:40,350
OpenID and and other folks hey I want
two suspects this book edited and if it

202
00:19:40,350 --> 00:19:42,879
hadn't been resolved

203
00:19:42,879 --> 00:19:50,509
hacker could have used you abusing
easily change Facebook's gmail is an

204
00:19:50,509 --> 00:19:55,929
OpenID provider to pretty much whatever
they want it so obviously Facebook

205
00:19:55,929 --> 00:20:01,450
jumped on top of that got it fixed
quickly gave Reginaldo a significant

206
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:09,940
reward and made sure to blog about it
and and receive the attention that

207
00:20:09,940 --> 00:20:16,269
useful find also had an issue that you
may have heard it out recently

208
00:20:16,269 --> 00:20:20,840
delete any photo album while this isn't
something he's found by running a

209
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:25,870
scanning tool or a Pfizer he was messing
around

210
00:20:25,870 --> 00:20:35,689
deleting his own photo albums using
graphics core access features and when

211
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:43,280
they do more than just delete my heart
to heart of that to Facebook and

212
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:53,389
obviously they fix that as well and
taking her so this is a company called

213
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:59,010
simple simple as an online bank and a
researcher with single runs about County

214
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:05,940
through and I researchers you your name
is darker and his actual name is Peter

215
00:21:05,940 --> 00:21:11,850
reported approximate information
disclosure they fixed it incredibly

216
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:20,428
quickly and let him talk about it

217
00:21:20,429 --> 00:21:29,830
the initial response was the day with a
passion post-production

218
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:37,240
its icy grip the kennedy space in this
presentation screencaps from vs

219
00:21:37,240 --> 00:21:41,399
four-star

220
00:21:41,399 --> 00:21:46,209
just a simple actually using hst yes and
website very quick test 8 well-known

221
00:21:46,210 --> 00:21:48,440
banking institutions

222
00:21:48,440 --> 00:22:02,769
one other side edges yes to review a
process which must complete and I say

223
00:22:02,769 --> 00:22:08,389
mostly as I didn't get this testing
account to capture traffic and I think

224
00:22:08,389 --> 00:22:22,070
that stood out from plants Chester looks
in this week s interesting doctors dose

225
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:33,330
in a strange place if we really don't
chase and you can see this job is to be

226
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:37,178
personalized with quite a lot of
interest nation by number email address

227
00:22:37,179 --> 00:22:44,190
for user everything's here I'm fortunate
however did not appear to be any one

228
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:50,460
time tokens of my medication in returned
out as a result something quick and

229
00:22:50,460 --> 00:23:00,350
dirty jobs cuts in bed in a website will
be enough to access the website contain

230
00:23:00,350 --> 00:23:23,090
discolored or they're off after having
recently looking for simple script as

231
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:31,480
requested by the petition tension and
malicious page and include cookies night

232
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:42,240
a little bit messed up I'm strangely
output this data is accessed let's give

233
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:46,830
it a shot see what happens

234
00:23:46,830 --> 00:23:56,179
all day very successful who are from
here and this page or redirect these are

235
00:23:56,180 --> 00:24:03,380
also as mentioned as presentation simple
shit special issue and removed all sets

236
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:23,630
the script thanks again to simple quick
and easy to report their ok so simple to

237
00:24:23,630 --> 00:24:29,570
Peter here wouldn't have their lineup
for a penthouse contract running about

238
00:24:29,570 --> 00:24:33,980
Manny he was able to go and find that
reported get it fixed and under

239
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:39,990
twenty-four hours for some next up we're
about a petition called Smart cheap

240
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:45,700
online collaboration and productivity
software application and web and mobile

241
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:51,610
applications 65,000 customers in over
six million users their customers

242
00:24:51,610 --> 00:25:00,330
include Google Cisco a smoke Clifford
way to go over any user without any

243
00:25:00,330 --> 00:25:05,280
interaction this was his first
indication is based in the Philippines

244
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:09,850
and run a program launched it was
midnight so he showed up to work on and

245
00:25:09,850 --> 00:25:22,350
he's pretty excited about working on
these things I like sleep but OK

246
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:29,740
elevation of privilege we no user
interaction whatsoever so this was a bug

247
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:34,580
in the import user feature there were
four different user roles there is

248
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:40,780
licensed user system admin admin a
resource problem was there was no check

249
00:25:40,780 --> 00:25:42,530
whether the user who is requesting

250
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:49,910
a privilege so she simply follow the
import process as you would just

251
00:25:49,910 --> 00:26:00,150
everyday but before he hit he fired at
an intercept proxy and what he is and he

252
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:10,080
choose the value of parameter 1 six-term
targeting the numbers they were members

253
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:28,889
imported attacker troll the amount is so
important you see here and murder I

254
00:26:28,890 --> 00:26:33,610
don't have a video of Clifford prefer to
do a write-up I'm trying to make sure

255
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:42,409
you want to the researchers their work
day or possibly tomorrow morning we'll

256
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:52,370
go live and I'll tweet but she had
requested permission and even are smart

257
00:26:52,370 --> 00:27:06,580
she was running on private property
value in this research received he's as

258
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:18,000
you may be aware of and it's on our
website and a researcher on an indirect

259
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:24,200
object reference has slowed ran a
private County weeks just so you know

260
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:36,690
get the process down before they open it
up to the whole world and researchers

261
00:27:36,690 --> 00:27:44,900
this individual was one and he basically
start my hands

262
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:51,860
in a way where he could simply just
logged in as admin so and talk about

263
00:27:51,860 --> 00:29:27,939
their future costs so so so so so I
really appreciate the response of the

264
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:48,560
contact with you make it is an
opportunity to give me an idea so so I

265
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:55,669
worked on there's a friend of his own so
it's written up on his friend's blog

266
00:29:55,670 --> 00:30:02,140
and the URL is there and permissions you
discuss this sometime ago also you use

267
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:11,710
boxer researchers there's obviously not
every customer has both

268
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:21,460
yeah we we had a critical vulnerability
in our platform and its fixed because

269
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:28,650
when these divisions come and you get
them fixed fast so let's talk about how

270
00:30:28,650 --> 00:30:34,680
do we get through to find these missions
program owner how do you how do you

271
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:41,930
clear out the hay to find the needle and
that he's so let's talk about the

272
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:47,530
mission free market expectations if
you're gonna have bug submissions for

273
00:30:47,530 --> 00:30:53,020
your Security Response Team have
anything to tell researchers what you

274
00:30:53,020 --> 00:30:58,440
need to do you need an attacks aerial
first before you go into like do you

275
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,390
want to know the security factor to use
this tried model to your developers

276
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:08,500
respond better to using drag model
wonderful and richly your organization

277
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:14,730
uses put it in your program for
researchers who are so many ladies so

278
00:31:14,730 --> 00:31:20,200
that they can submit what you need I'm
sorry you can't react faster in this is

279
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:26,950
a web form just make sure they know how
you work because most researchers are

280
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:31,190
more than happy to provide a forum that
you can use because it's in their best

281
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:39,040
interest as well how well is it ok

282
00:31:39,040 --> 00:31:45,389
researchers around the world it was a
second

283
00:31:45,389 --> 00:31:56,359
language if you're looking for a
babysitter 324 in a bug bounty program

284
00:31:56,359 --> 00:32:06,708
yes you will get some of those page PDF
the beautifully outlines and medications

285
00:32:06,709 --> 00:32:13,059
and workarounds recommended remediation
and not a thing of joy but if you're

286
00:32:13,059 --> 00:32:20,440
working with a global team make it easy
for you provide the repro steps or you

287
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:31,049
know plenty of really create and out of
scope documentation and understand that

288
00:32:31,049 --> 00:32:37,158
sometimes you'll get a ballad bug that
is listed in scope out of scope and have

289
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:41,200
a plan for how you handle my
recommendation is if you're going to

290
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:49,440
make a code change rewarded and then you
either put it on one of those type of

291
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:54,349
attack that area so the next time it
comes out it's really clear in quickly

292
00:32:54,349 --> 00:33:00,759
to know what do you do with that this is
an example of how Facebook's that exceed

293
00:33:00,759 --> 00:33:05,109
expectations in submissions for example
so this is these are things that you can

294
00:33:05,109 --> 00:33:09,129
do other companies are doing it you
won't be sort of the first line out

295
00:33:09,129 --> 00:33:15,829
there trying to save companies here and
you can even start from their model and

296
00:33:15,829 --> 00:33:21,020
make modifications of your own

297
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:26,430
guidance and training and not every
company is going to set up their own you

298
00:33:26,430 --> 00:33:32,730
know Google by higher university or the
Bounty Hunter's guide or a forum but

299
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:36,280
know what resources are out there in
those programs start pointing your

300
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:40,730
researchers when you get a report from
someone who maybe doesn't completely

301
00:33:40,730 --> 00:33:47,100
understand what excites us there's
online documentation you can point them

302
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:52,780
to you if someone is sending you a false
positive results there's information you

303
00:33:52,780 --> 00:33:59,070
can send them to you don't even have to
create that will tell him and and that's

304
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:03,070
gonna get you better submissions in the
future it does take an extra two minutes

305
00:34:03,070 --> 00:34:08,389
it's helpful if your turn on your lights
out there again

306
00:34:08,389 --> 00:34:12,540
clear in and out of documentation on
this because it's really just an

307
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:17,830
important skill it gets really quick and
easy to be like

308
00:34:17,830 --> 00:34:24,900
this is an example of Google's

309
00:34:24,900 --> 00:34:33,840
non-qualifying vulnerabilities if you
submit something on this list and what's

310
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:41,190
more researchers say nothing's gonna
stop which is going to cut down on your

311
00:34:41,190 --> 00:34:49,050
performance feedback

312
00:34:49,050 --> 00:34:57,880
this comes back to you if someone is
doing the wrong thing about her chances

313
00:34:57,880 --> 00:35:03,120
are doing the right thing gets the same
person over and over and over and I'm

314
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:07,850
not saying that but at least the first
couple times give them some feedback on

315
00:35:07,850 --> 00:35:12,930
their actions or hey this is a duplicate
I would really like to see more

316
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:24,049
submissions for me or you know the way
you think it and not appreciated and

317
00:35:24,050 --> 00:35:27,640
learners in the future

318
00:35:27,640 --> 00:35:33,330
rapid reaction prioritization of new
vulnerabilities every day so you don't

319
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:38,880
do it today due tomorrow before you know
it

320
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:55,079
and now in a few weeks gone by just
cleared up behind it it just makes it

321
00:35:55,079 --> 00:36:03,660
harder to get your priorities decision
last arguing with researchers about how

322
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:10,629
your morning how do you deal with
duplicates dukakis's the p1 and p2 level

323
00:36:10,630 --> 00:36:15,859
are pretty uncommon because you fix it
and then nobody else usually because you

324
00:36:15,859 --> 00:36:20,848
fix it but there's peace

325
00:36:20,849 --> 00:36:26,009
reports on those of you don't fix them
quickly and I had a few problems on an

326
00:36:26,009 --> 00:36:42,579
operational time telling researchers
reported to you once a week by week by

327
00:36:42,579 --> 00:36:51,180
the bad guys as quickly as is practical
fix a peaceful working seven days but

328
00:36:51,180 --> 00:36:58,470
don't let them languish for months and
months it's really bad researcher and

329
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:59,980
they may just stop looking

330
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:08,660
platform completely defined
vulnerability taxonomy this is not only

331
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:14,640
the prioritization model but also like
defining how are we gonna pay out for

332
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:21,618
these what's the prioritization model
not just among the security impact

333
00:37:21,619 --> 00:37:25,910
amongst features and in your development
I can really make it clear what the

334
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:27,149
business impact

335
00:37:27,150 --> 00:37:37,740
and for example LastPass disagreed took
an existing model and then adapted it

336
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:42,930
because what's important to last past
may not be what's important to Pinterest

337
00:37:42,930 --> 00:37:47,109
which may not be less important to
Western Union so make this modifications

338
00:37:47,110 --> 00:37:50,780
and then went the extra step of playing
their minimum payout based on priority

339
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:51,980
again

340
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:57,690
cuts down on discussion and to be about
what about paid out for an extreme

341
00:37:57,690 --> 00:38:09,240
faster because you're just like a $200
reward and maybe if you get a $300

342
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:24,049
standardized so is it worth these
artworks but actually wears a bucks game

343
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:32,110
in Mortal Kombat terms it's a face how
we have another customer who said they

344
00:38:32,110 --> 00:38:39,590
were doing a two-week program and they
said this one by justify the entire

345
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:43,250
program if we don't get another single
by this fund was worth it they had it

346
00:38:43,250 --> 00:38:48,960
fixed and production within 24 hours and
it was a remote code execution elevation

347
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:54,560
of privilege on an IRT device just
deleted all of the devices in the entire

348
00:38:54,560 --> 00:39:04,820
network this is fantastic even with the
noisy submissions to be less

349
00:39:04,820 --> 00:39:14,390
publish your program because you have
committed serious I just what you expect

350
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:17,839
from the researcher but what you're
committing back to them so you're saying

351
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:23,720
we will respond to this type of bug in
this time frame and they start bugging

352
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:41,509
you in a short period of time from me
today at all these behavior I have had

353
00:39:41,510 --> 00:39:56,360
multiple customers program owners across
the industry argue anymore about this is

354
00:39:56,360 --> 00:40:02,810
not an important but I'm not giving you
a reward and the research team

355
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:05,960
acknowledgement even if you're not gonna
give you money and not get tired of

356
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:13,750
arguing that's encouraging more of that
behavior and its diluting the value of

357
00:40:13,750 --> 00:40:18,870
your Hall of Fame so there's a few
options you could start publishing CBS

358
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:28,240
ice cores with your Hall of Fame ok
these people are on a CVSS 7.5 or

359
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:35,330
extinguish the behavior you can also
just say no you could have a Hall of

360
00:40:35,330 --> 00:40:42,120
Fame over a certain level and simply an
acknowledgement page or anything else I

361
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:48,210
know that organization that you only get
on the Hall of Fame once a year of

362
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:53,920
course that's the baseline expectation
if you had a 65 TV fantastically is

363
00:40:53,920 --> 00:41:00,860
absolutely fine deranged and don't
create bad behavior

364
00:41:00,860 --> 00:41:07,559
reward fairly quickly and again with the
document

365
00:41:07,559 --> 00:41:15,299
if it's super clear what your programs
during the researchers because it's not

366
00:41:15,299 --> 00:41:20,069
effective or profitable for them to not
work within the confines of your program

367
00:41:20,069 --> 00:41:31,269
so it's just a couple minutes your
question yes absolutely fine critical

368
00:41:31,269 --> 00:41:38,959
vulnerabilities and many companies of
all sizes and a lot of you may if you're

369
00:41:38,959 --> 00:41:44,379
into the whole bug landings you've
probably heard of Frederick and Matthias

370
00:41:44,380 --> 00:41:52,390
chances are all here people I talked
about today maybe but these are people

371
00:41:52,390 --> 00:42:01,749
around the world in the Philippines in
our countries with on a daily basis and

372
00:42:01,749 --> 00:42:05,729
you're bringing their talent and
creativity and technical skills into

373
00:42:05,729 --> 00:42:14,468
your virtual security called action told
you I will tell you that clear

374
00:42:14,469 --> 00:42:18,699
submission expectations providing
researchers feedback and consistently

375
00:42:18,699 --> 00:42:20,910
bad behavior

376
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:28,699
those are like the fire golden
principles and getting the most out of

377
00:42:28,699 --> 00:42:59,250
the solution over from the last

378
00:42:59,250 --> 00:43:10,400
question because it's not critical but
then come back and does actually fix it

379
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:20,570
is a critical and I can tell you we've
had researchers come back it was won't

380
00:43:20,570 --> 00:43:25,200
fix it's been eight months and it
doesn't repro anymore which not a fixed

381
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:30,680
and we will go back and make sure that
that's right now but that were managed

382
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:36,230
service so company we're running a
program that would be between the

383
00:43:36,230 --> 00:43:39,700
researcher and the company and I can
happen for a variety of reasons

384
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:54,339
obviously but it does not sound
implausible

385
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:59,640
clear text versus encryption

386
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:06,069
communication you're talking about
critical so those should be encrypted

387
00:44:06,070 --> 00:44:12,400
really hard to encrypted like not
user-friendly can't tell you how many

388
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:17,720
times I've had people who've been in
security for years accidentally send me

389
00:44:17,720 --> 00:44:31,640
their private key you know personally I
like a secure web farm but again only a

390
00:44:31,640 --> 00:44:43,770
secure website doing clear text now and
we actually I wanna go to hear and

391
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:58,470
decide to do you mentioned the chrome on
a program I'm actually not you know that

392
00:44:58,470 --> 00:45:02,879
there are bodies fix for the past few
years and I noticed like the past four

393
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:07,410
years they are very critical
vulnerabilities has declined

394
00:45:07,410 --> 00:45:11,810
significantly if you look at 2040 I
believe only two critical

395
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:17,509
vulnerabilities were patched and the
rest are just high medium and low and

396
00:45:17,510 --> 00:45:20,720
what are your thoughts on that

397
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:28,629
function of time I just that was
available but yes the crime program

398
00:45:28,630 --> 00:45:35,660
follows that the critical as are
declining in frequency and and that's

399
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:39,779
what you would see in a successful
program has where we eating out or more

400
00:45:39,780 --> 00:45:49,600
of the abilities end up happening with
their new Android as well just a couple

401
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:54,339
questions for comment

402
00:45:54,340 --> 00:45:56,740
around a lot of funds to

403
00:45:56,740 --> 00:46:00,339
to foreign nationals were kind of
background checks

404
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:07,270
sometimes coming from twelve year old
kids what's the legality of and then of

405
00:46:07,270 --> 00:46:11,170
course the lawyers are always in the
room and start asking well we pay these

406
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:16,570
funds out how do we know that we have an
NDA in place it's impossible and once

407
00:46:16,570 --> 00:46:26,320
you start crossing country Lions so your
website online today anyway so those

408
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:29,210
researchers can find those
vulnerabilities you're getting up and

409
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:32,780
the question is are you getting the
results and this way you get the results

410
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:34,730
now

411
00:46:34,730 --> 00:46:40,840
different rules around each's I know
PayPal doesn't pay in every country so

412
00:46:40,840 --> 00:46:44,910
there's definitely complications and
running on global program most

413
00:46:44,910 --> 00:46:49,270
organizations I now have multiple
payment techniques may be used PayPal

414
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:54,660
and Western Union are using something
like here or I believe CTI does just

415
00:46:54,660 --> 00:46:59,859
straight up wire transfer to your bank
and so it definitely varies by what the

416
00:46:59,860 --> 00:47:04,450
program needs I I know some customers
for compliance and regulation reasons

417
00:47:04,450 --> 00:47:11,618
can only have researchers in a private
program from certain countries because

418
00:47:11,619 --> 00:47:16,280
it's a government project I'll be happy
to talk with you more about that after

419
00:47:16,280 --> 00:47:32,250
we launched a women when a company
launches new bug bounty program is more

420
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:36,890
like flipping a switch so when the
switch is flipped do you have served as

421
00:47:36,890 --> 00:47:42,609
a lot more hectic activity to the
company at all

422
00:47:42,609 --> 00:47:47,569
how people manage it from your
experience

423
00:47:47,569 --> 00:47:55,930
generally speaking the customers really
concerned about those spikes what will

424
00:47:55,930 --> 00:48:01,549
happen is they will sometimes have a
proxy setup in front of the testers so

425
00:48:01,549 --> 00:48:06,769
they can differentiate the testers in
the program from people who are just

426
00:48:06,769 --> 00:48:12,680
getting their website so they can do
some things like that but generally

427
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:22,279
speaking it depends on how large the
customer millions of hits a day anyway

428
00:48:22,279 --> 00:48:29,749
may not notice the increase but I'm
happy to answer any questions or

429
00:48:29,749 --> 00:48:32,899
honestly at five o'clock
