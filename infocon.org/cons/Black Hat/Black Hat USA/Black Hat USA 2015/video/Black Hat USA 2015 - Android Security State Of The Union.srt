1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,549
you are in Mandalay Bay gah for the
session Android security state of the

2
00:00:06,549 --> 00:00:11,010
union with Adrian Ludwig couple quick
announcements there'll be a reception

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:16,730
tonight and the business call at 5:30
p.m. which is located in Shoreline a

4
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:23,310
youth room the podium words will take
place tonight and Mandalay at BCD at

5
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:30,330
about 6 p.m. and if you could please
make sure to set your phone to vibrate

6
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:41,290
because there are no awesome ringtones
thank you very much

7
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:47,700
all right thank you all for coming to my
first time on this side of the black hat

8
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,870
stage so excited to be able to share
some of what we're up to and my screen

9
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:58,720
locked so you could see my password
really see that it's got lots of letters

10
00:00:58,720 --> 00:01:10,310
and numbers that have been pretty bad at
typing in all right

11
00:01:10,310 --> 00:01:14,320
that's my live demo of exploiting a
system

12
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,029
adjusts eroded my own man oh well

13
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:25,620
responsible for Android security at
Google here to talk a little bit about

14
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:29,790
how we view the Android ecosystem in the
state of security in the Android

15
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:32,140
ecosystem at this moment in time

16
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:34,619
one of the things that's really
interesting about Android is it is in

17
00:01:34,619 --> 00:01:39,729
fact an ecosystem there is not a single
point of control and there are times of

18
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:44,660
different viewpoints and so I want to
start off by emphasizing that what I'm

19
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:49,310
gonna shares my view certainly there are
others and I think it's important that

20
00:01:49,310 --> 00:01:54,670
we keep that in mind we're thinking
through what it is that's going on that

21
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:59,380
said that's absolutely the case that
there are times when it's important to

22
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:03,149
reflect for a moment on what it is
that's going on you know we've heard a

23
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:06,560
lot in the last week or so about the
stage fright I'll talk about that in

24
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,759
just a minute we hear a lot about
Android security almost on a daily basis

25
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:16,350
there's a thing in the United States for
those who aren't from the United States

26
00:02:16,350 --> 00:02:20,850
called the State of the Union where we
asked the us- president actually written

27
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:26,109
in the law to stand in front of
everybody and give a speech about how

28
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:32,450
things are going it's a sufficiently
impossible task that pretty much the

29
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:37,798
only thing any of us remember within the
USS is the following the state of the

30
00:02:37,799 --> 00:02:46,910
union is strong looking at Android
security and having been a security

31
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:51,840
practitioner for going on twenty years
at this point on almost every side of

32
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:57,590
the coin from off against to consulting
to defense I'm confident saying that

33
00:02:57,590 --> 00:03:02,630
that's true for Android as well it's
certainly the case that we have seen

34
00:03:02,630 --> 00:03:07,549
threats and we've responded to those
threats it's also the case that we've

35
00:03:07,549 --> 00:03:11,390
taken extensive proactive measures to
make sure that the union would stay

36
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:15,410
strong and I'm gonna spend quite a bit
of time talking about what it is that

37
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:19,100
we're doing and then talked quite a bit
about the threats and how we're seeing

38
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:20,269
those threats as well

39
00:03:20,269 --> 00:03:24,350
the union is a complicated one

40
00:03:24,350 --> 00:03:28,140
there over a billion users of Android
devices

41
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:34,700
thousands of OEM thousands of devices
and incredible diversity of experience

42
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:40,690
and incredibly diversity what it really
is to be in the Android ecosystem from a

43
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:46,160
software ecosystem standpoint it's
perhaps unprecedented nearly every other

44
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:54,100
platform is a closed platform in a way
that Android has strived not to be open

45
00:03:54,100 --> 00:04:02,850
diverse and available everywhere what
that means is that diversity is one of

46
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:06,720
the core attributes and open this is one
of the core attributes of security for

47
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,609
the platform as well

48
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:13,890
their millions of lines of source code
all available to anybody to review I've

49
00:04:13,890 --> 00:04:19,000
had many interesting conversations about
this group or that group and whether

50
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,050
they would be allowed to post into open
source and the answer was always the

51
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:28,020
same absolutely as long as it's good for
the platform and as long as you know

52
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:32,450
your name is gonna be on it that kind of
transparency about what goes into the

53
00:04:32,450 --> 00:04:37,260
platform allows for extensive security
research and also allows for trust at an

54
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:42,240
unprecedented level for operating system
for mobile devices you can get it from

55
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:49,410
whoever you want and you can see what it
is that the devices can do it helps that

56
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:55,990
they're not coming from a single place
they you as an individual can see the

57
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:00,300
opportunity to purchase from a supplier
that you like on a network that you like

58
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:06,560
its matches the security preferences
that you might have

59
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,600
in addition to the contributions being
made at the operating system level and

60
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:14,320
in the diversity of devices one of the
things that's unique about Android is

61
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,950
that the OEM themselves all of us as we
have the ability to make contributions

62
00:05:19,950 --> 00:05:27,450
to improve the security devices as well
as allowing for extensive customization

63
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:33,760
at the software level by application
developers enterprise security solutions

64
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:38,700
and variety of other places in the stack
so when I look at the Android I sort of

65
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:42,070
asked you know where is the innovation
coming from its coming from everywhere

66
00:05:42,070 --> 00:05:47,280
which i think in the long run is what
makes Android resistant and will make

67
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,599
Android resistant two types of attacks
that we really haven't seen and that's

68
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:56,350
one of the things that I get excited
about this i think is like the visual

69
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:00,370
representation of what people think of
when they think of security a big safe

70
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:05,760
have the iron completely immutable and
if you look at the Android thinking

71
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:10,289
about safes those kinds of features have
been incorporated right application

72
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:13,160
isolation is at the core of how does
we've been designing and read from the

73
00:06:13,160 --> 00:06:14,380
very beginning

74
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:18,010
device integrity is an area that we've
made rapid advances ensuring that both

75
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:23,419
data integrity and application integrity
can be ensured exploit mitigation is

76
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:25,469
something we've been investing from the
very beginning

77
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:29,750
recognizing that it's critically
important that even if devices aren't

78
00:06:29,750 --> 00:06:34,000
able to be patched right the second they
have some line of defense all talk about

79
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,470
that a little bit in the context of live
stage fright and the vulnerability what

80
00:06:37,470 --> 00:06:45,400
we've seen discussed over the last week
or two what's interesting to me when I

81
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:49,099
put these slides together a couple of
weeks ago as at first I thought I'm

82
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:52,450
going to highlight the things that are
new people care about the things that

83
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:57,520
are new but over the last week it was
actually the decisions that we made a

84
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:59,419
few years ago

85
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:04,260
introducing a hassle are introducing an
axe fortify source and some of these

86
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:09,639
medications that have proven to be an
important line of defense while the rest

87
00:07:09,639 --> 00:07:13,990
of the industry works to deliver updates
to devices and so

88
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:17,470
I think it's important that we
constantly maintain a focus on the new

89
00:07:17,470 --> 00:07:20,860
features but also recognizes those
features are going to be providing lines

90
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:22,280
of defense for years to come

91
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:26,109
and that's how we're thinking about
Android not about building a safe it's

92
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:31,120
about building something that can react
in a dynamic and changing environment I

93
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,750
spend a lot of my time trying to think
about

94
00:07:32,750 --> 00:07:38,930
analogies so it's not a physical analogy
maybe it's a biological analogy is this

95
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:46,210
security a big toothy animal that if it
slows down guys know I think this is how

96
00:07:46,210 --> 00:07:49,250
a lot of people think about security in
a biologic sense right aggressive

97
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:53,220
predators but when you look at the
Android ecosystem this is really the

98
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:59,810
more appropriate analogy diversity at
the core enabling solutions that are

99
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:03,300
security solutions on a device by device
basis a service by service basis that

100
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:09,020
together make for a safe environment and
that's really what we're trying to do is

101
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:11,909
foster an environment where that kind of
innovation can take place at any point

102
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:14,590
in the stack and allow devices to be
safe

103
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:22,739
layered on top of that we recognized
that there was a need to have uniform

104
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:27,910
rapid response the focus and rapid
response to this point has primarily

105
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:33,390
been in services and making sure those
services are available in all places so

106
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:40,169
Google has provided a comprehensive set
of security solutions Google Play it's

107
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:45,209
just out for at least a tie people
thought about it a couple years ago but

108
00:08:45,210 --> 00:08:50,300
then we realized that it was a little
bit more than that in fact it was what

109
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,990
gave us the ability to have deep
understanding of a developer who is

110
00:08:53,990 --> 00:08:57,790
posting an application that might be
used by User

111
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:00,319
there's a commercial transaction that
takes place between Google and that

112
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,790
developer there's also a long history of
interactions with those developers that

113
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:08,860
allows us to prep to evaluate the risk
associate with specific applications on

114
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:14,230
top of that it is a mechanism for us to
identify and prevent proliferation of

115
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:19,090
applications will spend quite a bit of
time talking about the consequences that

116
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:22,770
that's had on the Android ecosystem that
are favorable from a security standpoint

117
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:25,760
but what was interesting was it wasn't
visible

118
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,680
high-profile security feature and was
only hears after we'd make Google Play

119
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,620
available that we even start talking
about that the protections of been there

120
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:41,690
all along but the safety preceded the
communication and that's a theme for me

121
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:46,010
over the last couple of weeks is the
safety of in the entry ecosystem often

122
00:09:46,010 --> 00:09:48,970
precedes the communication so we're
gonna try to do some communication

123
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:52,960
specifically about some of those issues
but it's not just google play that's

124
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:56,280
providing security service we've taken
that same approach of having a security

125
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:57,670
service available

126
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:02,199
deep into the rest of the device as well
offering safe browsing for chrome verify

127
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,030
apps verify apps essentially is the
world's largest antivirus solution over

128
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:11,360
a billion devices connecting to Google
and checking whether the applications

129
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,810
that they are installing are safe

130
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:17,140
based on the analysis that we've
conducted in the past based on in part

131
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:22,439
the analysis of the entire ecosystem of
application developers as learned by

132
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:26,650
interactions they've had a Google Play
right we've found the software

133
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:30,410
development ecosystem to the security
ecosystem in a way that's unprecedented

134
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:35,449
previously there was security and there
was development which for me is a

135
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:40,480
consulting company in business because
the security people built security tools

136
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,930
that nobody wanted to use to scan their
code and then the developers just built

137
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:51,469
things and ship them so that's one of
the things that really interesting is

138
00:10:51,470 --> 00:10:57,630
that convergence as a platform between
development and security it's new and

139
00:10:57,630 --> 00:11:00,500
it's happening I'll talk a little bit
about how that makes a difference as

140
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:06,280
well and then we have a few little
things like safety net which is an

141
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:10,890
intrusion detection system deployed on
over a billion devices as well as an

142
00:11:10,890 --> 00:11:16,920
intrusion reaction it looks for specific
high-risk devices based on

143
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:20,439
characteristics and then react to them
so perfect

144
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:24,610
none of these reactive technologies are
but in terms of providing protection at

145
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:30,570
an ecosystem level it's absolutely vital
for making sure that a low minimum

146
00:11:30,570 --> 00:11:36,840
common denominators available for all
devices will talk about that too so at a

147
00:11:36,840 --> 00:11:42,080
macro level for a while now I've been
talking about these three pillars if you

148
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:47,310
will the strength of Android security
robust platform with lots of features

149
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:51,699
that are sort of classic out of Orange
Book security features comprehensive

150
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:54,710
services that make sure that there's
nobody gets left behind just because

151
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:59,470
they didn't pay their antivirus solution
and last month an open ecosystem that

152
00:11:59,470 --> 00:12:04,870
allows for innovation that can take
place anywhere in the platform I think

153
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:10,560
there are four pillars I know I'm not
unique in saying this I think updates as

154
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,739
one that the Android ecosystem needs to
be talking more about and so we're gonna

155
00:12:14,740 --> 00:12:15,900
do that for a few minutes

156
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,850
currently

157
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:25,240
we're updating all Nexus devices to
patch issues that have been discussed as

158
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:38,050
lives change for Nexus 456789 10 and
this is my favorite Nexus player the

159
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:40,740
thing that used to play videos on your
phone because that's part of the Android

160
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:45,279
ecosystem we've extended not just the
phone for this isn't about this is about

161
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,009
a much broader ecosystem now are
receiving over-the-air updates and

162
00:12:49,009 --> 00:12:51,899
they've been receiving them some of them
starting this morning some of them

163
00:12:51,899 --> 00:12:53,319
starting a couple of days ago

164
00:12:53,319 --> 00:13:03,680
our response is not unique I think in
many ways outside the Android ecosystem

165
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:09,099
it's difficult to know how companies are
responding and so we spent the last

166
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:17,430
couple days asking and here's what they
had to say all of the devices are

167
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:23,239
receiving intense attention at this
exact moment these are devices that are

168
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:28,480
either in the process of receiving OTAs
right now or will be receiving them in

169
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,970
the next three weeks

170
00:13:30,970 --> 00:13:36,790
this is the industry response from my
perspective it looks like every device

171
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:42,099
I've ever heard of is getting an OTA at
the same time i guess i phones not on

172
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,310
there have also heard of that they
probably should be getting an OJ for

173
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:52,638
something as well but it goes way deeper
than that on Sunday evening I was

174
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:57,610
speaking with Henry league's MVP of
security at Samsung after stepping out

175
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:02,079
of a restaurant called me cuz soul time
in San Francisco time a little bit

176
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,508
different

177
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:09,079
they had over a hundred and fifty bills
that were coming through Google to Bota

178
00:14:09,079 --> 00:14:16,949
aid in the coming days on Sunday and
that's not unprecedented but that

179
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:20,609
clarity of what was happening is
unprecedented

180
00:14:20,610 --> 00:14:25,050
there were lots of people who were
looking and asking what's going on this

181
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:28,490
is what's going on my guess

182
00:14:28,490 --> 00:14:34,750
anybody could track of this my guess is
that this is the single largest unified

183
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:40,420
software update the world has ever seen
hundreds of millions of devices will be

184
00:14:40,420 --> 00:14:42,000
updated over the next couple days

185
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:49,899
incredible but it's not gonna stop there

186
00:14:49,899 --> 00:14:54,070
we wanted to make sure there's clarity
and the communication issues that lead

187
00:14:54,070 --> 00:15:00,640
to strong response that lead to hype
don't get in the way and so this morning

188
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:04,319
we started talking about the fact that
we're gonna be doing monthly security

189
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,339
updates for those within the Android
ecosystem involved in partnerships with

190
00:15:08,339 --> 00:15:13,370
Google they know this isn't a new thing
for a practical standpoint we've been

191
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:17,990
providing security bulletins departments
for over three years on a monthly basis

192
00:15:17,990 --> 00:15:20,420
they've been incorporating those patches
and they've been making them available

193
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:24,310
we just haven't been talking about it
and so now we're going to be making them

194
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:31,119
available on a monthly basis and we're
gonna be talking about it for security

195
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:34,510
bulletins I'll be coming out immediately
after the Nexus OTA comes to the public

196
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:42,130
at all of the issues that are fixed in
the next update and we promise to do

197
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:46,480
that on an ongoing basis for three years
or longer if necessary

198
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,579
from the data device first becomes
available in market simple transparency

199
00:15:50,579 --> 00:15:56,410
about how it is we're providing these
things onto the public was very exciting

200
00:15:56,410 --> 00:16:00,160
for me this morning to also see the
Nexus is not alone

201
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:06,339
Samsung has made a similar commitment LG
is made a similar commitment as an

202
00:16:06,339 --> 00:16:12,070
industry we've looked at the events over
the last few days and weeks and we've

203
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:18,200
realized we need to move faster and most
importantly we need to tell people what

204
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:23,040
we are doing because I think that in
many ways was the source of much of the

205
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:30,189
confusion so I hope this clears up what
it is that we're doing immediately and

206
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:34,450
on an ongoing basis for all of the major
devices that we support directly from

207
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:39,910
Google and that the other partners in
the Android ecosystem support as well

208
00:16:39,910 --> 00:16:45,069
there are now four major pillars that
we'll be talking about on a regular

209
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:53,370
basis for describing the State of the
Union for Android and I'll be honest

210
00:16:53,370 --> 00:17:00,150
this is black hat we want to talk about
bad things so let's do that let's talk

211
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:06,069
about threats and talk about malware
exploitation vulnerability all of the

212
00:17:06,069 --> 00:17:09,419
work that we're doing to try to
understand what's going on so we can

213
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:14,160
have an assessment of the risk that
exists in them in the ecosystem and to

214
00:17:14,160 --> 00:17:19,580
provide all of you the tools that you
need regardless of what your job is to

215
00:17:19,579 --> 00:17:24,679
be effective for some of you thats data
for some of you thats bug bounties we

216
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:29,180
want to make sure that all of that is
available to you so first let's talk

217
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:37,380
about other one of the interesting
things about malware is a previous

218
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:47,260
ecosystems have run into problems with
now we're really had very few checks in

219
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:56,430
those platforms to identify the flow of
code through those devices with Android

220
00:17:56,430 --> 00:18:01,920
and especially for those devices that
have Google Play we've got checks and

221
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:07,150
lots of different places that makes each
one of those checks itself useful but it

222
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:11,010
also allows us to use one check to
measure the effectiveness of the others

223
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:15,340
which is an interesting theoretical
problem how do you know how well you're

224
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,980
doing and so

225
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:22,600
within Google playing we look at the
applications themselves there are some

226
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,799
applications that come from outside of
Google Play and in those cases that

227
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:28,139
users at a minimum we're going to
receive a warning that they're

228
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:30,890
installing something from outside of
Google Play they're gonna have a

229
00:18:30,890 --> 00:18:34,960
confirmation that they're about to
install an application this sort of

230
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:38,740
blows people's minds sometimes on
Android you just can't get code running

231
00:18:38,740 --> 00:18:44,440
without a vulnerability and without user
confirmation just different from other

232
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,200
platforms that are more familiar with
the desktop world the mobile world is

233
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,559
fundamentally different in that way and
we're taking advantage of that to make

234
00:18:51,559 --> 00:18:56,720
sure that security stays robust there
are additional checks if applications

235
00:18:56,720 --> 00:19:01,510
came from outside of Google Play verify
apps looking at the content of that

236
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:03,740
application to make a determination of
whether it's something that we should

237
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:07,700
warn about and then there's the core
platform capabilities trained as an

238
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:11,799
operating systems are oriented person I
think about runtime security checks I

239
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:15,549
think about seeing boxes and permissions
I think about vulnerabilities there but

240
00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:18,090
I think it's critical that we don't lose
sight of the fact that they're all of

241
00:19:18,090 --> 00:19:21,918
these layers previous to that that can
be an effective mechanism for preventing

242
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,330
exploitation of vulnerabilities and in
fact in the Android ecosystem

243
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:29,210
vulnerability exploitation of will talk
about it in just a couple minutes

244
00:19:29,210 --> 00:19:32,809
extraordinarily low almost all of them
aware that we see almost all of the

245
00:19:32,809 --> 00:19:37,168
potentially harmful applications are
internal way of describing the word

246
00:19:37,169 --> 00:19:42,429
malware authors precision around that
language are of the form the user tried

247
00:19:42,429 --> 00:19:47,100
to install it they chose to install it
and it does exactly what the application

248
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:49,620
said I was going to do through its
permissions and so we're actually

249
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,570
providing defenses against social
engineering or not the types of things

250
00:19:52,570 --> 00:19:59,000
that can be implemented in San boxing
and runtime security checks so I talked

251
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,100
about application analysis what are the
sets of things that we look at where do

252
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,689
the traditional

253
00:20:05,690 --> 00:20:12,700
analysis of an application signatures
static code analysis behavior these are

254
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:17,309
the things that I think the antivirus
industry in particular has been very

255
00:20:17,309 --> 00:20:21,519
effective at generating and producing
good defenses for protecting sort of the

256
00:20:21,519 --> 00:20:27,409
masses much of our emphasis at this
point is on the next generation of the

257
00:20:27,409 --> 00:20:32,529
fences these are not signature-based
static or dynamic these are around

258
00:20:32,529 --> 00:20:36,289
trying to root out the behavior
associated with the development process

259
00:20:36,289 --> 00:20:41,809
and the deployment process right looking
for similarity in the application

260
00:20:41,809 --> 00:20:49,190
development itself a simple example they
sign up with the same well this one was

261
00:20:49,190 --> 00:20:54,019
bad and that was bad and this one looks
fine but sign of the same he was about

262
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:58,190
both of them and so we're going to be
taking it happened taking four years now

263
00:20:58,190 --> 00:21:02,259
a more aggressive stance about code that
we can tell is related to bad behavior

264
00:21:02,259 --> 00:21:06,980
we at the very least can force a
conversation literally a conversation

265
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:10,460
with the developer to figure out what's
going on and understand whether it's

266
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:14,879
good or bad it's a completely different
dynamic from the one that existed when a

267
00:21:14,879 --> 00:21:19,309
navy company was completed entirely
adversarial role and disjoint from the

268
00:21:19,309 --> 00:21:24,690
development process right and so
similarity mystics in many ways are tied

269
00:21:24,690 --> 00:21:27,889
more to the development process and less
to the behavior of the application

270
00:21:27,889 --> 00:21:33,449
itself or something else that we're
doing some very excited about which is

271
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:38,309
combining that with data that's been
collected on devices and this allows for

272
00:21:38,309 --> 00:21:43,970
boss to instrument functionality in the
Android operating system and on devices

273
00:21:43,970 --> 00:21:48,129
call in open source you can see what it
is that we're doing and you have the

274
00:21:48,129 --> 00:21:51,740
same capability and other applications
as well but you can gain deep

275
00:21:51,740 --> 00:21:54,309
understanding of the behavior some of
the applications on these devices

276
00:21:54,309 --> 00:21:59,080
through that transparency and we feel
that inter analysis as well and of

277
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:04,590
course we work with third parties with
your own manual review and look at all

278
00:22:04,590 --> 00:22:06,110
that information as well

279
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:11,389
ultimately in the world of Google Play
you either get too loud or two blocks in

280
00:22:11,389 --> 00:22:13,260
the world outside of Google Play

281
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:17,200
verify after my second option which is
we warn the user hey this is a ruling

282
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,560
out do you really want to install it and
they can make a decision about whether

283
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:29,899
they want to or not I reference safety
net earlier so this is raw data for

284
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:34,860
those of you who look at system uptime
reports we actually were changing the

285
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:38,649
logging and it's a couple days and so
there was a drop in our lobbying for a

286
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:42,900
couple days people were still protected
and we don't fudge the data but there

287
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,960
was a brief period

288
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:50,650
back in June last year where would start
have lost that set a time Google's that

289
00:22:50,650 --> 00:22:56,330
happens anybody who's run a system at
skilled at that so we built a system and

290
00:22:56,330 --> 00:23:01,120
deployed verify absent early 2014 with
extensive data we extended it was safety

291
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,459
net in early 2014

292
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:06,710
this is sort of to give you a sense of
the scale of the system right this is a

293
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:09,670
number of devices that are checking in
with Google they were performing scans

294
00:23:09,670 --> 00:23:16,380
on on any given day the cyclic nature
there's a lot of elements in the Android

295
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:19,100
ecosystem that are sick people use
devices differently during the week etc

296
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:22,689
this cyclic nature is actually something
that we put into the system because the

297
00:23:22,690 --> 00:23:26,890
devices basically check in once a week
and took a while for that to normalize

298
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:30,110
after the roll-up took place and then we
did some force normalization to get a

299
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:37,850
little bit more smooth so early is our
fault the later is actually the decline

300
00:23:37,850 --> 00:23:42,500
around the end of last year or early
this year was a conscious decision on

301
00:23:42,500 --> 00:23:45,900
our part to modify the way we were
interacting with the service to reduce

302
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:49,910
the load on user devices we were at that
point in looking at the data for long

303
00:23:49,910 --> 00:23:53,960
enough to realize checking in every six
days not necessary let's move to 74 some

304
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:59,620
devices let's move to different brothers
you see an increase in the last month of

305
00:23:59,620 --> 00:24:02,620
data that I have here that's available
that's actually an increase because we

306
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:08,510
decided to turn things up in russia
specifically based on data that we were

307
00:24:08,510 --> 00:24:11,720
seeing their and the need to provide
more aggressive response in that

308
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:15,590
particular region of the world and
interestingly enough we haven't talked

309
00:24:15,590 --> 00:24:19,870
about it a lot publicly but we've
started to see other security companies

310
00:24:19,870 --> 00:24:23,939
described in russia a decrease in

311
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,840
in what they considered a malware will
be considered potentially harmful

312
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:32,559
applications they don't know why but
we're reasonably confident it's because

313
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:38,850
at scale we were able to deploy
protections to nearly all devices in

314
00:24:38,850 --> 00:24:44,559
Russia in the same way that we're doing
that for the rest of the world we put

315
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:48,490
out on a date about two or three months
ago we're gonna be putting out more and

316
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:51,769
more of the state of my goal as a
individual is to get to a point where we

317
00:24:51,769 --> 00:24:54,980
can have that kind of dashboard
country-by-country languages by language

318
00:24:54,980 --> 00:24:56,200
etc

319
00:24:56,200 --> 00:25:00,620
available it's not going to be in near
real-time it'll probably be on a 60 90

320
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:04,158
day delay but this information should
all be available

321
00:25:04,159 --> 00:25:08,210
these are things are critical for you as
an enterprise if that's a business that

322
00:25:08,210 --> 00:25:11,960
you're in to be able to understand the
risk that you have for your devices and

323
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:16,509
so we want to make that available right
now it's in document format but we like

324
00:25:16,509 --> 00:25:21,210
dashboards better and so we're gonna get
to a point where available

325
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:27,759
one of the things that's defined in that
document is the definition of a PHA

326
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:31,570
potentially harmful application I'm
gonna talk about those for a couple more

327
00:25:31,570 --> 00:25:38,590
minutes so this is the percentages of
the percentage of devices worldwide that

328
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:46,019
do not have PHA installed as for all
devices and you can see over the period

329
00:25:46,019 --> 00:25:49,570
of time that's here about six months
again I mention that we do a tape delay

330
00:25:49,570 --> 00:25:54,539
of about 90 days to make sure that the
dead data is clean sometimes things go

331
00:25:54,539 --> 00:25:59,440
back so this is tape delayed by about
ninety days this gives you a sense for

332
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:04,039
the overall we consider to be device
hygiene for the ecosystem so

333
00:26:04,039 --> 00:26:07,779
in general over the last six months and
we've seen this going back further than

334
00:26:07,779 --> 00:26:09,080
that as well

335
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:13,539
around a half a percent of Android
devices have some potentially harmful

336
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:18,149
application installed on them we work
very quickly to clean them which is what

337
00:26:18,149 --> 00:26:22,340
makes the graph go up and then there's
new things that they discovered and that

338
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:27,399
makes the graph go down this is a
complex interaction and we have no

339
00:26:27,399 --> 00:26:33,469
expectation in an ecosystem the size of
Android that the numbers ever gonna be 0

340
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:39,119
there will always be some new person who
decided they want to write some bad

341
00:26:39,119 --> 00:26:42,668
application and they've published
somewhere in the world there will be

342
00:26:42,669 --> 00:26:46,909
users who is install it we will be
looking for it and incredible scale and

343
00:26:46,909 --> 00:26:51,379
we find it will take it down but there
will be some amount of churn and so our

344
00:26:51,379 --> 00:26:57,090
goal is to get that churn as low as
possible while doing as little damage to

345
00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:01,090
the user experience on these devices so
that's what we're tracking these are

346
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:08,330
internal metrics for making sure that
we're doing that this is the same data

347
00:27:08,330 --> 00:27:13,830
upside down and broken down by language
just to keep things simple as possible

348
00:27:13,830 --> 00:27:17,289
it gives you a sense for why

349
00:27:17,289 --> 00:27:21,149
targeting specific regions of the world
and choosing our response to the

350
00:27:21,149 --> 00:27:23,658
specific regions of the world makes
sense

351
00:27:23,659 --> 00:27:29,899
Russia in particular has been
persistently high water mark for

352
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:35,090
potentially harmful applications if you
look towards the end here sort of

353
00:27:35,090 --> 00:27:40,080
mid-march that number starts to drop and
the reason it drops is because we

354
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,399
increase the frequency that we were
responding and start taking more

355
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:45,969
aggressive measures particularly
targeted at russia were planning on

356
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:49,570
hopefully we'll talk more about that
publicly in the future but this gives

357
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:54,359
you a hint at what it is that we're
doing there are a couple of other areas

358
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:57,489
of the world where we've seen
periodically increases in activity

359
00:27:57,489 --> 00:28:02,349
Persian language in particular as one
we've seen increases in activity on a

360
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:05,759
fairly regular basis it's not as
substantial as we see in Russia but it

361
00:28:05,759 --> 00:28:10,940
is something that we see Chinese devices
have also had some instances increased

362
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:14,989
exposure China is particularly
interesting if you look at the report

363
00:28:14,989 --> 00:28:16,470
that I referenced earlier

364
00:28:16,470 --> 00:28:21,070
because the behavior there is actually
just in many ways distinct from the rest

365
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:25,428
of the world there are large
corporations that sponsor teams to find

366
00:28:25,429 --> 00:28:28,669
reading vulnerabilities in order to
incorporate reading abilities into the

367
00:28:28,669 --> 00:28:32,860
functionality of their applications and
it's the equivalent in many cases of

368
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:35,500
Google rooting your device

369
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:40,090
we're working to make sure that those
companies understand the consequence of

370
00:28:40,090 --> 00:28:43,480
that one of the consequences of course
those applications can be in Google Play

371
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:48,409
another is verify apps warns the user
about that and so over time I think

372
00:28:48,409 --> 00:28:53,130
we're seeing normalization of behavior
on a worldwide basis but that's gonna

373
00:28:53,130 --> 00:29:02,539
take some time this is a global view
again just to give you a sense for the

374
00:29:02,539 --> 00:29:07,510
difference between devices that have the
ability to install applications from

375
00:29:07,510 --> 00:29:12,490
unknown sources and devices that are
only installing basically from Google

376
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:18,150
Play the risk profile for them is
substantially different the risk profile

377
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:22,380
for a device that installing only from
unknown sources are installing from only

378
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:26,870
Google Play have unknown sources
disabled as well under about 0.15%

379
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:32,850
unstable that at that level for devices
that are installing from outside of

380
00:29:32,850 --> 00:29:37,168
Google Play borders around 1% which is
where you get the blended average of

381
00:29:37,169 --> 00:29:41,919
about a half a percent across all of the
devices in the system so these are the

382
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:46,950
things that were using to analyze and
understand the state of the union

383
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:49,659
sort of talked about this a little bit
already but I do want to emphasize that

384
00:29:49,659 --> 00:29:58,179
0 is really not the goal it's both
unrealistic and not the most effective

385
00:29:58,179 --> 00:30:03,450
way to manage ecosystem there is
functionality that is desirable but that

386
00:30:03,450 --> 00:30:07,340
is risky

387
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,399
we know that

388
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:17,570
people want to be able to do lots of
things that when they do it it's good

389
00:30:17,570 --> 00:30:21,530
application did it and unexpected manner
and there was adequate disclosure is

390
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:26,370
that so that's some of the tension that
exists in one of the reasons that we're

391
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:35,959
never gonna have 20 a perfect example of
that is really good or bad but i wanna

392
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:43,030
take a poll but I don't want to take a
poll same time yes is the answer in both

393
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:52,240
ways both good and bad freedom of the
individual is very important to come

394
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:55,270
down on this one but I think it's a
perfect example of the tension that

395
00:30:55,270 --> 00:30:59,600
exists right and why it is that there's
going to be lots of investment and

396
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:04,040
exploit development lots of investment
in research and one of the reasons why

397
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:08,570
we make Nexus devices unlockable is to
make sure that for those users who want

398
00:31:08,570 --> 00:31:12,020
to have that kind of flexibility they
happen and there's an outlet and we are

399
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:16,420
an open ecosystem there many other
members of the Android ecosystem to do

400
00:31:16,420 --> 00:31:20,770
the same thing delivering devices that
are unlockable we think that flexibility

401
00:31:20,770 --> 00:31:25,870
is critical and we think it's really
fascinating to watch what happens when

402
00:31:25,870 --> 00:31:30,050
it's not available what does happen

403
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:37,379
explains happen let's talk a little bit
about exploits so I mentioned safety net

404
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:44,220
the phrase that I used was an intrusion
detection and prevention system I'm old

405
00:31:44,220 --> 00:31:47,600
school from a marketing standpoint
meaning I don't even know what the

406
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,389
current description of injuries instead
I'm sure I'm like dating myself I 15

407
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:55,540
years basically we looked for data on
the device

408
00:31:55,540 --> 00:32:00,290
anything that we think could be
potentially relevant and that's

409
00:32:00,290 --> 00:32:04,080
available as remember the Android
security model makes a lot of data not

410
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:08,519
available for security and privacy
reasons we analyze that

411
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:12,209
and we try to find what's going on so
what are some examples of that one of

412
00:32:12,209 --> 00:32:17,330
the examples is looking for abuse of the
classic abusive SMS if you're to go back

413
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:21,820
a few years was to have an application
to try to send a premium SMS feature

414
00:32:21,820 --> 00:32:25,178
that was introduced a few years ago and
read was a warning to the user about

415
00:32:25,179 --> 00:32:31,179
whether a particular SMS was premium or
not if a user says yes they want to send

416
00:32:31,179 --> 00:32:36,099
that SMS from that application that's
probably an indication maybe not perfect

417
00:32:36,099 --> 00:32:39,070
one but a reasonably good signal that
that's intentional behavior on behalf of

418
00:32:39,070 --> 00:32:41,759
that application and there's not
cognitive dissonance between the

419
00:32:41,759 --> 00:32:46,200
application and the user on the other
hand if a lot of people are saying no

420
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:53,489
grade they've been protected by the
platform but be we can do more than that

421
00:32:53,489 --> 00:32:57,659
in that we can understand that that's an
application that should not exist at all

422
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:03,279
it should get blocked higher in the
stack that's a really simple example of

423
00:33:03,279 --> 00:33:05,779
how we're looking at did on these
devices and then being able to move

424
00:33:05,779 --> 00:33:08,899
higher in the stack to provide
protection settings like safe browsing

425
00:33:08,899 --> 00:33:12,570
provide them to verify apps or do better
scanning applications and Google Play

426
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:18,039
based on that type of data collection
but it doesn't just stop with going up

427
00:33:18,039 --> 00:33:26,399
the chain we've also been very active in
putting capabilities to make changes on

428
00:33:26,399 --> 00:33:29,968
the device in real time again

429
00:33:29,969 --> 00:33:36,919
referencing SMS the list of numbers that
are commercial varies by region by

430
00:33:36,919 --> 00:33:42,599
country by time sometimes carriers will
make a decision that the service I used

431
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:47,289
to be premium is no longer form and so
there is the ability in the platform to

432
00:33:47,289 --> 00:33:52,320
update those lists it sounds really
simple but thinking about how you

433
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:57,329
introduced checks that a couple of years
later will turn out to be useful as one

434
00:33:57,329 --> 00:34:00,899
of the amazing exercises that we go
through when we're looking at the

435
00:34:00,899 --> 00:34:04,329
Android platform one of the examples
that we haven't talked very much about

436
00:34:04,329 --> 00:34:08,089
is called the interactive firewall is
really called the intent firewall wanna

437
00:34:08,089 --> 00:34:11,759
go search for it it looks and intense

438
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:19,220
you can blacklist why did that get
introduced because many years ago there

439
00:34:19,219 --> 00:34:23,609
was a specific application on a specific
device that it received an intent from

440
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:28,760
the browser which was perfectly
reasonable expectations it could cause

441
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:33,139
harm to the device and we don't have a
solution they had to update the device

442
00:34:33,139 --> 00:34:36,409
we thought about it he said you know we
can do better than that we can make sure

443
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:40,250
that in the future there is a mechanism
that firewalls from one application to

444
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:43,630
another in order to protect the user so
we introduced into a firewall and we

445
00:34:43,630 --> 00:34:49,040
didn't use it we didn't talk about it
existed in the API documents wasn't a

446
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:54,949
secret and then we were looking in
russia specifically and we realized that

447
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:58,870
it was a key way for us to be able to
disable some of the potential

448
00:34:58,870 --> 00:35:03,799
applications that have become persistent
there we used it enables that's one of

449
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:07,370
the reasons you see that dramatic
decline in just a couple months ago so

450
00:35:07,370 --> 00:35:10,750
that's one of the things that we do a
safety net is try to deploy those types

451
00:35:10,750 --> 00:35:12,240
of protections

452
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:18,419
the other thing that we try to do is
maintain perspective on what's actually

453
00:35:18,420 --> 00:35:23,290
going on

454
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:27,450
has been fined for life just this year
for me on the internet security team but

455
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:35,279
for the last three years these are the
two previous blackouts and

456
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:40,339
vulnerabilities were both found by a
blue box

457
00:35:40,339 --> 00:35:44,599
great work on behalf of those guys they
work with us in a coordinated manner and

458
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:47,559
in exactly the same way that Joshua did
just to make sure I'm not shooting

459
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:51,660
anybody to make sure that those patches
were available that we were able to

460
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:52,690
respond etcetera

461
00:35:52,690 --> 00:35:55,509
one of the things I was really
interesting about master key in Fig

462
00:35:55,509 --> 00:36:01,599
heidi is that they were perfectly
instrumental meaning not only did we

463
00:36:01,599 --> 00:36:06,880
have checks in verify apps on Google
Play that gave us perfect visibility but

464
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:10,640
because they were in the signing
mechanism and because we had logs going

465
00:36:10,640 --> 00:36:15,848
back four years we know for the billion
devices that check in with us how

466
00:36:15,849 --> 00:36:19,890
frequently there was exploitation and so
we have the ability to analyze that

467
00:36:19,890 --> 00:36:25,160
relative to the headlines is pretty
interesting and it's one of the things

468
00:36:25,160 --> 00:36:30,219
that we're constantly trying to do is
understand can we put the exploit

469
00:36:30,219 --> 00:36:34,109
ability of a specific issue into context
and make sure that the conversation

470
00:36:34,109 --> 00:36:39,239
about that issue whether its historical
in this instance or forward-looking is

471
00:36:39,239 --> 00:36:45,219
grounded in reality and so hype in many
cases drives the very early conversation

472
00:36:45,219 --> 00:36:49,170
and then more information is introduced
that helps to stabilize that

473
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:53,460
conversation so let's talk a little bit
about live stage fright as I promised

474
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:56,380
that I would talk specifically about
that and I don't think there's anything

475
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:00,739
that's on this slide that hasn't already
been talked about by the folks at the

476
00:37:00,739 --> 00:37:04,779
Imperium that hasn't been talked about a
blog post hasn't talked everywhere but I

477
00:37:04,779 --> 00:37:10,210
want to make sure that we have a shared
understanding of what the facts are it

478
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:17,509
is the case that nearly all Android
devices as of six months ago had a

479
00:37:17,509 --> 00:37:23,739
vulnerability it allowed for taking
control program towner instruction

480
00:37:23,739 --> 00:37:27,999
control I actually wrote exploits back
in the day I don't sound as ignorant or

481
00:37:27,999 --> 00:37:31,230
I'm not as ignorant as I sound at this
exact moment

482
00:37:31,230 --> 00:37:38,460
but what was interesting was it a lot of
devices had thought about that and how

483
00:37:38,460 --> 00:37:42,410
defenses in place they're not perfect
offenses their statistical we refer to

484
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:47,160
them as medications very reasonably
because what they do in my view is by

485
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:52,250
time right that's the point of his
medications if you haven't found it yet

486
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:56,630
they make life more difficult for the
attacker and if you have found it

487
00:37:56,630 --> 00:38:00,090
they give you time to recover right and
one of the interesting thing about the

488
00:38:00,090 --> 00:38:04,270
Android ecosystem is a diversity of
devices is itself a natural medication

489
00:38:04,270 --> 00:38:09,460
every single exploit at this point
that's a remote exploit has to have some

490
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:16,740
level of customization on a device level
of perhaps level etc no prob let happen

491
00:38:16,740 --> 00:38:22,200
because everything's the same we don't
know what happens in a software

492
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:27,790
ecosystem when everything is different
we haven't had this before but it seems

493
00:38:27,790 --> 00:38:33,990
to be a powerful and underutilized store
but we do know though was that SLR was

494
00:38:33,990 --> 00:38:38,990
implemented in ice-cream Sandwich
Android 4.0 and we do know that over 95%

495
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:43,618
of devices at this point have a hassle
or so we know that a fire and forget

496
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:48,040
attempt at an exploit delivered over
something like MMS is really difficult

497
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:52,420
on those devices difficult in the st.
seen it done yet

498
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:58,050
kind of way and I would like I would
love to see it done because that is a

499
00:38:58,050 --> 00:39:02,950
medication that we can then get into
Android now so that for years from now

500
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:07,970
when there's a new exploit that we don't
know about people already have more time

501
00:39:07,970 --> 00:39:11,368
so that's one of the things that I want
to emphasize yes there was some

502
00:39:11,369 --> 00:39:16,580
protection yes it brought us some time
and yes people didn't talk about to

503
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:20,529
start with a communication issue that
we're working on I applaud the folks at

504
00:39:20,530 --> 00:39:23,910
Joshua in particular but the folks at
same period on helping to get the word

505
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:28,350
out that there was a little bit of
confusion early on and we're trying to

506
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:33,520
do the same there are other things that
you can do you can change the

507
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,299
applications

508
00:39:34,299 --> 00:39:37,999
Google messenger applications being
updated by the end of this week so that

509
00:39:37,999 --> 00:39:41,738
it will no longer play video delivered
over MPs automatically didn't actually

510
00:39:41,739 --> 00:39:44,660
play it automatically what it did was
extract the assets in order to give you

511
00:39:44,660 --> 00:39:48,558
a thumbnail I'm sorry for some period of
time in the near future

512
00:39:48,559 --> 00:39:53,339
your hangouts and messenger behavior is
going to be a boring from now as opposed

513
00:39:53,339 --> 00:39:57,499
to a topically relevant thumbnail
generate from the piece of content but

514
00:39:57,499 --> 00:40:00,598
that's a defense in depth measure to
make sure that the risk to users has

515
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:05,519
been reduced I've mentioned already the
Nexus devices are being updated over the

516
00:40:05,519 --> 00:40:09,859
air right now and we're in the midst of
what I think maybe the largest software

517
00:40:09,859 --> 00:40:19,069
update cycle the world to scene until
next month and will do it all again so

518
00:40:19,069 --> 00:40:23,089
with that backdrop safety net is giving
us visibility into some of these

519
00:40:23,089 --> 00:40:27,009
exploits one of the things that we're
also interested in is instrumental

520
00:40:27,009 --> 00:40:32,479
behaviors to see whether their exploits
that we don't know about this is not a

521
00:40:32,479 --> 00:40:42,368
useful slide shows you that we're trying
to understand whether there are issues

522
00:40:42,369 --> 00:40:46,319
related to SLP 3 downgrades and
unfortunately so far we haven't found

523
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:51,420
them there's some like weird anomalies
like European nations have downgraded to

524
00:40:51,420 --> 00:40:56,509
b3 more frequently than Asian nations we
don't know why we suspect it's related

525
00:40:56,509 --> 00:41:01,449
to the structure of operator networks
telcos carriers and each of those

526
00:41:01,449 --> 00:41:06,249
networks etc we don't know but it's the
kind of thing that we're looking for

527
00:41:06,249 --> 00:41:10,879
their some needle in the haystack kind
of investigation which is graphically

528
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,549
interesting but not at this point
informative as one of the types of

529
00:41:15,549 --> 00:41:18,650
things are looking for other slides

530
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:23,670
and other data that were collecting are
immediately actionable and immediately

531
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:27,950
interesting this is I think the only
slide that I have that on the left hand

532
00:41:27,950 --> 00:41:32,490
side has an absolute number I mentioned
earlier which scan about a hundred and

533
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:37,399
fifty to two hundred million devices a
day out of those we're seeing two to six

534
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:44,790
hundred that have a compromised
google.com certificate or responding in

535
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:47,720
a manner that indicates that they have a
compromise google.com sort of advice

536
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:54,180
we've analysed dogs what we consistently
see on those devices is that they are

537
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:59,930
have installed after having had the
device routed a certificate that from a

538
00:41:59,930 --> 00:42:02,879
marketing standpoint has like the name
of a company that does man in the middle

539
00:42:02,880 --> 00:42:07,300
for an enterprise or four schools are
for somebody else we can tell what's

540
00:42:07,300 --> 00:42:12,210
going on there at least it has all the
hallmarks of somebody intentionally

541
00:42:12,210 --> 00:42:15,870
installing a solution that's designed
for this purpose whether the user knows

542
00:42:15,870 --> 00:42:18,810
that that's what's going on in the
device I don't know but certainly the

543
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:23,970
case that somebody had physical control
the day's knows what's going on they

544
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:28,720
probably paid for the service we are by
the way

545
00:42:28,720 --> 00:42:32,149
advance from that making changes in
disclosure to make sure that the user of

546
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:36,840
the device does know what's going on
there so that when we see potential

547
00:42:36,840 --> 00:42:40,690
tampering or more visibility into those
kinds of things and where their

548
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:45,070
certificates that have been added the
user has visibility into them as well

549
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:51,080
another thing that we're looking at is
St Lenox SELinux at this point is the

550
00:42:51,080 --> 00:42:56,350
canonical representation of the Android
security model I say that again

551
00:42:56,350 --> 00:43:04,310
SELinux is the Android security mall
really that straightforward

552
00:43:04,310 --> 00:43:11,529
and Nick I'm sure I think he is not here
actually and Stephen Smalley a bunch of

553
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:16,410
other folks will be excited that that's
the point where at its a mechanism for

554
00:43:16,410 --> 00:43:19,940
defining interactions at application
level it's a mechanism for understanding

555
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:23,610
the attack surface is a comprehensive
set of never allow rules that constrain

556
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:27,740
that constrain that attack surface and
provide defense in depth in the event of

557
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:31,270
a local compromise to minimize the
likelihood of privilege escalation and

558
00:43:31,270 --> 00:43:36,980
on and on it defines Android security
model on a device so it's pretty

559
00:43:36,980 --> 00:43:41,410
important if you wanna understand what's
going on out there in the world so this

560
00:43:41,410 --> 00:43:46,980
is a simple at a device turned on if
your answer is No

561
00:43:46,980 --> 00:43:51,230
something's not right or if your answer
is yes but I'm permissive something's

562
00:43:51,230 --> 00:43:51,730
not right

563
00:43:51,730 --> 00:43:59,470
as well so that's something that we're
tracking and at this point we're seeing

564
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:03,759
about a quarter of devices in the world
at this point you're signaling this does

565
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:08,900
that mean five minutes left as I mean
I'm done okay so there are some rapid

566
00:44:08,900 --> 00:44:23,050
acceleration in time at that point we
may want to check something so phones

567
00:44:23,050 --> 00:44:24,260
I will be

568
00:44:24,260 --> 00:44:27,980
cognizant of my next speaker and I will
say we're platform we have security

569
00:44:27,980 --> 00:44:33,750
boundaries the security boundaries are
important that's the definition security

570
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:37,750
model we've talked about that a little
bit already a thing that for this

571
00:44:37,750 --> 00:44:42,370
community is absolutely important is the
announcement of Internet Security awards

572
00:44:42,370 --> 00:44:49,160
a few months ago one of the really
interesting things that we've done with

573
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:54,149
the Android security wards is think very
hard about how to structure these

574
00:44:54,150 --> 00:44:58,270
rewards in a manner that works to the
strength of the internet ecosystem

575
00:44:58,270 --> 00:45:03,960
around diversity of devices and multiple
sources of innovation so how does that

576
00:45:03,960 --> 00:45:04,970
work

577
00:45:04,970 --> 00:45:09,370
we pay for bugs and tests in CTS tests
and those value amounts are comparable

578
00:45:09,370 --> 00:45:13,299
to say the chrome bug bounty terms of
what it is that we pay out but in

579
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:18,040
addition to that baked into the program
we have a strong emphasis on exploit

580
00:45:18,040 --> 00:45:22,580
change so out of the gate we pay a lot
more for people who provide exploit

581
00:45:22,580 --> 00:45:27,960
chains and Wheatear how much we pay
based on how useful your contribution is

582
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:34,510
to the entire ecosystem so a bug is very
useful about gonna test for that bug

583
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:38,630
that can be deployed to all of the
industry so they can understand whether

584
00:45:38,630 --> 00:45:42,590
devices are vulnerable is that much more
useful than clarifying the state of

585
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:47,510
particular devices tests that have been
incorporated into CTS are available on

586
00:45:47,510 --> 00:45:52,910
the basis that much more valuable etc I
said the numbers look similar they do

587
00:45:52,910 --> 00:45:56,259
and then they go up from there

588
00:45:56,260 --> 00:46:00,560
individuals who are able to generate
exploits and demonstrate that the

589
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:05,320
medications that are in place are
insufficient for the state of the art

590
00:46:05,320 --> 00:46:08,140
that's what our expectations of these
bugs are coming under gonna be the state

591
00:46:08,140 --> 00:46:14,290
of the art there were gonna pay a lot
for them I can't make promises given the

592
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:19,820
response we've seen so far I think these
numbers are gonna have to go up in order

593
00:46:19,820 --> 00:46:23,020
to get a compelling response from the
research community

594
00:46:23,020 --> 00:46:28,280
we'll see how that shakes out it's a new
program you add it all up

595
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:34,940
$38,000 per issue anybody that finds and
reports and explain that form there's

596
00:46:34,940 --> 00:46:35,589
more details

597
00:46:35,589 --> 00:46:40,940
the other thing that we've done is to
focus a lot on application of a

598
00:46:40,940 --> 00:46:47,950
vulnerability we've added new features
to help users protect themselves one of

599
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:51,189
these that I want to draw special
attention to actually two of them are

600
00:46:51,190 --> 00:46:55,920
not platform level features their
capabilities providing Google Play one

601
00:46:55,920 --> 00:47:01,630
of them is the ability to use a version
of OpenSSL a security provider provided

602
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:06,269
by Google Play this is important if
you're running on a device that has not

603
00:47:06,269 --> 00:47:10,689
been updated but you want the most
recent version of OpenSSL you can get it

604
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:14,289
it's available you can use it go

605
00:47:14,289 --> 00:47:22,930
use it the last thing I want to talk
about the developer security warnings we

606
00:47:22,930 --> 00:47:26,950
have the ability to interact with
developers this is new in the security

607
00:47:26,950 --> 00:47:29,859
space this is new

608
00:47:29,859 --> 00:47:34,190
let's use it withstand all the
applications that come into Google Play

609
00:47:34,190 --> 00:47:38,940
we look for potentially harmful behavior
we look for malware we also look for

610
00:47:38,940 --> 00:47:41,420
people making mistakes

611
00:47:41,420 --> 00:47:46,039
introduction of all abilities that are
unintentional over the last year we've

612
00:47:46,039 --> 00:47:49,940
begun to roll out developer security
warnings raising for all application

613
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:54,239
developers the minimum bar for
development of applications and response

614
00:47:54,239 --> 00:48:01,089
to security issues we've learned lots of
apps as you know what developers make

615
00:48:01,089 --> 00:48:09,140
mistakes and they respond by fixing
those abs and their 0 is the goal I'm

616
00:48:09,140 --> 00:48:10,400
now being shepherded off

617
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:15,970
even more aggressively I thank you all
for your time I'll be around as always

618
00:48:15,970 --> 00:48:19,379
and if you have any questions you can
send them to me a lot with the

619
00:48:19,380 --> 00:48:24,529
google.com or you can inundate folks on
my team at security and radar com they

620
00:48:24,529 --> 00:48:27,490
always love to hear from fams thank you
very much
