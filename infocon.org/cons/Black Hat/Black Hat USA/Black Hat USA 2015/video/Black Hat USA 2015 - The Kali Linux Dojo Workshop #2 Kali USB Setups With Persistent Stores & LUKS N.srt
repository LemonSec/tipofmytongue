1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,179
giving you out so USB keys your car is
to repeat them into your laptops and

2
00:00:10,179 --> 00:00:16,590
ignoring warning messages that you see
how to use ours if you don't want to but

3
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:28,849
the next module is live from USB keys
and will be DDing that kinda image

4
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:33,309
though we just built through them so if
you prefer using your own USB key that

5
00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:38,110
fine if you need one from us will be
walking around and giving them out to

6
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:46,379
you

7
00:00:46,380 --> 00:01:56,960
we have enough everyone got all of these
guys come back

8
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:49,470
well maybe they JKL and recently sold
homes I break horses and so it's easy I

9
00:02:49,470 --> 00:02:57,170
J this is the challenge Linux 20 we're
shocked to USB set us with persistence

10
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:09,750
and books do supporter and I'll talk
about us very much so that he once again

11
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:16,829
for joining us in our second workshop
today both of these workshops are

12
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:24,880
designed like interactive session so
it's a workshop as opposed to a tool to

13
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:27,970
go see a good these guys up front

14
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:41,459
connected with that evil I think we have
any new people and I see ok so I don't

15
00:03:41,459 --> 00:03:44,710
have any on this project

16
00:03:44,710 --> 00:03:55,250
and reconsider the introduction so we
need to learn about our kind of its is a

17
00:03:55,250 --> 00:04:02,190
wonderful wonderful testing environment
and we will be taking live being

18
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:10,070
involved in nevada is trying to convince
the world that is more than just a

19
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:17,969
collection of pool and by what I mean is
that that that they're all very very

20
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:24,110
interesting features in town again
designed for professional penetration

21
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:32,830
test engineer as malware analyzes
success we've seen wonderful beach today

22
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:42,599
which was like bill and the ability to
modify the bill the candidates size of

23
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:46,060
all sorts of funky customisations

24
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:51,390
like you know overrides wallpaper what
not to that's trivial things like

25
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:58,169
writing feature which allows us to
change configuration built the results

26
00:04:58,170 --> 00:05:02,410
and I will have extra peaches low
additional configuration which might be

27
00:05:02,410 --> 00:05:10,720
back by the custom packages at one of
the things that I've seen happen a lot

28
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,460
is people now know that day by classic
example of this I guess would be

29
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:23,430
necessary like missus dead filed the
includes chroot directory and then build

30
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:33,780
time bill and then cross the guys oval
we have all necessary that stole that I

31
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:41,510
so once again if you have already made
opposition to previous laptop that's

32
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,030
great if you don't

33
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:54,099
then you should download a pre-made I so
it's a night various bills or Xfce as a

34
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:59,480
very limited tools but of course those
any additional pools can be manually and

35
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:14,420
stole your eyes and be very very careful
in this next stage because the next that

36
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:20,350
they will be doing today it will be da
these kind of those CD USB he's that you

37
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:29,890
have just received now because the
device that you want to be DDE to is not

38
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:39,690
that I want to end up like this young
gentleman here I'm happy about your

39
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:47,950
thoughts if you're unsure if you'd like
some advice for edta

40
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:58,409
instructions that here then raise your
hand and we will help out and make sure

41
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:03,810
that you are not about to format your
hard this we will not resume resume a

42
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:11,980
responsibility they just make sure you
don't mess up so once you have that I so

43
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:22,900
ed it to / whatever it comes out every
new USB device comes out as and the

44
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:57,909
coupon sequences can be found in a file
pool shop to txt

45
00:07:57,910 --> 00:08:03,620
procession happened very quickly because
we are using USB 3 so it shouldn't take

46
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:09,130
more than a few minutes also I don't we
billed as a minimal License instead of

47
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:17,800
being 2.3 case it's less than 10 it
should be should happen fatty P

48
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:32,669
take one of my own one of the
repositories and start my own process so

49
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:50,060
the images I will just now is right here
right now is that they advanced workshop

50
00:08:50,060 --> 00:09:03,869
great deal message was the USD he is
indeed as db2 so I do now is it is

51
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:11,840
someone checking to see that I'm not
doing something horrible to rebook all

52
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:35,140
that david has to be slide up an asset
that is this is the side if you have

53
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:40,380
doubts about what you'll be dealing
we're just raise your hand better safe

54
00:09:40,380 --> 00:11:02,819
than sorry

55
00:11:02,819 --> 00:11:25,669
tell you what we're going to be doing
what we need each kind of the USB key

56
00:11:25,669 --> 00:11:31,889
what we can now do is take that you
speak life

57
00:11:31,889 --> 00:11:38,459
any device any computers at me like what
this will mean that every kind of meat

58
00:11:38,459 --> 00:11:47,459
from this breed violence will
essentially be getting a new lease of

59
00:11:47,459 --> 00:11:59,089
life nothing no changes that we will
make will actually BC to the USB this is

60
00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:08,669
an important key because the USB Drive
USB Drive is readonly so every time you

61
00:12:08,669 --> 00:12:15,299
turn around and that's also something
about because if you have a seven-game

62
00:12:15,299 --> 00:12:19,569
guys so that means you need to have at
least that engages grounds to hold out

63
00:12:19,569 --> 00:12:24,319
if you have a minute why is it like we
do here you don't need that crap and

64
00:12:24,319 --> 00:12:28,449
again this is one of the reasons why you
might want to customize your items in

65
00:12:28,449 --> 00:12:38,128
the first place so every time the size
of goods into a lot of time so we say

66
00:12:38,129 --> 00:12:44,699
assistance in buying any changes made
will only say now one of the things that

67
00:12:44,699 --> 00:12:52,219
we like to do is often travel with
laptops and carry on a USB stick and

68
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:57,609
then if we end up in an engagement
somewhere we remain USB stick especially

69
00:12:57,609 --> 00:13:00,430
with today's USB drives

70
00:13:00,430 --> 00:13:07,959
fetus is no longer much of an issue and
we can do out there now comes the

71
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:14,050
question what happens if you want to
start saving finance in the middle of

72
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:18,930
your engagement and now you're writing
reports and of course you don't want

73
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:26,130
this report to disappear the next time
you actually like to be able to say stop

74
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:31,920
on the USB device and this is where
assistance comes in and this is another

75
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:39,140
new feature which allows us to define
additional politicians on a USB Drive

76
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:48,240
and those politicians can be used as a
persistent storage 29 assistant I think

77
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:54,640
about it this way we define an
additional partition on the USB Drive

78
00:13:54,640 --> 00:14:02,350
any changes made across serbia boots all
that I've environment is saved in that

79
00:14:02,350 --> 00:14:07,709
position and then the next time you boot
option to choose whether we want that

80
00:14:07,709 --> 00:14:14,010
assistance partition to be included in
our environment or not which is cool

81
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:19,339
because you can just plug in your body
must decide whether you want to eat into

82
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:23,790
a nice environment or into an
environment that contains your changes

83
00:14:23,790 --> 00:14:31,640
and dandy but what happens if the
information that you want to say is

84
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:39,390
sensitive again no think they've reports
of trying to get you don't want this to

85
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:46,689
be because if you want to do this
horrible horrible so one of the things

86
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:50,779
that you can do is not only to find
persistence

87
00:14:50,779 --> 00:15:03,570
define assistance politician you can
define an encrypted USB cable is not

88
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,830
your USB Drive

89
00:15:06,830 --> 00:15:11,910
time heating assistance with a
professional assistance without

90
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:18,850
encryption will see that its second and
then if you do this is with prompted an

91
00:15:18,850 --> 00:15:25,270
encryption or decryption passwords and
this is a gang based on the docks ok

92
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:31,390
that's what he does not know that means
that we can travel with with sensitive

93
00:15:31,390 --> 00:15:38,819
data security now here I was talking
about the locks

94
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:48,370
feature which our cryptid dried in case
we need to talk a bit about this later

95
00:15:48,370 --> 00:15:59,620
because it has some interesting aspect
here about no way now that's what that's

96
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:08,030
that's not right but there are making a
scenario this county will describe the

97
00:16:08,030 --> 00:16:20,689
nature of the USB life is one thing that
USB driver assistance USB live with that

98
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:25,740
assistance and the fact is the meeting
actually have multiple assistance on

99
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:33,840
drives you don't have to wear the
petition will be encrypted or not you

100
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:38,110
can actually have multiple stores and
then a good time to find which box she

101
00:16:38,110 --> 00:16:50,630
want to know if that makes sense and I
see a show of hands ok how many people

102
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:51,900
in progress

103
00:16:51,900 --> 00:17:09,819
showdowns break the case I guess a
couple of minutes more

104
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:20,859
quick side showing various options of
life but is supported in cash so regular

105
00:17:20,859 --> 00:17:27,169
assistance encrypted possible assistance
and there's another which I described

106
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:33,270
the show which is the forensic slow and
this is a mode that will actually boot

107
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:38,970
into a forensic police violence if you
do in forensics that's the one for you

108
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:46,210
and this is a small describing the
ability to have multiple persistent

109
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:53,720
schools ok so this is the deed on a USB
Drive and then we can define the

110
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,190
national politicians again

111
00:17:56,190 --> 00:18:22,810
assistance will not be included in those
looks like this one is printed this is

112
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:31,860
that by the falls and wait if you
actually go ahead and define a partition

113
00:18:31,860 --> 00:18:40,679
bad these things will take in a news
that opposition assistance to all the

114
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:45,510
secrets behind these options on the
route kravitzes themselves I'm not sure

115
00:18:45,510 --> 00:18:54,320
if that's visible not but these options
actually described assistants name which

116
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,350
by the fall

117
00:18:55,350 --> 00:19:08,780
up partition which is legal so just an
FYI

118
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:17,490
so now go to da yes he is going to
entail the phone away

119
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:22,820
process and all the tribe if I was to
begin with and then we'll move on to the

120
00:19:22,820 --> 00:19:27,220
actual amount needed to do this and the
guides you to the legal process is still

121
00:19:27,220 --> 00:19:31,190
ongoing cycle yeah

122
00:19:31,190 --> 00:19:41,350
into our computer so we will create two
additional partitions and back we can

123
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:46,020
create as many as you like but this does
this workshop will reach you additional

124
00:19:46,020 --> 00:19:54,900
partition format with extended file
system three and this will be out in

125
00:19:54,900 --> 00:20:02,200
unencrypted assistance office will leave
early resistance and then create a

126
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:08,340
persistent start class file on this
partition which defines what exactly I

127
00:20:08,340 --> 00:20:15,290
want to see which directories I would
like to assist the kind of USB just

128
00:20:15,290 --> 00:20:22,690
exactly treat any changes over the whole
office but this could be decided to

129
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:29,810
persist odious specific directory so
that's done we've essentially they find

130
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:41,220
out that bosses been annexed that will
be used to format the second assistance

131
00:20:41,220 --> 00:20:47,450
politician and this will be our mission
and then once again once sold as set off

132
00:20:47,450 --> 00:20:54,530
and we have possible to decrypt this
partition

133
00:20:54,530 --> 00:21:01,690
assistance the file that defines what we
would like to assist in this position

134
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:12,140
and this is essentially a walk-through
across the various

135
00:21:12,140 --> 00:21:19,630
very calm and happy to make this happen
if you want to invoke the new option

136
00:21:19,630 --> 00:21:27,870
that lots of options we can set up a not
possible again need that given the wrong

137
00:21:27,870 --> 00:21:33,050
given a specific positive rather than
decrypt the encrypted but this week that

138
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:41,149
she destroyed so that's what this
requires approval open up my workshop to

139
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:51,350
da txt file again you can find these on
the repositories so I don't have to

140
00:21:51,350 --> 00:21:57,969
with no spaces on the school's anything
doc txt and essentially a copy pace a

141
00:21:57,970 --> 00:22:14,390
casual place so looking at my eye I just
being needy done on my USB Drive

142
00:22:14,390 --> 00:22:21,970
minus else I should be what you'll see
is that mediate in the eyes of on a USB

143
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:26,640
Drive will actually result in two
partitions on the USB Drive what should

144
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:33,230
his goodness and the second partition or
did I get this wrong way round though

145
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:39,570
the second partition is actually owned
by and is natural this is the way to

146
00:22:39,570 --> 00:22:44,310
pose to be announced what a great
distance we need to define more

147
00:22:44,310 --> 00:23:03,580
politicians and walked away to do that
causes so I'll use boxes to create in

148
00:23:03,580 --> 00:23:09,149
this case I so that I built 909
megabytes in size

149
00:23:09,149 --> 00:23:23,149
so I'll city to find another politician
from 909 to buy GB and then from 5 GDE

150
00:23:23,149 --> 00:23:34,689
though the end of the space available on
the now what I should have for additions

151
00:23:34,690 --> 00:23:41,320
that this guy is going to be my
assistant non encrypted partition and

152
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:51,210
this guy is going to be my persisted
encrypted mouthful great reason to find

153
00:23:51,210 --> 00:24:02,039
find boxes and continue our food so I
got this from a different angle my USB

154
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:16,619
Drive now for what is in total create an
unencrypted partitions with extended

155
00:24:16,619 --> 00:24:28,539
file system three very very importantly
we will enable this hot issues with the

156
00:24:28,539 --> 00:24:31,408
label all is this again

157
00:24:31,409 --> 00:24:40,259
go to the movies commands so you don't
have to say this is a really important

158
00:24:40,259 --> 00:24:45,330
step by the way because if we don't make
this partition correctly it won't be

159
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:50,529
used for assistance and this is where
most people get this is really important

160
00:24:50,529 --> 00:25:14,010
the navy's top issues and i got a call
them on that partition

161
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:22,780
and we do this by simply mounting it do
any USB and then creating an assistance

162
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:30,300
dog gone file which contains this text
which means peace this is changes from

163
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:37,710
the root directory down and then once
that we announce

164
00:25:37,710 --> 00:25:43,740
encrypted so that was good enough

165
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:53,580
now we want to deal with the second
partition which is that right so well

166
00:25:53,580 --> 00:26:02,240
you should set up to four now the bad
boy just make sure you're all devices

167
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:13,040
correct was the number two politicians
an STD forward to partition a successful

168
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:20,149
verification he say yes and then asks us
for the creation process which naturally

169
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:29,540
me da security-conscious will be tour
and I'll verify that pasta and now we

170
00:26:29,540 --> 00:26:40,010
have a politician and not with the tour
the boss was next step is to mount this

171
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:48,520
partition as well so these tour and I
will once again create a file system and

172
00:26:48,520 --> 00:27:00,750
PSD file system on this encrypted
partition and then I will once again

173
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:10,370
persistence and this is an important
step

174
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:20,379
to complete assistance feature and that
is done by seeking mounting the

175
00:27:20,380 --> 00:27:24,570
encrypted partition

176
00:27:24,570 --> 00:27:29,710
assistance dog trial which once again
defines what we want to have two assists

177
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:56,059
and finally finally announce that we now
house we now how this is required to

178
00:27:56,059 --> 00:28:09,100
have a live usb 2.0 assists partitions
101 and the dishes will retain a changes

179
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:19,559
made during a live sessions now you're
back at your client's location and you

180
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:26,920
you're writing your report and that
you're lying USB key that change will

181
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:43,700
remain on the locks new feature that I
was talking about the one hand you can

182
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:50,890
define the possible to the crips your
audition time but then if you enter

183
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:56,590
another possibility is destroyed by the
way you actually vote that is by the

184
00:28:56,590 --> 00:29:04,029
finding that locks possible let me show
you the city taxes

185
00:29:04,029 --> 00:29:12,769
syntax of this is Joel beaches much well
described in Blancos so if you roll

186
00:29:12,769 --> 00:29:28,979
locks behind this but this is how so it
might be possible for someone to remind

187
00:29:28,979 --> 00:29:39,059
them eg I write the first possible that
I need to give us that the real

188
00:29:39,059 --> 00:30:00,289
positives that will or you will be Matai
ok so tore my script assistance story

189
00:30:00,289 --> 00:30:07,849
and Maddie as a possible destroy it and
that is all we need to do to get this

190
00:30:07,849 --> 00:30:13,119
stuff working so is naturally once you
complete this process you should have a

191
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:24,218
USB key and if you take this year's crop
it into a computer and try booting it up

192
00:30:24,219 --> 00:30:33,169
this is what's going to happen and I
need to demonstrate this in turn on him

193
00:30:33,169 --> 00:30:43,789
and groups like

194
00:30:43,789 --> 00:30:53,850
connected by usb I'm connected by usb he
usually ends in VMware so it's a bit

195
00:30:53,850 --> 00:31:04,129
funky with his USB 3 I'll make sure that
my USB key is possible via when she is

196
00:31:04,129 --> 00:31:15,340
and I'll press in our minds of music you
can see that it's because we have the

197
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:20,939
unattended installation option here from
the first workshop so that's those who

198
00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:36,239
decide the USB cable to the USB into
round two sensors around for this the

199
00:31:36,239 --> 00:31:47,070
end

200
00:31:47,070 --> 00:32:13,549
but in a handy with a custom will
remember that this is the same time so

201
00:32:13,549 --> 00:32:18,330
that we built in the first workshop so
hopefully we'll see an excess EE

202
00:32:18,330 --> 00:32:44,629
environment with the beautiful so pls
directory created by a tax that will

203
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,649
have some information on it

204
00:32:46,649 --> 00:32:58,658
the fires created on the file system and
I'm now reboot I read once again from

205
00:32:58,659 --> 00:33:00,860
the USB

206
00:33:00,860 --> 00:33:10,629
like assistance noticed that this guy
already has the assistance to find and

207
00:33:10,629 --> 00:33:15,908
buy the false as I mentioned the idea a
partition with the assistance will

208
00:33:15,909 --> 00:33:25,690
automatically so now when I hit and up

209
00:33:25,690 --> 00:33:34,440
boots and very hopefully we can see is
that the changes I made ya will now be

210
00:33:34,440 --> 00:34:00,759
over on the Greene County I salute the
change that I should be with me and now

211
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:09,109
this is a normal installation right
because now if I reboots and I choose

212
00:34:09,109 --> 00:34:18,639
then the black version of cash with
absolutely no additional fires on its

213
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:31,169
going to be a nice boobs and this is
probably one to two people who have to

214
00:34:31,168 --> 00:34:40,790
travel with sensitive documents here on
my assistance with encrypted options

215
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:54,399
should get some stage and say hey use
this partition as an encrypted storage

216
00:34:54,399 --> 00:35:03,589
space he said he'll be fine because this
is possible to decrypt it so fortunately

217
00:35:03,589 --> 00:35:13,730
my father was easy to remember who I
thought it or assistance encrypted

218
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:25,800
partition is loaded up into my life

219
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:45,370
echo my secrets the Reds 82 powerful
persistence use my type of case of a

220
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:54,490
file present on the storage and now if I
reboot and read those that a trick that

221
00:35:54,490 --> 00:36:06,950
passes assistance partition I should see
that again and try this USB Drive and

222
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:25,038
they don't know who secret tool to open
a DAT file is now secure

223
00:36:25,039 --> 00:36:44,400
once again I will take the tour and
overlaid on top of my night hopefully if

224
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:50,569
I look at my phone dry I should see this

225
00:36:50,569 --> 00:36:59,429
that's great now what happens if I knew
my USB Drive

226
00:36:59,429 --> 00:37:06,829
remember that's right so something has
happened and I just see situation

227
00:37:06,829 --> 00:37:12,150
talk about this in the second what
constitutes illegal emergency situation

228
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:24,019
because when we introduce feature kind
of a lot of noise around this so right

229
00:37:24,019 --> 00:37:30,988
now a situation arises I try I try to
recruit assistance partition and rather

230
00:37:30,989 --> 00:37:35,359
than getting the possible tour which is
the correct it I'll get in the past but

231
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:43,038
maiti which is the new options Oma and
error

232
00:37:43,039 --> 00:37:51,109
ok I'll try another hostage toward the
original possible these are not tour

233
00:37:51,109 --> 00:38:07,308
know not what I use my partition now and
in fact is loaded it with ice

234
00:38:07,309 --> 00:38:18,180
groups and violence not

235
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:28,410
not supposedly through the the encrypted
I am I must titles at the beginning I

236
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:33,930
could try that again he go ahead and try
to see itself ok if you want to try to

237
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:38,990
invoke the new function go ahead just
remember to test that end because once

238
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:46,410
you do that you're essentially believing
you lots of you do that at the end of

239
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:52,890
the whole NOx NOx and I'll see if I can
rectify this demo just that we have

240
00:38:52,890 --> 00:39:02,759
proof that this thing actually does go
ahead to not yet if you have questions

241
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:24,010
will be roaming around

242
00:39:24,010 --> 00:39:33,310
questions so far so good you managed to
get one shot out two da txt how come on

243
00:39:33,310 --> 00:40:15,210
let's see what's going on here with this
was any GI

244
00:40:15,210 --> 00:40:23,619
so once again I hope it looks possible
hopefully I didn't that possible so we

245
00:40:23,619 --> 00:40:35,080
should see that it doesn't boot
partition now less likely to sell and

246
00:40:35,080 --> 00:40:41,160
they actually like I must be doing
something in the process so we actually

247
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:47,460
destroyed the encrypted partition

248
00:40:47,460 --> 00:40:52,859
destroyed talk about that in the second
but I'll let you guys compete this

249
00:40:52,859 --> 00:40:58,119
exercise now and then in the last five
minutes all discussion about this is not

250
00:40:58,119 --> 00:41:24,589
so new and how to use it in a practical
and violence that you have some key

251
00:41:24,589 --> 00:41:25,779
stops

252
00:41:25,780 --> 00:41:35,410
find the positives and what they liked
newt just delete the partitions so it's

253
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:43,640
a trend destroyed just rented the data
on the party's use it while you guys

254
00:41:43,640 --> 00:41:51,980
think this is a few minutes just to
describe this is not snooze not use case

255
00:41:51,980 --> 00:42:02,250
and essentially what I'd like to do is
summarized the summarized the comments

256
00:42:02,250 --> 00:42:08,020
that you receive when we introduce
feature so imagine once again

257
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:15,060
tranny with you'll you'll see the bikes
whatever it is USB I do so by law

258
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:20,220
enforcement officers decrypt your
possible right so you get da you have

259
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:25,350
the option to type tour will have the
option to type Mathi Mathi be destroying

260
00:42:25,350 --> 00:42:29,380
the data on the drive home run during
the drive uses and poor

261
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:35,690
if you want to I'm not only this is
important to mention this doesn't

262
00:42:35,690 --> 00:42:40,750
constitute legal advice etc etc but if
you want to actually destroy the drive

263
00:42:40,750 --> 00:42:48,060
that could be that could be obstruction
of justice and that will take place this

264
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:56,940
is not a scenario we imagine a situation
once again they do when testing applying

265
00:42:56,940 --> 00:43:06,560
now a report very sensitive reports on
your USB Drive intercepted on the way

266
00:43:06,560 --> 00:43:16,330
that you can take your USB Drive but
they make up wake back up all the key

267
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:28,140
source of the US he saw the email back
seat to indication if you say you like

268
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:34,420
Snoop option to say he didn't exist then
travel with a corrupt and USB Drive

269
00:43:34,420 --> 00:43:37,310
corrupted and then

270
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:51,100
waves someone's YouTube and then once
you get to your location

271
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:56,390
travels down he saw backup

272
00:43:56,390 --> 00:44:01,640
rely on your USB Drive and then once
again

273
00:44:01,640 --> 00:44:07,299
access to encrypted partition and that
is the scenario that we had in mind when

274
00:44:07,299 --> 00:44:14,788
we built this feature which essentially
allows us to travel with sensitive

275
00:44:14,789 --> 00:44:22,910
documents without the theory that makes
sense of justice

276
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:29,140
yes who travel safe today

277
00:44:29,140 --> 00:44:44,150
questions feel free talks roaming around
there are some very slight changes on

278
00:44:44,150 --> 00:44:50,510
account YouTube which will be updated
during the day and I guess these off

279
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:56,609
that everything that happened to the
next to you as well as the night hope

280
00:44:56,609 --> 00:45:07,440
stuff which has very excited I know know
know that hundreds of now because you're

281
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:15,769
relying on the actual hundreds
encryption stuff which we have general

282
00:45:15,769 --> 00:45:36,279
questions not related directly to the
practical stuff how ya

283
00:45:36,280 --> 00:46:20,829
about when we say 10 test in class or
more than just collection of tools

284
