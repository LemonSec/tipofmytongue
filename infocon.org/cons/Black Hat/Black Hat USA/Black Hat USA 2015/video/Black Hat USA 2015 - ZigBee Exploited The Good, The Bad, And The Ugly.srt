1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,059
without further ado i'd like to pass a
stage for the ZigBee exploded takata

2
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:12,200
bias and special welcome

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:18,529
hello and welcome to our top security
official title is exploited the good the

4
00:00:18,529 --> 00:00:26,140
bad and the ugly I want to start and
introduce ourselves so many Mr bass

5
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:31,900
worker safety audit or in Vienna Austria
so editor penetration testing secured

6
00:00:31,900 --> 00:00:38,059
the audit are the kind of stuff so I
have a personal interest in this topic

7
00:00:38,059 --> 00:00:44,019
because also based on weather mission
system so I would appreciate if the

8
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:49,840
security gets better in this area today
with me as my colleague hi my name is

9
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:57,340
about still I'm working principle of the
fucking Second Piano my must be a time

10
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:02,989
I'm building drones still trying to get
the HDD first person view it won't work

11
00:01:02,989 --> 00:01:09,420
and I was all set way from automation
system which might change if we are able

12
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:10,880
to break that too little

13
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,229
so what is dead in there were what are
we talking about today I want to start

14
00:01:17,229 --> 00:01:23,890
with a short introduction but it's very
seduced by it is important then see

15
00:01:23,890 --> 00:01:31,540
session is split into three sections the
good the bad and so this reflected the

16
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:36,950
journey remade and analyzing the
security measures and think so at the

17
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:41,850
first it looks quite good then it gets
bad and the real-world implementations a

18
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:48,020
very ugly we will also through life
demonstration about a lot so we brought

19
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:57,399
some devices he led the Tigers very
skilled in working with wood so not the

20
00:01:57,399 --> 00:02:00,149
most beautiful one but it works

21
00:02:00,149 --> 00:02:06,210
yeah then we would include a short
summary and outlook would then explains

22
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:10,228
what we're doing and what you should do

23
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:17,519
so what it's about actually sick as well
as communication standard variable used

24
00:02:17,519 --> 00:02:23,549
and then things but also in the industry
for industrial control system for

25
00:02:23,549 --> 00:02:28,610
example we will focus today and home
automation systems and especially also

26
00:02:28,610 --> 00:02:33,940
smart lighting systems get there quite
popular and they're getting to the end

27
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:41,940
user at the moment so what is it was
designed for low-cost low-power devices

28
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:49,629
with the main goal of energy-saving
devices battery part it's designed to be

29
00:02:49,629 --> 00:02:54,649
installed and out in the field for a
couple of years without maintaining so

30
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:59,819
the focus is really energy-saving it's a
reliable because it's the way you get

31
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:06,810
your messages acknowledged which is
quite good for the kind of devices for

32
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:11,220
elastic which is very easy to ever
physically make a network and

33
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:17,310
application actually physically and to
make clear been done i'd ripley 802 that

34
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:22,109
fifteen the poor and they're just
implementing a network and application

35
00:03:22,109 --> 00:03:26,950
layer so the network obviously for
networking issues and an application to

36
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:34,268
commands are sending data is so very
seduced mentioned before being done and

37
00:03:34,269 --> 00:03:40,220
home automation but it's also used for
healthcare devices remote controls smart

38
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:46,690
lighting metering and also industrial
control systems so I read an article

39
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:53,750
today in the news was very excited about
that some guys in Austin the drone with

40
00:03:53,750 --> 00:03:58,220
the sick and the device and affluent
Boston and within 10 minutes they

41
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:04,660
discovered 860 an everyday basis in
residential area so that's actually what

42
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,060
we are doing

43
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:14,990
commission basis so they're on the rise
and that's always good

44
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:20,829
so to support this is important that
brought some numbers actually from a

45
00:04:20,829 --> 00:04:27,969
gardener study so you see the bus the
amount of devices out there is quite on

46
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:31,370
the rise in 2009

47
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:38,170
Syria that nine billion devices there
and they expect to be 26 billion in 2020

48
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:43,580
so it's gonna study might happen but the
dreamless certainly the right direction

49
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:50,130
this is under a statement from this
simpson CEO beginning of this year I

50
00:04:50,130 --> 00:04:55,370
think he said that every something
cheapest device would be part of the OT

51
00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:02,950
to 2019 so every every thing something
as bank will be connected the bank

52
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:10,820
building connected very interesting what
is also supporting our field of research

53
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:15,430
for home automation is that there are
some predict that 500 smart devices are

54
00:05:15,430 --> 00:05:20,900
rooted in a typical household but Utah
2022 that's quite a huge number of

55
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:27,169
devices and very curious how this would
work out the trend is going in wireless

56
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:34,410
communications is why I would be some
kind of crazy 500 by devices that you

57
00:05:34,410 --> 00:05:40,300
will have to unlock the seller and have
household CEO and such kind of stuff

58
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:47,630
that won't work so very important thing
is way should be about security in the

59
00:05:47,630 --> 00:05:53,360
area that the people ask me why should I
do security guy just do it letting ya I

60
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:57,530
don't mind if anybody is controlling the
LEDs or the kind of stuff so that

61
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:02,869
actually just the beginning we brought
today a door lock which actually may be

62
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:09,200
illustrated more that there is a real
danger but also home automation includes

63
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:10,770
home for me home

64
00:06:10,770 --> 00:06:17,140
request high privacy so I don't want
anybody to get my personal estate when

65
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:21,090
you are able to monitor emission system
you know when are people coming leaving

66
00:06:21,090 --> 00:06:26,049
going to sleep what they're doing though
they so that's my private stuff and I'll

67
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,060
support brought the

68
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:33,389
closed today from the former CIA
director David Petraeus interest will be

69
00:06:33,389 --> 00:06:38,560
located identified monitor then remotely
controlled through radio technologies

70
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:44,450
such as radio frequency identification
sensor networks 10 imprimatur of us and

71
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:49,650
energy harvesters are connected to the
Internet of Things so this means there

72
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:58,270
is actually interest in there and this
illustrates that's actually what is so

73
00:06:58,270 --> 00:07:07,200
now begin to it what security measures
are provided the 61st look quite good so

74
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:10,810
they're playing symmetric encryption
message authentication integrity

75
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:15,880
protection and replay protection they
also doing what they're also doing good

76
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,520
in my opinion is not doing any

77
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:27,000
own cryptography stuff using a sncc Mohd
128 bit key just glad I think it's

78
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:33,280
appropriate but it kind of devices
especially is I did some research and

79
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:41,080
home automation security and defenders
to cryptographic stuff during variations

80
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:46,359
of creating their own which is total
crap we know that a security community

81
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:52,310
don't do your grip on your own when you
don't have knowledge in this field so

82
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:57,560
there are some providing integrated
prediction up to 128 bit and replay

83
00:07:57,560 --> 00:08:00,810
protection which they added some years
ago

84
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:06,520
supreme court therefore means every
command sent from one device to another

85
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:12,020
supreme court then it gets increased so
you can't repay your your messages and

86
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:18,620
commands so this looks but now so the
thought about security whatevs but

87
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:24,450
secured the interesting thing is that we
are only able to choose one security

88
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:30,310
level for network what does this mean so
the richest device and your network will

89
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:36,770
determine your security levels usually
20 mathematician you automate your home

90
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:39,630
this means your dog will be applying the
same security

91
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:43,439
your light switch and led to adjust for
example don't even have been there is

92
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:47,020
sometimes the just gathering the
transmission power by pressing the

93
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:50,660
button through you can imagine how much
resources to have fun doing cryptography

94
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:58,949
such kind of stuff so that's quite bad
so if they're doing symmetric encryption

95
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:04,550
the security services based on the
group's in case they're played two kinds

96
00:09:04,550 --> 00:09:11,900
of cases which are important for us so
that's used them on the network of

97
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:20,060
brokers communication so every messages
are encrypted on this on this level so

98
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:25,109
the key Shiite minority basis for every
device in your network knows this key

99
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:27,030
can do

100
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:31,470
message forwarding thing and that kind
of stuff in an encrypted way but the

101
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:39,680
best the security door locks the
provided link is so called their use for

102
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:45,729
unicast communication and only available
for 42 devices so not every device

103
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:54,800
should be able to open the door lock so
points from the ZigBee specification

104
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:01,920
actually they say that the trust and
security architecture is reduced to the

105
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,890
security initialization installation
processing and storage of materials

106
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:10,910
obviously so we would cover today at
three points

107
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:19,120
storage was done in the past but it
showed very drastically how easy it is

108
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:25,250
to expect a material defect devices
there been a low-cost so they're not

109
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:33,080
temporary system and it's very easy to
get the key out so our kids exchange now

110
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:42,130
so the first three different ways to
change the key vs vendors which means

111
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:44,350
they know each other devices

112
00:10:44,350 --> 00:10:46,550
we've seen this once

113
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:54,439
in the real world and its ok so there is
no danger of some kind gesture but when

114
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:58,940
you want to do to add unknown devices to
your system you will have to implement

115
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:04,440
some kind of key transport mechanisms so
there was a problem in the past that it

116
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:10,860
had an encrypted so when a device want
to join a network to ask the Trust which

117
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:16,589
is a special device in a secure network
for doctrine a tricky and to keep us and

118
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:22,910
so everybody could sniff it was able to
read the messages and also inject

119
00:11:22,910 --> 00:11:30,680
command what is good actually is that
they recommend out of bands heat

120
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:36,300
transfer which is you might know from 50
riders so there is a sticker on it

121
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:41,319
enter the code and you have for the
initial connection and you what devices

122
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:48,290
trying to what they recommended a lot of
recommendations on security there which

123
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:53,480
are actually quite good but but but they
recommend but not require that's the

124
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:59,990
problem so the third option is key
establishment so the keys get the right

125
00:11:59,990 --> 00:12:04,209
from the keys but it's actually you also
need to reinstall

126
00:12:04,209 --> 00:12:09,270
material which is a variation of the
first one so for establishing a trust

127
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:13,770
relationship between the devices you
have two options actually been starved

128
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:21,170
or transport so they provide security
which is actually good thought about

129
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:26,270
doing good recommendations are you
should do it but then you have to do Col

130
00:12:26,270 --> 00:12:30,760
devices really communicated so they're
using application providers and

131
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:35,029
application profiles are designed to
allow communication between devices so

132
00:12:35,029 --> 00:12:41,740
members agreed on a message for months
they describe how you should send

133
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:46,540
commands are you should proceed commands
and they also have included some

134
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:52,209
attributes card start-up attribute sets
they are designed to provide

135
00:12:52,209 --> 00:12:55,479
interoperability and compatibility

136
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,820
they're really interesting from a
security point of view because every

137
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:05,920
device has to implement and support
these and they contain some very

138
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:13,510
interesting information so that's their
three attributes from the home

139
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:19,949
automation application profile is a
first for trusting the linky what is a

140
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:26,660
devout Christian think you have noticed
before so the device want to join a

141
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:33,969
network asks the trust in the key so
deposited it it doesn't take an

142
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:40,550
encrypted now the building in the
fallback mechanism using this key to

143
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:45,389
tracking devices so on top of that you
have a second attribute current used for

144
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:52,750
linkage on every device has the support
of our bake using this trip default key

145
00:13:52,750 --> 00:13:59,660
for transmitting and exchanging the
cases so its penetration tester battles

146
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:05,459
because how could a downgrade the key
exchange to enforce this fall break

147
00:14:05,459 --> 00:14:09,399
because then they know the key everybody
knows it's publicly available and they

148
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:14,139
can sniff to can take over control of it
and it took about selective jamming

149
00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:18,970
whatever but as we receive its not
sophisticated it's very easy but we have

150
00:14:18,970 --> 00:14:24,110
to do a third one is actually a very
interesting and to return to factory

151
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:28,019
defaults to me every devices to support
a return to victory

152
00:14:28,019 --> 00:14:34,069
command so what is this so when you want
to to seller devices through the way you

153
00:14:34,069 --> 00:14:38,449
would make want to make sure that the
key material gets the lead that a device

154
00:14:38,449 --> 00:14:47,519
so what's also interesting is the second
purpose my opinion this commanders to

155
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:52,920
its devices losses synchronization so
this means there is a key updated and

156
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,819
advise them get the new key won't accept
new commands because it only accept

157
00:14:57,819 --> 00:15:02,579
encrypt the commands and if you played
the wrong encryption key accepted

158
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:07,609
anymore so you are not able to control
the system anymore so you have to apply

159
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:11,459
return to pick through the phone and you
can then start again trying to to a

160
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:20,279
network we will take advantage of that
feature demonstrations so the second one

161
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:26,850
we looked at was delayed link Phillips
you for example explained that so first

162
00:15:26,850 --> 00:15:33,390
very good from a security perspective so
it's required to do that so there are no

163
00:15:33,390 --> 00:15:35,810
networks out there

164
00:15:35,810 --> 00:15:46,930
unencrypted but the second point very
interesting for us

165
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:51,239
security architect just based on a
secret master key so but this master

166
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:56,850
keys included in every device and
they're doing he encryption with this

167
00:15:56,850 --> 00:16:01,089
master keys this means they're not using
the default key as the home automation

168
00:16:01,089 --> 00:16:08,740
for the kind of stuff and they have
master key for that and manufacturers

169
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:14,750
have contracts and get feedback release
it but as we learned a security

170
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:19,899
community secured the security does not
work so don't rely on that because what

171
00:16:19,899 --> 00:16:27,120
what might happen instead they disclosed
in when it's out so you can now every

172
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:36,250
key exchange very funny because one when
you starting this year in March or April

173
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:43,199
1st at the same Twitter and the posts
are getting deleted all the time so both

174
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:48,390
to read it and whatever forum but it
always gets deleted so make sure that he

175
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:52,670
lives so but we know when it's in the
internet you won't believe that somebody

176
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:58,599
will have it that's really funny to
watch the race between them relating

177
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,970
posting what s

178
00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:10,140
I think application profile and there is
a tribute to code and wk or fresh which

179
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:15,220
means do not check the frame counter
referred responsible for replay

180
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:21,579
protection started about a check the
frame counter so we are able to

181
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:30,260
should be able to three players know I
think devices are also able to train

182
00:17:30,260 --> 00:17:34,350
home admission to me and it works so
they also have to play the Trust and the

183
00:17:34,350 --> 00:17:45,399
linky deford one and usage of the in
security line so we we learned there are

184
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:50,620
security security measures provided
they're actually good but due to

185
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:57,030
interoperability interoperability
weakness simplistically so we've had a

186
00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:03,460
look at the real implementations and
mature but whatever it depends really

187
00:18:03,460 --> 00:18:12,330
applying so very funny thing and
official statement about the security

188
00:18:12,330 --> 00:18:20,850
and specification the people who wrote
the specification of you have to 22

189
00:18:20,850 --> 00:18:27,629
tested and implemented really with
security men so they recommend it to

190
00:18:27,630 --> 00:18:31,100
that our security services should be
implemented and tested by security

191
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:38,360
experts I want to meet the security
experts because there is some we should

192
00:18:38,360 --> 00:18:47,049
we should talk about some stuff there so
and as an example for wrong or bad

193
00:18:47,049 --> 00:18:54,960
implementations we will bring up a
service called request key so usually

194
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,210
it's meant to be then devices want to
establish when they ask the other one

195
00:19:00,210 --> 00:19:03,160
give me a link and now we have

196
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:09,930
we will communicate using these keys for
encryption but it also states that you

197
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:14,840
could use it for a given a tricky but I
don't get it why you should do this

198
00:19:14,840 --> 00:19:20,169
because when you don't play encryption
there is no network admin you play

199
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:23,640
encryption your would you should have
been a tricky to send the correct

200
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:30,710
command so because otherwise they won't
accept this so I would request the key

201
00:19:30,710 --> 00:19:36,070
encrypted with the key was reporting
that makes no sense so I started looking

202
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:42,830
out on land how how do people implement
this kind of stuff so and found open

203
00:19:42,830 --> 00:19:47,860
source the agency and the developer said
the same questions so whatever they're

204
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:55,729
very confused what to do but what kind
of command except that nobody would have

205
00:19:55,730 --> 00:20:00,590
no idea what to do because this mix
makes no sense what's also interesting

206
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:06,159
in there that don't implemented
application case this means the only

207
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,830
implemented network layer security and
you can't do device to device encryption

208
00:20:10,830 --> 00:20:18,990
using this open source which is actually
bad so what do they do then asked her

209
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:29,170
about that but then they just plain that
the baddest thing you can do in this

210
00:20:29,170 --> 00:20:31,240
case so you have to know the week

211
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:36,090
kidron keeps change and if it's a
potential for implementations of

212
00:20:36,090 --> 00:20:43,610
so-called security services like the
service so we then headed out to reword

213
00:20:43,610 --> 00:20:48,959
assessment to test out the door lock

214
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:54,160
home automation system to lighting
solutions and we will check for the

215
00:20:54,160 --> 00:20:59,389
implementation of security so there is
required

216
00:20:59,389 --> 00:21:06,049
to stick to the topic so I tested
systems just implemented the steeple

217
00:21:06,049 --> 00:21:11,219
trusting the link for securing the
exchange we don't have to do any kind of

218
00:21:11,219 --> 00:21:18,009
downgrading or or disruptions of the
keys changed it just doing it so they're

219
00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:19,809
not doing unencrypted

220
00:21:19,809 --> 00:21:25,678
changed in the past encrypted with the
publicly known that the same actually

221
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:32,429
also they don't know implementation of
Blair's so this means when you have one

222
00:21:32,429 --> 00:21:37,909
key you are able to control the whole
network that's quite cool because we

223
00:21:37,909 --> 00:21:42,979
know we could be extracted the key could
be expected from the device could be

224
00:21:42,979 --> 00:21:47,229
expected during the key exchange
protocol implementation there are

225
00:21:47,229 --> 00:21:53,989
multiple ways to get the key also there
are no configuration possibilities for

226
00:21:53,989 --> 00:22:01,259
another test test systems so that means
you're not able to change the network

227
00:22:01,259 --> 00:22:05,739
key we are not able to trigger key
rotation that kind of stuff that they

228
00:22:05,739 --> 00:22:12,519
were deleted securely or whatever we
want so cute asian not applied so we

229
00:22:12,519 --> 00:22:19,139
tested it now for 11 months and still
the same key can't change it so if we if

230
00:22:19,139 --> 00:22:23,320
one device could compromise we have to
throw away the old system and burn you

231
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,958
on anything

232
00:22:25,959 --> 00:22:35,269
also device research very difficult so
that's my laptop doesn't implement any

233
00:22:35,269 --> 00:22:39,759
research that are you can't believe the
key material you have to physically

234
00:22:39,759 --> 00:22:48,309
destroy them really to to make sure
nobody gets your key interesting LED

235
00:22:48,309 --> 00:22:53,019
bulbs do not require physical
interaction of experience usually there

236
00:22:53,019 --> 00:22:56,659
are some buttons to press for appearing
at a kind of stuff

237
00:22:56,659 --> 00:23:04,229
celebs are constantly looking for new
networks to try and find one so we will

238
00:23:04,229 --> 00:23:07,770
take advantage of it

239
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:11,930
meanders through their playbook arounds
leg reduced and transmission power to

240
00:23:11,930 --> 00:23:15,480
make sure that when two neighbors but
the same system don't steal the LED

241
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:20,400
bulbs from all the time so there is used
as transmission power to help preparing

242
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:24,480
and have to get in very close proximity
to to pairing that's very annoying

243
00:23:24,480 --> 00:23:31,910
because you have to a possible I even
get to do this we are heading out to two

244
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:38,130
outs but in the end was very annoying so
that's also not very usable but this way

245
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:44,600
you are sure that you not stealing a
neighbor's slides so now we come to the

246
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:51,230
fun part 22 demonstration so we had to
to build a new tool for that kind of

247
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:51,990
stuff

248
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:57,380
testing tools are out there but they
were not really sufficient for me to add

249
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,310
two additional stuff

250
00:23:59,310 --> 00:24:07,510
merge them and pick the best one so a
target of us to to make some kind of

251
00:24:07,510 --> 00:24:15,850
other method for targeted for developers
to check their implementations of the

252
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:19,959
security service and the kind of stuff
so I thought is based on skipping radio

253
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:26,790
Colombia and Morocco early so the extent
we as a performer and extended them

254
00:24:26,790 --> 00:24:33,850
quite cool features so we are now
supporting the communication we're doing

255
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:40,409
life information extraction because
there are some some counties in there in

256
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:45,550
the communication you have to keep them
up so you can check them out then

257
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:50,790
properly but also very hard feature took
us the long stemmed implemented

258
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:53,010
correctly

259
00:24:53,010 --> 00:24:58,080
obviously a discount for the key trends
but we just skip it then extracted

260
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:03,570
automatically and with building a lot of
features for the the services like the

261
00:25:03,570 --> 00:25:09,129
recent victory trying to network or to
security services like the risky so we

262
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:15,700
have brought to hover boards today the
recipe which is quite popular think at

263
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,210
like at the moment

264
00:25:17,210 --> 00:25:25,770
and extension board for address be way
too because your superiors 44 sniffing

265
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:33,340
because we can get a large bandwidth can
get a secret channels to sniffing and

266
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:40,158
there are very few we used for command
injection because we're there to ways of

267
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:49,179
doing data transfer direct and indirect
called so mr Panetta battery-powered

268
00:25:49,179 --> 00:25:56,899
devices like all the other devices that
actually have a constant possibly the

269
00:25:56,899 --> 00:26:02,289
central usually so what does this mean
that directed the transfer is for

270
00:26:02,289 --> 00:26:07,850
devices with our to play so there is
even there is constantly on i'm looking

271
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:14,139
for new picketed listen to them you can
just send the pic and its directors

272
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:18,320
different because there is even sleeping
most of the time just sometimes wakes up

273
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:24,990
and send the requested help its ok if
their impending for me send it to me so

274
00:26:24,990 --> 00:26:35,840
the problem is very limited so that
mistake so it it's less than 60 seconds

275
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:44,408
so far too slow to react to that so many
times actually 22 slow because your

276
00:26:44,409 --> 00:26:49,720
superiors then leaving the commands have
to process them information and send out

277
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:52,480
commands so we get to it

278
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:57,770
milliseconds but we would need less than
serious that it realistic chance to

279
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:02,720
check the commands properly so that's
why we don't build our own custom

280
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:09,140
firmware for us so we are sending now
using TCP to come out city russ berry

281
00:27:09,140 --> 00:27:12,659
and russ berry injected them very
quickly to the network because we have

282
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:19,100
to be faster because otherwise you would
get then acknowledged that there is no

283
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:22,820
frame pending so but we want to in check
and acknowledged with yes there's a free

284
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:28,120
pending we will send it to you so that
some kind of risk conditions there

285
00:27:28,120 --> 00:27:37,270
so now we will head on to the
demonstration and then click OK we have

286
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:40,070
prepared a couple of demonstrations for
you guys

287
00:27:40,070 --> 00:27:49,649
the first one showing how to extract the
key from the pairing process well keep

288
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:57,620
your fingers crossed it all works for
before we switch over to Tobias view on

289
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:04,840
his laptop few notes here to the pairing
process first of all the parent process

290
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:09,580
still should be encrypt that you might
think while we are sniffing data is

291
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:15,480
encrypted data very nice but how do we
get killed if that's well

292
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:22,910
fallback mechanism is insecure and
Tobias explained that most of the van

293
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:27,430
Dorst basically all that we've seen
implement the four big mess making this

294
00:28:27,430 --> 00:28:32,250
mistake fault what that means that when
we see if the traffic this encrypted

295
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:35,320
traffic is not better than plain text
because we have two key to decrypt

296
00:28:35,320 --> 00:28:42,169
that's that's the standard default key
metric and keep good so switch over to

297
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:52,330
the bias at all

298
00:28:52,330 --> 00:29:02,360
so that actually had a graphical user
interface oh well I started sniffing now

299
00:29:02,360 --> 00:29:10,219
and the device is switching mode and
which 460 transmitted so now we have

300
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:14,360
smart appear I put this matter

301
00:29:14,360 --> 00:29:41,899
pairing mode will also look to wait for
the press and Tobias

302
00:29:41,899 --> 00:29:47,299
did it very quickly so you can see
there's basically the network is

303
00:29:47,299 --> 00:30:01,379
extracted from the traffic so good at
odds are now in 2012

304
00:30:01,380 --> 00:30:03,430
there

305
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:11,910
so we now have to keep

306
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:17,810
we have to keep so after disclosing this
weakness we thought we might talk to the

307
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:23,389
wind or about how to handle it but their
response was basically that's not really

308
00:30:23,390 --> 00:30:29,170
an issue because the time frame for that
to happen is very limited good time is

309
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,170
limited

310
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:35,360
proximity is required close proximity is
quiet and key extraction only works

311
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:41,179
doing pairing so what would a typical
attacker to actually extend that time

312
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:41,650
frame

313
00:30:41,650 --> 00:30:49,320
well you will just trust into the the
end user to repay devices whenever they

314
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:51,370
loose their connection

315
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:56,250
whenever they get unresponsive so in
this case we have the human factor in

316
00:30:56,250 --> 00:31:02,590
their to extend this window of
possibility to exploit the actual

317
00:31:02,590 --> 00:31:09,689
ability just champs communication
channel and waits for the user to repay

318
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:16,190
up the device

319
00:31:16,190 --> 00:31:21,649
good so what I fear is quickly do that
just shows a normal operation of all set

320
00:31:21,649 --> 00:31:27,809
up there some motion sensor in the box
that you can see on the bottom and this

321
00:31:27,809 --> 00:31:32,309
motion sensor will detect motion and
will send the motion to help which is

322
00:31:32,309 --> 00:31:37,289
basically the wife being in the middle
and whenever motion is detected the help

323
00:31:37,289 --> 00:31:41,389
of two and that's pretty straightforward
just to show you what what should happen

324
00:31:41,389 --> 00:31:45,100
miss somebody left the box

325
00:31:45,100 --> 00:31:51,539
life goes on ok good so I'm gonna show
now is we have on the left side the

326
00:31:51,539 --> 00:31:57,549
computer is running new radio and will
be starting to read you to change the

327
00:31:57,549 --> 00:31:58,200
channel

328
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,740
this is basically really easy you just
have a nice generated generate some

329
00:32:01,740 --> 00:32:06,370
noise you send it on the frequency
channel that is used by the devices

330
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:14,459
the general bio you can sniff so its
channel 12 2000 thing and well as secret

331
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:19,710
devices only use very low transmit power
you can easily jam a lot of CE devices

332
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:25,610
in a couple of well if you have a couple
of houses a block by block you can

333
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:35,379
easily check low transmit power yeah so
what happens jamie is activated now we

334
00:32:35,379 --> 00:32:39,100
live two blocks nothing happens
something that's obvious because device

335
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:44,820
can talk to the help anymore and even
after stopping the jamming that's normal

336
00:32:44,820 --> 00:32:49,100
operation device could send but it
doesn't because it's only since the

337
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:53,209
motion and forgets about it somehow had
all this is a special special case

338
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:56,480
normally drip-dry transmit the motion
detected

339
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:01,490
you can see in the background that
there's a small airport running and left

340
00:33:01,490 --> 00:33:02,529
them in the middle

341
00:33:02,529 --> 00:33:08,490
this this app is the small things how
application that also shows that normal

342
00:33:08,490 --> 00:33:13,360
EF so if you're using this for you alarm
system it's always a bad thing it's not

343
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:18,840
only used for forcing users repair is
could also be

344
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:22,459
interesting for somebody trying to break
into your house and just wants to

345
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:30,980
deactivate abortions and that's good so
the next the next finger once you start

346
00:33:30,980 --> 00:33:35,880
actually is common injection that would
be a life them all the bad news is that

347
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:41,510
the firm would that be fleshed on here
on the recipe is not working so we did

348
00:33:41,510 --> 00:33:45,710
the hardware is broke morning here i
mean we had to we had a long trip was

349
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:49,320
lying around for a long time we didn't
have time to test properly so either the

350
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,820
firm is broken or something

351
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:54,659
communication strong the good news is we
still have a video showing the same

352
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:59,810
thing happening so I would switch to the
left top showing the video instead of

353
00:33:59,810 --> 00:34:17,668
doing the lifetime

354
00:34:17,668 --> 00:34:31,408
on the left you can see actually small
piece of the screen where it only shows

355
00:34:31,409 --> 00:34:37,040
the small things and on the right side
stairs this is to lock built into a

356
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:41,399
really small door we didn't do a very
good job in building today in but you

357
00:34:41,399 --> 00:34:46,299
can see this this is the log I'll just
start the video and show what happens

358
00:34:46,299 --> 00:34:52,770
maybe you can tell by his can explain
what happens on the laptop because you

359
00:34:52,770 --> 00:34:55,849
don't see yours pressing buttons on the
lib directory so what you actually

360
00:34:55,849 --> 00:35:07,839
seized in the middle east the smart app
so I used it to sorry to to open the

361
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:15,200
door and lock it again so you see the
change from the green button to arrange

362
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:22,500
which is actually unlocked so now you
can see that the door is open and I look

363
00:35:22,500 --> 00:35:23,890
at again using

364
00:35:23,890 --> 00:35:31,799
so it's changing the green and gold is
going on so it's not what I do know is

365
00:35:31,799 --> 00:35:39,259
just use our tour and injected
appropriate command to the network very

366
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:50,680
so it's also open but it's close to lock
accept our command but you as a user you

367
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:57,730
are not aware of that because he doesn't
recognize it which is very good for you

368
00:35:57,730 --> 00:36:03,079
as a nice day could also look at again
and you would have no clue that ever

369
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:12,740
somebody was in your house

370
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:18,680
that's when you have the network key but
when you don't have to get there are

371
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:27,770
some possibilities ok so there's other
ways to local be asleep this is a seek

372
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:32,140
DNA will block the also tried to lock
bigoted using traditional tools we just

373
00:36:32,140 --> 00:36:38,640
recorded quickly dewitt can see just
just watched a video really $300 lock

374
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:45,779
and open 10 seconds so that's all

375
00:36:45,780 --> 00:37:14,200
the lockpicking so ok so that was luck
story before lab constantly looking for

376
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:20,879
new networks to try and if the future
like recent victory so this means we can

377
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:26,160
test the recent victory command to allow
above and just added to our system this

378
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:34,089
is a very easy we thought yesterday we
wanted to test it in a hotel room but

379
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:39,710
such huge amount of devices we didn't
manage to find our device again it was

380
00:37:39,710 --> 00:37:45,980
very funny so first the tool is going
crazy so many devices but then I

381
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:52,650
realized he added the room control is
written using sickly so what they offer

382
00:37:52,650 --> 00:38:02,860
you a link to identify the correct led
by even without any knowledge of the

383
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:04,890
kind of stuff so this is how we do

384
00:38:04,890 --> 00:38:10,100
identifying are correct target the
reason that to to default settings and

385
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:20,770
then turned into a network is here to
let the button remote control system is

386
00:38:20,770 --> 00:38:33,870
paired working and we're just resetting
it so that's correct

387
00:38:33,870 --> 00:38:44,569
you can do that without disrupting the
communication then we do so he said that

388
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:49,060
trying to our network and the remote
control doesn't work anymore so now we

389
00:38:49,060 --> 00:39:01,529
are in control device so that's actually
a very nice example of you don't need to

390
00:39:01,530 --> 00:39:09,870
know the network key in some cases and
usability is far higher than the demand

391
00:39:09,870 --> 00:39:15,049
for use abilities that the month of
security that made it very very easy you

392
00:39:15,050 --> 00:39:21,880
don't have to press about them you just
try it if you do the same stuff for for

393
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:32,390
other things that would be crazy so what
did we learn and I investigations but

394
00:39:32,390 --> 00:39:37,150
simply so they are providing really good
security missus that would enable you to

395
00:39:37,150 --> 00:39:43,990
make it good but requirements due to
interoperability weakness the security

396
00:39:43,990 --> 00:39:48,859
level drastically so defend us then also
implement only the minimum level to be

397
00:39:48,860 --> 00:39:54,400
compliant and get certified so we know
this already complains is the most

398
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:55,530
important thing you know this

399
00:39:55,530 --> 00:40:02,190
usability over the security and at this
moment because there is a fight for

400
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:02,980
market share

401
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:08,490
there is no main standard for wireless
communications there are a lot of their

402
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:14,620
action and they are fighting for market
share in the moment so I want to use to

403
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:21,529
buy the so the picture and write a very
good illustration of my picture of Sigma

404
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:28,260
security and the first first look solid
or think ok this level of security

405
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:34,720
should be appropriate ways to
circumvented but the train when you take

406
00:40:34,720 --> 00:40:42,569
a step back or or shift your perspective
would find some very easily 22

407
00:40:42,570 --> 00:40:50,330
overcoming to use for exploding in April
and take over the network so what are

408
00:40:50,330 --> 00:40:57,920
the key point we want you to take away
today is due to problems fermentation of

409
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:03,970
security not looking for being
complained to the standard and education

410
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:07,910
implement the recommendations in the
standard they're they're good so make it

411
00:41:07,910 --> 00:41:13,980
secure and not only complaint and get
certified also learn from history don't

412
00:41:13,980 --> 00:41:23,570
make the same mistakes again and again
it's not that principle to go and also

413
00:41:23,570 --> 00:41:32,970
last point very important there is a lot
of miscommunication is going on at the

414
00:41:32,970 --> 00:41:38,390
moment and mostly not using wifi but a
kind of stuff this month since I just

415
00:41:38,390 --> 00:41:46,330
don't manage to do you must provide
resources would be required to do this

416
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:53,319
so it should be a very huge at the
surface and this level said before the

417
00:41:53,320 --> 00:42:00,580
gas cost in eight minutes it under
devices and that maybe I don't know the

418
00:42:00,580 --> 00:42:06,610
flu but when you do a really good
antenna maybe even more so we want to

419
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:15,170
thank you letter to speak here today and
if you have any questions now it's time
