1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,089
you are in session here for how to
implement I T security after cyber

2
00:00:06,089 --> 00:00:17,779
meltdown with risky back up and I'll be
welcome her to the state

3
00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:23,109
good afternoon and thank you for making
it thru black hat this long I'd like to

4
00:00:23,109 --> 00:00:30,099
present about the Ramco 2012 attacks and
the recovery efforts now this talk has

5
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:35,430
broken down in four sections just a
light touch on what happened and focused

6
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:39,269
on the business operations in the idea
of what was lost

7
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,940
also starting from basically zero in the
MENA region outside of Saudi with my

8
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:49,510
company for security moving past the
poverty line and maturing your security

9
00:00:49,510 --> 00:00:56,099
and things that I could change or if I
had a hot tub time machine so this talk

10
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,770
doesn't really focus on just the bad
news

11
00:01:00,770 --> 00:01:06,570
yes a lot of things happened a lot of
things could have happened but it is

12
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:11,869
recoverable even a massive attack on a
company such as Saudi Aramco you can

13
00:01:11,869 --> 00:01:13,479
recover from such a thing

14
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:22,830
it almost has a hollywood happy ending
almost so what happened how many people

15
00:01:22,830 --> 00:01:29,179
had heard of Saudi Aramco before the
attacks and how many people only really

16
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:36,600
heard about it until after the attacks a
few more most people don't hear about

17
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,579
Saudi Aramco or they Ramco family of
affiliates because you see shell

18
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:46,889
gasoline stations you see British
Petroleum stations Wow Saudi Aramco

19
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:50,570
happens to have the world's largest oil
reserves you just don't happen to know

20
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:54,559
it because you don't see it as a
consumer but a lot of things you're

21
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,590
wearing come from Saudi Aramco they're
very very large and a lot of people ask

22
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:05,540
why Saudi Aramco there's a lot of
reasons people like to go where the

23
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:12,060
money is there some political reasons
religious reasons whatever but

24
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:18,480
unfortunately they are an attractive
target I don't know how many of you are

25
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,880
familiar with Islam but when the attack
occurred at attacked occurred during the

26
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:28,920
month of Ramadan which is very similar
to the Christmas and New Year's holiday

27
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:34,579
season here in the West the great time
to attack infrastructure you figure half

28
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,630
of your I T staff is gone half of your
regular staff is going on if you have an

29
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:41,880
incident you're gonna have to call all
over the place to grab people off

30
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:48,100
vacation so it happen to be timed very
well for low I T security and I T

31
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:53,829
staffing numbers the amount of systems
that were affected they primarily hit

32
00:02:53,830 --> 00:03:00,030
the windows-based systems on the I T
enterprise i'd never over 35,000

33
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:04,239
workstations and servers where their
data was either completely lost or

34
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:09,019
partially wiped and corrupted which was
quite devastating for any company to go

35
00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:16,150
through imagine if you walk into work on
Monday you got no email and no files and

36
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:24,140
no nothing and it's quite bad to lose
half of your system what had occurred

37
00:03:24,140 --> 00:03:29,730
was there was a bit of malware called
shamoon semantic calls at W 32 . this

38
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:35,250
truck the best visual that I've ever
found is actually from Cooper ski and it

39
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:40,650
was a two-pronged attack so once the
spear phishing email came through there

40
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:46,079
was clicks whatever whatever happened
they were able to get inside an internal

41
00:03:46,079 --> 00:03:51,370
PC and use that as an attack proxy once
you're in a network most of the time

42
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:57,160
you're just in your trusted internally
and that's how they were able to sweep

43
00:03:57,160 --> 00:04:01,850
out find as many computers as possible
to whatever they needed to do plan to

44
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:12,150
logic bomb for certain time august 15th
at 11:08 a.m. wiping begins so with any

45
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:17,810
attack it's very difficult to find win
it exactly occurred especially if you're

46
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:21,918
dealing with wiped server logs trying to
figure out when the attack actually

47
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:22,889
occurred

48
00:04:22,889 --> 00:04:27,740
so there's still some mystery involving
it because while there just isn't all

49
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:32,240
the data available for you to be able to
go through so no one's completely sure

50
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:38,389
the exact date but sometime around
august 15 things started looking a

51
00:04:38,389 --> 00:04:41,430
little funny 2012 were put together

52
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:47,810
of funniness some pace bins and
shutdowns as we would say Bob's your

53
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:52,099
uncle there's something really going on
and immediately and I was very pleased

54
00:04:52,099 --> 00:04:58,779
with the reaction Saudi Aramco and
affiliate organizations immediately did

55
00:04:58,779 --> 00:05:03,099
what they needed to do and disconnected
from the world because the last thing

56
00:05:03,099 --> 00:05:06,969
that they would want is for this to get
out because it was unknown what is going

57
00:05:06,969 --> 00:05:11,400
on they also disconnected themselves
from each other as a protection

58
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:19,830
mechanism reacted extremely quickly so
to give you an explanation Saudi Aramco

59
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:24,460
and the Ramco family their production
company just like British Petroleum just

60
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:30,049
like show they make their money off of
getting oil out of the ground so most of

61
00:05:30,050 --> 00:05:34,729
their security budget of course before
the attack would be on the production

62
00:05:34,729 --> 00:05:38,490
side and I think all of us are very
happy that they didn't lose a drop of

63
00:05:38,490 --> 00:05:43,830
oil but it also leaves you hanging with
if I put eighty percent of my budget on

64
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:52,649
the ice yes i'd get pwned well you've
got a problem I see us and I T risk are

65
00:05:52,649 --> 00:05:58,080
completely opposite it's one thing to be
without your email for day and it's

66
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,050
rather frustrating it's another thing to
be out without electricity I think I'd

67
00:06:03,050 --> 00:06:08,680
rather be able to turn the switch only
get my email a lot of mighty people

68
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:13,310
don't understand you can't just ask a
power plant to do a quick reboot to

69
00:06:13,310 --> 00:06:18,889
apply a patch or and certainly this
isn't how you do a hard reboot nuclear

70
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:23,719
power plant so the risks model is
completely different between nineteen

71
00:06:23,719 --> 00:06:28,279
nice yes of course how do you cope with
the majority of their budget into the

72
00:06:28,279 --> 00:06:30,610
place the area that they make money

73
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:35,200
ICS makes perfect unfortunately things
happened

74
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:42,039
the best quote I've ever seen about the
attack is actually from the CEO of Saudi

75
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:46,590
Aramco reminds me of an asthma
commercial I think that still runs in

76
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:53,940
the states of being a fish out of water
you depend on a tee and you don't

77
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:58,380
realize that you need it when it's until
it's gone

78
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:05,120
here's a good example the ICS part it
was isolated that's fantastic

79
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:11,750
oil kept running oil was flowing great
but this picture was taken and posted by

80
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:18,100
Middle Eastern journalists on September
1st 2012 remind you the attack occurred

81
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:24,150
on August 15th these are tanker trucks
that are lined up trying to get filled

82
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:29,750
with refined gasoline and saudi and
those miles and miles and miles of them

83
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,310
now

84
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:36,590
payment systems are not put in the
production line that's on your I T

85
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:43,250
enterprise side and also part of your
ideas knocked out well how do these

86
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:46,420
tankers get filled how do you know that
they should be filled

87
00:07:46,420 --> 00:07:53,380
who's going to get paid you have no way
of knowing so 17 days after the attack

88
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:59,390
there should be gasoline shortages
around the country Saudi Arabia and this

89
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:05,990
was moving past just and I T incident to
affecting national infrastructure what

90
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:09,230
happens if you can't put gasoline in
your car

91
00:08:09,230 --> 00:08:14,460
it's not a pleasant situation so

92
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,758
another thing to stresses Saudi Aramco
actually was not the only one that was

93
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:25,520
affected by shamoon there is a Qatar gas
national oil company called rather go to

94
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:31,250
joint venture with Exxon and two weeks
after the attack was Saudi Aramco RasGas

95
00:08:31,250 --> 00:08:38,490
was affected the same type of way now I
have read the Q search report and it

96
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:43,909
appears to be a slight variant than what
was used with Saudi Aramco but it

97
00:08:43,909 --> 00:08:47,830
actually went through two national oil
companies which could have really

98
00:08:47,830 --> 00:08:56,930
affected our prices for a good deal of
things and when they isolated themselves

99
00:08:56,930 --> 00:09:02,469
they are so isolated themselves from
things like vendor support if you've got

100
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:06,730
a production plant where Honeywell my
dial in every day to fix something

101
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:12,570
tweaked something or whatever it's quite
useful it was cut off if you've got a 90

102
00:09:12,570 --> 00:09:17,490
vendor like I don't know take a guess
like juniper need to come in they were

103
00:09:17,490 --> 00:09:26,170
cut off too so internally from vendors
from support and from the outside world

104
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:30,910
Aramco and the Aramco family had to
completely isolate themselves now

105
00:09:30,910 --> 00:09:37,500
imagine what the effect on business
operations as well there were no desk

106
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:39,160
phones that worked

107
00:09:39,160 --> 00:09:45,290
completely through there was no email
there were some fax machines and that

108
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:53,430
was cutting edge technology directly
after the attack so how do I come into

109
00:09:53,430 --> 00:10:00,489
the picture I was phoned months after
the attack in January 2013 at this very

110
00:10:00,490 --> 00:10:05,120
strange phone call I was in an airport
in Istanbul hoping that my frequent

111
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,590
flyer card would get me in the lounge

112
00:10:08,590 --> 00:10:12,860
and I get this call from a guy who said
he was from Aramco like oh that's

113
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:18,000
interesting what can I do for you and he
said listen we're recovering from the

114
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,900
attack and we would like you to set up
the security and network operations for

115
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:29,720
the MENA region outside of Saudi pretty
nice kid you be able to hire who you

116
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:34,750
want and you'll have a very nice budget
sounds interesting but actually started

117
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:40,010
job on Tuesday sorry but thank you kind
of look and the recruiter was quite

118
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:50,340
persuasive in said don't say no just say
maybe so I spoke to them

119
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:55,870
my new job I was starting up security
network operations for the Netherlands

120
00:10:55,870 --> 00:10:59,660
largest financial services companies so
it kinda similar but obviously the

121
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:07,469
raincoat full affair with as much bigger
scale and much bigger scale so I said

122
00:11:07,470 --> 00:11:12,750
all right I'll take a look I'll take a
look and as we were talking through a

123
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:18,870
few months of trying to work things out
and negotiate things and so forth a week

124
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:24,240
before I thought it was gonna start
Saudi Aramco's Twitter account got

125
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:30,430
compromised which ranked overseas runs
so if scrambling to assist them directly

126
00:11:30,430 --> 00:11:34,859
after funeral writing notes to help them
take back their Twitter account this was

127
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:40,380
before Twitter enabled two-step
verification or any real security

128
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:46,010
luckily it worked because the moment I
landed two days later I had my contract

129
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:53,100
in hand and I started to overseas
provides the ITT infrastructure for

130
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:58,000
Saudi Aramco zamira region outside of
Saudi got sixty plus offices in

131
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:03,580
Singapore could be Indonesia could be
wherever before the attack

132
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:07,790
Saudi Aramco didn't think it was
important to staff Ramco overseas with I

133
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:11,110
T security people so during the attack

134
00:12:11,110 --> 00:12:17,590
Remco overseas had zero people on staff
and when I joined I was the first

135
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:21,680
permanent employee and I T security for
Winco overseas

136
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:28,709
so basically started absolutely from the
euro which can be a good thing because

137
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:33,040
you don't have to go and fight the old
school or they're the folks who were

138
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:38,760
there and be the new kid on the block so
much but still it was amazing that they

139
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:45,689
actually had no I T security in the MENA
region outside of Saudi so I began

140
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:50,230
recruiting and that was probably one of
the funnest things that I did I know a

141
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:54,810
lot of people think it's frustrating to
find security analyst but then again I

142
00:12:54,810 --> 00:12:59,589
had elevated budget more than most
organizations did so I could really go

143
00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:07,440
out and find top town where did I go and
find these people I hear in the news

144
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,510
it's just so difficult so difficult so
difficult some of the methods that are

145
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:16,990
used to recruit were not reinventing the
wheel cuz we didn't really have time i

146
00:13:16,990 --> 00:13:22,700
used talent assessments both on new
candidates to read some out and also to

147
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:27,450
gauge my juniors and seniors and help me
get in additional training budget for

148
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:28,330
them

149
00:13:28,330 --> 00:13:34,630
used community conferences my network i
poached like crazy from other places and

150
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:42,240
good people and also if you have read it
blocked tell your boss this is a great

151
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,650
resource because every quarter they post
for free all the top companies or a

152
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:53,750
little companies who want people in the
next section hiring area so get it

153
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,110
unlocked you know have some
justification to watch and look at read

154
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:05,579
it during the day some tools and tips
for getting in good people good people

155
00:14:05,579 --> 00:14:10,680
are hard to find many people nowadays
they're very cool oriented but they

156
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,120
don't understand the technology is
behind the toll and you really want

157
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:18,630
people that understand the technology
because you can apply many tools to the

158
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:21,390
same situations long as you understood

159
00:14:21,390 --> 00:14:28,110
understand don't look for just the
corporate image the people who will just

160
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:32,390
look good in a suit I was able to get
weird and wonderful people

161
00:14:32,390 --> 00:14:35,120
harlem shakers people putting videos
online

162
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:41,570
around people whose hobby including mine
is lockpicking weird and wonderful

163
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:46,060
sayings and you have to look past that
corporate image if they've got tattoos

164
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:50,319
that they've got a couple piercings and
you know it can work it can work also

165
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:56,540
don't always look for just certificates
or just agree if you get somebody in for

166
00:14:56,540 --> 00:15:01,099
a job and they start talking about their
home lab and they're doing this at home

167
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:06,210
in their passionate and they get that
smile on their face that globe those are

168
00:15:06,210 --> 00:15:10,529
the people that you want to will excel
in your organization will bring really

169
00:15:10,529 --> 00:15:11,370
good value

170
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:18,190
another tip is I have seen some horrible
security analyst schedules and network

171
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:24,400
operations schedules likes eight days on
one and a half days off 12 hour shift

172
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:29,579
absolutely ridiculous the last thing you
want is people monitoring your network

173
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:34,210
that are falling asleep at their
monitors or who never see daylight

174
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:37,860
whatever scheduled someone permanently
on the night shift don't do that is just

175
00:15:37,860 --> 00:15:40,350
cruel and unusual punishment

176
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:44,650
one of the reasons why it took a while
to do my contract negotiations was I

177
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:50,779
wanted to make sure that I had well
organized team that had appropriate rest

178
00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:58,240
schedules so I got them to agree to put
my shift workers only six day on four

179
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,220
day off

180
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:02,990
averaged thirty eight and a half hour
work week which meant at the end of

181
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:07,220
every week they had a long weekend then
they would rotate they could see

182
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:12,650
daylight mornings afternoons night they
got to see each other and got to see

183
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:17,699
daylight and they almost never took
vacation cuz they had a long weekend at

184
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:24,540
the end of every week it was great
fantastic and when I say don't cheap out

185
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:32,390
it isn't just the base salary I had a
couple of questions about raises for my

186
00:16:32,390 --> 00:16:36,740
folks but that's that's wasn't the real
concern they want to training they

187
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:41,480
wanted top training they wanted to make
sure that they could address today's

188
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:47,000
challenges with today's education and
today's skill set

189
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:52,230
and that was the biggest thing training
budget training but your training budget

190
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:56,300
you don't want people monitoring network
they only know yesterday's technology

191
00:16:56,300 --> 00:17:00,040
and then you've got a flood of new
things than I can be able to keep up its

192
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,849
also can affect their self-esteem
because they're gonna think that they're

193
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:09,060
behind as well so very much focused on
training and development of your staff

194
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:16,929
and wife is Dave will do amazing things
when you come into an organization that

195
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:22,650
was focused on ICS risk and now you
suddenly have to do I T risk I had an

196
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:29,690
analyst Howard Allen had this great idea
of how to change security culture at

197
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:35,910
Aramco overseas he said how about we
make people security heroes I go what do

198
00:17:35,910 --> 00:17:38,020
you mean security here it goes

199
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:41,410
you know where the scary security
operations center and people think we

200
00:17:41,410 --> 00:17:45,300
have a big stick people are afraid to
talk to us

201
00:17:45,300 --> 00:17:50,379
well what if we make ourselves
approachable what if if an employee's

202
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:54,690
see something and send something they
can't put into a drawing where they can

203
00:17:54,690 --> 00:18:00,300
win a security team prize all the way up
to an iPad every single month and

204
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:05,820
encouragement somebody found the wifi
password crumpled up outside the

205
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:06,800
building

206
00:18:06,800 --> 00:18:10,419
well and they won the drawing for that
month are featured in the employ

207
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:15,510
magazine they got a certificate their
story was put in the magazine not only

208
00:18:15,510 --> 00:18:19,610
what they found but what the effect was
and what the effect could have been on

209
00:18:19,610 --> 00:18:25,240
the company and those who also reported
things they were also included gave us

210
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,810
really good metric because when a lot of
people see suspicious emails coming

211
00:18:29,810 --> 00:18:35,100
through the corporate email just hit the
leaf well we wanted to know if there was

212
00:18:35,100 --> 00:18:39,370
any specific targeting or get any
additional Intel from that two people

213
00:18:39,370 --> 00:18:43,050
started sending those emails through
instead of just deleting so we were able

214
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:47,629
to build metrics we're able to gain more
intelligence because we became

215
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:52,610
approachable and your analysts if you
let them play and let them do they will

216
00:18:52,610 --> 00:18:58,240
do amazing things and another guy Walter
who built from the ground up of forensic

217
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:59,580
system

218
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:05,230
even incorporated it into our central
antivirus so that the moment alert came

219
00:19:05,230 --> 00:19:10,850
we could pull back five key pieces of
information and do triage immediately to

220
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:17,000
see is this a false-positive most likely
afternoon it's just a issue will redo it

221
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:21,460
but it's not a security problem and they
were able to do amazing things I allowed

222
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:26,020
them about 10 percent of their time to
do research and development and project

223
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:33,690
work for interesting logging solutions
to changing the way that we were able to

224
00:19:33,690 --> 00:19:38,400
do packet analysis on the network
switching from span ports to taps making

225
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:43,850
sure that we could monitor as much as
possible and testing but analysts and

226
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:47,959
your security people if you let them
play if they're rested and they enjoy

227
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:52,820
their job they're gonna do amazing
things and bring a lot of value a full

228
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:58,600
forensic setup costs a lot of money like
I was able to do it with about 10 hours

229
00:19:58,600 --> 00:20:05,070
of overtime and the rest of the time on
the clock working on his project so they

230
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:13,980
will bring you amazing value they are
well worth the money once her set up I

231
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:18,370
don't even wanna know well I kind of do
but how much money was spent to set up

232
00:20:18,370 --> 00:20:24,419
her unit or security you know the guys
are top obviously they want to know if

233
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:32,530
it's been good money or not so we had I
think 5 assessments and six month time

234
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:33,610
period

235
00:20:33,610 --> 00:20:39,280
thought I was gonna lose my hair looking
I didn't nobody likes the dreaded

236
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:47,280
auditors but beforehand I come out of
Europe we use the European simulations

237
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:51,080
and exercises and I highly recommend
these or anything similar

238
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:56,310
26 different exercises a teacher and the
student with vehicles fully complete

239
00:20:56,310 --> 00:20:59,159
everything from recruiting staff

240
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:04,730
setting up contacts with law enforcement
handling critical infrastructure issues

241
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:08,970
contact in your search it is invaluable
and it's free

242
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:15,510
absolutely freely take tons of feedback
and I know there are some DHS ICS search

243
00:21:15,510 --> 00:21:20,820
resources like that as well and on the
regular I T certain this is actually the

244
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:27,689
best one I found so we went through some
of these some before lots more

245
00:21:27,690 --> 00:21:33,460
afterwards because of course auditors
and assessors they always tell you your

246
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:38,910
baby's ugly but it also gives you way to
get even more budget for the areas that

247
00:21:38,910 --> 00:21:46,120
you may or may not have been deficient
in one of the things that occurred was

248
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:52,899
after we were set up we became instead
of new acronym stock but more than the

249
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:57,840
security and network operations center
we became the security unit certainly

250
00:21:57,840 --> 00:22:04,820
not just guys on shift but guys running
projects with the business and I had

251
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:10,590
kind of anticipated that but I didn't
think it was gonna come so quickly and

252
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:14,260
it was a good thing because many times
your analysts who are monitoring your

253
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:17,760
network they don't know much about the
business they just do the packets so we

254
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,740
were able to get more integrated with
them and know what was more normal what

255
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:26,110
should be what shouldn't be and also
come up with new and inventive ways to

256
00:22:26,110 --> 00:22:33,770
help out those business units and we
also began to build a real computer

257
00:22:33,770 --> 00:22:37,440
emergency response team we're in the
process of using the trademark from

258
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:42,250
Carnegie Mellon and you have to involve
more than your aunty stuff for your eye

259
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:48,930
by a staff it's actually a team effort
involved PR because the last thing you

260
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:54,530
want to do is be Tony Hayward the VP CEO
at the time with the BB disaster having

261
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:57,080
a got your from the press of I just want

262
00:22:57,080 --> 00:23:01,689
back need to involve PR what if your
contracts can't be fulfilled because

263
00:23:01,690 --> 00:23:05,470
you've had an incident and there's a
delay involve your legal if you don't

264
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:11,320
have internal or external resources but
when you have an incident it is really

265
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:14,929
helpful because there's going to be mass
chaos you don't know what's going on

266
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:19,130
your communications might be down and if
you're trying to scramble and find

267
00:23:19,130 --> 00:23:25,070
people during an incident is it going to
cost a heck of a lot of money to try to

268
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:32,610
recover if you even can to try to plan
ahead a little bit lessons learned

269
00:23:32,610 --> 00:23:39,020
internally I had never seen a
cyberattack like what happened with

270
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:47,000
Saudi Aramco my former manager he showed
me a picture of himself before the

271
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:53,820
attack and had a full head of hair and
it was black when I met him he was

272
00:23:53,820 --> 00:24:00,340
falling challenging it was white so the
stress not just on the I T stuff around

273
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:06,899
the world the employees didn't know what
to do this it was like attacking the

274
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:12,320
Aramco family like if somebody broke
into your house and they didn't trust

275
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:17,280
computers they were act actually I
believe psychologically affected to the

276
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:23,899
point of PTSD from this because here's
something that they knew and it was

277
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:27,590
nothing anymore they had no more trust
it was compromised didn't know what was

278
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:34,520
going on so unfortunately because of
that we did have some setback I got a

279
00:24:34,520 --> 00:24:38,580
phone call one morning from a vendor
going what can we do to help you are

280
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:45,929
under attack again we are I didn't know
we were so I started calling around and

281
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:52,340
one of my guys or one of the guys at the
USU Lake look at Twitter and go look at

282
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,928
Twitter

283
00:24:53,929 --> 00:24:57,830
and unfortunately because of the panic
because of the psychological damage of

284
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:03,029
the UTech some employees in saudi and
Saudi Aramco decided taking pictures of

285
00:25:03,029 --> 00:25:07,230
their computers that they couldn't log
on posting it on Twitter and saying

286
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:12,850
we're under attack again we're under
attack that was a bit unfortunate a bit

287
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:18,998
scary but you also have to learn from
those things and I also highly recommend

288
00:25:18,999 --> 00:25:23,749
a good social media policy and to tell
your employees you know what if we get

289
00:25:23,749 --> 00:25:28,159
under attack firstly don't take pictures
of your computer please don't do that

290
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:34,759
secondly talk to a central area first to
ask questions but don't talk to the

291
00:25:34,759 --> 00:25:40,080
public don't talk to the press please
but just try to get control of it before

292
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:47,668
him a very positive results so another
thing I learned was unfortunately due to

293
00:25:47,669 --> 00:25:52,690
the distrust of the I T systems after
the attack everything had to be under

294
00:25:52,690 --> 00:25:59,580
super member strict security controls
are simple website change could take

295
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:04,279
three months to get approved and that's
when you're dealing with the business

296
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:07,899
unit so even though we're trying to be
approachable we ended up being the

297
00:26:07,899 --> 00:26:08,418
difference

298
00:26:08,419 --> 00:26:12,980
cold stare at the Sun to try to login
you're never gonna get your website

299
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:19,379
change so it was a challenge we're able
to work through it as much as possible

300
00:26:19,379 --> 00:26:23,939
but as far as I'm aware it's still a
challenge because it was quite a

301
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:28,850
devastating horrible stressful awful
attack so of course is going to be

302
00:26:28,850 --> 00:26:36,299
additional distrust in the ITT systems
so I liked this movie Hot Tub Time

303
00:26:36,299 --> 00:26:41,658
Machine I don't know why but there are
few things that I learned that I will

304
00:26:41,659 --> 00:26:47,649
take back and incorporate in myself or
any other job or any other consulting

305
00:26:47,649 --> 00:26:53,850
gig that I ever do and some of these
things were we became the security unit

306
00:26:53,850 --> 00:27:01,580
I had 10 does on a 24 by 7 shift who
were also helping to run projects

307
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,889
helping to run the pen testing

308
00:27:03,890 --> 00:27:10,190
or the vulnerability management will
also answering alerts so it became very

309
00:27:10,190 --> 00:27:16,860
problematic and there are some cultural
differences between especially northern

310
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:23,870
Europe and the Middle East where you
can't I'm a direct person I don't know

311
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:27,850
if it's because my former military I
don't know if it's because I'm very much

312
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:32,480
integrated and to the Netherlands and
we're known as very direct people but

313
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,820
communicating to the Middle East
especially Saudi you can't just say

314
00:27:37,820 --> 00:27:43,669
could you please respond to my email it
is how are you how are you doing how's

315
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:46,560
your white house your kids house 20
minutes worth of information that is

316
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:52,169
completely non work related just to get
you to look at me and that is very

317
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:57,630
difficult for someone like me so I
didn't really do my homework as much as

318
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:02,000
I should have and I should have really
worked on my communications as well as

319
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:06,110
the rest of my team because most of us
are very direct will just go hey we need

320
00:28:06,110 --> 00:28:13,199
there's no that's not correct hey
they're not used to that so you live you

321
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,250
learn and another thing about
specifically Saudi business culture

322
00:28:18,250 --> 00:28:22,950
differentiates itself from the rest of
the Middle East that you really have to

323
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:27,240
know somebody for twenty years before
you get on a first name basis with them

324
00:28:27,240 --> 00:28:32,780
and that became problematic because we
wanted to mature or intelligence we

325
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:39,700
wanted to go and we were moving more and
more towards that proactive response you

326
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:43,470
don't want to just be reactive you don't
wanna always be putting out fires you

327
00:28:43,470 --> 00:28:47,650
want to be able to get information
assets coming down so we began to talk

328
00:28:47,650 --> 00:28:53,840
to other national level certs and some
other peer companies like great we'd be

329
00:28:53,840 --> 00:29:00,120
willing to share information but can you
tell us a little bit about the attack

330
00:29:00,120 --> 00:29:06,810
it happened on august 15 now I don't
have much information for you think you

331
00:29:06,810 --> 00:29:12,740
could buy so that was that was difficult
there was a challenge and it was very

332
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:18,140
much a challenge to try to communicate
upwards to go listen if we want to be

333
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:19,490
proactive

334
00:29:19,490 --> 00:29:23,950
we're gonna have to change this a little
bit and it's a really big change so that

335
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:29,250
was one of the more challenging things I
had but at the same time we were able to

336
00:29:29,250 --> 00:29:34,880
do what we needed to do so in conclusion

337
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:40,580
try to save some time for a few
questions yes they did experience a very

338
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:46,699
devastating attack on the business
operations and no email from month that

339
00:29:46,700 --> 00:30:00,300
sucks cash machines by a fax machine and
Amsterdam but it is recoverable if you

340
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:05,120
plan ahead a little bit just a little
bit the cost to recover from an attack

341
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:11,590
is going to be a lot less you can change
people you can change the security

342
00:30:11,590 --> 00:30:15,610
culture might take some time might take
some budget it might take some effort

343
00:30:15,610 --> 00:30:19,050
but you can and it is possible

344
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:28,740
always try to incorporate those past
experiences and a lot of people you know

345
00:30:28,740 --> 00:30:32,790
when it comes to the lessons learnt from
an incident that's probably the worst

346
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:37,310
part of the incident handling because
it's really over done correctly try to

347
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:41,690
do that even with your minor incidents
and see how it affects things and

348
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:47,580
incorporated in so you can recover but
also if you think the impervious to

349
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:56,220
attack this affected the most valuable
company in the world it's worth per

350
00:30:56,220 --> 00:31:01,530
Wikipedia several years ago over 10
trillion dollars the country of India

351
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:06,450
announced a couple of weeks ago that
they want to hike up their economy to be

352
00:31:06,450 --> 00:31:10,429
two trillion dollars so

353
00:31:10,429 --> 00:31:16,679
if you think that you won't get attacked
or you're not attractive target or you

354
00:31:16,679 --> 00:31:21,539
know when power abuse this was most
valuable company who got knocked down

355
00:31:21,539 --> 00:31:26,559
temporarily and because she wants
valuable company it's probably the only

356
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:33,889
company that would have been able to
recover in the way that it did when the

357
00:31:33,889 --> 00:31:39,600
attack occurred and it wiped the hard
drugs and wipe the data they needed hard

358
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:45,600
drives immediately and Saudi Aramco owns
the largest private fleet of aircraft

359
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:51,119
they even have for airport in the United
States dedicated to themselves at the

360
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:56,499
time so just recovered from some floods
in the natural disaster to Saudi Aramco

361
00:31:56,499 --> 00:32:03,080
said we need a lot of hard drives we
need a whole hard drugs spoke to a

362
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:08,139
coworker about it and he said he'd never
seen so many zeros on paper and real

363
00:32:08,139 --> 00:32:13,178
life and they flew their private fleet
of aircraft to pick up those hard drives

364
00:32:13,179 --> 00:32:18,269
from the production floor so if you
bought a computer or hard drive from

365
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:27,659
September 2012 until about January 2013
you actually paid a small tax because

366
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:30,850
Saudi Aramco up the price of hard drives

367
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:35,408
they needed to recover immediately but
at the same time it's a really big

368
00:32:35,409 --> 00:32:41,970
company 25% of the world's energy they
needed to recover quickly so you can

369
00:32:41,970 --> 00:32:49,889
recover but try to plan ahead because
it'll be a lot less costly I don't know

370
00:32:49,889 --> 00:32:54,139
exactly how much it costs to recover but
I was speaking to some folks who

371
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:59,029
initially responded to the incident
outside consultants yesterday we were

372
00:32:59,029 --> 00:33:05,879
thinking even above the Powerball what
it costs to recover maybe half a billion

373
00:33:05,879 --> 00:33:08,780
so

374
00:33:08,780 --> 00:33:14,550
you can recover but try to plan ahead
cuz unless you're Saudi Aramco you might

375
00:33:14,550 --> 00:33:22,419
know one thing I want to do before I
conclude is thank the ITN ICS staff at

376
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:27,550
Saudi Aramco Aramco services company
Aramco overseas they did in the main

377
00:33:27,550 --> 00:33:32,300
seeing job responding to the incident
they do fantastic work

378
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:36,790
isolating recovering bringing things
back up and they continue to do so and

379
00:33:36,790 --> 00:33:44,110
without them and their teamwork recovery
would not have been possible so I've got

380
00:33:44,110 --> 00:33:48,840
a few time for a few moments for
questions if anybody has questions thank

381
00:33:48,840 --> 00:34:09,889
you very much

382
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:24,440
the rest of the MENA region or for North
America at the time of the attack there

383
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:30,940
is this the ones are over in saudi at
the time so suddenly Sox had to be set

384
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:35,540
up in their major areas around the world
to recover and make sure that the moment

385
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:39,290
that they connected that they were
secure they did not want to reconnect

386
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:46,080
and then get hit again that was the last
thing they want to do any more questions

387
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:51,340
a hard time seeing you have a question
what would with an unlimited budget you

388
00:34:51,340 --> 00:34:57,080
can do unlimited things what advice
would you give to the other 99% of

389
00:34:57,080 --> 00:35:02,440
companies who could not recover to this
extent perhaps collaborating in a joint

390
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:07,720
venture vs trying to do it all alone I
would say collaborate on joint venture

391
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:13,500
in if you have a lot of small companies
in the same type of market I would say

392
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:17,290
collaborate absolutely then he can
leverage each other's talents and work a

393
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:22,920
bit more as a team we had situations
such as up petrol from anonymous that

394
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:27,500
would announce things are going well and
gas companies so we wanted to make sure

395
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:32,440
that we collaborated with some of her
peers are you getting a knock on your

396
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:36,960
door yet is there anybody scanning you
in a weird way what's going on what do

397
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:42,180
you think about this post you do have to
collaborate with your peers and it is a

398
00:35:42,180 --> 00:35:49,870
really good way to save on your itu
security budget another question so I

399
00:35:49,870 --> 00:35:55,759
was wondering if you had attempted to
bring in anybody from inside already

400
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,690
inside Aramco from any of the server
administration staff into the security

401
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:06,410
world and whether you had any success or
failure with that yes so a lot of people

402
00:36:06,410 --> 00:36:14,390
were pool 91 over ties to security and
there was some success some not

403
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:19,769
it's a different mindset going from
servers and infrastructure

404
00:36:19,769 --> 00:36:26,578
administration to that we're logical
somewhat a logical way that security

405
00:36:26,579 --> 00:36:33,170
analyst will think and you also have to
have that tinge of evilness a little bit

406
00:36:33,170 --> 00:36:38,039
of grey hat because you have to
understand how somebody would take

407
00:36:38,039 --> 00:36:43,960
advantage of a situation so you can have
success with regularity staff as long as

408
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:55,279
they are slightly evil that answers your
question one question right here as

409
00:36:55,279 --> 00:37:00,210
quickly as possible so time-consuming to
get a whole bunch of hard drives and

410
00:37:00,210 --> 00:37:04,260
then also try to recover the data they
were going forward but they needed to

411
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:08,339
get set up as quickly as possible

412
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:12,920
hi I'm sure there's some details you can
share but could you be more specific

413
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:18,049
about the type of people you've
recruited the size of the team and also

414
00:37:18,049 --> 00:37:23,099
understands kind of a triage situation
but did you focus on processes first

415
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:24,589
then tools

416
00:37:24,589 --> 00:37:29,210
cried enough time to do a whole risk
assessment and the normal thanks

417
00:37:29,210 --> 00:37:36,480
well it's a continuous risk assessment
and the type of people that we recruited

418
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:44,250
were weird and wonderful people they
could have an MBA they could have a PhD

419
00:37:44,250 --> 00:37:50,230
in intrusion detection they could have
absolutely no degree but some amazing

420
00:37:50,230 --> 00:37:56,240
work online and get help account which
you have an interview with The get help

421
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:57,038
account

422
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:08,819
take a look we recruited a lot of staff
probably within my team there is at

423
00:38:08,819 --> 00:38:16,808
least 11 and in the other team's who's
probably + 20 there were added so that

424
00:38:16,809 --> 00:38:20,990
answers your question we see

425
00:38:20,990 --> 00:38:27,310
very high so i was just curious I think
you mentioned that you recruited your

426
00:38:27,310 --> 00:38:33,100
security team from zero was their
existing I T staff already on site and

427
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:37,630
there was was there any investigation
look into a possibility of any sort of

428
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:44,650
an inside job you guys look into that at
all or are kind of just accept everyone

429
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:50,300
kind of you for that would have been
handled by Saudi Aramco since the

430
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:55,890
majority of the TUC hit there there were
a couple of existing I T staff members

431
00:38:55,890 --> 00:39:01,500
at Aramco overseas they had been there
for a very long time and lost a lot of

432
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:07,670
hair but they didn't have the type of
access it would have taken to do this

433
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:13,220
type of attack over in saudi arabia so I
know a lot of things were looked up at

434
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:16,799
looked at them personally can't really
go into much more detail because things

435
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,869
are still under investigation by the
Saudi Arabian government

436
00:39:19,869 --> 00:39:25,380
follow-up would would you expect that
sort of a piece to be a part of this

437
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:30,740
situation is really unique in that you
came in with a zero sum game began 10

438
00:39:30,740 --> 00:39:34,879
right carte blanche so is there a
strategy around that when you are

439
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:39,619
attacked and you you look at that
recoveries are process or procedure in

440
00:39:39,619 --> 00:39:43,200
place of how do you counted how do you
kinda make sure that everyone on the

441
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:49,930
team is as clean as it makes sense well
we did extensive background checks on

442
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:55,310
folks quite extensive actually above
beyond what you would just get your

443
00:39:55,310 --> 00:40:01,619
regular background check company we also
did was illegal

444
00:40:01,619 --> 00:40:09,329
taking a look at their online presence
there were any dishes posts suspect

445
00:40:09,329 --> 00:40:17,880
criminal hacker areas so we tried to
take a very very deep look at people but

446
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:23,230
at the same time we also had to get
stuff who also did belong to some of

447
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:28,859
those groups to get the information from
those groups as well so it's kind of a

448
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:36,960
fine line but you can kind of tell
pretty instantly personal be I had one

449
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,289
interviewee that came in we asked him
why would you like to work for Ramco

450
00:40:41,289 --> 00:40:46,440
oversee security operations center and
he said well if I'm a member of the IIS

451
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:51,930
that means that I can get access to the
CEO schedules so we should thank you

452
00:40:51,930 --> 00:40:59,348
very much for coming good part of them
so you have to be careful but taking a

453
00:40:59,349 --> 00:41:03,420
deeper look and also their attitude
watching them when they start seeing how

454
00:41:03,420 --> 00:41:04,759
they work

455
00:41:04,759 --> 00:41:09,400
seeing what access and things that they
try to look at and keeping a tight leash

456
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:15,049
on them for at least one to two months
maybe even longer just to make sure that

457
00:41:15,049 --> 00:41:17,970
you do have to be careful

458
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:22,390
thank you thank you anyone pressure you
mentioned during you talk the

459
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:26,720
sensitivities to cultural differences
you mention that specifically the end

460
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:32,399
and relationships that time it has to be
cultivated really get access to speak

461
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:37,380
more shoot any potential issues relating
to gender that you specifically had to

462
00:41:37,380 --> 00:41:40,869
be dangerous your direct Chris right so
you're an accomplished woman with a lot

463
00:41:40,869 --> 00:41:45,369
of experience you know very capable and
directed yourself self described how was

464
00:41:45,369 --> 00:41:48,440
that taken to an weather issues with
that and it again if you were to give

465
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:51,999
advice to anybody else was dealing with
these countries in this region he said

466
00:41:51,999 --> 00:41:56,529
incidents what advice would be well when
I first got the phone call to notify I

467
00:41:56,529 --> 00:42:01,930
go by cross of Christina I asked to jump
on the way

468
00:42:01,930 --> 00:42:03,060
well

469
00:42:03,060 --> 00:42:09,820
I just got used to it and it also when I
was aircrew it was the only way that I

470
00:42:09,820 --> 00:42:13,800
could put my name on my bad cuz my name
is Christina conducted in Medina imagine

471
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:18,580
putting that on the mir crew badge so I
started getting them by Chris and I

472
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:25,460
asked the gentleman they didn't want a
woman right i mean i i go by Chris and I

473
00:42:25,460 --> 00:42:29,530
only have a couple of photographs of May
1 with short hair but they do know I'ma

474
00:42:29,530 --> 00:42:36,640
woman right now go absolutely the
question didn't come up so of course

475
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:39,580
challenges whenever you're a little
different but you get that anywhere

476
00:42:39,580 --> 00:42:41,509
anywhere

477
00:42:41,510 --> 00:42:46,530
their focus was to try to find the best
people not gender we had an

478
00:42:46,530 --> 00:42:49,820
international team they weren't even
concerned with that they wanted the best

479
00:42:49,820 --> 00:42:58,070
people to gender didn't come into it was
your question thanks you have any other

480
00:42:58,070 --> 00:43:05,190
questions they were go not sure if
you're able to disclose this information

481
00:43:05,190 --> 00:43:10,470
or not but i was just wondering during
this particular experience or any of

482
00:43:10,470 --> 00:43:18,069
your other experiences was there any
sort of interaction in operation however

483
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:23,900
you want to call it with government and
its so was that helpful a hindrance

484
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:26,030
somewhere in the middle

485
00:43:26,030 --> 00:43:32,620
just curious there there was a bit of a
hindrance when Remco overseas initially

486
00:43:32,620 --> 00:43:38,150
contacted the Dutch national search
they're called in CIS I believe all

487
00:43:38,150 --> 00:43:43,420
these lovely acronyms and ninety the
Dutch search unfortunately had to turn

488
00:43:43,420 --> 00:43:48,310
them away because they were only set up
for government and military but not for

489
00:43:48,310 --> 00:43:50,640
private sector to the size of the room

490
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:55,650
overseas even for private energy
companies unfortunately that's still the

491
00:43:55,650 --> 00:43:59,170
case that Dutch served as a little
behind so they were completely unable to

492
00:43:59,170 --> 00:44:01,970
help us and there was a shame so

493
00:44:01,970 --> 00:44:05,649
a whole bunch of external security
consultants from around the world had to

494
00:44:05,650 --> 00:44:08,700
so that answers your question

495
00:44:08,700 --> 00:44:15,980
just a quick follow it was that you need
to I was kind of asking that question

496
00:44:15,980 --> 00:44:25,119
under the assumption that Aramco by some
type of state sponsored investment and

497
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:29,210
the company made so maybe I was wrong
with that but have you been have you

498
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:36,890
been involved in experiences with the
company that owned by the government or

499
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:44,330
has a heavily investment by the by the
government that did or didn't allow you

500
00:44:44,330 --> 00:44:50,390
to respond to an incident as a bolt yes
I actually went overseas company is

501
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:53,810
wholly owned by Saudi Arabia Saudi
Aramco which is owned by the Saudi

502
00:44:53,810 --> 00:44:58,730
Arabian government now I did find some
difficulties even though and I am an

503
00:44:58,730 --> 00:45:07,880
American citizen discussing things with
say DHS ICS search that the deposed

504
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:13,089
difficulty and so we instead tried to
leverage that and lead to more closely

505
00:45:13,089 --> 00:45:19,150
on our american affiliates to try to get
those relationships going but it was

506
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:25,180
difficult because it's a Saudi Arabian
government owned company and some

507
00:45:25,180 --> 00:45:30,220
countries and organizations might not
want to talk to you or might not be able

508
00:45:30,220 --> 00:45:37,180
to thank you thank you any other
questions yes

509
00:45:37,180 --> 00:45:43,950
what kind of my question to question my
first question is what kind of advice

510
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:50,319
you'd like to give the students a
chemist Rudin who wants to pursue their

511
00:45:50,319 --> 00:45:55,040
I disagree daddy and my second question
is when

512
00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:02,759
has been done as you mentioned the
company's almost broken and that kind of

513
00:46:02,760 --> 00:46:12,880
situation what advice do leaker like
what is the first attempt as they employ

514
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:20,089
as a university student are any sector
what should we do

515
00:46:20,089 --> 00:46:27,299
the first question is as a student build
a home lab and start exploring there are

516
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:32,559
a lot of free resources and places and
websites that specifically say try to

517
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:36,200
hack me try to look at these
vulnerabilities use this free

518
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:43,020
vulnerability scanner start building out
things at home my my presentation laptop

519
00:46:43,020 --> 00:46:48,170
when when you see me step off the stage
it's about that big because it's a lot

520
00:46:48,170 --> 00:46:53,819
of memory and I have actually an entire
isolated malware allowed running on it

521
00:46:53,819 --> 00:47:01,020
anytime I want and do what you want to
do at home and start learning hands-on

522
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:05,339
because in the university setting it's
entirely too theoretical it's not

523
00:47:05,339 --> 00:47:10,529
applied and start doing it while you
study you'll learn a lot I also

524
00:47:10,530 --> 00:47:13,869
recommend a friend of mine just came out
with the really good book

525
00:47:13,869 --> 00:47:20,950
Georgia real diamond and if you read her
book basically how to be a penetration

526
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:25,399
tester but it has all of the PM's

527
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:28,970
not the PM's but I'll tell you how to
set up the BM's whether you want to lean

528
00:47:28,970 --> 00:47:34,230
more towards vulnerability assessment
and testing or just seeing how it works

529
00:47:34,230 --> 00:47:39,950
it's a step-by-step guide I highly
recommend this as in terms of the

530
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:43,308
recovery I would say probably the first
thing that you would want to do is if

531
00:47:43,309 --> 00:47:45,520
you're under massive attack

532
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:52,020
communicate with your employees or in
this case at a university your students

533
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:58,640
to say we recognize something is wrong
we might not hold on hold on a moment we

534
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:02,890
will get back with you once we know more
we do know something's going on here is

535
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:09,109
an office or a place where you can ask
questions but keep it controlled control

536
00:48:09,110 --> 00:48:12,510
communications if you don't you're gonna
have one person saying another thing in

537
00:48:12,510 --> 00:48:15,780
a Twitter person saying another thing
that that's the first thing is to kind

538
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:21,110
of coordinate communications and let
people know we know something's going on

539
00:48:21,110 --> 00:48:26,220
don't panic just contact us for
questions that's what I would say thank

540
00:48:26,220 --> 00:48:34,270
you thank you

541
00:48:34,270 --> 00:48:38,460
the question was that we have to make
social media policies while Souter was

542
00:48:38,460 --> 00:48:43,200
going you know the social media policies
came a bit after me there were some

543
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:49,540
existing ones but obviously they had to
be retuned to situations such as to take

544
00:48:49,540 --> 00:48:54,270
pictures of computers and put it on
Twitter so we had to constantly return

545
00:48:54,270 --> 00:49:00,480
them but you have to do that for any
time something new comes up any further

546
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:05,870
questions yes as you made the transition
from security network operations center

547
00:49:05,870 --> 00:49:10,270
and Rural Hall security unit did you
wrote a personnel between EUR analyst

548
00:49:10,270 --> 00:49:14,460
group and your engineering group that
was working with other business units

549
00:49:14,460 --> 00:49:19,050
and did you find value from that we
didn't do a lot of what we call shoulder

550
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:25,020
surfer so we would sit next to those
business units to see what they were

551
00:49:25,020 --> 00:49:29,720
doing how they were doing it and figure
out ways that we could actually enable

552
00:49:29,720 --> 00:49:32,759
their business because we turned into
the No group which we didn't want to do

553
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:37,090
we wanted the business to go but we had
to be able to turn things on in a secure

554
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:41,870
manner so we did put people with those
business units side-by-side to go okay

555
00:49:41,870 --> 00:49:46,049
show me how you work today and let me
see what I can do to make it better and

556
00:49:46,050 --> 00:49:50,690
it was extremely helpful thank you thank
you

557
00:49:50,690 --> 00:49:57,090
so having had this experience being able
to go ahead and tell other companies

558
00:49:57,090 --> 00:50:03,460
look what's happened you're not too big
to blow up do you still fight every time

559
00:50:03,460 --> 00:50:06,920
you see a new customer and you say this
is gonna be the bill you still fighting

560
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:11,960
with them yes but I also think it's a
bit of terminology I think we need to

561
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:18,620
step away from the words security and
talk about risk because executives

562
00:50:18,620 --> 00:50:24,020
understand risk management understand
risk so instead of a security operations

563
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:28,030
center I would say the risk mitigation
and Protection Center because that would

564
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:32,620
actually be easier to understand if we
talk in their language they're going to

565
00:50:32,620 --> 00:50:37,390
understand us and we're gonna be able to
understand them maybe eventually but we

566
00:50:37,390 --> 00:50:43,250
need to speak the same types of terms
with them it's a different world

567
00:50:43,250 --> 00:50:52,210
other questions

568
00:50:52,210 --> 00:50:59,030
ladies and gentlemen it's been a
pleasure speaking with you today have a

569
00:50:59,030 --> 00:50:59,420
great day
