1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,920
so you are a in the session here
bringing a Canon t1i fight deciphering

2
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,210
China's offensive cyber weapon and
encourage you to make sure your cell

3
00:00:10,210 --> 00:00:15,870
phones on vibrate as those distractions
and appreciated so without further ado

4
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:25,848
will pass the stage first off thanks for
having us here we really appreciate the

5
00:00:25,849 --> 00:00:29,210
opportunity to talk about this this is
something that you're honest and I were

6
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:33,309
very interested in from the beginning
when the great can enforce made its

7
00:00:33,309 --> 00:00:37,820
appearance and it was really unique we
just kind of coming out from two

8
00:00:37,820 --> 00:00:43,390
completely different angles so my name
is Adam Cody I'm a security researcher

9
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:50,000
with crushed right and I've been in
China hand for several years and I'm you

10
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,559
on Etsy I'm actually from germany as he
might might might be able to tell and

11
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:57,739
I'm doing something quite different from
cozy but still we decided to do this

12
00:00:57,739 --> 00:00:58,898
presentation together

13
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:02,260
yeah it was really cool about it as I
came out it from the China aspect and he

14
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:06,908
came in a very technical aspects we met
in the middle and just had piles of

15
00:01:06,909 --> 00:01:11,939
research basically so we're here with
with crops like that sorry that's our

16
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:15,080
company but this is a little bit
different than probably what you guys

17
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:17,590
are used to with our tigers and bears oh
my

18
00:01:17,590 --> 00:01:23,450
sort of thing so this is just a little
bit different so today first off we're

19
00:01:23,450 --> 00:01:27,250
just gonna run you through those of you
not familiar with the great candidate so

20
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:31,369
we're gonna do what happened kind of a
timeline of events leading up to it

21
00:01:31,369 --> 00:01:35,439
we're also going to talk about the Great
Firewall a little bit that's going to be

22
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:40,970
important because it's really hard to
understand kind of the background of the

23
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:44,189
great Canon without getting into the
Great Firewall because it's hosted on a

24
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:48,829
lot of the same infrastructure then
we're gonna go ahead and talk about kind

25
00:01:48,829 --> 00:01:51,100
of clean up what you can do to protect
yourself

26
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,710
countermeasures all these different
things and possibly a little bit on

27
00:01:55,710 --> 00:02:01,990
attribution you know who is actually
running this thing so before we get

28
00:02:01,990 --> 00:02:03,490
going here

29
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:09,269
normal disclaimers you guys can read
that one but no I'm gonna need offer

30
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,770
Chinese friends in the audience

31
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:20,700
Iowa young Joe Sheehan jungle pugwash
would show young John me wrong sure you

32
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:30,660
go to issue following that cut you may
remove the comment made by drunk she

33
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:44,470
found your hand although we define soon
John Chiang not sure why shouldn't child

34
00:02:44,470 --> 00:02:51,180
drew to a close shave for us that up

35
00:02:51,180 --> 00:03:01,040
chef on sending so ordered out with a
guy and that's basically just to say

36
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:07,290
that this is not meant to be a China
bashing presentation this is this is

37
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:11,858
like we conducted this is purely
academic research but it is pretty clear

38
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:15,209
that China was behind this and so we're
going to be talking a little bit about

39
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:19,500
that and as the audience what we want
you to understand is that China views

40
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:23,150
this completely differently than the
west and so we're hoping to kind of in

41
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:29,630
part that on you that from their
perspective it's very different so let's

42
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:31,060
get into the great Canon

43
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,900
inside joke so you're researching but
pretty much all of them ended with

44
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:41,250
that's what she said alright let's set
up with what actually happened for those

45
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,859
of you not familiar with the great Canon
so on March 19 of this year there was a

46
00:03:45,859 --> 00:03:49,430
website this website called create fire
and they put it on the block that

47
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:54,420
they've been that they've become on the
details to take it was two point six

48
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,179
billion

49
00:03:55,180 --> 00:03:59,889
requests Bella and to put that into some
context that would have meant that

50
00:03:59,889 --> 00:04:04,530
they're hosting coast with Amazon Cloud
fund would have shut up shut up to

51
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:09,299
$30,000 a day which obviously this is
not something that a website like this

52
00:04:09,299 --> 00:04:16,769
can handle about a week later get up on
it said his blog posted on March 26

53
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:21,060
they've identified and you don't have
taken the mediating it and what follows

54
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:28,520
is like five days off permanent status
updates as they tried to try to counter

55
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:33,159
measures to counter the attack as the
attack it seems to be involved evolving

56
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:39,419
and increasing in volume and the same
time there were quite a few postings on

57
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:43,930
Chinese language forums and bought where
people complain that they would go to

58
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:49,289
completely harmless websites like big
website likes the scene I don't call me

59
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:53,490
and they would get this done us but the
load and you could see that they can to

60
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:57,270
know this javascript is the same on both
pages although they are completely

61
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:04,859
unrelated and then on march 31st the
attack on get up actually stopped so

62
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:10,969
let's talk about bad file what does it
do great fires website censorship

63
00:05:10,969 --> 00:05:16,479
monitoring in terms of the Great
Firewall of China so what they trick is

64
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:20,159
the kind of websites that are being
blocked by China and also the kind of

65
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:23,460
keywords that are being blocked you can
imagine like a search keyword good

66
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,109
combination of search keywords which
would need to the connection being

67
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:33,250
dropped so that's one one thing they do
the other thing is that they also host

68
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:39,580
and develop and split second censorship
circumvention tools on their website ok

69
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:44,659
so pretty obvious why great fire might
not be the most popular website to the

70
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:48,659
Chinese administration but what does
that have to do with get up right so

71
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:54,740
great fire actually uses a concept which
is called collateral freedom which

72
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:59,120
basically means that they host their
stuff somewhere that would be

73
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,219
prohibitive in terms of economic costs
for the Chinese government to block so

74
00:06:04,219 --> 00:06:09,330
they actually have repositories and get
up where they have this this website on

75
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:13,729
the left kind of web side that they get
up a positive and it includes these

76
00:06:13,729 --> 00:06:18,669
tools like Android apps to circumvent
the Great Firewall and guides and stuff

77
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:23,270
like that but it also includes Western
newspapers Chinese traditions of Western

78
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:27,570
newspapers like the New York Times on
the BBC and these actually live on the

79
00:06:27,570 --> 00:06:28,248
get up

80
00:06:28,249 --> 00:06:33,779
wiki pages so they get updated daily on
github pages and dad is because

81
00:06:33,779 --> 00:06:39,109
obviously you use a GPS the Great
Firewall cannot distinguish traffic

82
00:06:39,109 --> 00:06:42,419
that's going to get up whether it's
going to one of these repositories to

83
00:06:42,419 --> 00:06:47,039
any of the other repositories they don't
care about so the only way they may be

84
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,308
able to block that content would be to
block get half off completely and that's

85
00:06:51,309 --> 00:06:55,949
not something they can do a lot of
economic reasons the same is true

86
00:06:55,949 --> 00:07:02,379
obviously forked out front another cloud
providers so to put that into context

87
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:08,759
kind of the timeline of the offensive
activities of the Chinese censorship

88
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:15,479
apparatus we're starting out on January
2013 when the Chinese government

89
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:21,029
actually block it up for about five days
so they blocked it out right because

90
00:07:21,029 --> 00:07:25,219
that's the only thing they can really
can do and there was a huge backlash

91
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:29,029
against that because people need told
them we cannot work without access to

92
00:07:29,029 --> 00:07:34,379
get up and so they had to do that and
and made it available again and as a

93
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:37,499
result of that people actually started
collecting list of people who were

94
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:41,649
responsible for creating the Great
Firewall again they created this list on

95
00:07:41,649 --> 00:07:48,669
get up then you can see a number of pls
man in the middle it takes and against

96
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:53,709
popular so this is some of them were
limited to the Chinese research network

97
00:07:53,709 --> 00:07:58,299
the Senate but all of them used like a
signed certificate so it's very obvious

98
00:07:58,299 --> 00:08:02,959
that they'd get some of the middle end
and not many people actually fell for

99
00:08:02,959 --> 00:08:06,849
that also there was a DDoS attack
against the hook it up

100
00:08:06,849 --> 00:08:11,009
Hong Kong popular vote website where
they had this kind of referendum going

101
00:08:11,009 --> 00:08:14,849
on and they had set up a website to pull
people in advance of the extra

102
00:08:14,849 --> 00:08:18,849
referendum to kind of get an idea of
what people actually really wanting to

103
00:08:18,849 --> 00:08:23,159
vote vote for and that was also does it
take and once again this was hosted on

104
00:08:23,159 --> 00:08:28,998
on cloud infrastructure in this case and
they were able to kind of me to get the

105
00:08:28,999 --> 00:08:36,269
attack so all of that leads up to the
great Canada takes in March this year

106
00:08:36,269 --> 00:08:41,460
and one might see these are isolated
incidents all people

107
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:46,070
testing some technology inside of china
but we think of that as more progression

108
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:54,840
towards a common goal and which is the
Chinese side I seventy and they realize

109
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:00,170
they have to have something like a great
canon because the approaches they tried

110
00:09:00,170 --> 00:09:02,650
to block sites like it up

111
00:09:02,650 --> 00:09:14,660
didn't really work ok everyone is
laughing about the South I think the we

112
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:18,800
have to get into the Great Firewall just
a little bit because to fully understand

113
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:24,760
how it came about is really important to
understand the progression that led to

114
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:29,830
the great cannon and basically the
reason I like Your Highness was talking

115
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:33,920
about that this was this was a series of
events that used some of the similar

116
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:36,969
infrastructure to the Great Firewall and
then progressed it even further to make

117
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:43,000
it a more kind of offensive weapon so of
course it takes its name from the Great

118
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Wall of China which fittingly was used
to keep out invaders and yes that was

119
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,800
gifted by basically by the Chinese
medicines at the time when we think of

120
00:09:54,800 --> 00:10:00,040
with the Great Firewall is actually an
amalgamation of many many projects you

121
00:10:00,040 --> 00:10:05,300
know thousands of hours of research and
different projects this kind of started

122
00:10:05,300 --> 00:10:10,709
basically so in 1987 China sent its
first email which fittingly stated

123
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:13,190
across the great wall we can reach every
corner of the world

124
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:16,720
slightly ironic I don't think we
realized how little they were talking

125
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:24,310
when they said after that the Internet
was slowly coming into China but we have

126
00:10:24,310 --> 00:10:27,660
to understand is it didn't happen as
organically as it did in Western

127
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:31,270
societies so the internet was a little
bit slower to catch on in China be

128
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:36,689
commercialized but it was very very well
planned and they did this by actually

129
00:10:36,690 --> 00:10:39,940
you know structuring it so that all of
the main international traffic would

130
00:10:39,940 --> 00:10:44,860
come in through different points so in
the beginning most of the actual

131
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:51,670
backbone of the Chinese Internet was of
course military and academic use so we

132
00:10:51,670 --> 00:10:53,469
have the Chinese academic now

133
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:57,050
which the Chinese Academy of Sciences
Tsinghua University and Peking

134
00:10:57,050 --> 00:11:03,420
University all use and then the more
commercial ChinaNet which was run by

135
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:10,819
China Telecom then in 1997 as this was
coming on the Chinese government wanted

136
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:16,150
a way to kind of start keeping track of
Internet users and who was you know how

137
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:19,370
the commercialization of the internet
was going to affect the Chinese economy

138
00:11:19,370 --> 00:11:24,760
they created CN neck which is the
National Information Center which

139
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:30,840
basically sort of conducting all types
of research on how to basically how to

140
00:11:30,840 --> 00:11:34,770
monitor all of the people in China and
what they were using the Internet for

141
00:11:34,770 --> 00:11:39,380
and one of the first studies actually
found that most of the users in China

142
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:44,590
where 18 to 24 and didn't have more than
a high school education level and we're

143
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:48,560
saying some kind of revolutionary things
so that was one of the very first

144
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:52,400
reports that seen it put out and so that
was something that was a huge interest

145
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:57,310
to the communist party are saying okay
like there's the potential for anyone to

146
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:02,449
basically put their ideas out there
neway is actually the current cyber czar

147
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:08,020
of China made kind of reference in
December at a conference I was at that

148
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:13,100
basically was comparing it to the
YouTube comments and saying that like

149
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:19,370
people were just posting random you know
kind of stuff that wasn't wasn't in line

150
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:23,720
with what the Communist Party was
looking to have on the internet so then

151
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,660
in April 1999 there was a giant Falun
Gong demonstration to spiritual movement

152
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:33,839
that has since been outlawed in China
but in April they basically gathered

153
00:12:33,840 --> 00:12:38,580
around Jang Nan Hai which is the kind of
their party parliamentary building and

154
00:12:38,580 --> 00:12:42,280
10,000 people just came in just sat down
and that was a little bit shocking for

155
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:46,790
the Communist Party they probably had
some flashbacks the tiananmen and being

156
00:12:46,790 --> 00:12:52,329
like wow yeah there are a lot of people
that can rise up at any time and the

157
00:12:52,330 --> 00:12:55,940
other thing was that the phone gone had
actually been fairly early adopters of

158
00:12:55,940 --> 00:13:04,490
using the internet to kind of yes
organize their their Meetups show the

159
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:05,379
movements

160
00:13:05,379 --> 00:13:09,419
and you know kind of preach that the
philosophy that they were talking about

161
00:13:09,419 --> 00:13:13,579
online so they were early online
adopters and as a result that was

162
00:13:13,579 --> 00:13:17,660
something that stuck out in the
Communist Party's mine so in June 1999

163
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:21,608
they created something called the center
which we're going to talk about a little

164
00:13:21,609 --> 00:13:27,169
bit more first a quick word on the
Golden Shield project if you go to

165
00:13:27,169 --> 00:13:29,709
Wikipedia right now and you look at the
Great Firewall you're going to be left

166
00:13:29,709 --> 00:13:34,179
with the impression that it's just the
Golden Shield project that's only partly

167
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:37,389
true so like I said that what we think
of as the Great Firewall is this

168
00:13:37,389 --> 00:13:41,809
amalgamation of many projects and the
Golden Shield is kind of part of it it

169
00:13:41,809 --> 00:13:46,598
focuses more on security this is run by
the Ministry of Public Security and is

170
00:13:46,599 --> 00:13:51,220
more designed to do surveillance and
have you know inability to where they

171
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:54,509
see people posting so that they don't
like actually track them down and arrest

172
00:13:54,509 --> 00:14:00,669
them or shut the internet off where the
Great Firewall was much cheaper they had

173
00:14:00,669 --> 00:14:05,189
better researchers and it was really
designed to be more of a censorship tool

174
00:14:05,189 --> 00:14:11,399
only and soda bottle necking all the
traffic there's kind of a zoomed out you

175
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:17,689
the Chinese internet so as I mentioned
those early three national level nodes

176
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:23,069
you can see up there it's basically the
kind of blue triangle between Beijing

177
00:14:23,069 --> 00:14:26,639
Shanghai and Guangzhou so pretty much
all of the international traffic was

178
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:30,189
being funneled through their which like
I said it was very planned out to make

179
00:14:30,189 --> 00:14:33,939
sure that that that's how they could
control of traffic all of its coming

180
00:14:33,939 --> 00:14:41,449
into their so the center it's got a big
long name which you guys can read if I

181
00:14:41,449 --> 00:14:45,478
say that every time it's gonna take
awhile so we just referred to it as the

182
00:14:45,479 --> 00:14:54,059
center while looking building the so
when it was created there's not a whole

183
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:58,228
lot of public information about the
center those of you who read the Citizen

184
00:14:58,229 --> 00:15:02,479
lab report which actually named the
great Canon getting a process that they

185
00:15:02,479 --> 00:15:08,459
did a fantastic job of that report
detailing it but they mentioned just

186
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:12,149
very briefly in there the center and
talk about how there's not a ton of

187
00:15:12,149 --> 00:15:15,100
public information and we found
basically the same thing

188
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:18,820
so I started doing some more research
and part of the reason is because it's

189
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:23,810
actually co-located with CNC but the
answer wasn't actually created in 22

190
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:29,810
2001 which should give you some idea of
the importance that they placed on the

191
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:35,260
center they immediately afford it a lot
of powers to go into research and start

192
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:39,700
working on sort of a web content
filtering censorship tool that would

193
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:46,230
basically become the precursor to the
Great Firewall and so the fact that they

194
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:51,250
actually you know created that part
first before they're even worried about

195
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:55,070
any offensive the tax which is normally
what she answered as your emergency

196
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:58,930
readiness team is going to respond to
you know national level incidents and

197
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:02,420
stuff like that so the fact that they
were really prepping to have the

198
00:16:02,420 --> 00:16:06,199
censorship to up and running before that
is kind of shows where their priorities

199
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:11,780
we're so throughout the history of the
center there were all these multiple

200
00:16:11,780 --> 00:16:14,670
Science and Technology Award that were
given out you look at some of their

201
00:16:14,670 --> 00:16:17,920
patents and the researchers that were
part of the center and their patents

202
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,099
they all had to do with web content
filtering on a massive massive scale

203
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:25,290
it's pretty clear what the center what's
up to at that point one of the bigger

204
00:16:25,290 --> 00:16:30,569
things that they did was project double
05 which was specifically web content

205
00:16:30,570 --> 00:16:37,600
filtering and that actually won the
state award for 2002 and like I said not

206
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:41,820
a whole lot of information on that but
the more we kind of research it more of

207
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:45,760
you realize that that was definitely a
big part of it and the other report that

208
00:16:45,760 --> 00:16:51,240
I recommend reading besides citizen Labs
is Mark Stokes from project 2049 just

209
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,750
recently did a paper on some of the
military Chinese cyber operations

210
00:16:55,750 --> 00:16:59,830
outside of Shanghai and one of the
things that he talks about their in

211
00:16:59,830 --> 00:17:04,900
there is the double 05 center which is
absolutely connected to this and the

212
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:09,200
Great Firewall and works closely with
the military so the centre still active

213
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:13,180
today one of the people that you're
gonna see when you look at the history

214
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:18,090
of the Great Firewall is usually long
been saying he's credited as being kind

215
00:17:18,089 --> 00:17:20,429
of the father of the Great Firewall but
you have to remember that there were

216
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:25,920
hundreds and hundreds of researchers
with this and so is just one of many

217
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:30,860
he basically started off as a professor
of Harbin Institute of Technology and a

218
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:35,330
lot of his research was based around
massive scale filtering and then he kind

219
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:40,280
of rapidly rose through the ranks very
quickly he ended up becoming director of

220
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:46,190
the center and even in 2008 was elected
to the National People's Congress which

221
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,910
is their highest legislative body so for
somebody that was just kind of during

222
00:17:49,910 --> 00:17:55,070
professorial research within a very very
short period of time he was kind of a

223
00:17:55,070 --> 00:18:00,230
Ford it all these special allowances and
named outstanding individual and

224
00:18:00,230 --> 00:18:04,020
basically had come out and said in many
public interviews that she was involved

225
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:08,500
in the creation of the Great Firewall as
a result he received quite a bit of 8

226
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:14,010
from Chinese netizens as you can imagine
has had she was an ex thrown at him as

227
00:18:14,010 --> 00:18:18,810
well as had to famously take his social
media countdown after creating one in a

228
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:23,260
record like two days after receiving
like 20008 messages so that's that's

229
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:30,180
gotta be some type of record so he's
still he's no longer head of the

230
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:34,180
university or the center he's retired
but still conducting a lot of research

231
00:18:34,180 --> 00:18:43,260
and is on several high-level meetings
that are councils that basically decide

232
00:18:43,260 --> 00:18:47,390
Internet governance for China couple of
the other ones will just run through

233
00:18:47,390 --> 00:18:52,080
these real quick shot soon the reason
that he is interesting is because he was

234
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:58,560
involved quite a bit on project below
five and won the award for that and now

235
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:02,220
he is currently the director or the
center we believe that he took over

236
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:10,180
management of it after benching and that
is even as recently as May 2015 there

237
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:17,200
was a news article stating as the actual
director of the center lead gen ipod is

238
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:24,170
another interesting figure he's out of
Shanghai Jiaotong University and has

239
00:19:24,170 --> 00:19:28,000
worked on the S 219 project which is a
little bit more related to the Golden

240
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,650
Shield project but he also had another
one that was for the network media

241
00:19:31,650 --> 00:19:37,490
regulatory and information system that
actually wanted a visit by the premiere

242
00:19:37,490 --> 00:19:39,140
at that time so once again

243
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:43,360
the research that these guys are doing
heavy amount of importance was placed on

244
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,889
it by the leading Communist Party
figures at the time he also has some

245
00:19:47,890 --> 00:19:55,130
really interesting connections to 61398
which everyone knows is one or comment

246
00:19:55,130 --> 00:20:01,380
and ending on which naming scheme you
follow and has done quite a bit of work

247
00:20:01,380 --> 00:20:06,710
on the several confidential problem
projects that that xxx is therefore as

248
00:20:06,710 --> 00:20:12,470
far as we know he hasn't done anything
so usually on their resumes that a lot

249
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:17,480
of times there's quite a few of these
xxx awards and that basically means that

250
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:22,830
they've done quite a few confidential
projects so all of these guys are still

251
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:29,149
once again on very senior level groups
and continue to do that today right now

252
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:32,450
that I'm provided us with some
background about the history of the

253
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:35,640
Great Firewall we gonna get back to the
great cannon and look at how it actually

254
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:43,190
works and what it did so great canon is
that it inject malicious javascript in

255
00:20:43,190 --> 00:20:48,110
2009 web connection so popular web
services in China like Baidu and by the

256
00:20:48,110 --> 00:20:52,850
way it's will talk about it and that's
always be a place with some people from

257
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:58,550
this is it which in turn then use the
browser to make requests to this target

258
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:02,750
sites like it up in cloud and thereby
overwhelming these target sites you can

259
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:07,600
imagine like a huge search engine and
the biggest search engine in China you

260
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:11,750
can imagine how many visits as it gets
and it if each of these visitors into

261
00:21:11,750 --> 00:21:16,490
and then posts requests to another web
side frequently this would quickly

262
00:21:16,490 --> 00:21:22,090
generated a lot of like we saw 2.6
billion power it you get requests and so

263
00:21:22,090 --> 00:21:26,540
this over here is a kind of the timeline
of when these injections took place

264
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:31,920
courtesy of a good safe browsing way but
to follow that but only in hindsight one

265
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:36,420
has to say that's that's an important so
we can see see that it started out with

266
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:41,180
the testing faced with a low number of
injections and then it actually

267
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:45,260
escalated when the exit take started and
that coincides with the timeline we saw

268
00:21:45,260 --> 00:21:50,490
earlier so what the great can and us and
that's how it differs from the Great

269
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:52,610
Firewall once again this pictures

270
00:21:52,610 --> 00:21:57,219
gonna see all that great citizenship
report is it's a fallen man in the

271
00:21:57,220 --> 00:22:02,770
middle so it's not an on power button in
part system meaning it can actually

272
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:05,570
interdict the traffic reaching the end
it intended

273
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:11,689
web server like buy.com and can replace
the response with with arbitrary content

274
00:22:11,690 --> 00:22:16,480
and that's what it did didn't act on
every packet so it had some selection

275
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:21,100
mechanism so it's not every user was
targeted and that's all so different

276
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:24,490
from the Great Firewall

277
00:22:24,490 --> 00:22:31,580
tried to locate the attack they wrote a
tool which would do basic a traceroute

278
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:36,620
and then see where the great cannon
would be active and they limited the

279
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:41,149
great connectivity to two autonomous
systems both of which are within China

280
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:47,010
Unicom infrastructure the earliest
basically that did the injection was to

281
00:22:47,010 --> 00:22:52,690
IPV laps behind after entry into China
which is not saying a lot because China

282
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:58,030
obviously also employees ipv6 tunneling
into money so it doesn't really tell you

283
00:22:58,030 --> 00:23:04,850
that much interesting enough the to
abide by citizens also looked for

284
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:09,699
activity by the Great Firewall and if
you run it you can actually see that the

285
00:23:09,700 --> 00:23:17,190
cops with a great cannon and the Great
Firewall a the exact same ones the great

286
00:23:17,190 --> 00:23:22,830
can also share some some characteristics
some side senate with the Great Firewall

287
00:23:22,830 --> 00:23:27,570
that I'm not that cannot be found in
other commercial up to its so sudden

288
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:31,740
that concluded that there was at least
some overlap in how these boots were

289
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:35,929
engineered but still it's important to
keep in mind that these are completely

290
00:23:35,929 --> 00:23:40,490
separate and distinct system systems
which have different capabilities and

291
00:23:40,490 --> 00:23:46,330
then different targets so about the
exact location people tend to obsess

292
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:50,418
over there but ultimately doesn't really
matter at least that's the way we see it

293
00:23:50,419 --> 00:23:57,150
the facts as I said it inject malicious
javascript country it targets only by

294
00:23:57,150 --> 00:24:00,890
destination IP address mean the
webserver you trying to reach but it

295
00:24:00,890 --> 00:24:05,290
could just as well target by source IP
address meaning the client doing

296
00:24:05,290 --> 00:24:10,720
the request realistic targeting not not
every user's targeted it has some weird

297
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:15,570
behavior meaning it would actually on on
connections with on which are not

298
00:24:15,570 --> 00:24:21,260
completely better place because nixon's
which was initiated with us in picket

299
00:24:21,260 --> 00:24:25,990
outside on incorrect it should be
requests and all of these side effects

300
00:24:25,990 --> 00:24:29,650
can can then be used to detect that
there's something strange going on and

301
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:34,660
that's the way this tool by myself
actually works and probably the most

302
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:38,560
important part that people sometimes
misses they did only targeted

303
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:43,730
international uses so only international
uses going to the Chinese Web side like

304
00:24:43,730 --> 00:24:49,260
by two would get target it obviously
that is mostly Chinese speaking people

305
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:55,620
like in Taiwan Hong Kong or even the us-
but that means that the requests that

306
00:24:55,620 --> 00:24:59,250
are being sent as a result of this
malicious javascript come from outside

307
00:24:59,250 --> 00:25:03,830
of China so if you get up you cannot
simply sale just going to block the

308
00:25:03,830 --> 00:25:08,320
traffic originating from China because
the traffic is is coming from every user

309
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:15,179
worldwide and that's really important to
keep in mind so i won one thing we did

310
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:19,320
not a whole lot of other people did was
take a closer look at the excellent job

311
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:25,270
us that the payload that they injected
to the connections and it's a relatively

312
00:25:25,270 --> 00:25:32,080
short code snippet I put it here you can
find it online as well and even if you

313
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:36,570
don't create JavaScript you can probably
read that piece of code so you can see

314
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:40,700
that it tries to use some some libraries
some some convenience library it has a

315
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:46,070
few function definitions it as a an
aerial targets this UN area and that's

316
00:25:46,070 --> 00:25:50,030
actually the list of targets that it
wants to do request again so this one is

317
00:25:50,030 --> 00:25:54,560
cloud front and it has some functions
for sending and then it has an

318
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:59,600
additional function which is the actual
get function and that if you if you know

319
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:04,439
JavaScript if you know decree that just
a basic like get to an ATP get on that

320
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:10,030
UL and you can see that they have a
handle which which says basically up to

321
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:16,000
the request is done said to timeout set
a time so that the next request

322
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:20,560
will get out in like 10 seconds or
something like that and that's those of

323
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:25,899
us and this was actually it wasn't
obvious skated sold so this is the way

324
00:26:25,900 --> 00:26:31,920
it was delivered to the user's it's very
readable shot very simple so you might

325
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:36,320
say why talk about it but even this
short piece of code contains some

326
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,450
interesting things at least we think so

327
00:26:39,450 --> 00:26:44,130
which give us some hints on how this
might have been written so it has some

328
00:26:44,130 --> 00:26:50,630
including naming like it uses chemicals
and snake case which is not something

329
00:26:50,630 --> 00:26:57,090
that a program I usually picks us up
some needless and buggy functions it

330
00:26:57,090 --> 00:27:02,379
also shows that the that the author of
the coal miner have been familiar with

331
00:27:02,380 --> 00:27:05,750
JavaScript that much it has some
leftover code fragments which looked

332
00:27:05,750 --> 00:27:08,950
like there was something there before
but they got rid of some functionality

333
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:13,770
and left some code in like this contrary
but it relies on jQuery which is

334
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:18,550
generally really noisy and easy to
detect and it actually improve during

335
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:22,780
the campaign so during the campaign they
apparently realized that they can pick

336
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:27,930
the JavaScript so it looks a little bit
of you skated into this and then later

337
00:27:27,930 --> 00:27:32,990
sections used that which is which is
funny so the bottom line and I'm not

338
00:27:32,990 --> 00:27:37,330
trying to best the people here but the
bottom line is this is a little bit

339
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:43,030
sloppy code which is strange if you're
trying to unveil your really cool great

340
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:51,120
candidate pool and a tech users to write
this piece of sloppy also its copy paste

341
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,310
code so I mentioned the variable naming
that's really strange that led me to

342
00:27:54,310 --> 00:27:59,020
believe they copied and pasted it from
somewhere and if you actually go on such

343
00:27:59,020 --> 00:28:04,050
and and this is by two but you can do
the same thing on Google and search for

344
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:09,190
times like dick repaying which means
just get something from a website period

345
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:15,360
you come up with this code snippet as
the first it basically and that contains

346
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:20,780
the same variable names that have been
observed in the payload so yeah that's a

347
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:26,830
little bit of copy paste programming
right so it's only JavaScript ride

348
00:28:26,830 --> 00:28:32,279
why I said why is it relevant so
obviously not realistic to to use the

349
00:28:32,279 --> 00:28:36,919
web without Javascript anymore so
turning that off is not an option and

350
00:28:36,919 --> 00:28:41,830
it's also not easy to say what malicious
javascript is i mean is that malicious

351
00:28:41,830 --> 00:28:45,928
behavior that we saw in this piece of
paper it's just wing it should be get

352
00:28:45,929 --> 00:28:47,110
requests

353
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:52,299
that's what these libraries and Methods
about four so how would you tell that

354
00:28:52,299 --> 00:28:58,429
that's militias still there so many
individual risked to having this kind of

355
00:28:58,429 --> 00:29:02,789
addiction so this is basically what we
in the industry called a strategic

356
00:29:02,789 --> 00:29:08,200
weapon mice were you able to compromise
high-volume high-value website and then

357
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:12,169
target the users as they come by and
then you can use that to target

358
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:17,220
individual uses and that actually
frameworks for that militias as well as

359
00:29:17,220 --> 00:29:25,019
academic quad so if we remember earlier
this year drive-by exploitation of

360
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:29,750
various technologies electrician job US
is still a topic and they might have

361
00:29:29,750 --> 00:29:34,470
might have just a sweater injected some
flesh the 20 day instead of some

362
00:29:34,470 --> 00:29:39,630
javascript and and keep in mind that
this system is a lot simpler for them to

363
00:29:39,630 --> 00:29:45,700
use than something that other Western
governments are using to do that kind of

364
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:49,260
stuff so they have a full man in the
middle they don't need a complicated set

365
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:53,129
up to be able to target specific user us
they don't need distributed

366
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:56,960
infrastructure they can just sit there
at the center of the patient's in and

367
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:02,090
take whatever they want and also which
is interesting that interest you and

368
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:06,678
JavaScript attack back to us so for
example you could use WEP IDC to get the

369
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:12,750
IPO the real IPO host which is important
for all uses and you can do the whole

370
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:16,700
bunch of other stuff you can usually do
with JavaScript so good reference for

371
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:21,070
that would be the talk two years ago
which was called the million browser

372
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:24,990
botnet which talked about all the
different ways that you can abuse

373
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:29,960
JavaScript to do something in the user's
browser and this is basically the same

374
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:35,220
thing only that it is a multi-million
browse the botnet that the government

375
00:30:35,220 --> 00:30:38,279
can turn on with a flick of a switch

376
00:30:38,279 --> 00:30:43,809
so let's talk about some countermeasures
these fall into different categories the

377
00:30:43,809 --> 00:30:49,009
person the most important ones other one
in the the top 9 I'd say so this is kind

378
00:30:49,009 --> 00:30:52,359
of the prevention but we'll talk about
how to look out for this kind of

379
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:59,599
activity at UPS is the first 10 HEPES
would have prevented that problem

380
00:30:59,599 --> 00:31:03,830
because they wouldn't have been able to
inject malicious JavaScript into a

381
00:31:03,830 --> 00:31:10,639
cryptic connection to the website so why
why is that so many issues in 2015 and

382
00:31:10,639 --> 00:31:16,059
we looked at the most popular websites
in China based on the Alexa list and you

383
00:31:16,059 --> 00:31:21,639
can see them right here and we looked at
the state up there it's ups adoption so

384
00:31:21,639 --> 00:31:26,218
the left column the leftmost column says
whether they actually operate GPS which

385
00:31:26,219 --> 00:31:30,879
is foremost website not even the case
the next one sis whether they are best

386
00:31:30,879 --> 00:31:35,899
but have some mixed content which could
be exploited the third column tells you

387
00:31:35,899 --> 00:31:39,699
whether the plane website the plane
version of the website will try to

388
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:45,589
redirect you to the HPS website and the
last column this or purchased something

389
00:31:45,589 --> 00:31:51,349
the last column tells you whether the
website uses HSCs which is a trapeze

390
00:31:51,349 --> 00:31:56,428
trick transport security which basically
tells browser next time you come by only

391
00:31:56,429 --> 00:32:02,219
HPS never tried to reach me using plain
HTTP again and so it looks a little bit

392
00:32:02,219 --> 00:32:06,859
different and it looks a little bit
different if we you look at Western

393
00:32:06,859 --> 00:32:12,830
websites and I think big reason for that
was obviously the revelations by by at

394
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:20,099
Snowden some other fact about HGS
interests in china so companies might

395
00:32:20,099 --> 00:32:24,119
say their few incentives fostered up
that Chinese companies that obviously a

396
00:32:24,119 --> 00:32:28,869
convenient public reason they might be
pressured to not add up this by doing

397
00:32:28,869 --> 00:32:32,459
which is the biggest search engine in
China will actually not index your site

398
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:37,330
if its running only on a GPS so you have
to operate in HDB if you want to be on

399
00:32:37,330 --> 00:32:42,968
the search engine and this HSPs list
which is built into the browser switch

400
00:32:42,969 --> 00:32:49,529
which test brothers only visit these
websites its ups only includes six very

401
00:32:49,529 --> 00:32:51,490
small Chinese websites

402
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:56,150
out of thirteen hundred and toyota also
there's currently no domestic Chinese

403
00:32:56,150 --> 00:33:00,710
roots certificate authority it was
removed after security incident but it

404
00:33:00,710 --> 00:33:07,020
will likely be reinstated the CNN that
is so what what can you ever an

405
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:12,629
organization do especially if your web
server somewhere in China the answers

406
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:19,160
it's BS it has never been easier to
deploy the the performance impact is

407
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:24,080
minimal nowadays and this is my free and
automatics certificate authority coming

408
00:33:24,080 --> 00:33:28,350
in September of this year which which
would make it really easy to set it up

409
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:35,100
even for non-technical folks HP to 2.0
which is also being rolled out as we

410
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:39,850
speak actually requires less so if you
want to use that if you want to use that

411
00:33:39,850 --> 00:33:45,219
you're gonna need in any way please
consider using hst s and went to the pre

412
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:48,610
loading it into the browser and there's
even something called the public

413
00:33:48,610 --> 00:33:54,500
deepening extension which tells the
browser not only to use a GPS but only

414
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:58,670
use a specific public key so even if in
the worst case what some people who

415
00:33:58,670 --> 00:34:04,480
tried to try to make up even if that's a
rope CA some when your brother chain and

416
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:08,300
that rope CA Sports doing TLS man in the
middle successfully because it's in the

417
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:13,659
CA store using public keeping you would
be able to prevent that and also

418
00:34:13,659 --> 00:34:18,600
reported which is really important so
saying he left doesn't matter because

419
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:23,330
they might be rogue CIA is no longer
true so the bottom line the threat can

420
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:28,899
be reduced and there's no reason not to
use TLS anymore so next topic would be

421
00:34:28,899 --> 00:34:34,560
monitoring how could you possibly watch
out an attack like this and the first

422
00:34:34,560 --> 00:34:38,980
thing to keep in mind is static
monitoring like downloading websites and

423
00:34:38,980 --> 00:34:43,460
then doing dips or whatever that's not
going to cut it at all so you need some

424
00:34:43,460 --> 00:34:49,168
kind of monitoring the dynamic behavior
for website and to do that you have to

425
00:34:49,168 --> 00:34:52,839
build up the Document Object Mode on
actually execute the JavaScript to get

426
00:34:52,840 --> 00:34:58,850
the behavior that different approaches
none of which get my my bill

427
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:02,120
so what I really wanted him or something
like this and you might be familiar with

428
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:06,560
that that's a chromed ibarra I want to
know what kind of requests have been

429
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:10,960
made what kind of resources has been
downloaded I want to know about

430
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,460
JavaScript errors I wanna know about
output or stuff like the lockbox and and

431
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:20,000
so yeah I want all of these things
listed here details on the request and

432
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:26,460
so on so basically I want an
instrumented web browser right and I

433
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:31,970
looked at this at this kind of screen
shot and then it occurred to me where

434
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:34,879
the Google Chrome inspector which is a
development would actually use the

435
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,960
public API Jason API to interact with
the Chrome browser in a debug mode and

436
00:35:39,960 --> 00:35:43,510
you can use that same API to get all of
the information that's available in the

437
00:35:43,510 --> 00:35:49,540
comments picked up to do exactly that we
have a have a really cool cool way to do

438
00:35:49,540 --> 00:35:54,950
leave a brother that you can use an
automated fashion to do this kind of

439
00:35:54,950 --> 00:35:57,560
monitoring and then to set it up

440
00:35:57,560 --> 00:36:01,799
you obviously have to set up to browse
different websites frequently you have

441
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:08,740
two geographically distributed across
different IP SAN and then continent and

442
00:36:08,740 --> 00:36:11,509
then you have to think about how you
want to entertain the data what kind of

443
00:36:11,510 --> 00:36:14,970
additional information wanna put into
the data do you want to create a car do

444
00:36:14,970 --> 00:36:22,430
you wanna do the IP autonomous systems
look up because the bottom line is what

445
00:36:22,430 --> 00:36:26,569
do you monitor for what what what's
malicious behavior and when do you wanna

446
00:36:26,570 --> 00:36:32,700
be alerted and that's a really tricky
question to get that just ride so the

447
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:36,910
bottom line is if you're considering
doing monitoring on your own website you

448
00:36:36,910 --> 00:36:43,558
Beto just employing transport security

449
00:36:43,559 --> 00:36:49,949
ok taking a look a little bit behind the
curtain as to who might actually be

450
00:36:49,949 --> 00:36:53,609
responsible for this obviously is talked
about earlier

451
00:36:53,609 --> 00:36:58,660
locating the actual source of it's kind
of irrelevant for several reasons but we

452
00:36:58,660 --> 00:37:02,379
know that basically came from the China
backbone network and that there are very

453
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:10,269
few organizations that have access
control that can we talk about possible

454
00:37:10,269 --> 00:37:14,819
contributors it's important to note that
since coming into power President Xi

455
00:37:14,819 --> 00:37:19,380
Jinping has done a lot of quite a few
different reforms this is making himself

456
00:37:19,380 --> 00:37:24,900
as as he consolidates power he's been
making himself the head of multiple

457
00:37:24,900 --> 00:37:31,699
information leading groups one of them
has been to take a better control of the

458
00:37:31,699 --> 00:37:37,189
PLA and military the other has been
establishing something like the

459
00:37:37,189 --> 00:37:44,719
cybersecurity and informatization
leading group txt chairs that and is

460
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:49,339
along with Liu Wei who heads the cyber
Administration of China like I said he's

461
00:37:49,339 --> 00:37:54,199
kind of the cyber czar of China those
guys are basically making all the

462
00:37:54,199 --> 00:37:59,089
decisions at the top and the way in
particular is a very effective

463
00:37:59,089 --> 00:38:05,849
politician attending a conference with
him and see that was d see if this last

464
00:38:05,849 --> 00:38:06,529
year

465
00:38:06,529 --> 00:38:12,819
super charming guy there were FBI CIA
NSA guys in the room and he was cracking

466
00:38:12,819 --> 00:38:18,670
jokes with all of them just yeah really
really good politician but he definitely

467
00:38:18,670 --> 00:38:22,679
knows what he's doing he's he's no dummy
when it comes to this stuff and he also

468
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:28,160
runs the state internet info office
which basically handle censorship and we

469
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:33,399
believe the Great Firewall of China so
they have as you can see those tenuous

470
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:39,059
connections with the ISPs as well as the
Ministry of Public Security so that

471
00:38:39,059 --> 00:38:41,969
connection is kind of more of what we're
talking about when we say like the

472
00:38:41,969 --> 00:38:47,349
Golden Shield project so the censorship
plays directly into the MPS which

473
00:38:47,349 --> 00:38:54,340
basically enforces what their with the
censorship

474
00:38:54,340 --> 00:38:58,160
so their consolidation because they've
been doing all this consolidation

475
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:02,529
squarely places them at the top of the
decision-making process and in addition

476
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:07,200
there are on these working groups quite
a few senior figures that played an

477
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,299
influential role in the creation of the
Great Firewall we talked about some of

478
00:39:10,300 --> 00:39:14,870
them earlier so there's quite a bit of a
mix between these civilian and military

479
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:20,620
groups this is important because the
collaboration there has been talked

480
00:39:20,620 --> 00:39:24,130
about before but there are very few
organizations which are authorized to

481
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:31,520
kind of carry out offensive cyber
operations against national targets PLA

482
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:36,050
is one obviously talked about that quite
a bit with our own crap strike reporting

483
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:43,220
MSS which is kind of the Chinese version
of CIA and of course the MPS so when

484
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:46,270
we're talking about these groups working
together that's really important to

485
00:39:46,270 --> 00:39:51,500
highlight is that some of these guys at
a very influential role from the start

486
00:39:51,500 --> 00:39:56,860
and are probably still involved in some
of that stuff for example one of these

487
00:39:56,860 --> 00:40:01,270
working groups this is an 863
informatization working group actually

488
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:08,100
features both legally and while we're
actually heads the organization and long

489
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:12,110
been changed so both of these guys that
like I said had a pretty influential

490
00:40:12,110 --> 00:40:16,960
role in the founding of the Great
Firewall are on this council and the

491
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:22,210
other ones that are highlighted on there
are someone from the first Bureau of

492
00:40:22,210 --> 00:40:27,550
three PLA which of course conducts
operations as well as somebody from the

493
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:33,580
MSS 13th Bureau which does science and
technology so we're talking about who

494
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:37,410
could possibly be behind this you know
there's there's definitely some groups

495
00:40:37,410 --> 00:40:40,799
that come to mind

496
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:48,500
got a nice picture punching and BTW NY
at a 973 conference 863 1973 we have a

497
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,420
lot of reporting on that as well

498
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:54,550
definitely cs4 that you'd like more
information but they kind of service as

499
00:40:54,550 --> 00:40:59,790
a roadmap to what China wants to
accomplish and close the technological

500
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:04,759
gap between itself in the west

501
00:41:04,760 --> 00:41:10,570
so what happens next this is probably
the big question on everyone's mind we

502
00:41:10,570 --> 00:41:14,400
see this as kind of trying to releasing
this even though it was kind of sloppy

503
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:17,850
code we're a little confused by that as
well but this is kind of their moment to

504
00:41:17,850 --> 00:41:23,720
say like this is my boomstick we can use
this you know we're pushing the notion

505
00:41:23,720 --> 00:41:27,700
of cyber sovereignty beyond our own
borders in the Great Firewall was to

506
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:32,529
keep invaders keep things centralized
and harmonious is the word that they

507
00:41:32,530 --> 00:41:38,510
tend to use the most and the great
cannons expanding that words will we see

508
00:41:38,510 --> 00:41:42,560
it being used in the exact same way
probably not there are a lot of

509
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,980
improvements that could be made to the
attack kind of a best-case worst-case

510
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:51,920
scenario depending on how you look at it
the big question of course is will there

511
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:57,240
be blowback official response from the
USA government at first was basically

512
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:01,419
just an inquest which to the Chinese
government which is kind of like asking

513
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:06,280
the kid with cookie crumbs all over
space like to have a cookie did you say

514
00:42:06,280 --> 00:42:12,700
so it'll be interesting to see if they
use it again what will happen from that

515
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:17,180
standpoint and from a political fallout
sandpoint one of the things that did

516
00:42:17,180 --> 00:42:21,790
happen fairly recently is the Obama
administration made it so that they

517
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:25,890
could basically sanction countries that
carry out cyber operations so that could

518
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:30,779
be possibly something we'd see in the
future so it was pretty lucky the fact

519
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:33,860
that this was an early and
unsophisticated attack it was evolving

520
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:40,620
and changing even as it was ongoing but
overall you know was still standing at

521
00:42:40,620 --> 00:42:43,480
the end of the day and it could have
been a lot worse when we talk about

522
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:53,430
targeted attacks it gets a lot more
serious so we expect to see that play

523
00:42:53,430 --> 00:42:58,410
into the great cannons usage in future
so they'll improve a lot of these things

524
00:42:58,410 --> 00:43:05,930
possibly using you know just get a code
as well as you know persistent SWC

525
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:12,440
attacks it also be interesting to see if
the CIA Nick

526
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:17,050
authority gets approved again in
browsers because that will enable

527
00:43:17,050 --> 00:43:20,970
another method of potential infection
and could play a whole bring a whole

528
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:24,649
nother side to that as well since
browsers will automatically be trusting

529
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:28,950
that like I said currently they have
been rejected from that after some

530
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:32,279
controversy you literally around the
exact same time as the great Canon

531
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:42,970
attacks but we do expect that they will
be reinstated at some point

532
00:43:42,970 --> 00:43:49,230
attack again some of the big ones coming
up that China is very interested in is

533
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:53,170
the time we need presidential election
we're currently the person that's in the

534
00:43:53,170 --> 00:43:57,490
lead so far is fairly Andy Beijing so
that's something they're a little bit

535
00:43:57,490 --> 00:44:01,870
worried about whether we're seeing exit
bring down an election website that'd be

536
00:44:01,870 --> 00:44:05,370
pretty ballsy but it's definitely
something that they're interested in

537
00:44:05,370 --> 00:44:10,630
talking about potential targets thats
for sure one of them the issue with Hong

538
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:17,190
Kong and the open referendums for their
elections that still ongoing

539
00:44:17,190 --> 00:44:22,140
there could be another one and of course
we've seen quite a bit of activity

540
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:27,660
related to the South China Sea and
Vietnam in any of the other territorial

541
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:32,210
disputes that they've got going on there
and then we could also see now targeted

542
00:44:32,210 --> 00:44:37,460
attacks as we said against domestic
entities as well so Dalai Lama and

543
00:44:37,460 --> 00:44:46,030
Tibetan movements as well as the readers
out in western China and that is gonna

544
00:44:46,030 --> 00:44:56,970
do it for us so thank you very much

545
00:44:56,970 --> 00:45:14,720
as well and we did our own Canon so what
we try not to let anyone with this one

546
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:19,040
if you guys have questions please move
up the mics otherwise you can always

547
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:21,830
find us around

548
00:45:21,830 --> 00:45:49,509
looks really dangerous by the way but

549
00:45:49,509 --> 00:46:03,089
so they wouldn't have been able to
inject it into the connection that he's

550
00:46:03,089 --> 00:46:04,849
in the USA vs

551
00:46:04,849 --> 00:46:09,380
as we said they might use different
techniques like employing their their

552
00:46:09,380 --> 00:46:15,199
own root CA but that really dangerous
and easy to detect so that's the main

553
00:46:15,199 --> 00:46:19,559
takeaway that if your website is in
China of its outside of China general if

554
00:46:19,559 --> 00:46:23,469
you care about you that's not be
affected by a one in the middle

555
00:46:23,469 --> 00:46:30,309
use https and the second question about
whether Chinese users would be able to

556
00:46:30,309 --> 00:46:39,169
still see the website so this was an
attack on web it's really loud was an

557
00:46:39,169 --> 00:46:43,509
attack on web service which are located
in China and it was targeting to visit

558
00:46:43,509 --> 00:46:47,549
us came from outside of China so the
Chinese

559
00:46:47,549 --> 00:46:54,399
the domestic users in China they were
infected by their it for them for them

560
00:46:54,399 --> 00:47:01,630
and they don't actually I think by to it
by now uses HPS by default but only for

561
00:47:01,630 --> 00:47:10,759
domestic use in China which is kind of
ironic yeah I think so I read that a few

562
00:47:10,759 --> 00:47:14,619
days ago

563
00:47:14,619 --> 00:47:19,609
got a question ever hear more about the
web

564
00:47:19,609 --> 00:47:25,999
RDC in what it's able to actually get
around and they mentioned or but it also

565
00:47:25,999 --> 00:47:33,209
able to get past people in some cases or
we're all gonna do yes so basically best

566
00:47:33,210 --> 00:47:37,900
time democrat on the web if you like but
idc I P league or something but if you

567
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:44,849
are running at all on the on the same
same computer on the same machine you're

568
00:47:44,849 --> 00:47:48,789
not running it in different virtual
machines then this kind of information

569
00:47:48,789 --> 00:47:52,539
is able to get your real IP and that
actually been used in the white appeared

570
00:47:52,539 --> 00:47:57,690
was evenly in New York Times which did
that to identify the IPO the uses and

571
00:47:57,690 --> 00:48:02,099
that's really dangerous because a lot of
the people using talk specially in

572
00:48:02,099 --> 00:48:06,839
connection with china are trying to
circumvent the firewall to any kind of

573
00:48:06,839 --> 00:48:13,019
interested and those are not the most
technology proficient uses so it's

574
00:48:13,019 --> 00:48:17,160
really proud of them for them and just
out of curiosity and I'm guessing it

575
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:23,609
bypasses no script and some farmers a
protection mechanism if you if you have

576
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:28,230
no script and you really don't exclude
any any JavaScript at all then you safe

577
00:48:28,230 --> 00:48:32,499
from that kind of attack but as I said
it's not really realistic if you have

578
00:48:32,499 --> 00:48:41,009
any kind of browsing experience right
right very good thank you

579
00:48:41,010 --> 00:48:49,090
you know it's what's being done to
prevent this cross origin attack that

580
00:48:49,090 --> 00:48:54,870
they were able to do a javascript what
being done by whom they and I need

581
00:48:54,870 --> 00:49:02,150
standards body needs someone to help you
know so I thought that's not malicious

582
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:08,770
behavior that's not something that's not
like you can say it's not something it's

583
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:12,050
something that you wanted to feature if
get up was hosting some piece of

584
00:49:12,050 --> 00:49:16,300
JavaScript and you wanted that on your
website because it's a library and you

585
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:20,710
want to use it obviously have to make a
request to get up right so they can

586
00:49:20,710 --> 00:49:26,550
prevent that request from happening
today did I misunderstand the question

587
00:49:26,550 --> 00:49:31,730
and again disintegration I guess just
that's the problem with this whole thing

588
00:49:31,730 --> 00:49:47,160
thank you

589
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:54,450
it doesn't say so it it just says in the
Bible like if we don't index PHP s

590
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:59,270
website and about them not adopting a
GPS I tried to reach out to all of these

591
00:49:59,270 --> 00:50:03,050
websites to get some kind of reply on
why they're not adopting it or why

592
00:50:03,050 --> 00:50:08,040
they're not making it default I didn't
get any replies on that as I said I

593
00:50:08,040 --> 00:50:15,110
think it's it's convenient to say you
cannot make it would be too costly and

594
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:19,560
complicated to set up HPS when at the
same time they might be pressured not to

595
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:24,350
make it the default that's the way it
could be so you also have to remember

596
00:50:24,350 --> 00:50:29,310
too that most of these big Internet
companies in China have a very close

597
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:33,090
relationship with the government and so
the important thing to remember is that

598
00:50:33,090 --> 00:50:37,600
most of these are all publicly traded
companies so if they are pushed hard

599
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:42,120
enough they do have stakeholders so
they've they have before

600
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:46,549
kind of gone against the Chinese
government although with limited success

601
00:50:46,550 --> 00:50:50,960
doesn't always work but it'd be
interesting to see them or that their

602
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,840
stakeholders expressed that to see what
will actually happen

603
00:50:54,840 --> 00:51:02,550
another question you just click your
reference lining in this one yes thank

604
00:51:02,550 --> 00:51:02,760

605
00:51:02,760 --> 00:51:07,240
yeah definitely suggest reading those
there's quite a bit more which like I

606
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:11,419
