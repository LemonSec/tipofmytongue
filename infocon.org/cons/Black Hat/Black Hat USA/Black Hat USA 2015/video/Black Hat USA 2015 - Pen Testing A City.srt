1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,069
would have heard you you're sure to see
a CD from Gregg County Tom cross and

2
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:14,719
Dave Ramone so please give them warm
round of applause thank you and we'd

3
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:20,960
like to thank SimCity Godzilla's well
I'm great county this is Dave Raymond

4
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,380
and Tom cross thank you for joining us
after testing the city before we get

5
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:31,990
started we're here is free citizens we
don't represent anyone employers we're

6
00:00:31,990 --> 00:00:35,839
also not lawyers and please if you're
going to Penn test anything especially a

7
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:43,590
city please talk to you about your first
so Tom Tom cross on the CTO of

8
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:48,989
drawbridge networks previously worked at
Lanco opened IBM x-force research done a

9
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:55,269
lot of vulnerability research over the
years and I was most recently back to

10
00:00:55,270 --> 00:00:59,070
west point where did cybersecurity
education research and just transition

11
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,879
now I'm doing the same thing at Virginia
Tech and I'm Craig County I'm currently

12
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:07,479
at west point where Moses a faculty
member and security researcher and I'll

13
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:09,860
be transition from the Army next summer

14
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:16,869
ok so cities why are they important well
what really motivated us in this effort

15
00:01:16,869 --> 00:01:21,159
to get this talk to conduct this
research was that we're good at

16
00:01:21,159 --> 00:01:24,650
penetration testing and analyzing
security properties of individual

17
00:01:24,650 --> 00:01:28,850
products and businesses of varying
degrees of scale only think about what

18
00:01:28,850 --> 00:01:35,429
keeps countries nations secure and what
really worth civilization thrives it's

19
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:41,479
based on cities and there's a big Delta
between securing a company and securing

20
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:44,810
the city and we want to take a look at
that and as part of that we've had some

21
00:01:44,810 --> 00:01:50,409
really unique access inside the the
workings of several major cities talking

22
00:01:50,409 --> 00:01:53,850
to some of their security professionals
about their challenges so that helped

23
00:01:53,850 --> 00:01:57,009
inform with real-world I think
real-world insights into it

24
00:01:57,010 --> 00:02:07,230
into the research we were doing when you
think about cities there there there are

25
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:12,920
microcosms of Nations really to explore
best practices so that we can start

26
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,760
figure out how to scale farm the you
know the techniques and strategies that

27
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:23,179
will allow us to from to go from a and
testing and accompany a large company to

28
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:27,360
pen testing a city then we can start
thinking about how to secure nations

29
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,980
that that was the idea and if we can
figure out that that those insights and

30
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:34,549
maybe perhaps a generalized not just the
united states but we can we can figure

31
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:41,080
out how then to passes around she other
cities share the results while you think

32
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:44,560
about the things in the new Europe
civilization right it doesn't take much

33
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:48,620
for to tip over civilization and it's
hard enough to keep things working

34
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:53,290
without there being an adversary you
think of two inches of snow and about

35
00:02:53,290 --> 00:02:58,700
whether call or two down in atlanta
paralyzed the city you can think the New

36
00:02:58,700 --> 00:03:06,640
York City a blackout caused riding the
earthquakes and it goes on and on so

37
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,109
deep you had an example for Baltimore so
I think we'll be talking about is is the

38
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:15,140
potential for cascading failures when a
failure in one infrastructure causes

39
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:18,679
cascading failures and other
infrastructure is one good example is

40
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:26,290
from 2001 when a commuter train derailed
in a train tunnel in Baltimore and of

41
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:30,440
course it caused expected delays in
commuter train traffic and an automobile

42
00:03:30,440 --> 00:03:34,000
traffic and the surrounding area were
also happened during the derailment was

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,010
a water main was broken and a cause
localised flooding which flooded power

44
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:44,840
substations and caused power to go out
for most of the c4 for about a day also

45
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:50,850
what happened was there was a small fire
associated with the derailment and it

46
00:03:50,850 --> 00:03:56,019
severed fiber-optic cables that really
controlled communication between some

47
00:03:56,019 --> 00:03:59,980
major companies on the eastern seaboard
so it caused disruption in network

48
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:04,459
communications all the way from New York
City down into washington D C so so

49
00:04:04,459 --> 00:04:08,500
here's an example of a of a fairly
localized event that can cause

50
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:15,170
cascading failures really throughout the
infrastructure sectors as another

51
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:20,548
example we know we were thinking about
like that are happening by accident

52
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:25,760
well we've we've had throughout the last
few years are really many years InfoSec

53
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:30,280
amused on some great research and
provided point cases on vulnerabilities

54
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:35,159
in cities and one of my favorite stories
on a call from a car not a vulnerability

55
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:41,720
researcher prisoner conference but a
teenager in 2000 and he developed

56
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:47,880
basically hack the tram system using a
modified television remote control and

57
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:54,680
derailed a train in his in his hometown
in poland just just as a hobby project

58
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:57,460
and that was a teenager so we'll talk a
little bit more about what the

59
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:01,340
implications of that individual
relatively small-scale research that

60
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,760
people are doing and that what could be
built upon that cuz it's it's hard

61
00:05:04,760 --> 00:05:08,490
enough to keep cities running Tom I mean
as you all know Chris Powell second

62
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:12,890
Charlie Miller successfully did a remote
computer you know full control of an

63
00:05:12,890 --> 00:05:17,090
automobile and their one-point point
four million automobiles I think that

64
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:19,810
we're vulnerable to that attack but
certainly not the only vulnerability

65
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:23,880
like that and so if you can cause you
know that sort of cascading failure to

66
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,360
derail train you know imagine what you
could do with a well-placed sport

67
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,710
utility vehicle a lot of the scenarios
that for years we've sort of dismissed

68
00:05:31,710 --> 00:05:35,979
as maybe science fiction scenarios or
risk that were sort of overblown we're

69
00:05:35,979 --> 00:05:38,820
now getting into a point in time where
those things are becoming more and more

70
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:44,640
realistic so one good place for us to
start his dad just think about what we

71
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,950
mean by the terms city and turns out
even though we all have sort of an

72
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:53,400
intuitive understanding of what the city
is it's fairly difficult to to to define

73
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:59,099
and so we googled it and got this
decidedly poor a definition particularly

74
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,490
the second informal version the
definition little more digging led to

75
00:06:03,490 --> 00:06:07,600
some some pretty good attributes things
that you can use to describe a city in

76
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:12,630
and really you know this city is as
thick of it is it is a large town you

77
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,000
know municipal area could also be a

78
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,470
tribal area you know there's sort of a
different versions of what a city might

79
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:21,450
be but for our purposes

80
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:28,210
city has 24 to be something that that
were concerned about it has large scale

81
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:31,979
network infrastructure composed of
probably critical infrastructure non

82
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:35,510
critical infrastructure maybe many
businesses and then some sort of a

83
00:06:35,510 --> 00:06:45,940
municipal network architecture and even
with that fairly clear definition broad

84
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,860
their broad differences between cities
if you just look at population alone

85
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,870
cities might range from a few thousand
people to tens of millions of people so

86
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:59,110
if you look at this chart shows
populations of some large municipalities

87
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:00,390
around the world

88
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:04,719
Tokyo with with almost 40 million people
the largest city in the United States

89
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,850
New York City has has only half that and
numbers obviously can go can go down

90
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:15,110
from there the show there there are
different ways we're going to talk about

91
00:07:15,110 --> 00:07:18,980
how their different ways of defining a
city often cities are defined based on a

92
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:22,990
particular county or administrative
region we also tend to think about

93
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:26,750
metropolitan areas of New York City
think the whole place not just you know

94
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:31,240
it's not just the five boroughs
necessarily and so the United States

95
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:35,340
being what it is the best way to decide
how big city is in this country is to

96
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,429
look at the television viewing audience
and that's what marketing professionals

97
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:44,220
to you and they they have these metro
area DMA codes that represent the

98
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:49,490
television viewing a population for a
particular metro area and actually these

99
00:07:49,490 --> 00:07:53,300
DNA codes are used often in online
marketing they're used in the Geo cities

100
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:57,620
database to integrate the metro area
that are particularly people are so I

101
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:01,410
took a look at how many IP address for
this were assigned to the ten largest

102
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:06,940
DMA metro areas in the United States who
and what's interesting is that the

103
00:08:06,940 --> 00:08:11,000
geography of cyberspace is often
different than that of the real world I

104
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,220
don't know why houston has so many ipv4
addresses if any of you do please talk

105
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:20,220
to me after talk of course you can see
that ipv6 deployment is radically

106
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:26,900
different at different stages in
different and different metro areas so

107
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:34,120
various strands won the trans right now
is cities particularly those that care

108
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:40,169
crisis and so smart cities are aspiring
to be smart cities employing networks of

109
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:46,960
sensors to help them a gimmick gather
data analyzed the data and provide

110
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:51,470
better services for their people and
also for example prod more energy

111
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:55,410
efficiency with that comes along i think
is everyone in the room and recognize

112
00:08:55,410 --> 00:09:01,189
that when you bring on additional
technologies that really increases the

113
00:09:01,190 --> 00:09:07,160
attack surface and you can see as well
that industry is where opportunity and

114
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:11,469
smart cities and and just a series of
all types I mean I tend to think of

115
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:15,240
cities as there's some cities there is
moderate intelligence cities and their

116
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:19,570
smart cities there's a whole spectrum
there but it's so their industries

117
00:09:19,570 --> 00:09:24,660
recognize this and here just three
examples of groups that are looking for

118
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:30,719
products and services here to sample
Cisco Smart connected communities IBM's

119
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:34,550
intelligence operations center and
recently Google sidewalk lab so that's

120
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:41,540
trying the tension of industry as well
and are mentioned some cities but I

121
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:46,360
wonder now be a good time for a question
who has still has a Honeywell nineteen

122
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:52,810
fifties era thermostat on the raw good
choice ok so good choice because you're

123
00:09:52,810 --> 00:10:04,910
probably a lot safer than your home
decorated like that ok now moving on to

124
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:08,790
like what it really means to try and
think about pen testing is something the

125
00:10:08,790 --> 00:10:10,520
skill that we're talking about

126
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:16,410
well we begin our analysis looking at
this is for those who remember sans sans

127
00:10:16,410 --> 00:10:18,219
560

128
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:23,810
testing methodology and it works you
know it in a in a certain scoped

129
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:30,079
environment it works right but how does
something like this scale up or where do

130
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:36,550
you begin when you're thinking at City
skill in another pieces you know it's

131
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:40,170
not just network penetration tests we
have basic building blocks of

132
00:10:40,170 --> 00:10:44,310
traditional pen testing thinking network
penetration test physical penetration

133
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:50,030
test a web application penetration test
or human / software engineer so those

134
00:10:50,030 --> 00:10:55,189
are the basic basic building blocks that
you might have to work with again

135
00:10:55,190 --> 00:11:01,990
prioritize how do you focus those
efforts so we decided to to start with

136
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:07,700
the sands framework and build upon a
framework that looks at the

137
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:12,730
intersections that tied dave was talking
about earlier in his Baltimore example

138
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:18,350
so traditional sales process starts with
understanding the scope it up and tossed

139
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:22,020
an auditing the technical surface area
and then doing a risk analysis in a

140
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:26,260
report for the client in our case we
start with the same place we define the

141
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:29,230
scope of what is a city we talked about
the way to the fact that there are

142
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:33,220
different ways of defining the scope and
then we ought to attack serve as cities

143
00:11:33,220 --> 00:11:36,720
have unique attack services that don't
exist within organizations so we're

144
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:40,710
going to take you through that layer by
layer and then once we've identified the

145
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:43,940
point vulnerabilities in the attack
surface we really need to start looking

146
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:47,500
at what the intersections are between
the those points on our abilities that

147
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:52,050
can cause the sort of cascading failures
that Davis referring to and we look

148
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:56,770
specifically for pressure points that
you can push on that can cause those

149
00:11:56,770 --> 00:12:01,840
dominoes start falling and then on top
of that you can then build your risk

150
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:05,640
analysis you can assess what thread
actors are interested in pushing those

151
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:09,240
buttons and that gives you a more sort
of comprehensive understanding of what

152
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:15,110
the risks are 22 a complex system like a
city so

153
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:19,140
you know the first step here is that
we're going to dissect the surface area

154
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:22,170
of the city and talk about those
different surface areas and then we'll

155
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:26,560
go through the cross sectioning pressure
point and risk analysis so we have to

156
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:30,500
understand it sees themselves it's not
just the local it's just not the local

157
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:35,790
government local government is right
riding herd over a loose coalition of

158
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:41,569
the willing and unwilling to to try and
make the city function so here's an

159
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:46,769
example from San Francisco so you have
the local government but they've got two

160
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:51,130
hundred thousand commercial entities
thousands of nonprofits and a population

161
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:56,230
of eight hundred and thirty-seven
thousand plus or minus so that I mean

162
00:12:56,230 --> 00:13:00,880
that's the complexity the trouble and
it's an important aspect as it's not

163
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:04,630
just not the government itself you have
to think that all the interdependencies

164
00:13:04,630 --> 00:13:09,670
all the interconnections between these
two groups and then just a quick look at

165
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:14,170
what if you want to think about
protecting the nation in the United

166
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:21,399
States using statistics that from there
there's 39,000 cities 1.5 million

167
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:27,320
nonprofits 27 million small businesses
and then you get into hundreds of

168
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:30,740
millions of smart phones personal
computers and people and potentially

169
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:36,519
billions with the emerging Internet of
Things so really it just goes up it's

170
00:13:36,519 --> 00:13:40,459
like powers that video powers of ten
just gets harder and harder harder more

171
00:13:40,459 --> 00:13:45,649
complex so we have to manage that
complexity so one way to look at surface

172
00:13:45,649 --> 00:13:48,660
area for something like a city is to
analyze it in terms of the cyberspace

173
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:52,670
planes and this is a framework that
we've used to analyze different cyber

174
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:55,990
infrastructure and insofar recent
research over the last couple of years

175
00:13:55,990 --> 00:14:00,649
so with with the planes at the very top
of the Supervisory plan which includes

176
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:05,519
people and processes that my pride
command control over other lower

177
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:10,110
elements of cyberspace you have the
persona plane which is you know think

178
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:17,760
network personas login login names email
addresses even even social media

179
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,200
presences

180
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:23,160
blow that you have the logical plane so
you have layers to 3700 signed model

181
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:29,900
operating system and application
software device drivers network

182
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:35,069
different network protocols and packets
below that is the physical plane

183
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:40,720
SolarOne devices routers switches cables
etc and then the geographic plane really

184
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:44,800
describes the physical location of some
of those network devices which is often

185
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:51,810
relevant so something that's different
about cities with other network

186
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:56,079
infrastructures is you have this very
heavy influence of the politics really

187
00:14:56,080 --> 00:15:00,270
at all the planes particularly though we
we see politics at play at the

188
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:05,420
Supervisory plane so you're likely to
have a city is going to be influenced by

189
00:15:05,420 --> 00:15:10,750
state and federal governments applying
pressure at various points in the

190
00:15:10,750 --> 00:15:15,900
Supervisory plane there are various
forms of municipal government so each

191
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:21,949
city is is you know sort of organized in
its own way here we have a sample

192
00:15:21,950 --> 00:15:26,890
coordinated organizational diagram for a
city and you have this combination of

193
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:30,620
elected officials and appointed
officials and that's gonna cause

194
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:34,930
tensions between different factions
within the city government here this

195
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:37,989
picture shows a city manager

196
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:42,710
council-manager style of municipal
government and in this picture of the

197
00:15:42,710 --> 00:15:46,610
the the police chief you know reports
through the city manager to the City

198
00:15:46,610 --> 00:15:50,770
Council you can imagine no in a city
that has a particularly strong police

199
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:55,420
force for example that the police chief
willie Mae sort of owned his own little

200
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:59,060
fiefdom and doesn't feel like he reports
to anybody even though the

201
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:05,359
organizational chart shows him behold
into the city manager so again elected

202
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:10,280
officials and appointed officials
appointed officials are obviously

203
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:14,449
beholden to the to the elected officials
who put them in place and then you have

204
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:18,890
elected officials who are concerned
about pleasing the constituency so they

205
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:23,500
continue to be elected officials and
then you could imagine these silos of of

206
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,620
excellence right so you have all these
different infrastructure sectors and

207
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:30,390
various government agencies and

208
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:35,830
private entities they all have their own
network little silos some of which are

209
00:16:35,830 --> 00:16:41,650
far better secure than than others and
this this diagram is just sort of

210
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:46,400
designed to evoke what those silos look
like from the top down and you have all

211
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:52,160
these very very complex
interdependencies between all the silos

212
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:56,370
so even if some are very well secured
you can imagine that others are less

213
00:16:56,370 --> 00:17:03,050
well secured and then you have sort of
this weakest link problem if you take a

214
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:07,470
step down $11 Prasanna plan you know
cities and other small governments tend

215
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:11,819
toward openness right so they want the
people to have access to the politicians

216
00:17:11,819 --> 00:17:16,230
they published a lot of information
online they have a very active social

217
00:17:16,230 --> 00:17:19,760
media presence there they're publishing
email addresses and information about

218
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,180
members of the city government and all
this could be very rich source of

219
00:17:23,180 --> 00:17:29,280
information for a social engineering
campaign at the logical plan can you

220
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,920
have interdependencies with with systems
that aren't necessarily very compatible

221
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:38,790
you're likely to have industrial control
systems throughout the city I T

222
00:17:38,790 --> 00:17:43,030
infrastructure more and more of which
are connected to the internet for cost

223
00:17:43,030 --> 00:17:47,149
savings and and for the purpose of
convenience and a lot of those

224
00:17:47,150 --> 00:17:52,490
industrial control systems are
notoriously insecure you also have city

225
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:57,600
management software so you have software
that specifically designed to 44 cities

226
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:02,290
to purchase and used to manage city
operations software that has a free

227
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:06,889
spirit Lee small user base purchased by
organizations that probably don't have

228
00:18:06,890 --> 00:18:10,420
big budgets and it would be interesting
thing to do

229
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:16,710
availability assessment of some of this
city management software

230
00:18:16,710 --> 00:18:21,240
example is the IBM intelligent
Operations Center so you have this tool

231
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:25,540
that can be used to view City conditions
used to analyze and social media

232
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:30,490
sentiments really it's sort of like a
real world no sim city playing out in

233
00:18:30,490 --> 00:18:36,340
real time right in front of you so
typical part of a of a pentose

234
00:18:36,340 --> 00:18:40,379
topological plan is to do a port scan
and so we figured we take a look at what

235
00:18:40,380 --> 00:18:44,660
services are some of the major cities in
the United States are running most of

236
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,810
the major cities in the United States it
turns out

237
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:51,440
have provider independent IP address
spaces and so it's pretty easy to find

238
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,880
out what the range right piece that they
have city government is using and take a

239
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:01,570
look at what's in those ip address
spaces sometimes city governments will

240
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:06,350
have a website that's just running
within that IP range in other cases you

241
00:19:06,350 --> 00:19:10,909
know consistently we found that will be
some sort of if there if they're using

242
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:14,500
Akamai or some sort of hosting service
for their website that they'll have a

243
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,980
web app behind that website that's doing
something like letting people pay

244
00:19:17,980 --> 00:19:22,370
traffic tickets or some other
bureaucratic city process and the web

245
00:19:22,370 --> 00:19:25,469
app will be hosted on a machine that's
in the in the provider independent space

246
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:29,190
so once you've got one IP in the space
you can go to the air and database and

247
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:35,150
get the whole IP block and you know see
the entire IP address range for a given

248
00:19:35,150 --> 00:19:44,300
city I have the clicker now so this is a
chart that shows you the tcp/ip services

249
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:48,659
that are posted on the internet by the
ten largest by the city governments of

250
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:53,780
the 10 largest metro areas in the United
States and this data came from the show

251
00:19:53,780 --> 00:19:58,280
and database we you know so of course
there's a better information and other

252
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,950
things wrong with that data and there's
some pretty interesting stuff when you

253
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:06,790
when you drill into the details you know
at the low end of course we expect a web

254
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:11,639
servers one of these cities has an IBM
mainframe that serving as an FTP server

255
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:18,200
of the open Internet there's lots of
off-brand SSH demons and there are a

256
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:24,090
number of legacy web servers few
instances of IIS version 6 which runs on

257
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:28,070
Windows XP or Windows 2003 which is
still supported as a server OS I think

258
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:33,879
and then you know I found a number of
Netscape Enterprise Server version 60

259
00:20:33,880 --> 00:20:37,159
which was released in 2001

260
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:43,460
moving up the chain you know we we
expect to see them points that's you

261
00:20:43,460 --> 00:20:46,440
know something we would anticipate
finding but there are other things we

262
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:52,470
were surprised to see a printer
directory server a number of databases

263
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:59,169
some Windows PowerShell ports in the
case of washingtonDC there were a number

264
00:20:59,169 --> 00:21:03,200
of services over 10,000 with that we
decided not to include in this chart

265
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:07,889
because it just made the truck too much
of an eye chart but those parts included

266
00:21:07,889 --> 00:21:13,699
some ports associated with the video
conferencing system so you know drilling

267
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:17,549
down from the logical plane to the
physical plane cities have a really

268
00:21:17,549 --> 00:21:24,080
interesting physical plane particularly
from a wireless perspective the cities

269
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,369
have traditionally use wireless to
communicate with a to coordinate

270
00:21:28,369 --> 00:21:32,789
operations across a large physical area
they've got you know their emergency

271
00:21:32,789 --> 00:21:36,720
services they've gotten maintenance ppl
garbage trucks etc all these people

272
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,799
communicate over wireless networks

273
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:42,399
a lot of the stuff is becoming
computerized their wireless emergency

274
00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:47,228
coordination broadcast systems and then
he's smart cities initiatives are

275
00:21:47,229 --> 00:21:52,559
bringing a whole bunch of new technology
online often it's either in the 2.5

276
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:59,320
gigahertz or 5.4 gigahertz bands and a
lot of this stuff is getting deployed

277
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:03,200
you know without encryption or with
encryption that is very poorly

278
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:07,840
architected and so you know there's
there's a there's a really interesting

279
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:14,418
wireless spectrum analysis and testing a
city at the same time we're kind of

280
00:22:14,419 --> 00:22:18,960
seeing this renaissance in terms of
tools that are available to people in

281
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:24,229
our community that enable us to audit
the wireless spectrum you know I went

282
00:22:24,229 --> 00:22:29,429
out and spent 20 bucks and got this
little USB G that enables me to do

283
00:22:29,429 --> 00:22:35,019
spectrum analysis up to 1.6 gigahertz
using an app on my android phone so

284
00:22:35,019 --> 00:22:38,889
that's really awesome and the factors
there's a whole lot of people playing

285
00:22:38,889 --> 00:22:43,199
with this at DEFCON in though in the
wireless village so you know there's

286
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,809
sort of this renaissance happening where
on the one hand we're seeing all the

287
00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:48,859
smart city infrastructure get the plate
with all these wireless protocols that

288
00:22:48,859 --> 00:22:49,899
are interesting

289
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:53,970
and we as a community are getting a
bunch of new tools that enable us to

290
00:22:53,970 --> 00:22:58,040
investigate and research and hack that
stuff so you know I think there's gonna

291
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:03,250
be lots of interesting developments over
time in this area below the physical

292
00:23:03,250 --> 00:23:06,810
plane we have the geographic playing the
geographic plane is relevant in the

293
00:23:06,810 --> 00:23:11,760
context of cities for two reasons the
first is that you may not you may have

294
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,600
to deploy something in a particular
location because that's where the city

295
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:18,600
is it's not your fault that hundreds of
years ago people decided to settle in a

296
00:23:18,600 --> 00:23:22,050
tsunami subduction zone that happens to
be where you are and you're going to

297
00:23:22,050 --> 00:23:24,970
have your computers there even though
you would rather put them up in the

298
00:23:24,970 --> 00:23:28,630
hills where they're safer so that's a
that's a challenge that cities have to

299
00:23:28,630 --> 00:23:32,500
contend with the second issue is that
you when you think about pen testing a

300
00:23:32,500 --> 00:23:38,130
corporation usually they have lake
property that you can't trespass on at

301
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:41,320
all of their infrastructure is inside
their properties from the outside you

302
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:45,810
have some physical access challenges but
live inside of city is and we have to be

303
00:23:45,810 --> 00:23:50,399
allowed into them and the infrastructure
is kind of built up around us in a city

304
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:54,660
that means that we can get physical
access to it in ways that sometimes we

305
00:23:54,660 --> 00:24:00,030
chant when we're looking at a corporate
infrastructure and so that's relevant it

306
00:24:00,030 --> 00:24:05,060
leads to threat models and attacks that
that don't necessarily exist for for

307
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:10,620
most organizations with respect to the
sort of point vulnerabilities that exist

308
00:24:10,620 --> 00:24:14,429
in these systems there's been a ton of
research that's been presented on this

309
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:19,940
stage and at DEFCON over the years and
another hacker cautions that demonstrate

310
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:24,410
point vulnerabilities in systems that
are popular in cities you know a couple

311
00:24:24,410 --> 00:24:30,670
prominent examples a seizure queridos
excellent research last year on hiking a

312
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:34,210
traffic lights that the there these
traffic lights that communicate with

313
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:38,410
vehicle sensors over wireless protocol
that has no encryption and so you can

314
00:24:38,410 --> 00:24:42,650
spoof the messages and turn the lights
on and off he's also a look at start

315
00:24:42,650 --> 00:24:49,930
smart street lamps there there have been
there was a talk on bad and wireless

316
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:54,520
encryption for municipal surveillance
system so that you can access the

317
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:58,560
cameras or you know turn on this these
things have a speaker's that allow you

318
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:58,830
to

319
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:04,769
talk to you can talk to people who are
around the cameras the there was a

320
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:08,630
really good talk about europe a couple
years ago where these guys got a smart

321
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:14,010
meter off their house and used a
wireless mesh network to communicate and

322
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:18,960
it was the encryption was done with a
fixed ASP that was stored in EEPROM it

323
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:24,090
so they were able to get the EEPROM get
the ASG out and using that key they

324
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:28,250
could send messages to everyone's house
turning the power off so there's there's

325
00:25:28,250 --> 00:25:31,789
tons of vulnerabilities that happened
have been you know discuss these

326
00:25:31,789 --> 00:25:35,340
conferences over the years that you're
gonna find you on it real cities and

327
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:40,080
increasingly as as some of this new
technology gets to show what you what

328
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,199
you've looked at the surface area and
you understand the point vulnerabilities

329
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:47,350
we gotta get to the next step which you
know is I think unique to the israeli

330
00:25:47,350 --> 00:25:50,719
complicating infrastructures where we
need to consider the intersections

331
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:55,730
between all those vulnerable components
and try to figure out where you know we

332
00:25:55,730 --> 00:26:00,809
have a problem with a domino effect and
so the cross-section is all about

333
00:26:00,809 --> 00:26:04,418
identifying interdependencies between
all these various networks and systems

334
00:26:04,419 --> 00:26:11,029
and so you can imagine that if someone
were to try to take malicious actions

335
00:26:11,029 --> 00:26:13,299
against the city's network that there's
some effects that they're going to

336
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:18,190
achieve those effects have a second and
third order effects that that cascade

337
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:22,740
from there and not only cascade directly
down a single path that could cascade

338
00:26:22,740 --> 00:26:29,960
exponentially on several different pass
there's a fairly strong body of work on

339
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:33,559
interdependencies modeling at least for
critical infrastructure sectors so

340
00:26:33,559 --> 00:26:39,649
here's an example of some of that work
in this image shows an analysis of

341
00:26:39,649 --> 00:26:43,570
interdependencies interdependencies
between a handful of infrastructure

342
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:49,139
sectors so here you have individual
planes that represent infrastructure

343
00:26:49,139 --> 00:26:53,100
sectors and parallel lines represent
subsets of the infrastructure nodes

344
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:56,678
represent key components and then the
dotted lines show some of the

345
00:26:56,679 --> 00:27:00,960
interdependencies and so for example in
this image yet you can add might have an

346
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:06,010
electrical substation failure on the
energy plane that causes a sewer pumping

347
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:09,810
station to fill the water plan that then
leads to see roads being flooded

348
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:13,530
and being disrupted on the
transportation plane so with this

349
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:16,720
more broad understanding of what the
different interdependencies are then

350
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:21,640
then you can start to think about
prioritizing where you want to put your

351
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:27,170
cyber security effort this just shows
another way to to sort of a graphically

352
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:32,630
think through those different
interdependencies and now what we've

353
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:35,440
analyzed the interdependencies we can we
can take a look at the cascading

354
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:39,360
consequences right so we can think of
individual events that might have

355
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:46,149
cascading consequences down a variety of
different paths and if you can draw you

356
00:27:46,150 --> 00:27:49,880
know you can draw some conclusions based
on this analysis 22 again think about

357
00:27:49,880 --> 00:27:56,820
the prioritization so again fairly
robust body of research again it's sort

358
00:27:56,820 --> 00:28:02,439
of focused on the on the critical
infrastructure sectors and really mostly

359
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:05,950
done for disaster planning sorts of
scenarios but here's some references to

360
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:09,030
some work that that's been done and the
slides be available eventually I'm sure

361
00:28:09,030 --> 00:28:17,980
the black hat website so we've put some
thought into the way these different

362
00:28:17,980 --> 00:28:21,330
individual silos are interconnected now
we can start to think about some of the

363
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:25,010
pressure points of places where you
might be able to push you know on

364
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:28,930
something that causes these ripple
effects throughout the city's

365
00:28:28,930 --> 00:28:34,040
infrastructure and the way we like to
think about that it is using this thing

366
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:39,350
that we call center of gravity analysis
in this draws from military doctrine so

367
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:43,730
this the center of gravity is the source
of strength for foreign entity or for an

368
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:49,490
organization and if you think of cities
in all cities have their individual

369
00:28:49,490 --> 00:28:52,780
centers of strength right so if you
think of new york city have the

370
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:57,690
financial sector that is that is a
source of strength for the city in

371
00:28:57,690 --> 00:29:03,090
Orlando you have the amusement park
business god forbid if if Denver were to

372
00:29:03,090 --> 00:29:07,199
lose the legalize marijuana industry

373
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:11,060
course here in Las Vegas you know we
have we have a gambling industries as a

374
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:17,010
center of strength so various centers of
gravity industry related centers of

375
00:29:17,010 --> 00:29:18,360
gravity

376
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:21,330
in different cities and then you have
the critical infrastructure sectors

377
00:29:21,330 --> 00:29:26,530
right so this is the list of 16 critical
infrastructure sectors from from DHS and

378
00:29:26,530 --> 00:29:31,780
you know all cities have some of these
some cities have all of these and there

379
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:35,280
are certain things you can cause to
happen in different infrastructure

380
00:29:35,280 --> 00:29:40,280
sectors that could cause some serious
cascading effects and then we should

381
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:43,030
also think about the non critical
infrastructure right so you have

382
00:29:43,030 --> 00:29:48,800
churches you have sports facilities
theaters local banks Law Offices things

383
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:54,350
that could have a large impact if they
were to be adversely affected in a

384
00:29:54,350 --> 00:29:59,020
metropolitan area and this isn't just
hyperbole so their recent relevant

385
00:29:59,020 --> 00:30:04,920
examples of city centers of gravity
being attacked from from cyber you know

386
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:10,670
being targeted by cyber actors and here
just listed a few so you have the Sony

387
00:30:10,670 --> 00:30:17,830
hacking Sands Casino last year Saudi
Aramco NASDAQ and in 2010 and so you

388
00:30:17,830 --> 00:30:20,840
know each one of these were fairly small
scale attacks but you can imagine if

389
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:24,360
there if there were not only a
large-scale attack on a city center of

390
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:30,620
gravity but a large-scale attack coupled
with some attacks and in some critical

391
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:34,310
infrastructure sectors you can imagine
these cascading failures sort of causing

392
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:39,950
ripples throughout the whole place so
what we what we have identified these

393
00:30:39,950 --> 00:30:44,050
pressure points and and we we understand
you know where the centers of gravity

394
00:30:44,050 --> 00:30:47,570
are you to perform risk analysis

395
00:30:47,570 --> 00:30:51,290
the basis of this risk analysis is not
dissimilar from what we need to do in a

396
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:56,149
regular tactical pen test of a private
company we need to look at the different

397
00:30:56,150 --> 00:31:00,470
thread actors that these organizations
face and we need to consider you know

398
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:04,910
what motivations those three doctors
have what keep those tractors have to

399
00:31:04,910 --> 00:31:08,390
they have the ability to exploit a
particular vulnerability I also think

400
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:14,140
it's important to think about the
typical of that group and and how they

401
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:18,780
usually operate because they're likely
to do things in the future that they

402
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:21,600
have done in the past things that are
huge payments for them are less likely

403
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:25,610
to occur even if they're within their
capabilities and also what the what the

404
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:28,840
life cycle of their attack

405
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:33,760
what what what the frequency of their
attacks are that enables us to predict

406
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,690
how likely particular event is to happen
in the future there are a few

407
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:41,909
conclusions that this sort of general
conclusion that the sort of risk

408
00:31:41,909 --> 00:31:47,730
analysis process implies for cities the
first is that you can be a small city

409
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:52,500
that's kind of out in the middle of
nowhere and you know kind of think of

410
00:31:52,500 --> 00:31:57,059
yourself as off the beaten path and
still be a target internationally for

411
00:31:57,059 --> 00:32:01,730
you know computer attacks because on the
internet everything is is just as

412
00:32:01,730 --> 00:32:06,230
connected and so you're is just as
accessible as Los Angeles from from from

413
00:32:06,230 --> 00:32:10,320
a computer perspective and so that's
something that you know sometimes

414
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,730
catches people off guard

415
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:19,230
another fact is that we couldn't so so
we could have infrastructure that's

416
00:32:19,230 --> 00:32:22,880
vulnerable that sits out there for a
long period of time that without

417
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:27,059
necessarily having anything bad happen I
tend to think about the way that you

418
00:32:27,059 --> 00:32:30,210
know people tend to settle in
earthquake-prone regions or regions that

419
00:32:30,210 --> 00:32:33,250
are subject to tsunamis and they can
live there for years and years and years

420
00:32:33,250 --> 00:32:38,260
before they have a bad day and you know
when you do you think of you know we

421
00:32:38,260 --> 00:32:41,110
know that there's lots of security
issues with water treatment plants for

422
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:44,439
example there's lots of if you look at
ICS sure they've they reported that

423
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:47,409
there's lots of problems with the system
is being directly connected to the

424
00:32:47,409 --> 00:32:50,990
Internet as we know their systems have
security vulnerabilities people in this

425
00:32:50,990 --> 00:32:55,070
community of talked about it for years
but you know the problem is that no one

426
00:32:55,070 --> 00:33:00,220
cares financially motivated attackers
are not interested in attacking you know

427
00:33:00,220 --> 00:33:04,850
water treatment facilities maybe there's
a ransomware scenario but it would be a

428
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:07,918
lot of work for them to get that
software and set it up themselves and

429
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:11,919
find you know good attack scenario that
they can reproduce against people and so

430
00:33:11,919 --> 00:33:15,039
they just don't bother they've got other
things that other things that they're

431
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:18,720
doing to generate money and so those
things considered out there for a long

432
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:22,169
time I thought something bad happening
to them but a nation state has the

433
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:26,960
ability to get access that software has
the ability to find out what you come up

434
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:30,480
with an attack scenario against it may
have a motivation to do so

435
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:34,970
nation states operate on a different
time scale and so it's not something

436
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:37,230
that's going to happen next week it's
not something that's going to happen

437
00:33:37,230 --> 00:33:40,590
next year but it is something that may
happen eventually

438
00:33:40,590 --> 00:33:41,590
and so

439
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:45,850
you know I think that the problem is
that the longer time goes on the the

440
00:33:45,850 --> 00:33:50,439
higher the probability of these events
occurring one other observation about

441
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:54,750
this and that is that you know when I
think of the the cross-section and and

442
00:33:54,750 --> 00:33:57,860
pressure plate analysis that they've
just took us through I really think

443
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:04,100
about the the OPM and when I'm about to
say here you know is a personal comment

444
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:08,699
that may or may not reflect the opinions
of my co prisoners but you know that

445
00:34:08,699 --> 00:34:15,210
that particular dataset is obviously a
dataset the compromise of that data shit

446
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:18,070
is something that has widespread
implications for the federal government

447
00:34:18,070 --> 00:34:23,500
in the United States it is a bit is a
pressure point that hard cascading is

448
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:28,149
happening cascading effects and we know
that their threat actors out there that

449
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:32,429
have a regular attack lifecycle who
target identity caches we've had

450
00:34:32,429 --> 00:34:36,830
multiple identity cash was stolen from
all kinds of different organizations by

451
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:41,009
sophisticated tractors over time it so
when you consider the sort of analysis

452
00:34:41,010 --> 00:34:45,780
that that we're talking about you know
the idea that that particular dataset

453
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:50,609
would have been targeted as a pretty
predictable thing and so you know the

454
00:34:50,609 --> 00:34:54,399
the question is like who is looking at
the federal government of the united

455
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:58,700
states across the board and asking you
know what are the what are the pressure

456
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:02,609
points one of the centers of gravity
that could have widespread consequences

457
00:35:02,609 --> 00:35:08,750
and and responsible for prioritizing
those things a lot of people are

458
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:13,540
satisfied that the bureaucrats who was
responsible for operating that agency

459
00:35:13,540 --> 00:35:17,940
has been replaced with a different
washington bureaucrat but I I don't

460
00:35:17,940 --> 00:35:21,849
personally find that that it to be
satisfactory I don't think that solves

461
00:35:21,849 --> 00:35:25,690
the problem that we have which is a
systemic risk a problem that exists at a

462
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:32,140
different level of abstraction so we got
from my personal editorial opinions you

463
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:36,368
know what we need to do to to solve this
problem and you know it's obviously a

464
00:35:36,369 --> 00:35:40,420
very complicated problem one of the
people that we spoke to who is

465
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:44,740
responsible for security in a major city
said you know I treat my city like your

466
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:49,359
company and I operate you know using the
practices that I would operate if I was

467
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:51,140
trying to protect the company

468
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:54,970
and you know off tonight that can be
effective you you'd treat each

469
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:59,339
department of the city government as a
business and any business unit and you

470
00:35:59,340 --> 00:36:02,270
set standards and you get everyone
communicating and you you you come up

471
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:05,490
with the same sort of things that you
would if you were if you are operating a

472
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:10,689
business there are however differences
and that particular scales those

473
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:14,450
differences can have a bigger effect one
key difference which they've talked

474
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:18,430
about is the fact that you were operated
by politicians who have a tendency to

475
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:23,430
get re-elected or not get reelected and
so when you get a new partition you know

476
00:36:23,430 --> 00:36:26,520
they they may have different priorities
they may have a different understanding

477
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:31,920
of the significance of computer security
as a priority and so that can cause

478
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:35,380
budgets to shift that can cause the
architecture that change underneath you

479
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:38,860
in a way that that is probably less
predictable than you would find in a in

480
00:36:38,860 --> 00:36:43,770
a company and so as we talk to people
that operated security in different

481
00:36:43,770 --> 00:36:48,220
cities we came up with this hypothesis
and that is that there might be a sweet

482
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:53,200
spot where you know what you're too
small and you're too remote chances are

483
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:56,770
you have a lot of difficulty recruiting
and training people that know things

484
00:36:56,770 --> 00:37:00,380
about computer security you probably
have difficulty coming up with a budget

485
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:06,650
for working on computer security at the
same time if you're a big city you've

486
00:37:06,650 --> 00:37:10,570
got all these departments you've got all
these fiefdoms you've got different

487
00:37:10,570 --> 00:37:13,950
people running their own I T departments
with their own technologies in their own

488
00:37:13,950 --> 00:37:17,290
way they don't necessarily want to
cooperate with each other and so you've

489
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:21,400
got a lot of cats to hurt and they can
be very difficult to manage that there

490
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:25,970
may be a sweet spot of you know cities
that are about in the middle that have

491
00:37:25,970 --> 00:37:30,049
the resources that are big enough to
attract pelted InfoSec professionals but

492
00:37:30,050 --> 00:37:34,520
at the same time you know not so
complicated that it's difficult to wrap

493
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:38,200
your hands around it's it's you know
possible to get everyone beating to the

494
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:43,040
same drum and the implication of this
hypothesis is that cities of different

495
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:45,170
sizes need different things

496
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:50,280
cities that are remote may still be
targets of attacks over the internet and

497
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:53,280
they need technical help they don't know
what to do and they don't have people

498
00:37:53,280 --> 00:37:58,150
who can do it on the other side of the
spectrum major cities you know may need

499
00:37:58,150 --> 00:38:01,990
better leadership they need leadership
that understands this is a priority and

500
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:04,450
have the political influence to get
everybody

501
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:08,680
all these different departments working
together and communicating together so

502
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:12,149
one of the things that we think you know
needs to be developed as a capability

503
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:16,570
maturity model for cities from a
security standpoint the talks about you

504
00:38:16,570 --> 00:38:19,670
know how well coordinated and how
prepared cities are to deal with

505
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:23,990
security incidents how well incident
response teams different parts of the

506
00:38:23,990 --> 00:38:29,819
city communicate with each other you
know how how how good that city is at

507
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:33,160
just protecting and walking down the
infrastructure that has we think there's

508
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:36,078
probably a good conference talking this
capability maturity model someone's

509
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:40,940
interested in developing yet another
thing that's happening out there which

510
00:38:40,940 --> 00:38:44,680
you think is really interesting is the
securing smart cities initiative there's

511
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:47,819
a number of companies with folks here at
this conference who are really

512
00:38:47,820 --> 00:38:51,540
interested in the risks that are posed
by some of this smart cities technology

513
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:54,869
that's getting deployed out there they
would like to see more work done on on

514
00:38:54,869 --> 00:38:58,650
on protecting that they're trying to
raise awareness there's some really good

515
00:38:58,650 --> 00:39:03,369
research papers up on their website and
we do you think it's worth checking out

516
00:39:03,369 --> 00:39:09,869
one of the sites we had as we looked at
this problem the smart cities problem is

517
00:39:09,869 --> 00:39:13,400
that there's a need for broadband
wardriving

518
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:18,930
we've been driving the issue 11 spectrum
for 15 years or something but you know

519
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:21,690
that's just a little piece of the
picture we really need to be able to see

520
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:24,670
an increase for cities to protect
themselves they need to be able to see

521
00:39:24,670 --> 00:39:30,190
the entire spectrum and we're talking
about these these transmitters they're

522
00:39:30,190 --> 00:39:33,250
pretty low power and so it's very
difficult to identify low power

523
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:38,930
transmitters over big physical area so
we need new strategies one strategy is

524
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:43,220
is the possibility of crowdsourcing this
data I can get a device for 20 bucks

525
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:46,919
that lets me do spectrum analysis so if
lots of us have them then we can start

526
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:49,819
posting things we database somewhere in
there actually is a pretty interesting

527
00:39:49,819 --> 00:39:54,170
project I learned about yesterday that
where people are beginning to do so

528
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:58,460
before driving and posting it on a
database online you know another another

529
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:02,099
idea if the city wanted to take things
into their own hands that I had his is

530
00:40:02,099 --> 00:40:06,020
you could you could put spectrum
analysis equipment inside a police cars

531
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:09,910
because police cars drive everywhere and
so eventually you'll collect data about

532
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:14,649
all of the transmitters that are you
know in your municipality now this idea

533
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:16,750
might be a little controversial to have

534
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:19,910
spectrum analysis device inside of a
police car that's collecting data about

535
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:24,129
transmitters there could be some
sensitive information and unique MAC

536
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:27,330
addresses and things like that associate
with private citizens and perhaps that

537
00:40:27,330 --> 00:40:30,549
date went into getting used for law
enforcement purposes and so there's

538
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:34,150
probably an interesting dialogue there
about like that idea dangerous is it a

539
00:40:34,150 --> 00:40:38,850
good idea what should we be doing and
and so you know I think that this is an

540
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:44,470
area where there's a need for new tools
and and and you know some new projects I

541
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:48,919
i think that you know the UI on my app
is designed for listening to the radio

542
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:52,920
it's not really designed for spectrum
analysis I'd love to see some more apps

543
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:57,250
that support these these these these
suffer defined radios that are really

544
00:40:57,250 --> 00:41:00,700
designed for this kind of work so I
think there's a lot of projects and a

545
00:41:00,700 --> 00:41:05,569
lot of opportunities for some cool
hacking to do in this in this area

546
00:41:05,570 --> 00:41:09,970
another strategy is the use of
simulation exercises I mean there are

547
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:13,359
homeland defense type exercise of the go
on now but I'm thinking about continuing

548
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:18,430
that we're finding that focusing on
information security in particular and I

549
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:22,980
like the idea of combining with some
physical or physical management's

550
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:28,410
manifestation of the of the results so
when you have these exercises are they

551
00:41:28,410 --> 00:41:31,379
can be light way they can be something
like a communications exercise it just

552
00:41:31,380 --> 00:41:34,460
tells people who to call in certain
circumstances and they practice those

553
00:41:34,460 --> 00:41:39,380
all the way down to two very deep dive
exercises perhaps from the packet level

554
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:44,230
I like the idea of a physical
manifestation you may be familiar with

555
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:51,310
sam says cyber city project that has
underwriting critical infrastructure and

556
00:41:51,310 --> 00:41:56,529
allows people to do exercises on the
underlying infrastructure sector which

557
00:41:56,530 --> 00:42:01,910
hit real-world responses from the the
mini tri-city I can envision a day you

558
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:06,240
know where city could have like a small
version of itself that they would use to

559
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:10,680
conduct these exercises and other
would-be efforts out of the Michigan

560
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:15,240
cyber range and and then if there's an
opportunity with a virtual I solution

561
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:18,560
that would allow people to do this

562
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:20,759
the state these type of exercises in a
very

563
00:42:20,760 --> 00:42:26,430
scalable scalable lack the political
will to really the the political

564
00:42:26,430 --> 00:42:30,810
motivations required fact change would
do the work for the information security

565
00:42:30,810 --> 00:42:35,000
community to raise public awareness and
gained media attention that they could

566
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:41,410
get some voters concerned I is I think
it necessary aspect of helping secure

567
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:47,640
cities would also point to estonia when
you think about stony estonia's smaller

568
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:53,390
study the nation is smaller than many
united states cities but it takes it and

569
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:59,109
they've learned their lessons from there
really be the major tactic they suffered

570
00:42:59,110 --> 00:43:04,980
so they've got their their building in
information security into the backbone

571
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:06,210
of what they do

572
00:43:06,210 --> 00:43:09,980
right it's not an afterthought and
there's a nice article on their model

573
00:43:09,980 --> 00:43:16,100
three governments in the communications
of the ACM June 2015 editions of

574
00:43:16,100 --> 00:43:22,029
something that you're interested in and
that I'd recommend that to you we had to

575
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:26,440
put that in there and with that

576
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:41,500
think a parting comments know they will
take questions thanks it's really hard

577
00:43:41,500 --> 00:44:00,040
for sassy so just go ahead

578
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:08,980
so what we've done is to discuss the
specifics and he's become a standard

579
00:44:08,980 --> 00:44:14,810
practice right but we've we've received
a large cities and have been helping

580
00:44:14,810 --> 00:44:18,400
them design so basically talked about
with their problems helping them

581
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:24,490
designed exercises have a top-down
approach and then tom toms taken a

582
00:44:24,490 --> 00:44:34,919
bottom-up approach to to gather
information but I i think that different

583
00:44:34,920 --> 00:44:37,670
cities are at different levels of
sophistication with respect to this we

584
00:44:37,670 --> 00:44:40,900
did a couple of the cities that we were
talking to we're trying to look at night

585
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:46,340
doing across the board pen testing or
they had just begun to do so and so

586
00:44:46,340 --> 00:44:49,370
really what we're trying to do is
provide a framework for people to

587
00:44:49,370 --> 00:44:57,040
organize that work in to think about
what they need to do so I guess I may be

588
00:44:57,040 --> 00:45:03,509
the next test question just kind of a
brief one and I don't want this come

589
00:45:03,510 --> 00:45:11,080
across the wrong way but with the idea
of you know out of en masse telecom

590
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:14,520
trash collection especially trash
collection because they drive everywhere

591
00:45:14,520 --> 00:45:19,190
out of all the different entities within
a city that drive all over the place you

592
00:45:19,190 --> 00:45:26,200
selected policeman what's wrong with you
we did have the central discussion time

593
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:31,930
would you like to feel that question you
know I don't have it it's what occurred

594
00:45:31,930 --> 00:45:37,779
to me like garbage trucks that's akin to
my garbage trucks are not always

595
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:41,720
municipal some people have private
garbage collection

596
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:46,419
yeah I think that there are interesting
controversial questions that that raises

597
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:51,300
and I think it's interesting discussion
which I'd be happy to have a beer what's

598
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:56,790
this is what's this is over here by

599
00:45:56,790 --> 00:46:03,340
with regard to crowdsourcing the
spectrum analysis that were driving

600
00:46:03,340 --> 00:46:08,950
what's your experience and expectation
of the municipal response to that in

601
00:46:08,950 --> 00:46:15,960
some jurisdictions it's illegal so goes
back to the comment that I made that

602
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:20,290
that you know the besieged cities that
are all over the board from a

603
00:46:20,290 --> 00:46:23,800
sophistication standpoint perhaps that
was clear in the in the diagram of

604
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:29,710
tcp/ip services I put up there and and
we see cities that like within a city

605
00:46:29,710 --> 00:46:32,430
you have different organizations that
are all over the board from

606
00:46:32,430 --> 00:46:36,919
sophistication standpoint and so
certainly one of the the stages of

607
00:46:36,920 --> 00:46:39,840
coming to terms with information
security is the stage where you start

608
00:46:39,840 --> 00:46:43,910
shooting the messenger and so yeah
absolutely like like going around doing

609
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:50,430
wireless or driving is going to provoke
some people but I I guess teaching them

610
00:46:50,430 --> 00:46:54,089
through the process of being provoked
and reaching acceptance that that this

611
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:58,200
is a reality is part of how we get
people to do the right things maybe so

612
00:46:58,200 --> 00:47:03,230
you know perhaps it's a good thing that
we provoke them sometimes have you been

613
00:47:03,230 --> 00:47:08,400
doing with foreign cities shell has this
global initiative and smart cities

614
00:47:08,400 --> 00:47:12,380
boys look on smart governance tokyo's
definitely worried about the Olympics in

615
00:47:12,380 --> 00:47:19,100
2012 on the big market out there for
this yes we did talk to some overseas

616
00:47:19,100 --> 00:47:23,069
journalists yesterday about some of the
city and it does seem that that

617
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:26,630
internationally there are some countries
that just sort of feel like this isn't

618
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:29,260
as big a problem as in United States

619
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:32,350
you know they feel like they're
government entities and infrastructure

620
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:38,049
sectors cooperate better then maybe we
do not know the extent to which that is

621
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:43,010
true maybe the case may not be but I
agree I think I think you know cities

622
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:49,470
that have upcoming huge events like the
Olympics or World Cup or you know

623
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:50,480
etcetera

624
00:47:50,480 --> 00:47:56,910
this is this is a good way to us or to
analyze one aspect of the security for

625
00:47:56,910 --> 00:48:00,569
those large scale events yet so I jabbed
what you're saying I definitely think

626
00:48:00,570 --> 00:48:04,360
that the japanese government is taking
information security around the Olympics

627
00:48:04,360 --> 00:48:08,300
very seriously she seems to be that
there are a bunch of initiatives that

628
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:09,170
they've launched

629
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:16,000
around and around inside a responsible
like also to further point the smart

630
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,490
cities initiatives are they really seem
to be taking off in Europe or people she

631
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:22,200
may be a little bit more concerned with
energy conservation than they are in the

632
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:26,058
united states and show you know a lot of
that infrastructure is getting deployed

633
00:48:26,059 --> 00:48:28,859
over there and a lot of the
vulnerabilities are are are propping up

634
00:48:28,859 --> 00:48:32,220
over there so we're probably gonna see
some of those things unfold there before

635
00:48:32,220 --> 00:48:38,240
you see them unfold here just one thing
I terms of the back in terms of

636
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:45,250
monitoring why is the spectrum Rd amor
se touchpoint than Google driving around

637
00:48:45,250 --> 00:48:49,040
doing its mapping the same thing right
because they were were driving as as

638
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:52,270
they mapped and they got in trouble
because I guess they were collecting

639
00:48:52,270 --> 00:48:58,089
cleartext wifi package and so are
arguably they were wiretapping you know

640
00:48:58,089 --> 00:49:03,308
and so clearly like if you're gonna do
that then you need you to avoid

641
00:49:03,309 --> 00:49:07,290
collecting content but you know knowing
that the transmitter is there and

642
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:11,160
knowing what kind of transmitter is you
know it's not content information but

643
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:13,618
these are the kinds of things that need
to be sucked out in order to run an

644
00:49:13,619 --> 00:49:17,589
operation like this and obviously
Google's a very savvy company when it

645
00:49:17,589 --> 00:49:22,619
comes to you know technology and they
ran afoul of this so it's obviously

646
00:49:22,619 --> 00:49:27,230
mindful to a certain extent and people
need to understand the issues when they

647
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:30,369
perceive that's basically the reason
that I'm saying it needs to be a

648
00:49:30,369 --> 00:49:35,869
discussion so I also had the idea of a
business opportunity I mean I do sense

649
00:49:35,869 --> 00:49:40,200
that there's there's a market if you are
penetration testers think the next level

650
00:49:40,200 --> 00:49:44,049
scale and I don't know how much budget
how much money cities had actually

651
00:49:44,049 --> 00:49:47,509
higher penetration testing forums but I
think cities are increasingly becoming

652
00:49:47,510 --> 00:49:53,730
interested so it looks like we're out of
time and I see a black black and white 0

653
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:58,809
being held up at us so we'll we'll go
ahead and and here and we're happy to

654
00:49:58,809 --> 00:50:01,369
thank you very much for coming thanks
