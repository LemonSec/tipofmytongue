1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,420
let's welcome Kobe morning at this URL
right they coming out so today we're

2
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:15,849
going to talk about spread spectrum
signals and hacking the Globalstar

3
00:00:15,849 --> 00:00:17,400
simplex data service

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:23,359
yes that US satellites superstar want to
give a shout out to ever booted the

5
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:30,550
elevator computers this morning that he
got the day started off right the first

6
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:35,170
time and actual mechanical engineer that
loves computer security like really

7
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:39,739
worked at the center on the R&D team I
first got interested in satellites and

8
00:00:39,739 --> 00:00:44,980
radios when I got my ham radio license
while back just ladies that's not my

9
00:00:44,980 --> 00:00:51,260
call sign up there so be sure radio me
I'm single but anyway what is this

10
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:55,739
company soon after I worked for
basically we're start up with a new spin

11
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:00,059
on security for the enterprise army
embedded security researchers to her

12
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:06,280
clients on a daily basis for some pretty
crazy payouts recycles I wanna come join

13
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:10,240
our team and you're worried about
security come talk to us with a sweet

14
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,110
tooth the lobby got two free drinks and
cocktails out there so comes around if

15
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:18,310
you want to chat more about this
research

16
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:23,560
alright so a brief introduction of
motivation you know why why am I doing

17
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:26,320
this I want to try something new

18
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,520
frustrated with the top diversity lately
you know same-sex offers associate's

19
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:39,740
degree tend to be kinda like ultimate
hack and see if you want every year like

20
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:44,929
very theoretical and I'm gonna go home
and apply the knowledge you are doing a

21
00:01:44,929 --> 00:01:47,840
lot of research at Seneca location-based
privacy so we can get location

22
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,929
monitoring satellite seemed like a good
fit the bottom line I wanted to

23
00:01:51,929 --> 00:01:55,229
establish something different and
hopefully inspire some cooperation and

24
00:01:55,229 --> 00:02:00,259
further research and unexplored area
will be released into some tools whether

25
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:03,890
David tomorrow I haven't had the time to
get up yet but they'll be on get double

26
00:02:03,890 --> 00:02:06,740
the length of the end hopefully some you
guys are interested

27
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:14,290
home so what we gonna learn to talk
about the basics

28
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:19,160
modulation introduction to what spread
spectrum is there going to selectively

29
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:24,760
target and reverse engineering and then
hopefully that target and you know I

30
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,870
started doing this research kind of my
on my spare time just lack of it wanted

31
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:31,829
to keep it on the cheap so we're going
to this offer you know less than $1000

32
00:02:31,829 --> 00:02:35,769
to get pretty accessible to everyone
here is quite a bit of material to cover

33
00:02:35,769 --> 00:02:40,180
so I move pretty fast and hopefully
questions at the end

34
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,530
resources will be online

35
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:48,410
so I intend to keep it all fairly high
level to give you know the geriatric the

36
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:51,790
skills they need to analyze satellite
systems and really hopefully all you're

37
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:58,929
gonna need coming out of here is let's
talk about targeting how do we pick the

38
00:02:58,930 --> 00:03:04,560
system there's lots and lots lots of
potential targets out there are these

39
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,890
just a couple and they operate on a
variety for consumer interest but the

40
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:15,679
right one was key so to be namely
consumer accessible to keep this was a

41
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:19,510
side project now is funny myself so want
to keep the barrier to entry pretty low

42
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:25,070
I wanna be popular and you know so we
can be pretty high impact across the

43
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:29,150
board and you know we have something to
talk about

44
00:03:29,150 --> 00:03:35,760
personally was familiar with Globalstar
spot while consumer products and

45
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:40,840
personally I think they're fantastic I
used them while backpacking and they

46
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:46,230
also make attackers for your car to get
stolen or something like that and then a

47
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:49,060
personal locator beacons meanwhile back
at you need help you break your leg

48
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:54,720
search-and-rescue don't come get you
anywhere in the world so I started

49
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,890
looking deeper into this technology and
it turns out that their commercial

50
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:02,738
offerings and even some like military
operations they used the same

51
00:04:02,739 --> 00:04:06,090
technologies to consumer tech so that
the same perfect the implications were

52
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:10,790
very broad spread so disliked by a
dirt-cheap device to research and

53
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:15,138
research and translate all is expensive
prices not to mention anything founded

54
00:04:15,139 --> 00:04:19,750
be pretty high impact caused these
things are deployed everywhere I looked

55
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:24,590
at my research focus on three main
devices the Globalstar spot trace

56
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:30,250
looking began the smart one commercial

57
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:35,130
mostly is like a shipping containers and
the spot Jan 23 the personal locator

58
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:42,120
beacon but he also wears a satellite
technology used really everywhere the

59
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,620
tech is designed to be integrated
anywhere low bandwidth off grid

60
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:49,750
communications are needed most
interesting it's used in SCADA systems

61
00:04:49,750 --> 00:04:55,960
gas and oil operations military and
predominately asset tracking something

62
00:04:55,960 --> 00:05:01,000
shipping containers and other things you
know armored cars interesting stuff

63
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:08,940
operates on what's called the Globalstar
simplex data network is the data network

64
00:05:08,940 --> 00:05:14,890
in the case about the trackers are
portrayed as well

65
00:05:14,890 --> 00:05:18,789
the tracker gets its location from GPS
satellites and then it begins its

66
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:22,530
location and other meted out to
Globalstar satellite satellite simply

67
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:26,219
for that information back down to the
ground stations all around the globe and

68
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:30,990
decoding process the data from the
packet ford's it on through the Internet

69
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:36,460
to global starts back in infrastructure
or two users customer

70
00:05:36,460 --> 00:05:42,400
technology to SMS to Sally world very
short the data packet size about seventy

71
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:49,909
two bits so the global star system is a
series of low-earth orbit satellites in

72
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:54,480
the way I been paid system works does
that actually what goes up is exactly

73
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:58,580
what comes down just kind of ships the
frequency of the data and it keeps the

74
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:02,940
cost us that low as it's pretty diamond
doesn't do any processing cheapskate

75
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:08,690
reusability really flexible but notice
the data link is in one direction and

76
00:06:08,690 --> 00:06:14,940
the simplex data network so reliable but
turns out that he stay packages sent

77
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:19,280
multiple times to ensure successful
transmission so you know to 33 times in

78
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,140
Tripoli about testing these things are
crazy reliable you can leave a

79
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:26,610
transmitter my trunk like a shield in
this still gets out

80
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:32,000
so it's easy to deal with these ground
stations were talking about it turns out

81
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,930
there's hundreds of them around the
globe and they handle all the reception

82
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:39,800
of satellite data and others also two
main operations control centers that

83
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,710
handle the actual operational satellites
in the control you know where birds

84
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:46,859
positioning extra one of those is
located in San Jose California where the

85
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:51,289
other is but you can see a picture that
they're on the right on the ground

86
00:06:51,289 --> 00:06:58,199
stations look like he's making sure the
coverage map will start website you can

87
00:06:58,199 --> 00:07:02,189
see those patches with no coverage
namely the oceans and that's because

88
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:05,789
there's no ground stationarity receive
the satellite data on each ground

89
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:09,849
station provides a few thousand mile
reception window you can see down in

90
00:07:09,849 --> 00:07:15,069
South Africa there's a big deal clear
actually just recently tagged coverage

91
00:07:15,069 --> 00:07:20,569
down there so I was a deliberate
groundwork for us just to get an idea of

92
00:07:20,569 --> 00:07:24,729
a class general security posture to look
at the website I was having trouble

93
00:07:24,729 --> 00:07:30,090
signing up for an account and you know I
try to login and you know what this

94
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:37,060
looks like a sequence action and so like
a warm fuzzy feeling like a punt on

95
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:42,900
target that a little deeper it turns out
the data from the ground stations before

96
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:49,679
to clients over FTP and HTTP yeah there
there's no s so it might be just easier

97
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,360
to type of data over the internet
instead of over the air but you know

98
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:58,669
would be too easy so things are looking
pretty good in general and a leg for

99
00:07:58,669 --> 00:08:03,599
them to try to break us so let's dig
deeper into the actual salary system so

100
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:09,009
we need to gather our intelligence how
to do that well you know where to look

101
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:12,340
for hardware information of course
Google you know everyone rules

102
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:17,489
everything but the FCC database turn out
to be like to welcome information

103
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:21,259
essentially if you have a device in the
us-

104
00:08:21,259 --> 00:08:25,150
to register with the SEC to make sure
that transmit other people's frequency

105
00:08:25,150 --> 00:08:29,568
as I can form so it's a universal
fitting your papers are signed docs and

106
00:08:29,569 --> 00:08:34,719
and you know that's enough to share this
all also academic papers as a lot but a

107
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,529
lot of studies on the global star system
as well as I had a lot of leaks in a

108
00:08:38,529 --> 00:08:43,500
greater spec sheets which is downtown
static also want to make sure that

109
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,440
someone else had already broke the
system to look for any prior research it

110
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,310
turns out Travis Goodspeed I'm sure many
BS know him

111
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:56,979
Bluetooth protocol of one of Globalstar
devices just kind of the protocol is so

112
00:08:56,980 --> 00:09:01,029
you can send messages to the Globalstar
devices over the network guy by the name

113
00:09:01,029 --> 00:09:05,620
of nature important to look at the GPS
micro controller interface on board one

114
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:10,000
of the Old Spot personal locator beacons
wanted up a little bit deeper this was

115
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,350
that research deal with satellite
communications themselves so deep in

116
00:09:17,350 --> 00:09:21,810
that city database I found that ship
called the STX 3 kept coming up

117
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:25,279
turns out that's one of the transmitters
used by the simplex data network

118
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:31,050
integrators to put these creations in
their devices that low-cost low-power

119
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:34,370
entire you can see it's about the size
of a quarter and that thing will talk to

120
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,270
us

121
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:39,420
and listen nice diagrams came along with
the state the reference come to center

122
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:45,680
where things go these diagrams I kept
seeing this DSS and BPSK coming up we'll

123
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,410
talk about that more in a minute I
didn't really know what they were but

124
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:56,110
they were probably so get to see
databases also came up with the various

125
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:59,830
frequency ranges like global stars uses
for the Simplex didn't work in the case

126
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:04,000
of me specific devices and also
mentioned their frequencies they operate

127
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:08,020
on about 1.6 caterers

128
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:13,960
around some more manufacturer spec sheet
company and the company that used to

129
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:18,060
make these transmitter chips life and
global star for the simplex data network

130
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:22,890
reference all these wacky primarily to
make any sense but I could help feel

131
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:29,430
like they're important so note that some
readers doc says we see that DSS again

132
00:10:29,430 --> 00:10:35,859
and something called a 255 chip p.m.
sequence at a rate of 1.25 mega chips

133
00:10:35,860 --> 00:10:41,060
per second a reference data rate of
hundred-point 04 bits per second it

134
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:45,250
turns out these are all parameters for
dr. modulation and four of the specific

135
00:10:45,250 --> 00:10:49,470
system will talk about that as well

136
00:10:49,470 --> 00:10:53,440
some point talk about the spread
spectrum stuff that's cool

137
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,760
brief review of waves and modulation

138
00:10:56,760 --> 00:11:01,630
remember that radio waves radio signals
are transmitted on radio waves and it

139
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:05,960
isn't cold waves by modulating various
parameters about wave remember that

140
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:10,150
waves have three main characteristics
that we can modify one being wavelength

141
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:14,870
essentially the frequency how many
cycles per second and then the face the

142
00:11:14,870 --> 00:11:18,840
position of the way relative to a fixed
point and empty the way the century

143
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:24,740
house and then you know when we look at
ways we have a couple different ways to

144
00:11:24,740 --> 00:11:28,910
look at them from earlier with the
time-domain representation where time is

145
00:11:28,910 --> 00:11:33,900
on the x-axis and y-axis working with
signals we look at what's called the

146
00:11:33,900 --> 00:11:40,900
frequency-domain representation is on
the x-axis and y-axis so this frequency

147
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:44,230
domain representation essentially shows
us what frequency components make up a

148
00:11:44,230 --> 00:11:49,570
signal frequency domain representation
of a peer hundred kilohertz I'll a shop

149
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:54,460
assistant sharks sharks bike $100 its
mark

150
00:11:54,460 --> 00:12:01,250
and sometimes we call this an FTP time
singles containing so many different

151
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,580
frequency components and will take on
kind of a really unique shapes and

152
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:11,300
different types of signals visual
representation so we can look at them

153
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:15,339
let's let's start and see how ought
analog modulation has died I'm gonna

154
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:19,430
look at both AM and FM both of which you
probably don't listen to in the car and

155
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:24,620
I'm radio since 10 a.m. signal
essentially have a carrier wave at the

156
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:32,480
desired frequency and amplitude of this
wave according to your data which we

157
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,300
call them getting signal the resulting
signal is like a center there you can

158
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:41,069
see the resulting signal notice how you
carried one parameter

159
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:45,440
descended over there and sort of
modulating the carrier analog leave we

160
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,690
could have also simply read it between
two discrete amplitudes Tokyo digital

161
00:12:49,690 --> 00:12:51,580
data as well

162
00:12:51,580 --> 00:13:00,490
the method of encoding digital data over
a.m. ok I asked a simple to ship it

163
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:04,070
would do the same thing the frequency
modulated except we vary the carrier

164
00:13:04,070 --> 00:13:08,900
frequency according to the modulating
signal amplitude again we cannot ship to

165
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:13,819
the between two or more distinct
frequencies code these data samples in

166
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:19,200
this method for selling dildo was called
for

167
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,600
and so as we talked about the delay I
was called a scare ok and did you let

168
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:28,490
them is called for what we wanted to
vary the third parameter and in a manner

169
00:13:28,490 --> 00:13:32,840
that we can do this in a manner that's
called phase shift and we can do that to

170
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:37,050
encode data on a way of using just a
face

171
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:42,439
focus on specifically BPSK we saw that
earlier in the spec doc just answer

172
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:46,320
binary phase-shift keying essentially
it's alternating a wave in and out of

173
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:50,190
phase hundred and eighty degrees in a
return code and binary data as

174
00:13:50,190 --> 00:13:56,160
hundred-degree fascia simply cheese by
putting away the upside down or just so

175
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:03,630
here each cycle the way of course almost
21 simple but in this case ok so we have

176
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:07,390
a necessary knowledge on how Cingular
modulated so let's go one step deeper

177
00:14:07,390 --> 00:14:12,699
and talk about how we turn these in it
spread spectrum signals physically

178
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:16,430
spread spectrum away to take a
narrowband signal 12 doesn't take up too

179
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:21,050
much bandwidth and spread out over a
much much much wider frequency range and

180
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:24,290
this gives it the ability to be no
really jim resistant and introduces a

181
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:28,240
property call processing game especially
the more you spend a signal the morning

182
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,270
gained you get the receiving you
essentially you can transmit further

183
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:36,780
processing and actually allows for a
spreads expected to be received even if

184
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:41,800
it's below the noise floor so spending a
single also allows what's called CDMA

185
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:45,099
properties of the stands for
code-division multiple access you may

186
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:50,080
have heard about this you know what that
means is that multiple devices can

187
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,600
transmit on a same frequency at the same
time

188
00:14:52,600 --> 00:15:00,180
think through this is achieved through
each device having a unique spreading

189
00:15:00,180 --> 00:15:03,540
code remember earlier we saw the
reference to appear in code

190
00:15:03,540 --> 00:15:10,689
that's kind of the same thing so there's
two main types of spread-spectrum DSS

191
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:17,459
and HSS DSS stands for direct sequence
spread spectrum and HSS stands for

192
00:15:17,459 --> 00:15:21,939
frequency hopping spread spectrum and
the differences that DSS operates around

193
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:27,279
one single frequency whereas FHS SP
multiple

194
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:38,240
so I left you can see the DSS formal at
11 peak on the right that HSS 44646 the

195
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:44,750
stock only about DSS and remember we saw
that reference an abstraction earlier to

196
00:15:44,750 --> 00:15:49,329
create a DSL signal in this case a
relatively slow BPSK say no remember

197
00:15:49,329 --> 00:15:53,849
hundred-point for data bits per second
from the spec sheet remix with them in

198
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,880
very very very fast

199
00:15:55,880 --> 00:16:00,209
pseudo-random signal can see and the
resulting signal contains all the

200
00:16:00,209 --> 00:16:03,349
original information the spread over a
much much much larger and larger

201
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:09,620
bandwidth and so it's great to see the
new data BPSK signal left and on the

202
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:15,300
right we spread it out to 1.25 megahertz
thats 12,500 times wider announced the

203
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:19,240
shape of the waveforms are are very
similar in fact and I'll be important

204
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:26,360
later so here's an example is really
just 20 and shown there in the blue

205
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:32,040
modulated very slowly our sitter random
sequence is a sequence that changes much

206
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:38,579
much faster than the green tea mix those
two together we get a resulting signal

207
00:16:38,579 --> 00:16:41,939
at the house with high-frequency
components resulting there on the right

208
00:16:41,940 --> 00:16:48,069
now if you want to recover the data from
the resulting signal we simply makes the

209
00:16:48,069 --> 00:16:51,750
output signal with the receipt of random
signal one more time and original data

210
00:16:51,750 --> 00:16:57,079
falls out mix that result in blue with
the surrounding green and the data

211
00:16:57,079 --> 00:17:03,109
signal comes back out there and how you
spread Indy spread spectrum signal

212
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:08,240
know more about these these p.m.
sequences what they are their periodic

213
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:12,410
binary codes out strong correlation
properties that they are a binary

214
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:17,020
sequence repeats over and over and over
and over again and just as an

215
00:17:17,020 --> 00:17:19,319
interesting piece of information for
those who might want to dive into the

216
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:25,500
nitty gritty on their generated commonly
using linear feedback shift registers so

217
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:30,429
this research looking at a specific type
of p.m. sequence called him secrets and

218
00:17:30,429 --> 00:17:33,890
again we saw that in the original spec
doc what's interesting about them is a

219
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:39,830
sequence is strongly with themselves out
of a ship 20 very poorly with themselves

220
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,720
any other Asia so take a look

221
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:48,730
comparing a very short time sequence to
itself in sequence being 0001 and has a

222
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:52,950
perfect correlation of for Sean there
left but if we shipped down on the

223
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:57,110
bottom we shift the blame sequence one
of the left we have to the correlation

224
00:17:57,110 --> 00:18:00,918
goes to zero and I we ship to get its
2010

225
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:04,919
shipped it one more time around we back
the original they should have a scary

226
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:09,460
strong correlation for this is nice
because it makes searching for P&C

227
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:16,980
really really easy so this liquid
coatings area this is all simple but

228
00:18:16,980 --> 00:18:21,100
it's actually more difficult practice so
in theory simply mixed-signal be

229
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:25,100
received with the appropriate given
sequence ended in a single match the

230
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:29,309
perfect world are transmitter receiver
are going to have different frequencies

231
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:32,760
so never beyond the exact same frequency

232
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:35,580
need to accommodate this frequency
differential at some point

233
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:39,399
remember the p.m. if the plan is not
properly aligned with the data the

234
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:44,600
smaller carbon cycle out so we need a
way to Faisal ibn sequences

235
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:50,480
do that we used auto correlation
properties in sequence will talk about

236
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:53,890
that as well

237
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:58,470
down but we need to put into practice so
fun to build some hardware so we can do

238
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:05,160
this so to do this I use the software
radio along with Python and unirradiated

239
00:19:05,160 --> 00:19:11,270
I could use the USR key b200 about 600
bucks fantastic Board of tremendous

240
00:19:11,270 --> 00:19:17,150
research I strongly suggested an
appropriate action just getting on a

241
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:21,490
copy made a global starting lineup
includes will do what you gotta home

242
00:19:21,490 --> 00:19:26,390
note that these global starting tunnels
are left to answer to a plus you can

243
00:19:26,390 --> 00:19:30,030
just use be any specific intent I want
her to stop the right polarization

244
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:34,100
that's a little bit out of scope of the
stock and for those of you familiar with

245
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:38,699
RTL SDR the really cheap TV dollars
offered by radio fortunately it won't

246
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:43,430
work doesn't cover it up with the covers
me about to megahertz we need just a

247
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:46,380
little bit more than that I'm so
unfortunately you probably need a more

248
00:19:46,380 --> 00:19:52,250
robust dusty are we also needed a
low-noise amplifier preceding weeks ago

249
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:56,520
said I really wanted to try to have
received some actual data and scoring

250
00:19:56,520 --> 00:20:01,270
table eating cabling and voltage
regulators to supply the specific alunet

251
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:05,070
from a company called many circuits I
really like you to mention it

252
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:08,169
engineering and evil regulators will
basically it's a Dec step-up or

253
00:20:08,170 --> 00:20:13,910
step-down regulator for pretty much any
voltage starlets just stuff

254
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:17,480
anyway at this point that's all up in an
icebox these things are pretty fragile

255
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:21,660
and we all know that Packers are calling
the earliest I really want to break it

256
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:26,120
off so I'm out of the intent on the
outside the box so we can aim at kinda

257
00:20:26,120 --> 00:20:31,159
worried too but we'll still be together
with me you guys are welcome to come up

258
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:33,280
to the top and take a look play with it

259
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:39,120
get whatever you just know that this is
what we're gonna use to do research but

260
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,879
how does this hard work it's kind of a
mystery black box listen to radio waves

261
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:47,130
which are you know a lot more out there
in the real world and converts the

262
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:51,770
digital data so a computer can process
them and it does this by taking samples

263
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:55,889
of the way of it at discrete points in
time this guy named Nyquist back in the

264
00:20:55,890 --> 00:21:00,070
day came up with the realization that
while sampling Lena sampled at least

265
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:04,090
twice just twice as fast as the signals
fast frequency in order to reproduce a

266
00:21:04,090 --> 00:21:09,139
single accurately a real-world example
that might help you get your head around

267
00:21:09,140 --> 00:21:14,220
this is that the same here can't hear
frequencies higher than $20 now if you

268
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:19,260
remember cd-audio a sample that 44.1
killer it's just over twice the human

269
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:23,890
here and so that's us

270
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:28,080
so you should also know that this offer
to buy radios the use what's called IQ

271
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:32,199
sampling and population to receive and
send signals to stop is a little too

272
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:39,400
much to get into now you know but know
that for each sample taken to values

273
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:43,360
recorded and I value the interface value
in that you value the quadrature about

274
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:47,340
it and using I came out and modulation
of strong benefits were doing signal

275
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:51,830
processing and software but so if you're
interested I suggest you check out this

276
00:21:51,830 --> 00:21:55,699
YouTube video for good explanation it's
really fantastic bottom line you don't

277
00:21:55,700 --> 00:21:58,730
need to understand it for us to stop
unless you're going to try this at home

278
00:21:58,730 --> 00:22:05,230
but he has more about this later so the
first step to decoding the Selecao

279
00:22:05,230 --> 00:22:07,250
mission is we need to figure out this

280
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:14,320
secrets that's really the key to our
hard work remember that we're looking

281
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:20,470
for a signal the PNC Arts 255 bits and
repeats over and over and over and over

282
00:22:20,470 --> 00:22:25,880
again and repeat the rate of 1.25
million chips per second I should

283
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:29,100
mention here that a chip is the same
thing as a bit but we named it

284
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,760
differently so we can distinguish it
from the actual data bits of the

285
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:41,430
original data message was interesting
enough we can treat DSS BPSK spread the

286
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:47,340
PSAC not the same we treat regular BPSK
so check this crap on the left we can

287
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:52,270
see that the BPSK sitting on the top
ships to wave at its transition but once

288
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:57,610
every several way of cycles the DSS BPSK
single shift the way of whom much much

289
00:22:57,610 --> 00:23:01,500
much faster in reality it's even
possible unless the same way as the PPS

290
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:07,790
Casey essentially means the same thing
so this means we can use an ordinary

291
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:13,340
BPSK modulator to receive spread the
downside of receiving data this way is

292
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:17,240
that we don't receive any of the
processing and we talked about earlier

293
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:23,410
so this technique really works well over
short distances legitimate see maybe

294
00:23:23,410 --> 00:23:30,630
over like a hundred feet or so in the
lab was so accurately perceive the

295
00:23:30,630 --> 00:23:34,530
studio we need a SAP hardware to sample
correctly then we have to meet a few

296
00:23:34,530 --> 00:23:40,790
different criteria 33 specific criteria
adopted by radio voice sample multitude

297
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:45,500
of 32 megahertz wealthy dissemble twice
as fast as the highest frequency

298
00:23:45,500 --> 00:23:51,110
component of the p.m. sequence which is
1.25 megahertz this is due to the

299
00:23:51,110 --> 00:23:55,659
Nyquist sampling we talked about the
sample to rate it provides an even

300
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:59,180
number of samples per symbol in this
case an even number of samples per trip

301
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:04,770
to achieve almost a sampling at a rate
of four makers and then recently the

302
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:08,389
signal essentially just interpreting
extra data points into it to get a

303
00:24:08,390 --> 00:24:12,990
resulting up sampled signal what's
special about this pipe maker so you

304
00:24:12,990 --> 00:24:20,350
know is that it has a sampling rate that
corresponds to four samples personal

305
00:24:20,350 --> 00:24:24,459
but now how do we use this to get the
actual p.m. sequence but we know can do

306
00:24:24,460 --> 00:24:28,669
some calculations of the p.m. sequence
repeats forty nine times for each had a

307
00:24:28,669 --> 00:24:32,860
hit since the pin sequence doesn't cross
any boundaries for the repeats forty

308
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:38,000
nine times within a bit iffy X or the
p.m. with a fix that the national debt

309
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:44,890
the resultant should be the pho itself
so lets you gonna radio telco to decode

310
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:49,169
the data signal is just regular BPSK and
the appropriate settings and I'll put

311
00:24:49,169 --> 00:24:53,760
the data to desk so here you can see
chapter in your radio program that I

312
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:58,720
used to do you see the PSK demodulator
there on the right thing block includes

313
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:03,240
the setting of four samples are some
resemble that we talked about the

314
00:25:03,240 --> 00:25:08,760
modulator of them up with the dakotas
symbols to examine later attacks so

315
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:12,580
looking at the data in a text editor we
could clearly see that there is seating

316
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:20,149
secret the data to identify that song
should update the PHP code and turns out

317
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:24,020
that's actually the keys became
discouraged used by all simplex data

318
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:30,940
service network devices to encode their
day so the code and I'll be online later

319
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:37,400
want to use it let's be spread some
other day I know you may recall that we

320
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:41,309
need to mix 2 p.m. code with incoming
data signal retrieve the information and

321
00:25:41,309 --> 00:25:45,809
if all goes well we should expect to
contain very strong narrowband signal

322
00:25:45,809 --> 00:25:49,710
show as a sharp spike that's going to be
our original data signal kinda hopin'

323
00:25:49,710 --> 00:25:56,500
how so above as well as normal simplex
data network looks like the SSS below

324
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:00,929
depicts creation of similar to what we
see that one sharp spike emerging in the

325
00:26:00,929 --> 00:26:03,559
rest can be suppressed

326
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:09,029
so again it's important to know that
working to signals is actually super

327
00:26:09,029 --> 00:26:13,169
computationally intensive on receiving a
signal for megahertz of stopping by

328
00:26:13,169 --> 00:26:18,980
radio works out to an incoming data rate
of 30.5 megabytes per second so for the

329
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:22,720
purposes of this work we're doing all
the data recording now everything we're

330
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:26,690
gonna post process the data cord and
eventually possible use more about

331
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:32,700
custom hardware think PGA is you know to
do this work in real time but I really

332
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:38,110
sound like a damn about right now so a
big thanks to my interns I think couple

333
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:42,399
were sittin here for optimizing health
and I couldn't previously took about a

334
00:26:42,399 --> 00:26:47,039
minute to process data packet David and
about 40 seconds right now the dow more

335
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:53,539
so so how do we do you spend the data
force me to log on to the next p.m.

336
00:26:53,539 --> 00:26:57,629
sequence with signal we did expect
correlating the received it as a law

337
00:26:57,629 --> 00:27:01,820
against the recovered p.m. at each point
I essentially we're sliding that were

338
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:05,779
covered in sequins against the received
signal and correlating every step of the

339
00:27:05,779 --> 00:27:06,070
way

340
00:27:06,070 --> 00:27:10,360
reply back relations over time when the
PAS perfectly aligned we should see

341
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:14,729
other sharp spike correlation and that's
what those spikes are you see our this

342
00:27:14,730 --> 00:27:20,749
is how do we know when the mix the two
together to describe the data so if we

343
00:27:20,749 --> 00:27:25,889
allow the p.m. on the first correlation
cycle and do some frequency mismatch

344
00:27:25,889 --> 00:27:31,248
autocorrelation overtime shown their
underground left we fix this by Justyna

345
00:27:31,249 --> 00:27:36,159
p.m. for the backward at each and every
correlation peak to insurance while so

346
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,429
this point we mix 2 p.m. at it again
together

347
00:27:40,429 --> 00:27:43,960
we shouldn't spend a single that way so
let's try to see what you look at the

348
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:47,690
correlation is shown here on the left we
actually get a really consistent

349
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:53,330
correlation oscillates you know a little
bit over time but overall you know

350
00:27:53,330 --> 00:27:57,639
croatians relatively consistent zoom out
and look at the correlations overtime of

351
00:27:57,639 --> 00:28:02,110
the whole packet you can see positive
and negative correlations and these

352
00:28:02,110 --> 00:28:10,320
respond to correspond to actual data so
that this is the code to display the

353
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:14,820
data if we look at that time and
representation but still coming out the

354
00:28:14,820 --> 00:28:18,539
software to spreader sure enough to see
that sharp spike in the centre

355
00:28:18,539 --> 00:28:22,119
indicative of our original didn't
question this means we successfully

356
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:27,209
destroyed our data museum way way way
way way in an upbeat about 12,500 times

357
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:32,419
and we can see the waveform actually
looks like a BPSK single operating

358
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:37,190
between shows the numbers down below but
about a hundred hertz is the data rate

359
00:28:37,190 --> 00:28:40,480
in question of this network so things
are looking really promising at this

360
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:47,460
point so now that we're seeing data
packets we actually need to go down so

361
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:50,659
if you look at the time to meet
representation of that say no you can

362
00:28:50,659 --> 00:28:55,159
actually see the data bits coming out
over there on the top and so you know to

363
00:28:55,159 --> 00:29:00,740
process this week a little bit namely we
low-pass filter it just a regular BPSK

364
00:29:00,740 --> 00:29:03,820
modulator

365
00:29:03,820 --> 00:29:08,980
so that point did you start small and
you can see we got to the top of page

366
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:14,530
there that we need to validate this is
real sexy the references the data packet

367
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:18,610
format and it starts with a preamble as
many of these things do and a premium

368
00:29:18,610 --> 00:29:22,229
for those who don't know is essentially
constant unique binary sequence that

369
00:29:22,230 --> 00:29:29,300
tells the receiver when a packet of
starting has a manufacturer idea in the

370
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,370
preamble and then you know a bunch more
data parameters we don't need to worry

371
00:29:32,370 --> 00:29:36,219
about right now but if we end up
converting that manufacture I did a test

372
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:39,890
does not sure enough that lines up at
the actual ESN of a device that can read

373
00:29:39,890 --> 00:29:44,130
the packet like right on the back of a
little little card with it when you

374
00:29:44,130 --> 00:29:47,260
first saw this means we're doing
something right actually the coating the

375
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:53,230
state over there now the data contained
just about any information on this is up

376
00:29:53,230 --> 00:29:58,490
the air for these these devices are
really predominately used for tracking a

377
00:29:58,490 --> 00:30:02,150
stunning location data back and everyone
uses the same Globalstar kinda suggested

378
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:07,280
this format used up on that allows it to
be digested on their back and so after

379
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:14,389
extensive comparisons interns while he's
here throughout the 832 on a lot of tune

380
00:30:14,390 --> 00:30:21,160
3256 so you can put those bits to binary
to decimal value and then you multiply

381
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:25,800
that by eight degrees work out another
centrally extracts actual latitude

382
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:32,020
longitude as well it's also listed on
there but you'll be able to try this out

383
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:34,610
for ourselves

384
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:41,669
so did a package also contains a checks
on a short walk us but how to calculate

385
00:30:41,670 --> 00:30:49,490
the check so that's over there is the
actual checksum value this means that we

386
00:30:49,490 --> 00:30:53,640
can not only validate packets but if we
know the checksum format we can create

387
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:59,540
around so there's no encryption on his
pockets no signing any protection that's

388
00:30:59,540 --> 00:31:04,820
really just data so you know if we could
transmit to me that would seem like

389
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:08,918
reading Jacaranda

390
00:31:08,919 --> 00:31:13,790
recall that would probably just
receiving data but do the better nature

391
00:31:13,790 --> 00:31:19,530
of Globalstar satellite system but it on
the downlink is exact exact same as the

392
00:31:19,530 --> 00:31:25,020
date on the way up so reception should
be very very very similar except in this

393
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:29,940
case we need to compensate for Doppler
shift its allies moving wicked fast as

394
00:31:29,940 --> 00:31:34,429
well as a reference to this an avenue
for future research but it shouldn't be

395
00:31:34,429 --> 00:31:38,330
that much harder to just start building
our own base station and really with our

396
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:44,699
own ground station we should be able to
see about 2,000 mile radius around us

397
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:51,380
we can create her own family actually
inject back an hour so little disclaimer

398
00:31:51,380 --> 00:31:54,770
here I know you guys are a bunch of
hooligans and I want to blame for less

399
00:31:54,770 --> 00:31:58,240
but seriously don't transmit Globalstar
specialties

400
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:01,640
it's probably over you live if anyone
actually knows the legality of

401
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:06,690
transmitted from the waters I wouldn't
mind knowing you could interfere with

402
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:10,550
regal communications you know these
things are used for emergency response

403
00:32:10,550 --> 00:32:15,090
fortunately the Simplex frequencies are
used for actual satellite control so

404
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:24,020
it's not like you're gonna make it fly
sideways but if you wanted to transmit

405
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:29,430
theoretically this is actually the the
easiest part you simply makes the data

406
00:32:29,430 --> 00:32:32,740
p.m. and share together at the
appropriate rates and send it out over

407
00:32:32,740 --> 00:32:37,290
there now I'm not going to release my
transmission or something that happened

408
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:41,490
but if you really tried to call you
should use the information here to do so

409
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:46,060
chat about it but really all you need is
point to watts of power and you can

410
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:50,940
easily get an appropriate amplifier on
the internet I ended up writing some new

411
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:58,540
radio code data and do all this but what
if there was an easier way so grossed

412
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:04,070
out by the OS X update utility for their
spot race devices inside this

413
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:09,060
application package is a tool spot three
former cool . jar contains all sorts of

414
00:33:09,060 --> 00:33:13,490
interesting functionality that's never
called by the consumer out so we look at

415
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:19,830
it and there's this UI UI folder and
debug console doctor and calls this

416
00:33:19,830 --> 00:33:24,669
function called right PSA electronic
serial number in stock to buy stock

417
00:33:24,670 --> 00:33:33,090
class so what appear on a job app to
call that cultural history to console a

418
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:41,020
little doubt if everyone to play with
this so let's us update any essentially

419
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:44,160
we can change the serial number any spot
of ice out there

420
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:50,440
clone and arbitrate about us and maybe a
possible targets device sir have you to

421
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:51,490
prove this

422
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:57,330
checkers with the others ESN until it to
transmit out to the world I gotta check

423
00:33:57,330 --> 00:34:03,260
email back that I think my dad made him
think he was somewhere else and it

424
00:34:03,260 --> 00:34:11,449
started with us but so are currently on
sale for 49 bucks go out to the child

425
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:17,259
low barrier to entry so obvious of
utilizing this utilize the network to

426
00:34:17,260 --> 00:34:20,830
transmit your own custom data expanding
capabilities your service such as may be

427
00:34:20,830 --> 00:34:26,340
transmitting data packets faster than
your 848 attacker do with this

428
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,800
transmission capability

429
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:34,950
well first used in emergency response
around the club 2013 scoop emergency is

430
00:34:34,949 --> 00:34:39,819
jammed up the central Emergency Response
preventing it from getting to an actual

431
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:45,460
emergency or what if you monitored for
help requests and then just kept talking

432
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:48,970
over really well known reporter
yesterday and she has to work out a

433
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:52,989
corresponding the Middle East and her
life was currently in danger or endanger

434
00:34:52,989 --> 00:34:55,279
just journalists out there

435
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:59,630
use the spot biases of a consumer-grade
low profile on the tractor we're about

436
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,620
the case to get kidnapped so they rely
on these devices to protect allows

437
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:06,279
nothing about this one for now we're
sorry was sleeping and distracting to

438
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,620
these people had no idea that it was not
accepted and I have a feeling that

439
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:10,609
stopped using

440
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:16,120
now it turns out these chips are also
used in access control systems reporting

441
00:35:16,120 --> 00:35:22,299
you know door opening closing such a law
enforcement and animal tracking so I

442
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:26,150
personally think it'd be hilarious to
say that while grizzly relocated sell to

443
00:35:26,150 --> 00:35:30,460
suburban California neighborhood and
just see what people do especially when

444
00:35:30,460 --> 00:35:39,180
they can't find so many ideas here not
to mention that they're heavily is in

445
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:44,149
SCADA systems across the board and
refrain from any specifics goes against

446
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:51,410
the DEFCON crowd but they're commonly
used for water quality monitoring and

447
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:57,440
pipeline pressure monitoring and really
actually big oil and gas operations so

448
00:35:57,440 --> 00:36:00,270
what are your arrival oil company and
you want to figure out where competition

449
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:06,100
is drawing fire station and yourself

450
00:36:06,100 --> 00:36:10,750
Lockheed Martin flight services the FAA
contacted the handles flight planning

451
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:14,520
for the update I just allowed these
devices to be used to track to any of

452
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:18,900
the apartheid out there so what if the
taxpayer an airplane appear to deviate

453
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:22,630
from its intended flight plan and a
tightly controlled airspace

454
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:28,800
airport maybe so does your some of this
adults more of a full-featured

455
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:32,240
capability to see what I can do on the
cheap

456
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,669
networks is that I sit with the bias

457
00:36:35,670 --> 00:36:39,190
got the transmitter listen you know on
the top of a building and I got this is

458
00:36:39,190 --> 00:36:46,220
running in my report but over time it
will pick up Telus transmissions from

459
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:49,890
the trackers and not their pattern life
and this makes it really easy to

460
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:55,040
identify what a target is I where it
goes in this case I'm scenario I'm going

461
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:59,270
for sorrow and armored car out I did
some research while back on

462
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:03,240
location-based privacy with mobile apps
and I attract a bunch of users through

463
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:07,240
their mobile app locations through a
broken AP I was actually able to

464
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,229
correlate real patterns like you know
where is the home location where the

465
00:37:10,230 --> 00:37:13,960
work location of the Opera they work on
that so the stuff really does work is

466
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,700
very important to know you know where
something's going and where it intends

467
00:37:16,700 --> 00:37:25,339
to be opening scene from various where
they where the hijacked the trucks so

468
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:33,030
now that no with armored car is a no-win
jacket to hijack a car just didn't begin

469
00:37:33,030 --> 00:37:37,000
speaking there because I D from my
transmitter and also spoof the GPS

470
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:41,020
coordinates to make it appear that
armored cars on a 30 but reality I'm

471
00:37:41,020 --> 00:37:47,320
dropping off somewhere else with all for
Knox's gold and get away with it she

472
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,600
might ask does this work

473
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:53,089
short answer is yes but we need high
damage point so could only real solution

474
00:37:53,090 --> 00:37:57,780
was to go out and get my license data
from there

475
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:00,339
sunset a little excessive

476
00:38:00,339 --> 00:38:08,650
so this works up close to Temple I've
demagogues today

477
00:38:08,650 --> 00:38:13,140
subject up the process really just my
computer into a step-by-step video

478
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:18,150
showing spreading process like these
data package intercepting their piece by

479
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:23,900
piece so here and switch over to a video
really quick and play the video demo

480
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:34,340
god's thats

481
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:45,080
radio here and wait for someone to
transmit some data and you can see a

482
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:51,060
data package being transmitted we
automatically recorded to file

483
00:38:51,060 --> 00:38:56,500
oil spill over here to the D spreading
code essentially will drop out file into

484
00:38:56,500 --> 00:39:02,740
the spreader and you go and you see a
lock on to the sequence immediately and

485
00:39:02,740 --> 00:39:06,589
start correlating takes about a minute
so I'm not gonna fade it through to

486
00:39:06,590 --> 00:39:14,570
watch consistent correlation from the
data package costs that's what you want

487
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:20,410
to see you want to see a bunch of random
data or go ahead and you can see and you

488
00:39:20,410 --> 00:39:23,770
can see that sharp spike emerging and
then we're actually writing up a bit

489
00:39:23,770 --> 00:39:26,630
from that sharp spike to file and i own
a similar on the time-domain

490
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:32,360
representation there let's go and you're
going to see a bit quiet over the air so

491
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:37,590
those are satellite transmission data
bits from there always get a bit sore

492
00:39:37,590 --> 00:39:41,280
right now for a while for us to
interpret so we got an interview

493
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:48,530
Thursday tibet's career but the binary
sequence for what they actually are and

494
00:39:48,530 --> 00:39:53,670
go ahead and put those into a packet
validator

495
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:59,640
data at their second drilling further
you want to do and people to get out of

496
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:07,140
that data field but this is essentially
the process of intercepting the state so

497
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:13,460
let's go back

498
00:40:13,460 --> 00:40:19,960
so few parting thoughts and conclusions
here just cause 2 Globalstar about a

499
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:22,760
hundred and eighty days ago and they're
actually really friendly and there are

500
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:26,430
spots it took awhile to get back to me
but they seem pretty concerned they just

501
00:40:26,430 --> 00:40:30,529
don't deal with this kind of stuff to
providing them a lot more technical

502
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:36,650
details and I never heard back so wired
broke the news recently initially and

503
00:40:36,650 --> 00:40:40,710
global star had this response but they
issued a statement saying to the take

504
00:40:40,710 --> 00:40:46,150
privacy very seriously and have moderate
and places his attacks fortunately just

505
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:51,359
attack as possible and so you can't
attack in the Jasmine question if it's

506
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:56,640
targeted a really low probability be
detected if everything is really within

507
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,770
the parameters of the system so I
sincerely hope they're serious about

508
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:03,330
addressing these issues and I really
look forward to seeing your solution how

509
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:07,319
they dress just a lot of work to be done

510
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:11,000
honest code releasing I get up you know
later today or tomorrow so I can get it

511
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:17,880
up on me on Twitter posts on there
what's up I love to collaborate on this

512
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:20,780
approval system and maybe began
intercepting his downlink signal that

513
00:41:20,780 --> 00:41:25,410
feeling really seeing the tip of the
iceberg on where the systems used to

514
00:41:25,410 --> 00:41:30,960
saying to us and start taking a look for
ourselves are interested please help out

515
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:37,200
but in conclusion I really still think
global star makes it great product sells

516
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,879
but manufacturers you know remember that
airspace products have a long life cycle

517
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:44,660
and we're stuck with them for years to
come with a double star system is

518
00:41:44,660 --> 00:41:48,200
implemented it's really unmatchable
mostly devices don't support for

519
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:51,140
upgrades or so far out in a while
they're never gonna get them to patch

520
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:55,940
them to do going forward is out to add
you know a layer of encryption on top of

521
00:41:55,940 --> 00:42:01,080
the existing protocol security is not
charity spreading your data more

522
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:07,348
protected so consumers assume someone
can smooth and act accordingly

523
00:42:07,349 --> 00:42:10,930
manufacturers to a higher standard

524
00:42:10,930 --> 00:42:15,330
demand security and really demanding
know how your day is being said and is

525
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:21,319
encrypted and if it is also a special
thanks really quick to two main transit

526
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:26,770
route they helped a lot of testing and
kind of some of the groundwork deficit

527
00:42:26,770 --> 00:42:33,490
after finding the crazy research the
company live later and you know I'll be

528
00:42:33,490 --> 00:42:43,149
sure to be with us up so anybody have
any questions or comments thoughts

529
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:47,860
so the question was how showed it to the
company already and the answer is no I

530
00:42:47,860 --> 00:42:50,460
disclosed of them you know the
researchers I'll ask what happened

531
00:42:50,460 --> 00:42:53,640
actually dead most of them were out of
this to face conversation about them and

532
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:56,920
if there's a global star up here I love
to chat maybe see how would you get this

533
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:03,869
text

534
00:43:03,869 --> 00:43:16,970
someone over there had to shout it out
in the back so I can hear it

535
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:21,509
I'm actually not sure I was looking
around trying to figure that out I think

536
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:25,080
they might be which would be really
interesting so the devices was the

537
00:43:25,080 --> 00:43:28,430
question was the devices used for like
house arrest

538
00:43:28,430 --> 00:43:34,029
like the tracking outlets and I'm
actually not sure be interesting to find

539
00:43:34,030 --> 00:43:36,630
out

540
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:47,360
that's right here in the front

541
00:43:47,360 --> 00:43:51,860
I mean I guess the answer is I'm not
really sure the devices would need to be

542
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:55,660
individually cheat from the factory I
think you know cuz there is no know

543
00:43:55,660 --> 00:44:01,230
whether due to a data transfer so
potentially

544
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:12,090
think it's better than the initial setup
so you know maybe somebody else

545
00:44:12,090 --> 00:44:19,230
medium day so I had to have a look at
the Iridium network can actually have a

546
00:44:19,230 --> 00:44:26,020
so my guess is no obvious systems are
vulnerable part of this is a kind of

547
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:29,600
wanted to show you guys how to do this
so maybe you guys can take a look at

548
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:45,808
yourselves but I love doing if I do I'll
certainly let you know

549
00:44:45,809 --> 00:44:56,369
and deployed early 2000 security
probably just wasn't at the top of

550
00:44:56,369 --> 00:45:00,979
everyone's mind not to mention I think
she just abuse in this unique unique in

551
00:45:00,979 --> 00:45:04,368
that it was probably a little bit harder
back then there's really no excuse now

552
00:45:04,369 --> 00:45:09,150
with was probably a little more
expensive than any additional overhead

553
00:45:09,150 --> 00:45:14,130
probably not worth it but now going
forward I think we can do this and it

554
00:45:14,130 --> 00:45:27,470
shouldn't be too hard

555
00:45:27,470 --> 00:45:40,470
actually it was no satellite offices are
crucial as I get any specific data there

556
00:45:40,470 --> 00:45:46,200
is no data in the end the packets
actually all the different satellites

557
00:45:46,200 --> 00:45:56,240
just repeat whatever it is they see as
well thanks a lot for coming out
