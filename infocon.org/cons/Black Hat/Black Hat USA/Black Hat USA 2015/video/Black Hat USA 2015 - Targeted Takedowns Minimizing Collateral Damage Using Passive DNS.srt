1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,630
hello everybody and welcome again to
black hat 2015

2
00:00:04,630 --> 00:00:07,859
quick announcements and I'm sure you've
heard but you're gonna hear again there

3
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:13,259
is a reception tonight in the business
home at 5:30 p.m. that room again is the

4
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:17,890
shoreline a broom and then sometime
after that at six o'clock in the

5
00:00:17,890 --> 00:00:23,369
Mandalay BCD room or the pony awards
which of course are always a lot of fun

6
00:00:23,369 --> 00:00:28,630
right now you're in jasmine and you're
here to see the targeted takedowns

7
00:00:28,630 --> 00:00:34,519
minimizing collateral damage using
passive DNS from Dr callback see our

8
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:39,170
site security so that's all you need to
know right now other than that this is

9
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:42,270
probably very interesting talk and I
hope you all enjoy it and to make sure

10
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:45,649
that we all enjoy please also make sure
your phones are on silent mode

11
00:00:45,649 --> 00:00:51,260
thank you

12
00:00:51,260 --> 00:01:00,589
is working good afternoon we are as is
the tradition for scheduling of my talks

13
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:06,890
in a time slot where even I would rather
be in the other talked on this one so

14
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:14,830
thank you for coming I have talked quite
a bit about takedowns talked quite a bit

15
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:20,470
about passive DNS we finally realized
that there was some applicability in the

16
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:26,750
overlap zone between taking on criminal
infrastructure and the use of passive

17
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:34,189
DNS so we have a fairly lengthy time
slot which means I'm hoping to be

18
00:01:34,189 --> 00:01:37,990
interrupted with questions were able to
save some time at the end

19
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:43,829
don't be shy in any case I want to
briefly go back through what has have

20
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:45,380
DNS is

21
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:51,289
and how it is traditionally used then
gonna get into some non-traditional uses

22
00:01:51,289 --> 00:01:58,479
involving takedowns and hopefully
motivate you to follow up on all of this

23
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:06,408
this is me most important thing from
your point of view is that I started the

24
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:11,769
first antispam company in probably the
most sued person you will ever meet as a

25
00:02:11,769 --> 00:02:22,780
result of that will be right along so in
spite of everything that we hear about

26
00:02:22,780 --> 00:02:29,310
police brutality or law enforcement over
regions surveillance in the Patriot Act

27
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:33,980
and all the rest of this fact is there a
lot of people of good conscience working

28
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:38,530
in law enforcement and in corporate
security who really do wanna make the

29
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:44,829
world a better place and they're doing
the best they can under our system of

30
00:02:44,829 --> 00:02:51,560
laws and our system of Economics what we
have here is a list of all the various

31
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:54,989
ways that people are being hurt by other
people online

32
00:02:54,989 --> 00:03:00,870
certainly the online child abuse
materials is often considered it's been

33
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,500
called one of the Four Horsemen of the
Apocalypse because it and it's an

34
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:09,650
argument tender you talk about so-called
child pornography

35
00:03:09,650 --> 00:03:14,350
there's really no defense against will
know that people should be able to do

36
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:18,510
whatever they want well not in that case
but

37
00:03:18,510 --> 00:03:24,530
get away from that which i think is
almost a quarter case just the center of

38
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:30,079
industry the center of everything we do
in the information age is this network

39
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:32,890
and we have exposed ourselves to it

40
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:39,018
our data applications in particular our
personal data or medical data is all

41
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:45,480
merrill the attack surface the stuff
that we're building and out of his crap

42
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:52,409
technology that we build the information
age on is terrible if you're a

43
00:03:52,409 --> 00:04:00,420
programmer you know that if one of the
sale of builders carpenters built

44
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,349
buildings the way that programmers
building programs in the first

45
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:08,250
woodpecker to come along with destroy
civilization and that's your supply

46
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:13,510
chain as we've discovered by looking at
all the different libraries and even

47
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:17,639
chips that have various bugs in them
it's impossible to build a secure system

48
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:24,000
so we're going to be dealing with bad
guys getting into our stuff forever

49
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,820
that's that's the new reality we're not
going to reach some policy over the bad

50
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:33,070
guys go away and decide to get real
drugs that's not going to happen we're

51
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:37,820
going to keep building cheaper and
cheaper electronics and logic and

52
00:04:37,820 --> 00:04:43,760
exposing more and more of our data and
valuables to it and then we're going to

53
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:48,360
continue having this weird jousting
match with the bad guys every year about

54
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:52,690
who's got the better set of techniques
and in the middle of that we have as I

55
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:56,199
said a bunch of people of good
conscience working at law enforcement or

56
00:04:56,199 --> 00:04:58,210
in corporate security

57
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:02,940
who really just wanna make the world
safer and they're sympathetic to the

58
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:06,900
idea that they wanna make the world
safer without extra surveillance without

59
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:11,049
putting everybody under a spotlight so
that if any of them happens to be a

60
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:18,789
criminal that will be able to catch them
so when I'm done trying to describe here

61
00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:25,460
is that this is our life from here on
out and this presentation today is about

62
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:35,830
how to live in the middle of that scrum
which will never rent estimating loss is

63
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:42,099
fool's game but you have to play at this
particular esta meant having to do with

64
00:05:42,099 --> 00:05:47,719
white collar crime was 800 million I
consider that to be a very low number

65
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:53,470
even for that year but maybe I'm calling
other things crime the sense that they

66
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:58,210
aren't calling Crime that the point is
it's a big number and what we're doing

67
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:06,840
is we're essentially we have a what is
it the the the good guy side of the

68
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:09,960
economy and the bad guys side of the
economy when you have a certain number

69
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,840
of people in the world who really do
want to produce artifacts and systems of

70
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,409
value they want to earn their way they
want their money and they want it to be

71
00:06:18,409 --> 00:06:21,520
that if they do particularly well as
because they were particularly

72
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:27,419
constructive creative and productive
other people just want to take what they

73
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:31,320
can and live as high off the hog as they
can and they don't care if ultimately

74
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:36,620
they are parasites on the side of the
you know the the productive economy that

75
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:42,550
they're they're living and we can
measure loss I think more in the

76
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:47,300
hundreds of billions hundreds of
millions as far as money that is

77
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:53,100
illegally moved from the good guys to
the bad guys every year in order to

78
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,310
pay for their private yachts and all the
rest of that stuff

79
00:06:56,310 --> 00:06:59,560
the problem whether it's hundreds of
millions or hundreds of billions the

80
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:04,320
point is it's a big number it's getting
bigger and you're seeing a lot of law

81
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:10,920
enforcement action you see certainly the
immigrations and Customs people have

82
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:15,140
taken a hand in what are we gonna do
about all this counterfeit goods you saw

83
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:19,039
the sober wars I fought in the Super
words I am one of the reasons we did not

84
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:24,900
get so not in favor of that approach but
I don't think we were that they were

85
00:07:24,900 --> 00:07:28,710
wrong to want something that the
Internet has certainly hurt the old

86
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:32,620
brick and mortar economy I think we
should probably do something something

87
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:37,660
to help with that so but was the wrong
thing though if we don't help them

88
00:07:37,660 --> 00:07:40,650
that's the kind of solution they're
going to come up with so really make

89
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:45,580
yourself available to your local
congressional staffers your local FBI

90
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:52,479
field office make sure that they have
your wisdom as one of their signposts

91
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:56,720
that goes against their house they are
good conscience they're gonna do the

92
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,280
best they can to solve these problems if
you don't help them their solutions are

93
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:10,400
going to be terrible so as you start to
fight crime systemically and you start

94
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,120
to look at the structural defects in the
economy and in the technology you begin

95
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,350
to notice that ok we have this internet
that has this what used to be considered

96
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:26,580
a large pool of IP addresses we ran out
in ninety four and we have an almost

97
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:33,460
infinite supply of domain names now
there are other more obscure things like

98
00:08:33,460 --> 00:08:37,650
a sauna systems for let's just look at
IP addresses and domain names for a

99
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:46,130
moment they are cooperative in other
words everybody has to believe the same

100
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:50,820
thing if your company has a certain
block of IP address space allocated to

101
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,130
advance a by Aaron which is the address
alligator herein

102
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:59,140
in the United States or by rape overseas
whenever or if you have a domain name

103
00:08:59,140 --> 00:09:03,540
has been created for you through maybe
Go Daddy in Verisign of its top comments

104
00:09:03,540 --> 00:09:06,819
0 for three if you count some of these
identifiers that you're using in your

105
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:10,120
business the reason that they work is
that everyone else respects those

106
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:15,800
allegations toward you no one else
claims oh well I want those addresses

107
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,930
are that domain name for myself so I'm
going to use the same one the reason

108
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:23,810
that they don't isn't that it couldn't
work they could make your life a living

109
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:28,119
hell if they tried their life would not
be great but your life would be really

110
00:09:28,120 --> 00:09:30,710
really bad if a lot of people

111
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:34,110
conflicted with you and all tried to use
the same domain names in the same IP

112
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:37,780
addresses you are so in other words were
power in this whole economy on

113
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:48,400
cooperation and the bad guys benefit
from that because you probably all heard

114
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:52,550
me say that nothing happens on the
internet without DNS DNS is the first

115
00:09:52,550 --> 00:09:59,500
thing that happens for any tcp/ip flow
that means that whether it's good or bad

116
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:06,000
the bad guys need good DNS the good guys
need good DNS they need you to cooperate

117
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:12,270
with their allegations they need us as
their victims to be willing to follow

118
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:17,420
DNS pointers through the name servers
and all the rest and dragged up the a

119
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:22,079
records and connect to their servers
they're counting on undifferentiated

120
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:26,960
service and so one of the things that
law enforcement and corporate security

121
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:31,680
very much like to do is to take those
identifiers away and to say if you plan

122
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,489
to use a cooperative identifier that
only works because I'm co-operating with

123
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:40,000
you and you're going to use that in a
unilateral non-cooperative way in other

124
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,210
words you gonna steal stuff from me then
I'm gonna go to court to take that away

125
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:49,120
from you because you're not using a
great and that works it doesn't work

126
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:52,420
every time and it's hard and it's taken
a long time to build up the case law for

127
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:56,209
it but it does work if you take away
somebody's domain name and web domain

128
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:57,970
name was their method

129
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:05,040
of stealing from you for example the
recent Grooveshark case then you can put

130
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:08,480
a bad guy out of business because their
customers won't be able to find them

131
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,819
after you have repossessed their domain
name and the same thing can happen with

132
00:11:13,819 --> 00:11:20,389
IP addresses or even physical services
servers if you're interested in putting

133
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:23,250
somebody out of business because they're
stealing from you

134
00:11:23,250 --> 00:11:28,060
the courts will help you the problem is
the courts will also believe you if you

135
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:32,099
say that this service this server

136
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:36,870
maybe this science P this IP address
block this domain name is only used by

137
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:37,709
bad guys

138
00:11:37,709 --> 00:11:41,750
the court has no way to know if you knew
what you were talking about when you

139
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:46,410
said that and we've seen some recent
examples again

140
00:11:46,410 --> 00:11:51,089
immigrations and Customs would be my my
prime example for this because they took

141
00:11:51,089 --> 00:11:57,240
away a domain name as part of the Black
Ice take down a couple of years ago that

142
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,100
had millions of people in China that
also depended on that domain name

143
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:06,160
because it was one of these free free
DNS things you could get a sub domain

144
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,500
for nothin and what these guys did as
they took the parent domain of something

145
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:16,620
that had millions of subdomains and they
didn't need that what they needed was

146
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:22,170
about twenty or thirty of the subdomains
but they didn't know that the judge said

147
00:12:22,170 --> 00:12:27,019
ok taken and they took it and then
people in China were no longer able to

148
00:12:27,019 --> 00:12:32,000
send and receive email because their
domain names have been seized created an

149
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,720
interesting international incident and
I'm sure that the treaty lawyers are

150
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:39,899
still studying what to do about all that
but my point the point I'm trying to

151
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:42,550
make today is that wasn't necessary

152
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:46,378
the judge should have been able to call
on one of you as an expert witness and

153
00:12:46,379 --> 00:12:51,079
you should have been able to go out and
look and say you know this is used by an

154
00:12:51,079 --> 00:12:54,758
awful lot of people other than the
criminals and we don't think that every

155
00:12:54,759 --> 00:12:58,910
user of the asset that you that this guy
wants to see is is criminal and you

156
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:03,889
should be able to advise the judge don't
do that make them be more specific and

157
00:13:03,889 --> 00:13:08,680
be like seizing dot com because you
didn't like example.com

158
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:15,500
anyway sorry about this I do not know
how to shut this shirt is going to live

159
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:22,899
with it so on the internet everything is
connected to everything and you should

160
00:13:22,899 --> 00:13:28,630
always suspect the thing you're about to
seize has dependencies has other things

161
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:34,910
depending on it and you shouldn't say
until I can prove that there aren't a

162
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:38,790
lot of other things depending on this
I'm not going to ask to seize it or not

163
00:13:38,790 --> 00:13:45,459
going to advise the judge to sign the
order that allows it to be ceased so you

164
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:50,089
can see collateral damage of this kind
from the shared domain name of RD

165
00:13:50,089 --> 00:13:54,020
mentioned that you would not want to
seize dot com because you hated

166
00:13:54,020 --> 00:14:01,930
example.com IP address blocks very
similar idea you find one of the cause

167
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:07,050
and ISP to block access to a single host
address which you mistakenly say I'd

168
00:14:07,050 --> 00:14:12,149
like you to block access to a maybe a
class senior class being at work that

169
00:14:12,149 --> 00:14:17,680
being 256 adjacent hosts or even 65,000
adjacent host if you don't know what

170
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:23,250
else is there you don't necessarily know
what not to ask for but there are other

171
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:23,930
things

172
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:30,199
deeper than server names turns out or
external dependency if you're taking out

173
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:35,380
some name server that is holding up on
stage three thousand domains belonging

174
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:39,790
to a counterfeiter that might be great
because you're taking out a single name

175
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:43,089
servername and you're having this broad
impact on the criminal empire that

176
00:14:43,089 --> 00:14:49,320
you're up against but it's possible that
there are a lot of other things that are

177
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:53,150
not the criminals that also need that
name servername to keep working or a

178
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:57,319
domain names completely unrelated to
your cause of action are also going to

179
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:05,880
stop working so I'm gonna go through
every one of these details these slides

180
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:12,200
will be on the cd-rom or on the website
but let's just say

181
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:18,180
we've had a bunch of high-profile times
when some company or some law

182
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:21,800
enforcement agency have their name in
the paper the next day because they did

183
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:26,479
not do enough homework before they got
their court order member judges tend to

184
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:32,720
be older folks right in my generation
they don't they're the guys who don't

185
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,790
know how to set the time on their VCRs
and this generation they're the people

186
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:40,180
who probably could not re-install
windows on the laptop if they had to so

187
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:44,510
they are they they tend to believe what
you tell them and it's important that

188
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,630
you tell them something as specific as
possible when you're doing one of those

189
00:15:47,630 --> 00:15:57,850
takedowns so you can't say that any
collateral collateral damage at all is

190
00:15:57,850 --> 00:16:03,700
too much sadly we we have there's an
acceptable limit and there you have to

191
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:09,110
say you know I did the best I could but
in order to get this bad guy to stop

192
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:14,210
doing bad things to me I had to take out
a resource the did have some external

193
00:16:14,210 --> 00:16:20,790
dependencies on it and I made it as
specific as I could but I was not

194
00:16:20,790 --> 00:16:24,010
willing to walk away and do nothing
because there were going to be innocent

195
00:16:24,010 --> 00:16:30,730
victims here so if I seem like i'm i'm
calling for a zero threshold please let

196
00:16:30,730 --> 00:16:38,270
me disabuse you so again this the slides
are available I can read through this

197
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:45,150
whole thing just wanna say that the
things you have to check for in are all

198
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:50,290
over the damn place like URL shortener
sites for example we we've seen court

199
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:56,689
orders requesting that bit ly be
repossessed because criminal was using a

200
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:02,840
bunch of URL shorteners and you know
when I was asked about that I said no

201
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:07,800
you cannot find some other thing that
this criminals depending on that is not

202
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:13,899
be online and it was a long list and
this is in fact a partial list this is

203
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:18,040
what would fit on one slide in a in a
types typeface I thought you could read

204
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,099
from your seats

205
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:24,760
we could go on for a long time on that
so let's look at some of the major ones

206
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:29,440
you wouldn't want a black hole
originating server you know yessir root

207
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,390
name server is necessary for all
criminal action but that's also is also

208
00:17:33,390 --> 00:17:37,049
necessary for just about everything else
you would be an example of something you

209
00:17:37,049 --> 00:17:42,710
want to stay away from also the name
servers responsible for any of the DoD's

210
00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:46,970
right and in Verisign servers for.com
don't block those because you'll hurt

211
00:17:46,970 --> 00:17:52,860
yourself way more than it will hurt
Verisign but interestingly there is now

212
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:57,049
something called a public suffix list
and this is used often in browsers to

213
00:17:57,049 --> 00:18:02,240
figure out what the same origin cookie
policy lot of the which i think is just

214
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:08,200
insane but they're doing it and this is
where you have names like CEO dot UK

215
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:13,169
which is very it's dot com for the
United Kingdom

216
00:18:13,169 --> 00:18:18,380
it's not a TLD about the acts like a TLD
other words any direct trial that CEO

217
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:24,350
dot UK is a delegation point is a point
where there's a registry above that part

218
00:18:24,350 --> 00:18:28,689
of the namespace and there is some
registrant link below that part so

219
00:18:28,690 --> 00:18:34,850
anytime you have a delegation point of
the the parent is something you should

220
00:18:34,850 --> 00:18:40,520
protect and that's why the free DNS
providers that black ass black by

221
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,110
mistake would be an example of something
to leave alone if somebody is giving

222
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:50,209
away third level domains under you know
no ip dot com or something like that you

223
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:55,460
would like it to be the No yp.com is
safe and none of its assets will be

224
00:18:55,460 --> 00:19:00,870
seized because you know I guess they're
necessary for crime but necessary for so

225
00:19:00,870 --> 00:19:04,510
much more just have to be a little more
specific than that but they with these

226
00:19:04,510 --> 00:19:09,658
are some examples of things that you
should have a top of mind when doing

227
00:19:09,659 --> 00:19:14,970
this type of research research and you
know there's a lot of registries

228
00:19:14,970 --> 00:19:20,340
registers certainly I've seen it happen
the people blocked the Google Website

229
00:19:20,340 --> 00:19:22,790
because they thought they were

230
00:19:22,790 --> 00:19:30,120
being spammed it was actually the robots
doing the indexing so that level of care

231
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:34,639
I think I don't need to tell you in this
audience to do but here's an interesting

232
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,520
one crypto infrastructure it turns out
that to make this whole piece of junk

233
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:44,870
old X 509 certificate authorities work
you have to have an online application

234
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:50,590
provider to have the ability when you
are trying to validate the key that some

235
00:19:50,590 --> 00:19:55,340
web server just gave you the signature
rather in the key that you have these

236
00:19:55,340 --> 00:20:00,590
also the ability to ask some third party
has this been revoked because it has

237
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:04,000
been revoked chances are the web server
is not gonna tell you it's been revoked

238
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:08,240
because the era criminal and they want
you to accept the certificate so there's

239
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,080
this little side thing that happens
asynchronously when you're visiting an

240
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:17,080
HTTPS web site or doing any other SSL
type activity that requires you to be

241
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:23,840
able to reach this certificate
revocation services so anything that

242
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,800
prevents those names from validating
Indiana and then that prevents you from

243
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:33,560
reaching the nameserver anything that
prevents you from being able to get a

244
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:38,040
signing trip to authentic indication
from that service that there is no

245
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:42,139
revocation for the thing you're asking
about is going to slow down everything

246
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:43,270
you do

247
00:20:43,270 --> 00:20:47,800
30 to 60 seconds per web click is what
you should expect to be penalized by if

248
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:55,120
you were to firewall these things out so
I mentioned this before but i wanna just

249
00:20:55,120 --> 00:21:00,820
saying bad guys are not as dumb as they
used to be I wish they were about to

250
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:05,679
keep training them and then they keep
getting better and so they know that we

251
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:10,320
want to avoid unpleasant side effects
for ourselves they know that collateral

252
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:16,050
damage that puts our company's name or
perhaps our law enforcement officers

253
00:21:16,050 --> 00:21:19,750
name in the newspapers tomorrow because
we did it take down that had a lot of

254
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:24,610
collateral damage is not something we'd
like to avoid and also they do pretty

255
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:29,649
much what the Germans did in Dresden and
as they put their stuff right next to a

256
00:21:29,650 --> 00:21:32,600
bunch of stuff that we don't want to
hurt

257
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:35,179
and you have to be prepared for that
they're going to do this on purpose

258
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:40,450
you're going to find shared resources
that you will be afraid to touch and

259
00:21:40,450 --> 00:21:44,410
that means you have to be more clever
than they are and find things they're

260
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:47,860
sharing that they didn't even know they
were sharing or you have to be willing

261
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:51,550
to tolerate the occasional time when
your company name is in the newspapers

262
00:21:51,550 --> 00:22:04,070
because that was the best choice open to
you want to finally have a few bad

263
00:22:04,070 --> 00:22:10,560
actors you know are you still gonna hurt
me the answer is that depends if you

264
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:15,940
have a record of doing the best you can
keep the bad guys out no sales people

265
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:20,350
are not signing so-called pink contracts
with people did you know you're only

266
00:22:20,350 --> 00:22:24,280
gonna use your service to annoy other
people are spam them or or whatever

267
00:22:24,280 --> 00:22:29,280
you're you're not looking for bad
business and when you do find them

268
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,520
you raise the the fire under those
customers and try to get rid of them and

269
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:38,889
you're trying to run a clean shop then
you're gonna get the close ones if

270
00:22:38,890 --> 00:22:42,550
you're doing the best you can do your
proactive you have an abuse Desk you're

271
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:47,030
willing to spend some money on keeping
abuse out of your network and you're

272
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:50,260
willing to lose some money when those
customers go away

273
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:56,890
chances are you're not gonna get you
will not face massive takedown but

274
00:22:56,890 --> 00:23:02,650
certainly all of you read the cribs
articles about est domains and

275
00:23:02,650 --> 00:23:08,130
provider in San Francisco that he peered
went out of business and had its assets

276
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:14,530
sold for scrap to the FBI as it turns
out it was all about a company who was

277
00:23:14,530 --> 00:23:18,790
showing absolutely no sympathy for
victims and was shown a lot of sympathy

278
00:23:18,790 --> 00:23:24,210
for criminals so really if you want to
get the close ones you have to behave as

279
00:23:24,210 --> 00:23:29,660
well as you can the rest of the time
it's like real life just real-life

280
00:23:29,660 --> 00:23:36,660
intruding on the internet again you can
also do yourself a huge favor as an ISP

281
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:42,760
if you use our who is or swept or
whatever it takes so that the customer

282
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:47,910
allocations of IP address blocks out of
your larger block you know if you're

283
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:52,230
giving a smaller block to some customers
somewhere there is a way to tell era or

284
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:56,880
right or after Nick you can tell your RA
are that this has been done which means

285
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,110
that when somebody has been victimized
by one of your customers and they do it

286
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:04,229
who is they will end up seeing your
customer's name in that who is result

287
00:24:04,230 --> 00:24:10,210
instead of your ISP's name in that
result so really anything you can do to

288
00:24:10,210 --> 00:24:15,460
offer recourse and accountability to
victims will make will improve your

289
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:20,470
chances are not being taught to be in
cahoots with those criminals when when

290
00:24:20,470 --> 00:24:31,230
when the bullets are flying alright
passive DNS briefly wish I had two

291
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:34,440
diagrams to this page

292
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:39,340
DNS is a way to collect transactions
that are occurring in the domain name

293
00:24:39,340 --> 00:24:45,720
system between servers so there's a
bunch of recursive name servers that are

294
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:50,820
being operated for us here about the
black hat noch and who knows the running

295
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:54,560
on bounder binders and whatever they're
running doesn't matter they're speaking

296
00:24:54,560 --> 00:24:59,490
a protocol that is causing our laptops
and smartphones to be able to surf and

297
00:24:59,490 --> 00:25:03,010
reach things we're sending simple
queries were getting back

298
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:08,120
simple responses behind that server the
recursive the upstream of that recurs

299
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:12,330
observer there's quite a bit more going
on it's not just a simple one answer

300
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:17,590
or Jimmy one question 1 answer as you
may have to play go fish you might see

301
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:21,139
if you're looking for a dub dub dub dub
example.com and your your you know

302
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:25,390
nothing we're gonna have to ask but root
servers where is calm even half chap

303
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:29,700
task becomes servers whereas example.com
and finally you can ask the example.com

304
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:37,070
servers where is dubbed but those back
in transactions are the heart of

305
00:25:37,070 --> 00:25:42,879
Pasadena us and certainly there's
different ways to do this my company

306
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,970
happens to be in the passive DNS
business but we're not the only ones

307
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:50,470
that this is not a product pitch except
to say that there's a way to do this is

308
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:56,149
quite compatible with the internet neo
libertarian philosophy of no

309
00:25:56,149 --> 00:26:00,719
surveillance and that is to say if you
only gather upstream transactions that

310
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:04,510
our server to server sort of back office
transactions you will have no subscriber

311
00:26:04,510 --> 00:26:10,820
IP addresses and you won't see any reuse
of MCC nocache hits you don't know what

312
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:14,990
was popular and you don't know who
looked it up and you need that makes it

313
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:20,130
pretty pretty passable on I'm willing to
live with this level of privacy

314
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:24,610
intrusion because there's no way to use
our system for example to do

315
00:26:24,610 --> 00:26:29,500
surveillance you can't start an
investigation using only server to

316
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:32,039
server traffic you might be able to
enhance one but you could never

317
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:37,220
discovered that a crime had taken place
or get a suspect by looking at the data

318
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:42,350
we collect any case what you do with
these observations is put them into a

319
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:48,740
database and you index them and if you
do this long enough and you have enough

320
00:26:48,740 --> 00:26:52,940
servers you will end up with a database
that pretty accurately reflects the

321
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:58,019
actual content of the entire DNS rather
than just the part of DNS that you

322
00:26:58,019 --> 00:27:02,929
yourself on your smartphone or laptop
happened to have looked looked up so

323
00:27:02,929 --> 00:27:07,409
when my company we've been saving two
hundred thousand events per second for

324
00:27:07,409 --> 00:27:12,789
about five years and we have i think a
very rich content source there and what

325
00:27:12,789 --> 00:27:20,129
you get to do with this after you index
is to discover relationships and it's

326
00:27:20,130 --> 00:27:25,169
usually used offensively where you might
say I've been spammed there was a

327
00:27:25,169 --> 00:27:27,000
fishing link in the spam

328
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:31,320
it had domain name in the middle of that
fishing link the demand has been taken

329
00:27:31,320 --> 00:27:36,379
down because some security company got
it taken down and gave them but now that

330
00:27:36,380 --> 00:27:41,250
means I can't see it but I can ask the
Pasadena system what the result was

331
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:46,429
during the time before it was taken down
and if it was let's say moved around a

332
00:27:46,429 --> 00:27:50,020
few times you'll see the history will
see all the different values that that

333
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:54,820
domain has ever resolve to and you can
find out what name servers have served

334
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:58,200
it and you can find out what other
domain names were served by the same

335
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:02,899
name servers you can then find out what
other name servers have similar IP

336
00:28:02,899 --> 00:28:06,340
addresses to those name servers and what
is the list of domain name server by

337
00:28:06,340 --> 00:28:10,529
those names rivers other words starting
with one tiny piece of information from

338
00:28:10,529 --> 00:28:14,529
your attacker that they had to expose in
order to attack you you might have a

339
00:28:14,529 --> 00:28:18,700
good chance of map in their whole
infrastructure to better target your

340
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:27,590
criminal complaint or civil lawsuits
that's the normal defensive use and you

341
00:28:27,590 --> 00:28:33,399
know that's that's why passive DNS was
created and ranked was to facilitate bad

342
00:28:33,399 --> 00:28:38,820
you sigh I can say that cuz I know the
guy who invented it for invite more but

343
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,779
it turns out that it has another use

344
00:28:40,779 --> 00:28:49,409
related to take down just 1 I'm here
today certainly one of the things you

345
00:28:49,409 --> 00:28:55,460
have to do this is one of my all my
researchers really wants me to make this

346
00:28:55,460 --> 00:29:00,950
point sometimes IP addresses get reused
by different people and if it's been

347
00:29:00,950 --> 00:29:04,110
sitting on the shelf for six months you
don't necessarily want your

348
00:29:04,110 --> 00:29:10,340
investigation two trips into the
previous echelon abuse so you do do do

349
00:29:10,340 --> 00:29:14,010
sometime fencing on your lookups when
you're trying to do the defensive

350
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:18,539
application I just said you know don't
find out that some name server has been

351
00:29:18,539 --> 00:29:22,200
responsible for two million domains but
that was all three years ago

352
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:30,390
go for example I do want to emphasize
this is important

353
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:36,220
passive dennis is not a reputation
source I started the first antispam

354
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:41,180
company we invented the thing now called
the RBL very proud of it lawsuits and

355
00:29:41,180 --> 00:29:43,450
all but that is different than this

356
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:49,000
those are judgment calls those are
opinions of those are statements of

357
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:55,200
danger vs safety and this is not a
reputation system is somebody has a

358
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,230
passive DNS database and offers you
access to it take it but realize that

359
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:04,360
what you're seeing is facts there were
observed and it is up to you to draw

360
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:09,629
conclusions about whether they were good
or evil and certainly Spamhaus

361
00:30:09,630 --> 00:30:14,940
answerable are two extremely effective
reputation systems if you're not using

362
00:30:14,940 --> 00:30:19,890
them you should and there's a way of
making an inquiry of both at once using

363
00:30:19,890 --> 00:30:26,150
the URL shown here but anyway without
background let's take a look at a

364
00:30:26,150 --> 00:30:32,780
natural use case of what you might do if
you don't is on the defensive use its a

365
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:38,639
takedown related use if you were
starting with this domain name where the

366
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:43,780
final period has been changed into
brackets dota in order to prevent you

367
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:48,930
from cutting and pasting those who
actually running the query if you have

368
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:53,340
seen it and you're wondering should I
take it now

369
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:58,959
should i block it or should I may be
asked the registry to delete my country

370
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:03,040
and pronounce it but should I asked the
germans June delete this thing ending in

371
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:08,360
24 here you'd like to know who else is
depending on it besides the criminal who

372
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:12,949
would who just attacked you so

373
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:17,039
the current result as of the day we may
be slides was that it had to IP

374
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:22,330
addresses and we found that both of
those were listed on the Spamhaus SPL

375
00:31:22,330 --> 00:31:28,720
usually an indication that they really
are darker to joke but let's look at

376
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:35,649
what else we can learn here we are
looking at what are the other names that

377
00:31:35,649 --> 00:31:39,439
point to the same IP address and it
turned out that there were some things

378
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:47,360
that look a little bit like name server
names and that is an indication that

379
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:51,750
there's trouble ahead because you need
to find out what name server what

380
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:55,710
domains depend on that name server
because if you take away this name

381
00:31:55,710 --> 00:31:59,169
you'll be taking away all of the
infrastructure that supports those other

382
00:31:59,169 --> 00:32:08,639
names the other ones were similar
keenness to insult idiots one but is

383
00:32:08,639 --> 00:32:12,320
this something has only been true for
the last week I mean how how long is

384
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:16,740
this person been at that ISP how much is
this thing this particular domain name

385
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:23,159
been served where it is so this is
looking at the history didn't have a

386
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:27,460
huge count wasn't terribly popular
during all the times that it spent one

387
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:32,769
day where one week or maybe two weeks at
some provider but it has moved around

388
00:32:32,769 --> 00:32:36,820
quite a bit of its moving around quite a
bit and this list unanswerable that's

389
00:32:36,820 --> 00:32:41,590
two strikes because moving around is
called fast flux or can be

390
00:32:41,590 --> 00:32:44,570
you can have legitimate reasons for
moving around like for example your

391
00:32:44,570 --> 00:32:48,350
maximized and you've got a CD and
banking you but if you don't have a

392
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:52,870
legitimate reason chances are you moving
around cuz you're getting kicked off so

393
00:32:52,870 --> 00:32:57,620
moving around and the enlisted
unsuitable or two strikes against do it

394
00:32:57,620 --> 00:33:03,059
in terms of analyzing for your own
reasons what is the reputation of this

395
00:33:03,059 --> 00:33:11,200
this name here we're looking for all the
subdomains particularly powerful query

396
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:15,730
for passive DNS is it something that
normal danis can't even conceive of his

397
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:19,510
show me all the names that are children
of that name

398
00:33:19,510 --> 00:33:24,240
but we didn't see a whole lot of other
unique names in other words we don't

399
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,140
have a huge slush pile now other names
that we have to check the dependencies

400
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:35,890
on the ones that we found were pretty
much the ones we already had but name

401
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:40,110
server names look like name server names
if you see dennis one and DNS to you

402
00:33:40,110 --> 00:33:44,959
know the name server names and do you
really wanna know what else depends on

403
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:50,510
that so here's a query where is quite a
few things depend on a hundred and

404
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:53,940
thirty thousand things depend on it
that's usually an indication of a

405
00:33:53,940 --> 00:34:02,570
parking Domain Service and these are
some examples Yandex Bruce security

406
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:07,610
stopped done are you you know I'm not
enough of a Russian to be able to tell

407
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:12,969
you if that's likely to be a company
name or or some kind of a fishing domain

408
00:34:12,969 --> 00:34:17,350
but the fact is there a hundred and
thirty thousand of them gives us some

409
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:22,560
bolts we look this is looking at the
same thing for and asked to which has

410
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:26,840
pretty much the same name so everything
was served by one is mostly served by

411
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:33,790
the other and yet that first one
starting with G es un is listed on the

412
00:34:33,790 --> 00:34:41,550
Spamhaus dbl answerable now it looks
like all three of these were now four

413
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:44,560
hundred and thirty thousand of them we
might not be willing to check every

414
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:48,320
domain name to see if it's blocked
answerable but for at least a handful

415
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:52,690
you should take a look because if
everyone you look at the first ten out

416
00:34:52,690 --> 00:34:57,070
of that hundred and thirty thousand are
answerable is probably a nameserver the

417
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:04,330
world would be a better place without
now we did run into one other name

418
00:35:04,330 --> 00:35:09,640
server looking name during those
previous searches and we found a very

419
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:19,440
low count and we didn't find a very long
period of time for the first one yeah so

420
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,380
what accounts the slow you know that
there aren't enough things looking this

421
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:28,000
up for this to be all that important so
you know at this point you're in the

422
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,080
investigation you're leaning in the
direction of

423
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:36,140
block in this thing and this doesn't
convince you to change your mind but

424
00:35:36,140 --> 00:35:39,220
that's really what you should do that
level of understanding of the

425
00:35:39,220 --> 00:35:43,310
infrastructure you intend to block
before you then reach out to the germans

426
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:49,940
and say could you please block this
second level name and diamond D E and

427
00:35:49,940 --> 00:35:55,420
the alternative which has been tried by
a number of different high-profile

428
00:35:55,420 --> 00:36:02,150
takedowns is where you just kind of wing
it and just hope for the best and then

429
00:36:02,150 --> 00:36:07,820
your names in the papers tomorrow and
then your chief counsel was answering

430
00:36:07,820 --> 00:36:12,160
questions from your chief executives and
chief executive asst answering questions

431
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:16,920
from the board who might be answering
questions from the SEC so you really

432
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:23,530
want to use your powers wisely and if
this level of homework is not as you

433
00:36:23,530 --> 00:36:27,770
just saying it's not an insuperable
burden on unreasonable ask you know just

434
00:36:27,770 --> 00:36:32,020
do this level of checking before you ask
that judge to take away that domain name

435
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:42,360
then don't just wing it so some of you
are wondering why you're sitting here

436
00:36:42,360 --> 00:36:45,950
those are you haven't already left
because you're not in the business of

437
00:36:45,950 --> 00:36:50,160
taking things down your non corporate
security type you not law enforcement

438
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:54,549
you're not likely to be called as an
expert witness by a judge asking you is

439
00:36:54,550 --> 00:36:59,880
this reasonable request there are some
other things that may apply to you which

440
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:03,550
is then let's imagine you're about to
purchase some infrastructure maybe it's

441
00:37:03,550 --> 00:37:05,990
a managed name service or

442
00:37:05,990 --> 00:37:12,160
the PM's DPS whatever it is there some
vendors somewhere of some services

443
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:19,080
answering a request for proposal or
request for quotation and you're

444
00:37:19,080 --> 00:37:23,540
wondering alright so what kind of a
neighborhood are you in

445
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:29,130
who are your other customers and are
they also are they like me or are they a

446
00:37:29,130 --> 00:37:34,180
bunch of really dark herded folks and
I'm gonna face a lot of overbroad

447
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:38,609
takedowns because I'm your customer just
because of who your other customers are

448
00:37:38,610 --> 00:37:45,020
we've had a number of people use our
Pasadena service tool to locate that

449
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:46,520
just saying all right

450
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:52,610
the science P has you know maybe 2048
adjacent IP addresses let's look at the

451
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:56,460
history of all the names that have ever
point to any address in that address

452
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:01,910
block and if what you see is a whole
bunch of things that look like online

453
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:06,288
child abuse material shore

454
00:38:06,289 --> 00:38:09,759
massage services or or whatever it is
that you don't want to be associated

455
00:38:09,759 --> 00:38:15,279
with you might use that as a decision
criteria for maybe I'm gonna pay extra

456
00:38:15,279 --> 00:38:19,989
to get a provider that is not this this
one the lowest bidder might not be to

457
00:38:19,989 --> 00:38:25,079
your liking you do the same thing with
any other infrastructure that you intend

458
00:38:25,079 --> 00:38:29,729
to purchase whether it's managed name
service managed mail service would ever

459
00:38:29,729 --> 00:38:34,078
find out who their other customers are
it's public information you're not doing

460
00:38:34,079 --> 00:38:41,459
anything and violating anybody's privacy
by doing this and you know again I can't

461
00:38:41,459 --> 00:38:47,649
stress that if you are a service
provider and you're doing the best you

462
00:38:47,650 --> 00:38:52,369
can then everybody including Spamhaus
answerable is going to be on your side

463
00:38:52,369 --> 00:38:56,410
and you're not going to face blocking
but if there are some trivial steps that

464
00:38:56,410 --> 00:39:02,569
you could be taken to keep criminals
from an able to hear from using your

465
00:39:02,569 --> 00:39:07,249
service as a foundation and you're not
taking those proposed reveals taps then

466
00:39:07,249 --> 00:39:14,549
pretty much people are going to be
looking for an excuse to cut you off so

467
00:39:14,549 --> 00:39:23,069
nothing is too big takedown I realize
that most of you were saying so you

468
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:26,429
probably never blocked gmail.com

469
00:39:26,429 --> 00:39:31,169
but I did for the first two years and
was until members of my family started

470
00:39:31,169 --> 00:39:34,810
getting i cant send email and could not
send me

471
00:39:34,810 --> 00:39:38,960
email that I was willing to accept email
from them when I discovered is that in

472
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:43,360
those two years google bot and antispam
company and actually paid some attention

473
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:48,380
that's a machine learning and so now
gmail is not a spam source but there was

474
00:39:48,380 --> 00:39:54,530
a time when gmail was pure spam and I
rejected all mail from them and I think

475
00:39:54,530 --> 00:39:58,760
you'll discover the nobody not even
Google not even Akamai is so big that

476
00:39:58,760 --> 00:40:04,110
you would not block them if they start
demonstrating bad patterns of behavior

477
00:40:04,110 --> 00:40:09,390
antisocial in a way that shipped to
their costs to you were profits at your

478
00:40:09,390 --> 00:40:16,660
expense finally I always say this I'm
down to my last five minutes we need

479
00:40:16,660 --> 00:40:22,420
your data not just weeee far side but
any passive DNS project whether

480
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:27,410
for-profit or non-profit I don't know
which we r needs more data because the

481
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:34,069
more we can see then the more the
customers can see and you know we have a

482
00:40:34,070 --> 00:40:39,070
lot of we ourselves give away free
accounts to law enforcement and academic

483
00:40:39,070 --> 00:40:44,060
and we're not alone most pasadena's
projects do that and so anything you can

484
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:48,830
do to contribute this data that has no
país no no privacy implications in this

485
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:53,390
data would really help the world will
give you a better world to operate in

486
00:40:53,390 --> 00:40:58,490
and it will cost you nothing so please
think about that if you're running a

487
00:40:58,490 --> 00:41:04,410
recursive name server and you're
technically able to run a sensor Google

488
00:41:04,410 --> 00:41:11,710
will tell you who you could contact or
you can reach out to me we don't collect

489
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:14,670
PII have already stressed that

490
00:41:14,670 --> 00:41:45,540
and I'm gonna leave it there so we have
five minutes for questions

491
00:41:45,540 --> 00:41:52,259
I think that shows the what we've been
doing just as for the other passive DNS

492
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:57,860
providers in the in the world has worked
and it has caused the bad guys don't

493
00:41:57,860 --> 00:42:02,970
think about new ways to operate and you
know I don't think it's news to anybody

494
00:42:02,970 --> 00:42:06,029
in this room that there's no such thing
as a silver bullet and that no matter

495
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:10,540
what we do it will be countered the
question of how much cost there will be

496
00:42:10,540 --> 00:42:14,130
for the bad guys to counter it and how
long it will take them but those are the

497
00:42:14,130 --> 00:42:17,780
only variables we know they will do it
so i think thats what you're seeing

498
00:42:17,780 --> 00:42:22,000
there as they they believe the Twitter
is to me too large to block and probably

499
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:27,880
it is but the more they leverage that
the more the machine learning geeks at

500
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:32,710
Twitter themselves are going to be
looking for that stuff and you know so I

501
00:42:32,710 --> 00:42:37,690
think that to the extent that we we can
force the bad guys to make a move and we

502
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:41,840
couldn't cause them to maybe go on
appealing to some sort of infrastructure

503
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:45,290
that is not their preferred
infrastructure that we might make the

504
00:42:45,290 --> 00:42:50,690
next move easier on ourselves obviously
got a place like Jesse gotta play three

505
00:42:50,690 --> 00:42:56,600
or four moves ahead of you wanna win
yeah

506
00:42:56,600 --> 00:43:07,770
first version of this which some of you
know I started inside of internet

507
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:12,560
systems consortium which was my
non-profit by the way we bought the

508
00:43:12,560 --> 00:43:16,740
assets fair and square and we overpaid
for them so this was not a case where

509
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:21,560
public infrastructure became private
infrastructure but when he first started

510
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:28,049
this in 2007 I was collecting data from
not just recursive servers but also

511
00:43:28,050 --> 00:43:31,540
authorities servers because ultimately
its two ends of the same transaction

512
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:35,830
when it when a recursive server is
asking a question asking an authority

513
00:43:35,830 --> 00:43:41,210
that question so in other words seeing
the question-and-answer coming in to

514
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:47,320
authorities is almost as good as seen as
it leaves the recursive at the far end

515
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:55,290
but as I say almost as good turns out
really it isn't as good because what we

516
00:43:55,290 --> 00:44:01,480
found is that there's a fairly small
working said of popular names that are

517
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:08,210
not already is going to answer and
you're gonna get all of those and least

518
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:18,810
save five hundred thousand times per GTL
so the data that we get from authorities

519
00:44:18,810 --> 00:44:25,190
servers is extraordinarily self-similar
and once we went through the duplicator

520
00:44:25,190 --> 00:44:31,190
it crushes out to such a small sliver of
data then I'd kind of rather see the

521
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:34,750
data at the recursive end of that
transaction so even though it's the same

522
00:44:34,750 --> 00:44:40,740
transaction that just isn't enough name
display thority unless it's a Perkin

523
00:44:40,740 --> 00:45:03,810
server the deserving millions of
authority zone

524
00:45:03,810 --> 00:45:11,250
200,000 events per second sounds like it
might be expensive to collect and so for

525
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:14,690
that is that was one of the reasons I
pull this out of the nonprofit is that

526
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:18,570
we didn't have access to capital and we
were constrained about how big we could

527
00:45:18,570 --> 00:45:23,920
get but it turns out that if you're
really clever and certainly the people

528
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:29,420
working for my company are even if I am
NOT you can do everything you need to do

529
00:45:29,420 --> 00:45:36,290
in RAM so the other than five years
storage where we obviously that's a

530
00:45:36,290 --> 00:45:42,910
necessity but all of the deduplication
and all of the early filtered filtering

531
00:45:42,910 --> 00:45:47,440
out of diana's channels and DNS cache
pollution attempts and everything else

532
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:53,730
that really isn't he announced it all
happens in RAM and so pretty much takes

533
00:45:53,730 --> 00:46:00,100
about a half a rack of equipment that
costs may be a grant to to do this job

534
00:46:00,100 --> 00:46:08,500
at the hub at the far end where the
sensor is it's the Minimus it's it's

535
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,850
negligible is what you're doing

536
00:46:10,850 --> 00:46:15,750
if you install our sensor what it is is
a free program that links against

537
00:46:15,750 --> 00:46:20,050
Liberty Cap so it's just like the
tcpdump command accepted runs as a demon

538
00:46:20,050 --> 00:46:25,190
and it just sits there watching for
request packets to go one way in keeping

539
00:46:25,190 --> 00:46:28,860
a little bit of state around so that it
knows what request for outstanding which

540
00:46:28,860 --> 00:46:33,320
for the fragmented response to come back
reassemble the fragments and then put

541
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:40,920
that together and since it upstream most
recursive servers are in the 2001 or

542
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:46,820
between 20 and 50 21 reduction due to
DNS caching in other words if you're

543
00:46:46,820 --> 00:46:53,080
answering twenty million queries you are
only gonna be sending 1,000,000 cache

544
00:46:53,080 --> 00:46:58,790
misses upstream while doing it and the
provisioning problem that recursive

545
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:03,110
nameserver operators think they have is
the number of queries per second and

546
00:47:03,110 --> 00:47:06,250
especially the bandwidth toward the
stubs in other words towards the

547
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:10,950
smartphones in the servers and all the
rest so the cache miss traffic is such a

548
00:47:10,950 --> 00:47:14,140
small thing that they mostly don't even
account for it

549
00:47:14,140 --> 00:47:18,058
absence hour traffic requirement mirrors
something that they already don't care

550
00:47:18,059 --> 00:47:22,130
about the basically you install this
thing and Romans in one corner of your

551
00:47:22,130 --> 00:47:28,549
CPU takes about you know worst case I've
seen it takes about one twentieth of the

552
00:47:28,549 --> 00:47:33,599
the CPU cycles that the name server
itself is taking so really the sensor is

553
00:47:33,599 --> 00:47:47,470
such a light footprint that no one
notices it any more questions

554
00:47:47,470 --> 00:47:49,230
okay thank you
