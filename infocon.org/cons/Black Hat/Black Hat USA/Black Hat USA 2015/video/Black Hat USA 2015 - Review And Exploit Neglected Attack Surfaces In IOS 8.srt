1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,950
connection and what comes out of it and
this is i me and I am today won't be off

2
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:13,829
against

3
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:24,519
hey guys just a bad pass to yes I don't
have security research is already

4
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:28,340
researched

5
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:39,230
tax asset base in this study was
announced and get a tax is eight and

6
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:51,718
show based on the floor and we assume
that could still find some you browse

7
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:56,550
and also the results

8
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:02,099
thanks baby during the day tomorrow

9
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:06,770
this actually this topic is about two
months ago

10
00:01:06,770 --> 00:01:17,009
downtown where she is about his age to
box we discovered that he had a permit

11
00:01:17,009 --> 00:01:29,130
to carry on the agenda today it's just a
sea change over at the was adding

12
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:36,600
background and where did you send that
text so this is missus embarks used that

13
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:46,820
are still break and then we first see
what price and after three for the for

14
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:52,089
the do this you that space we focus on
talking about a species so I think

15
00:01:52,090 --> 00:02:05,399
actually due to the folks at some point
you have to pass this ban on a desk so I

16
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:14,450
just this morning I think we are the
video is dis security mechanism has

17
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:25,109
since launched off she's and data
protection to protect your personal and

18
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:34,060
maybe the next major version of hours I
was nice to get more

19
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:43,310
each do see highlights to the security
of Colonel maybe I said let's go to

20
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:54,500
first unread texts this post you choose
to use it as i text service to use it

21
00:02:54,500 --> 00:03:05,790
and I think so too big or go home and
also does 22 kind of tax the first is

22
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:17,680
the means I did ours devices and the
other is you start applications and

23
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:31,920
enterprise said the case so for the
first time in a hose you to manage your

24
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:41,600
iPhone iTunes so I guess a lot of time
they stop at this particular and I both

25
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:52,980
like each s exy access face and he can
restore your iPhone case and also you

26
00:03:52,980 --> 00:04:09,040
just because she saw their study and
she's just brought up the issue was

27
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:20,709
devices that this is provided by myself
for the for the east of casein we two

28
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:29,139
examples here the first jet car because
she is also produced by our two men did

29
00:04:29,139 --> 00:04:38,300
he want to just saw that I said he used
to creating this this application that's

30
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:47,979
used 58 shy but just due process to
review all uploaded to the app install

31
00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:56,919
so

32
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:04,660
tax this is this year

33
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:14,250
research I'm sure this program is that
you just right because she said why he

34
00:05:14,250 --> 00:05:25,280
said as a cease and then you can just
replace the original one maybe two ish

35
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:35,510
yeah actually the attacks with you why
they used hostage a brace and that's a

36
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:42,840
lot of example in recent memory they
hope to hear their own

37
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:52,719
di to the device and gay marriage the
device

38
00:05:52,720 --> 00:06:02,080
for the remote access this and cherries
and then that's your comment she's home

39
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:13,620
is all BS targets he is so thought I was
about suffering this is also

40
00:06:13,620 --> 00:06:27,920
jeopardy becoming used to do that and
also to own that they can they do this

41
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:34,280
to your contact information photos

42
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:42,789
Texas message she first saw the first
message and a reduced to sunlight any

43
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:52,900
medium and tries to use that is actually
this yet also a part of the message if

44
00:06:52,900 --> 00:07:02,409
you send a special Unicode message to
send device they can just call and the

45
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:12,610
system that's what the most disparity
that exists here is she doing that lol

46
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:21,200
crashed and their system is just just
responsible and is bounded ok so this is

47
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:29,000
also released today I guess so did you
though and that's ok

48
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:43,770
could not text this is basically a space
could be accessed this and does raise to

49
00:07:43,770 --> 00:07:53,760
that kind of the first is busy system
calls like Obama writes read and check

50
00:07:53,760 --> 00:08:07,630
this is a very special I was actually we
go to divide these two categories I just

51
00:08:07,630 --> 00:08:20,250
this number of the HIDs if you actually
going to punch showed some system

52
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:28,710
arrivals and Bri since I was like 10
devices to go see if you want to mount

53
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:37,960
you make that kind of us to resolve the
system and device actually like i said

54
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:51,360
im shi shi no devices / these parties
I'll kiss most most she is provided by

55
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,520
this case he faces

56
00:08:54,520 --> 00:09:09,689
mig system we discussed this process
process and the box already used the

57
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:19,280
jailbreaks look at that so for the
filesystem

58
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:31,920
yes very very basic fact has actually
check at university I could say that

59
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:39,479
caused the problem is that a six and
also the car enough I was fire this

60
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:48,170
experience should be right by the beach
and he's having done this is a check us

61
00:09:48,170 --> 00:10:00,050
hehe 0004 system cost 06

62
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:08,010
she is incorrect ready checks actually
data and cost to this party also explore

63
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:14,590
to jerry flowers 6:23

64
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:27,610
ensure that doesn't explain to actually
this very special he said his friend the

65
00:10:27,610 --> 00:10:41,460
correct size so that was you just cannot
dresses and they don't think she would

66
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:53,710
decrease the address I miss you I guess
they changed and this party is used to

67
00:10:53,710 --> 00:10:58,190
replace it allows for you

68
00:10:58,190 --> 00:11:13,220
ice for winning well okay so do I says
Judy Weiss and very nice as use the eBay

69
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:27,260
she say for the I was just break he did
GMA shes and it didn't change boot with

70
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:38,830
Mary T is changing my number all the BMX
device memory access

71
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:52,660
jade is so so many blacks decide okay so
I just listened

72
00:11:52,660 --> 00:12:02,150
actually listens during breaks all the
kind of bauxite is OK

73
00:12:02,150 --> 00:12:12,180
processor this is a quote today

74
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:17,939
thoughts on the issue that cannot be
allowed to talk about first 12 that s

75
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:29,560
and some small group and decided that we
should do some more popular kids and

76
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:43,209
that's just and distinctive this might
be this is not just for you this place

77
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:53,840
focus the XP CD or juice work we do
actually that is different from the one

78
00:12:53,840 --> 00:13:03,850
who go 2009 as we know they also
released a sandbox for use in space

79
00:13:03,850 --> 00:13:08,790
ok so let's go to the first time

80
00:13:08,790 --> 00:13:23,740
you see ya locates companies more hole
so he is made by a very cheesy I would

81
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:32,120
get proper so we see does his best
tickets for kind of thing you'd assume

82
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:44,390
so hard for this and actually two years
ago President shall pretend we just

83
00:13:44,390 --> 00:13:50,100
talked about how to do DIY ok so we
don't get some basic information just

84
00:13:50,100 --> 00:13:59,550
talk just give scientists thought he was
the first is that we are not the most

85
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:09,500
out a focus calling this message is this
is a powerful she's to do all the

86
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:16,830
turnovers but if you look inside
dysfunction actually this is not the

87
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:28,910
first time she actually this is just
call it a massive function and is she

88
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:36,719
actually she just called my message to
cuddle so

89
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,199
what does she do

90
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:49,359
Akshay today they did a very tracy has
seen a check the size of the structure

91
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:58,959
to determine the size of a very large
jet and forget about it should use their

92
00:14:58,959 --> 00:15:06,939
own memory is scripted man this you that
and the memories I see it otherwise if

93
00:15:06,939 --> 00:15:17,079
the plays moll I just you can just call
our taxes this is obvious that its

94
00:15:17,079 --> 00:15:20,239
considerations

95
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:29,620
and he's a snapshot of the city has to
sign a check and they different branch

96
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:36,930
they were different to permit us to them

97
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:51,390
so I previous I think you should I come
back so it's a good choice to call the

98
00:15:51,390 --> 00:16:03,189
function and gives you the power to
bypass the size mister cheese and see

99
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:08,910
some of us

100
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:17,020
different different copy or I remember
the script that they were all different

101
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:30,930
branch of cold so cold and there's an
example here this this is used the last

102
00:16:30,930 --> 00:16:40,239
year and this is very cheap coal exist
the branch of the drive to deal with I'm

103
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:49,300
not sure how to structure the parameter
want to exploit these Park want to

104
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:58,640
explore these issues he's made that
means you need to put the memory

105
00:16:58,640 --> 00:17:10,970
nothing magic about us must muster you
so so cause I'm coming home as a

106
00:17:10,970 --> 00:17:14,520
function you will not be a part

107
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:22,900
you need to call it all and she passed
size restriction

108
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:37,250
gypsies that is really what this case is
if you want to write a one key exploit

109
00:17:37,250 --> 00:17:50,110
and needed by the most other medications
so what do you do you actually we check

110
00:17:50,110 --> 00:18:03,649
this out hotel just outside so this is
this is used for it costs we actually

111
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:11,220
just a break

112
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:32,230
desire to you by calling on low-level
she wants to do is show kids chance so

113
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:41,400
we look at short-term memory memory is
that ok I was able to share married

114
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:46,850
director he is to use the space
applications and it's assumed us they

115
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:57,209
use up vacation already know the
structure I mean what you say so the

116
00:18:57,210 --> 00:19:06,289
space if wants to open to share their
memories I think they just going to use

117
00:19:06,289 --> 00:19:19,220
open the device is that she and this is
just me to ship it to you memory type

118
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:28,730
this this is me fall to our kids
exchanges

119
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:33,590
we see how these

120
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:41,299
ok wants to share with you the space
applications they need to overwrite this

121
00:19:41,299 --> 00:19:47,190
file she kinds of memory and this is a
simple

122
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:53,040
hold for the HID

123
00:19:53,040 --> 00:20:01,340
and you can see is that seems to do is
to pretend that memory descriptive

124
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:10,070
subject then the kernel which memory
should be back to you the space you to

125
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,210
the since

126
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:21,559
extensions as I said before she's
alright she's the second parameter is

127
00:20:21,559 --> 00:20:31,320
this is just a memory type process to
the colonel and then you must be good to

128
00:20:31,320 --> 00:20:36,629
successfully opened over Andy Murray

129
00:20:36,630 --> 00:20:47,230
and then finally so he was trying to
open this year and then if you this

130
00:20:47,230 --> 00:20:55,150
memory while I like to call myself
because they have these show the memory

131
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,160
is used

132
00:20:56,160 --> 00:21:13,110
I used by some punk she's my my sis to
host and the former two parts by James

133
00:21:13,110 --> 00:21:21,919
deal and this is the number I use to
jailbreak so we see the problem the

134
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:29,310
scenarios that the correct rate should
not trust their memory daytime need more

135
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:32,780
than that by using the Caseys

136
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:39,320
we could I said that he's its members to
the US space used at a time when the US

137
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:48,070
space then you should check she and
watching these days they just

138
00:21:48,070 --> 00:21:55,850
I think so I know there was another
Tokyo de cheques del the checks can be

139
00:21:55,850 --> 00:22:04,270
made by his base by calling a six-month
she said finally they all get you the

140
00:22:04,270 --> 00:22:17,500
past they are easy on the backs of likes
and decides that there's maybe up to six

141
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:31,630
current tests and the issue so we can
see that kinda well versed in a

142
00:22:31,630 --> 00:22:40,460
structure according to the next ok and
if it's successful get a structure and

143
00:22:40,460 --> 00:22:49,610
then directed called the structure and
there's no more checks

144
00:22:49,610 --> 00:23:03,209
get extension once to provide this
feature they may write about USC most

145
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:14,130
diverse choose to override a target in a
plane that she's so I was discharged

146
00:23:14,130 --> 00:23:22,090
after first use to locate over she's and
the Chiefs you could get any Rancho

147
00:23:22,090 --> 00:23:28,949
that's so you can you can do it for us
because then no more science check this

148
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:37,240
can put 6 p.m. meet us but apparently
that's fine sand by any and the like

149
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:43,150
this you will find the lowest in the
trap is structured the definition is

150
00:23:43,150 --> 00:23:53,610
different from the way there is no
memory and destruction we caught it but

151
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:57,969
I yeah I saw the work day

152
00:23:57,970 --> 00:24:11,240
the black because he's the second member
she is it as we seat is real point is it

153
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:14,700
went on sale I means the fuck she

154
00:24:14,700 --> 00:24:24,950
function and there is upset after
function objected

155
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:37,520
after he talked about his chance in the
process I just sent them my sister is a

156
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:42,290
very very well at home ATM card

157
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:52,740
Mike message actually I'm not only this
way to champion the land dispatched the

158
00:24:52,740 --> 00:25:02,760
messages this is the ceiling number yes
I was this close I think you see your

159
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:13,790
messages and message to what we see here
is that the message I he does set in

160
00:25:13,790 --> 00:25:26,870
this message I so cannot handle this
case were dispatched by PCR and

161
00:25:26,870 --> 00:25:39,590
dysfunction on the max according to the
message I okay and then called the other

162
00:25:39,590 --> 00:25:51,139
routine this destruction so if you want
to know she's markets and you'll find

163
00:25:51,140 --> 00:26:03,180
this this this they are actually is and
he or she is just

164
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:09,380
read all of that stuff from the bronco
and thus told him he should

165
00:26:09,380 --> 00:26:19,210
markets so take a look at this this is
not a sudden sisters here so each

166
00:26:19,210 --> 00:26:20,410
subsystem

167
00:26:20,410 --> 00:26:24,860
you can you say so

168
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:34,100
go to I could catch up the iOS devices
and you can look at it and the distance

169
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:49,010
here and then we'll use these beings
subsist and this is the memo message and

170
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:58,670
the minimum routine number this message
I D set message she also thinks that

171
00:26:58,670 --> 00:27:04,120
shes

172
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:15,340
so this year I also know what message
IDs

173
00:27:15,340 --> 00:27:26,290
this is possible for you to see all team
subsistence sheets but maybe not so good

174
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:38,460
so you know you I see maybe it must be
used to and my sister that means for

175
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:43,750
each time she's but if she sees to you
she said the figure out what this

176
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:51,290
message so that you can really excites
distinction

177
00:27:51,290 --> 00:28:01,860
and I think we still we see that and my
cheese subsistence not to wear do so

178
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:12,429
maybe maybe some rocks from the east and
today just give up our houses and he

179
00:28:12,430 --> 00:28:22,970
said it is ok to chance I'll still use a
crime or right on target and that she

180
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:36,840
and he just function actually a street
to parent this is that ok so genius

181
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:55,480
judge next to us less than we did look
into D were over he returned to this

182
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:06,320
area at least six if you want to send
you close to this out of my system

183
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:15,710
memory but here is JD's I think this is
a very long program and we just go is

184
00:29:15,710 --> 00:29:19,840
just the overall difference

185
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:23,830
48.4% she

186
00:29:23,830 --> 00:30:03,899
and he's in exile to talk about the case
you should surprise you look at me

187
00:30:03,899 --> 00:31:16,639
access to a comp

188
00:31:16,640 --> 00:32:34,370
this message and also reduce what
message does it always point seven and

189
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:54,610
it just kind of the LED details to see a
recent poll interface look to hop a bus

190
00:32:54,610 --> 00:33:09,050
services only by the name very very easy
to use to receive strong it very easy to

191
00:33:09,050 --> 00:33:10,440
use

192
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:22,549
kind of free to do that so I am going to
use according to demonstrate how to also

193
00:33:22,549 --> 00:33:48,620
so this is also the most common way is
to use easy to say we should do BBBJ

194
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:55,120
fires wineries

195
00:33:55,120 --> 00:34:10,098
thirties they are not open to serve the
same API also be used to buy the kind

196
00:34:10,099 --> 00:34:15,310
words

197
00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:36,489
parameter the web and those are the
moment to connection so that means you

198
00:34:36,489 --> 00:34:50,509
wanted a special connection she so you
can use these connections connections

199
00:34:50,510 --> 00:35:02,150
especially here and there came in
connection but this time you and all the

200
00:35:02,150 --> 00:35:20,230
messages you are able to get the message
and actually over 60 CT her rice and let

201
00:35:20,230 --> 00:35:59,240
the thirties so it's been 12 next season
13-0 and now each time I see you next

202
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:13,240
week she points out now this example 31
2009

203
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:25,080
and now we just need to have the right
to use this number right along the x PC

204
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:51,170
so you prepare to say they had to and
from receiver message PC attorney

205
00:36:51,170 --> 00:37:06,210
whether extracted and processed so we
believe all the three staff members

206
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:29,369
would be so here and work from research
this work a lot of a lot of the top

207
00:37:29,369 --> 00:37:30,930
judy's

208
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:41,368
this cold demonstrated a computer
service I received a message also

209
00:37:41,369 --> 00:37:59,670
receive a message for example when they
tried to reach you choose to use the key

210
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:06,530
there

211
00:38:06,530 --> 00:38:24,860
because different structure if you don't
have a phone that it would problems

212
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:38,050
reflect all three spots so happy days

213
00:38:38,050 --> 00:39:07,450
produced a lot to check the level of
false if so all this crime actually but

214
00:39:07,450 --> 00:39:34,950
I fix this so we made reference to how
we were so soft and fuzzy a lot of us

215
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:46,790
are raised and I think policies the
first made but we just saw that and we

216
00:39:46,790 --> 00:39:53,080
see that we are able to choose

217
00:39:53,080 --> 00:40:29,819
which is also received would clash and
then we marked in 2001 2001 but he's so

218
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:54,830
sorry so what we did for a while to the
company and find the old needs to be

219
00:40:54,830 --> 00:41:21,040
this shows up at a service issue I told
you know we we want to see folks so what

220
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:38,820
do we do this we

221
00:41:38,820 --> 00:41:43,880
up to construct

222
00:41:43,880 --> 00:42:17,580
know if you don't process so rich so we
just how I hope I see straight line also

223
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:30,230
could reference to this family and we
just shot the case of the objects so we

224
00:42:30,230 --> 00:42:46,870
are able to reach the single parent with
my relax so we

225
00:42:46,870 --> 00:43:18,000
father we should we will see you but we
are not sure we lost and we go through

226
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:27,600
the most difficult so they're just
presume the existence of the sort of a

227
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:45,490
piece of the message so I just tried to
reach you change that this is the code

228
00:43:45,490 --> 00:44:07,430
and this is possible to see the big deal
I told them what I can see all the crush

229
00:44:07,430 --> 00:44:24,770
services let me know

230
00:44:24,770 --> 00:44:44,070
London memory ok so he was like this
program

231
00:44:44,070 --> 00:45:29,040
gel yes we should just try to do with
also just more like helping people to

232
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:58,090
decide

233
00:45:58,090 --> 00:46:41,160
and has to be trusted to manage example
we you docs sent out what I want to

234
00:46:41,160 --> 00:47:16,310
share a taxi 882 deep and it's very
quickly again but she added

235
00:47:16,310 --> 00:47:23,040
try to make the whole country

236
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:38,560
you just go and say the truth authority
but it's very easy to explain why looky

237
00:47:38,560 --> 00:48:03,170
looky how to control this is so scary to
you is to say how easily the second you

238
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:37,750
might be able to jump ship to you find
so he just super

239
00:48:37,750 --> 00:49:15,880
ok this is the second fiscal 2011 movie
the program

240
00:49:15,880 --> 00:49:43,200
systems and so forth and so we we
demonstrated so I can see what you come

241
00:49:43,200 --> 00:50:04,600
up with new and it's not spicy and also
we believe that you're not sure what did

242
00:50:04,600 --> 00:50:23,259
you make a step further because we
believe that all those first goal

243
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:24,310
we have cut
