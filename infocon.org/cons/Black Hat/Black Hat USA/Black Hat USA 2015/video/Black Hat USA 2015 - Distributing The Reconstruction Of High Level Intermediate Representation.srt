1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,160
by everyone and thanks for coming for
our presentation of the glass the title

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,760
the presentation will be able to come to
your inbox you're actually what will be

3
00:00:10,760 --> 00:00:15,309
speaking about today is to do we
distribute it to my lawyer and now this

4
00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:23,539
report researchers so this is a research
group 2004 researchers from Intel and

5
00:00:23,539 --> 00:00:30,550
ESET and the names are on this slide are
presented in the alphabetical order and

6
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:31,480
that's about it

7
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,930
everyone did the same contribution that
dear all the decisions on this

8
00:00:36,930 --> 00:00:42,989
presentation ready but its and their
agreed to my house so let's start first

9
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:50,209
of all we would like to say that they're
all jokes her mistakes and other things

10
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:55,190
our response to our own responsibilities
and of course we want to put these are

11
00:00:55,190 --> 00:01:01,699
our imports for hearing officer of time
to work on this research in case there

12
00:01:01,699 --> 00:01:10,039
are any mistakes it is going awesome but
no doubt reporters before starting this

13
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:10,880
presentation

14
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,420
let's take a look back to our original
thesis research started before so are

15
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:24,299
the guys you're already presented in
that black had 2012 her on the

16
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:28,229
distributed environment report due
tomorrow where analysis actually started

17
00:01:28,229 --> 00:01:33,240
this project in 2010 and before it was
more like an approach so we can see here

18
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:41,740
all the hardware on the slides so this
time we are made up with a sound here

19
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:50,740
our hardware looks like more powerful
and more well-structured actually in the

20
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:57,640
middle of the black hat rack rush
something started toward mass op and

21
00:01:57,640 --> 00:02:03,759
your will mister a puter is house on
fire so I help their insurance company

22
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,690
won't see this presentation

23
00:02:05,690 --> 00:02:12,079
ok let's start with the agenda of the
presentation and the first thing he will

24
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:16,080
speak about her is it actually what made
you needed to ask her for it

25
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,640
given this presentation octaves here and
here is what kind of tools what kind of

26
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:25,549
algorithms also speak about the
limitations of the our approach

27
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:33,800
volunteers design decisions we put in
place or interact to obtain results will

28
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:38,330
share with you all the results are we
were able to obtain the course of this

29
00:02:38,330 --> 00:02:44,180
research and will discuss how are those
additional information will be shared

30
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:53,230
with the community year researchers so
first of all I think it sends to say

31
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:59,410
that her year-by-year the number of
samples here and there is growing at an

32
00:02:59,410 --> 00:03:05,880
outer space and it can be public
research there is a lack of the year at

33
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:13,829
quantitative analysis of the year in
Dallas at I mean we often see your

34
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,640
boards most and Manny

35
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,630
actually your interest and to bring to
or is actually the numbers and the

36
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:26,299
results of these in-depth research and
shared community so other researchers

37
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:33,920
can take a look at these results do
their personal differences and this is

38
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:38,720
something that very well with the
driving they're not too or this project

39
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:48,870
objectives of our of this year project
is that to demonstrate that it is

40
00:03:48,870 --> 00:03:59,220
possible to do more in depth her wearing
out this scalable so top I'd approach to

41
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:04,570
or we just sat at his ass and they're
widely used in the community and tried

42
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:12,519
tour as key over these here at the store
and distributed environment hit toward

43
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:17,220
evil tour processor many samples like
many samples in the research presented

44
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:18,739
to me liane 0

45
00:04:18,738 --> 00:04:24,560
over samples and of course will share
all the results but he can you teach it

46
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,400
to the IDB easier to the year howard
told this creates a plug-in suite

47
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,780
developed in this course of this
research and any additional information

48
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:47,349
about some important knowledge of all
the we concentrated our attention on 32

49
00:04:47,349 --> 00:04:55,909
bit and 64 beat by Reese didn't impose
any limitations on the sides of the ball

50
00:04:55,909 --> 00:05:02,250
where so we are analyzed samples as big
as your key to max and your as less as

51
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:08,819
their only fewer tools we are explicitly
put our preference to the amount where

52
00:05:08,819 --> 00:05:15,310
written in C++ because of the album
since we were using for this research is

53
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:20,530
the most they work and we have a serious
platform so that's why we are we are

54
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:29,250
targeting all the Microsoft Visual C++
walrus information about the year a

55
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:33,159
distributed environment actually was
presented it back at 2012 so we're not

56
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:36,830
going to speak bobby is here at this
presentation and if you're interested

57
00:05:36,830 --> 00:05:45,520
you can get that to the material and
learn how how it look like this is a

58
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,758
brief overview of the process so we have
several phases are we have court fees

59
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,460
for the first phase we were collecting
samples what it means killing themselves

60
00:05:55,460 --> 00:06:02,549
we had samples from multiple public
sources at and near the idea was to a

61
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:09,120
teen to me lands of samples are required
as it means that earlier Microsoft

62
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:16,770
Visual C++ 32 bit or 64 bit so we had to
process it that we more real person

63
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:22,539
involved 15 the awareness of samples and
their children out all the rest of the

64
00:06:22,539 --> 00:06:28,490
year by up to our collection 2002 2003
is this we're

65
00:06:28,490 --> 00:06:33,340
pipelined the samples in this connection
in the distributed over and and we

66
00:06:33,340 --> 00:06:37,310
started to pursue the information
extraction so actually be right idea Pro

67
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:46,520
Bowl the Cotton Bowl this creates a
ouija rated output data and then go

68
00:06:46,520 --> 00:06:50,969
there two phases combining agreed to
know there is also and generating

69
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:55,800
statistics in charge which will result
in this presentation and other important

70
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:03,370
thing is to say that we were considering
all the static analysis oh why did we

71
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:07,180
consider any outside because well
generally it is faster than do damned if

72
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:14,590
we don't have to take care setting up
executive are in football and in our

73
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:20,989
keys this is always want to hear design
criteria because we had all samples and

74
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:22,509
were limited here

75
00:07:22,509 --> 00:07:30,539
additional power yes we know that static
analysis is free on tour and it is and

76
00:07:30,539 --> 00:07:35,919
it reeks it has some limitations here
can be exploited by tomorrow we're

77
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:43,820
almost over and you're either pro's pro
and a nice tool to do this analysis and

78
00:07:43,820 --> 00:07:49,370
it there is it a lot of great scripts
and plugins here in the community toward

79
00:07:49,370 --> 00:07:58,590
to hear so let's talk about how we are
doing how we were doing this or what

80
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:04,229
kind of Alberta's and told me we're
using so or we were using primarily the

81
00:08:04,229 --> 00:08:11,110
intermediate representation to predict
which will be there to see tree so

82
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,710
basically see tree is the year

83
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:18,109
intermediate representation or decompile
I deplore

84
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:25,120
weaver tambien see trees for so I'd
appreciate nice functions we didn't

85
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,210
operate every function will explain
later why we were reconstructed

86
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:36,030
Microsoft Visual C++ types from the
virus and

87
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:44,059
escalation between the AM we also care
for and depth analysis see trees were

88
00:08:44,059 --> 00:08:46,069
down because it was really interesting
to know

89
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:53,250
ok Tennessee tree planted by only it's
it's interesting to know how deep in the

90
00:08:53,250 --> 00:09:01,380
call graph like what is the distance
from the entry point to the answer to

91
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:05,480
the secret because this information is
released from our analysis howdy doody

92
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:10,210
in to reach some interesting function
keys if you were developing simulator

93
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:16,870
how how deep do you need to Emily your
application to be able to resell

94
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:24,140
features and functionality we were also
detected and martini group two routines

95
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:28,819
which were using the hardware
instructions and get sick detection this

96
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:33,710
is a really interesting princess gets a
tour to understand how we're at it is

97
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:36,770
actually used in this instruction tour
the death toll

98
00:09:36,770 --> 00:09:43,380
environment and to aidid and other
topics which were recovering here is the

99
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:46,460
year using this point in the year

100
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:52,560
object oriented languages because
sometime parlors and even if we become

101
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,709
popular due to different optimization
their drinks this point there may be

102
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:02,940
used to using different registers ec EC
I EDI and it'll be interesting to know

103
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:10,010
ok how these are is used and it actually
this helped us to filter altered

104
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:19,390
Microsoft Visual C++ samples out of all
the collection will looks like I will

105
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:26,130
represent some limitations and your
designer Richie Rich which were using a

106
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:31,050
particular it could explore and see
trees and C++ types for doing different

107
00:10:31,050 --> 00:10:37,160
halcion and addicting so experienced our
wheat beer

108
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:43,430
analysis so the person is rather simple
we're americans throw a chance are

109
00:10:43,430 --> 00:10:48,290
recognized by the idea in the IDB year
we were obtained an intermediate

110
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:53,949
representation they're doing their trade
organization so basically we limited

111
00:10:53,949 --> 00:10:59,359
number of seats reprocess here like we
persist through a 60 tears all sizes

112
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:06,750
larger than their 160 hexadecimal up to
30 creep two routines and 30 other

113
00:11:06,750 --> 00:11:12,519
functions better than 60 balls so some
important notes here it all

114
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:20,529
justification of these numbers there is
no real safety thicker scientific proof

115
00:11:20,529 --> 00:11:25,459
for choosing these costs us make this
number swatches and empirically when

116
00:11:25,459 --> 00:11:30,529
we're experimenting in our research
doing it on their smaller and smaller

117
00:11:30,529 --> 00:11:37,639
sample set in sheer like how does this
feature because if we can get more

118
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:42,430
results will be a little bit more noise
year before last and you're not enough

119
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:50,019
data so we came up with you and your old
their results are presented in this

120
00:11:50,019 --> 00:11:55,939
research will depend on these numbers so
we were obtained in this number of see

121
00:11:55,939 --> 00:12:00,290
trees and reducing their ICT
normalization so normalization is down

122
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:06,730
to do a comparison of the sea trees you
can see a reference to the to the

123
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:10,399
implementation of dysfunction in the
source code of the plugin

124
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:15,410
Explorer which will you do to alter the
presentations are all the details about

125
00:12:15,410 --> 00:12:21,360
normalization because normalization is
actually removing all the information we

126
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:26,069
can introduce the industries in the
intermediate representation and

127
00:12:26,069 --> 00:12:32,630
basically only consider the structure of
the century and what can I do cross

128
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:38,500
correlation to see here are different in
some way but generally their control

129
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:46,740
flow if the sea will end up getting this
see more normal actrees

130
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:52,350
another approach which we did you get it
done paying their bills plus tax so

131
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:57,080
scared for their children table in the
bar area since we are targeting

132
00:12:57,080 --> 00:13:00,040
Microsoft Visual C++ compiler

133
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:05,010
we were looking for here and there was
virtual tables in the section Rd to end

134
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:08,709
date and if we didn't find anything in
this section we are going to be data

135
00:13:08,709 --> 00:13:14,790
section to look out for virtual table
sometimes while we're renamed the

136
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:21,029
section so we didn't find any data or
data section we're looking at other data

137
00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:31,220
sections after identifying virtual
tables with reconstructing types make

138
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:36,240
sure we're very using the construction
type I mean it's a structure

139
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:44,520
representation of this object to read it
also we were scattered throughout the

140
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:50,520
year I D beer for possible types
identifier instructors and using these

141
00:13:50,520 --> 00:14:02,260
contractors who are we doing this
research study tour only types which at

142
00:14:02,260 --> 00:14:05,270
least four members if they have it

143
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:11,910
fewer than four members then directing
this type the justification is pleased

144
00:14:11,910 --> 00:14:16,829
because you're an hour now we see your
we've seen a lot of her type species

145
00:14:16,829 --> 00:14:22,229
albeit one member I should be support
tool and you're there is a lot of them

146
00:14:22,230 --> 00:14:26,050
all throughout the collection so these
data are useless when it comes to

147
00:14:26,050 --> 00:14:32,130
finding similarities we were doing all
sorts of Sitra bit depth analysis where

148
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:32,870
to find it

149
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:38,020
ok we have a street called deputies from
the entry point in american Cross River

150
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:50,260
and Cesar recursively until we reach the
entry point or we're limited in that we

151
00:14:50,260 --> 00:14:57,319
would hope for what and who are using
that breadth first search felt herself

152
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:58,150
healthy

153
00:14:58,150 --> 00:15:06,510
and their families with all these things
from the and report in depth and

154
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:15,520
cross-references toward finding the
creep to correct instructions MPs sick

155
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:21,810
all we reason to pull an approach so
we're analyzing the executable sections

156
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:26,709
near a sexually the entry point you
Kaiser and reports boy so you're not

157
00:15:26,710 --> 00:15:32,650
applicable sections so this happened as
well and we were limiting their number

158
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:39,720
of the year there's this section so so
this section so we're spending all this

159
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,980
first half of the killer bait to this
section and leaders who dis and he was

160
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:53,720
very fast and we were just some
candidates if they receive their sound

161
00:15:53,720 --> 00:16:01,850
bad your not recognized all calls you
dear readers see his family and

162
00:16:01,850 --> 00:16:04,730
regarding p

163
00:16:04,730 --> 00:16:16,640
this point there use each year in the
samples so we used this approach to halt

164
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:21,150
the samples which are not relevant to
tell which are not Visual C++ so the

165
00:16:21,150 --> 00:16:27,180
idea was to sue check up to a first call
instructions entry point and then we

166
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:32,439
were scared and I proceeded instructions
for any manipulation really he seeks any

167
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:37,330
manipulation but eventually instructions
Lauderdale or so this isn't even more

168
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:42,980
construction law detective interesting
shops and then very confusing a

169
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:50,140
percentage of course we applauded he
seeks

170
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:56,050
Gabriel will show we did find some
crucial cost and when are these your

171
00:16:56,050 --> 00:17:03,400
goals and manipulated he sees is higher
than me sir caught up her constant this

172
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:07,849
sample is considered a smile

173
00:17:07,849 --> 00:17:18,149
now if you were to falter just to be
denied parole it was believed as you're

174
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:23,549
there is Lord a very huge December well
that's because it was designed for

175
00:17:23,549 --> 00:17:29,780
tripped over there is an interaction
between a user and December when he

176
00:17:29,780 --> 00:17:32,870
tried to kill this earth to do right to
bed smolder

177
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:42,189
surprise me here performance tool
probably because of the year

178
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:46,750
structure they differ materially used in
because you're like looking up some

179
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:53,190
functions or see a series or whatever
was it really really thought about the

180
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:57,330
same time there is some disadvantages
vez que was really complex down your

181
00:17:57,330 --> 00:18:02,139
gullet up any interest or in most of the
cases distrust trying to work with the

182
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:07,470
roads in and everyone else what what
this parameter is a call to end it so it

183
00:18:07,470 --> 00:18:11,630
was a little bit challenging and we were
able to achieve a good performance and

184
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:19,280
hardware on the other hand so I guess
you are using this platform because

185
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:28,149
you're the year there were some
particulars he should I am here at the

186
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:34,620
same time we're still not made to scale
because they were designed with a cold

187
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,309
or the year

188
00:18:35,309 --> 00:18:44,059
interactive analysis and here they were
targeting a single sample analysis while

189
00:18:44,059 --> 00:18:52,950
we were there so I think this is this
basically kind of the first part of the

190
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:59,110
presentation about our situation about
our catalog here and strains and

191
00:18:59,110 --> 00:19:04,860
algorithms and Ally mariposa word to get
real explain your who presented actually

192
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:08,389
the detailed statistics you up to this
research

193
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:18,810
right all the time constraints and all
that

194
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:24,240
detections they have a direct influence
on the numbers they did you guys see

195
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:30,670
this and you know what that means the
number so first up here we propose a

196
00:19:30,670 --> 00:19:36,180
wrong way to me tomorrow it's a unique
more samples do some basic commodities

197
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:41,990
on how much of that not packets and how
much of the number 206 snipers did not

198
00:19:41,990 --> 00:19:48,600
make it possible with all due six
appeared in the past and then get final

199
00:19:48,600 --> 00:19:55,870
researchers with decent for these
researchers have to pay microsoft Visual

200
00:19:55,870 --> 00:20:02,610
C++ samples due to the construction of
atoms which phone did not back yet

201
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:07,379
simple just analyzing samples to be
analyzed the same thing called many

202
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:15,630
times did not make it simple just 13
percent plus do this because that's what

203
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:20,780
did you think that detects with what
they all that the flour and is it worth

204
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:24,080
around 40% between fifty percent of all
the samples

205
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:33,210
much so often we can also get samples do
Sul ought to the study doesn't help that

206
00:20:33,210 --> 00:20:42,290
prevalent and some members much so well
tonight optimization solutions over

207
00:20:42,290 --> 00:20:52,379
tonight right and we hope that's likely
Christian so the question is among the

208
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:58,320
samples analyzed it just 18 stempel's
actually using using it and thanks to a

209
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:05,689
chance so choose stuck here because we
did have a very

210
00:21:05,690 --> 00:21:13,480
test and see what brings you to the next
elections were you expecting to see a

211
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:20,080
lot of approach and deal with it we got
a lot to halt negatives right either

212
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,960
perot was more effective in detecting
these independent so it was actually

213
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:34,919
created a lot of places to appreciate
did this year to person without thinking

214
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:44,919
and gets extra 60 strachan it actually
may be dependent on the hypervisor

215
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:48,889
behavior so let me get someone who's get
sick

216
00:21:48,889 --> 00:21:53,789
defeated print hypervisor or to detect
if you are already said that the machine

217
00:21:53,789 --> 00:22:03,120
and this case it is possible to use the
execution of this approach every trial

218
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:10,258
that four percent off all the symbols
used to get sick these looks so some

219
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:17,460
softball teams here even the same dates
did when you get sick because it isn't

220
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:23,990
this number we got to the object
orientation of these texts that movie

221
00:22:23,990 --> 00:22:33,809
sex before we got the police here will
be more prevalent in the 18th or for

222
00:22:33,809 --> 00:22:49,950
being so they put it off the coast of
any sex before Visual C++ impose so that

223
00:22:49,950 --> 00:23:00,200
all the tables have decided to stick
with almost no such sure that was before

224
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:06,740
the researchers late there this may or
may not be uprooted education that's

225
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:14,780
better for buyers and specific behaviors
of our

226
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:26,240
ok so now we got serious we didn't get
it has 285 more or less of me don't see

227
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:31,280
to it is what we put more while there is
still a shed have all of the information

228
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:45,820
with 45 just because the huge number so
he then repeated surgeries so easy to

229
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:50,659
40,000 repetitions is are all booked 42
percent and so on

230
00:23:50,660 --> 00:24:03,000
what did he get just the trees that got
some repetition easy to book 7602 Reese

231
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:15,830
precluded to us because now I just want
repeated situation

232
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:28,199
6776 personal stories so greedy
assisting their lives with all of the

233
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:38,150
other sexually covered so now I didn't
hear the percentage of the three-step

234
00:24:38,150 --> 00:24:48,100
repeated 2008 medium velocity is a major
so distracted this based in the PK if

235
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:58,270
you're not busy city so if someone is
gonna post or to remove this witness the

236
00:24:58,270 --> 00:25:08,750
correct operation so we notice that he's
got a petition and big majority had no

237
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:16,790
repetition scribe again these numbers eg
and officials established that she

238
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:19,889
better than in the previous section

239
00:25:19,890 --> 00:25:27,140
now that the other chapters we got to
see trees now let's get them out so we

240
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:35,750
thought that we had to have something
like nine personal fouls have at least

241
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:47,320
three so did number depending the
scenario before the characteristics are

242
00:25:47,320 --> 00:26:06,540
played for various scenarios ok so now
we've got right how much of this is

243
00:26:06,540 --> 00:26:12,460
quite a few days passed between the
anchor point and his business interests

244
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:27,280
and short notice that 44% we shall
appoint so now if the pressure right

245
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:38,350
what did depth to show us where our
strategic interest is located right so

246
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:47,020
that every step of the deceased was five
books you more or less

247
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:56,690
15 to 94043 me that they are five goals
with a division of 235 from the

248
00:26:56,690 --> 00:27:13,570
intertwined and also here is how it is
like they wanted it to be there was one

249
00:27:13,570 --> 00:27:20,139
of these numbers we can happen to seat
because probably

250
00:27:20,140 --> 00:27:25,560
dysfunction their record to be helpful
he said he should function go through

251
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,179
the stuff so

252
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:48,430
right how many parents have it means how
it functions are going to write that

253
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:59,450
here you see here is huge like it never
felt awesome people but then proceeded

254
00:27:59,450 --> 00:28:08,990
to be ghost town right and these were
the shots we have many other data we

255
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:15,120
have actually a huge information we get
all the provisions just just just got

256
00:28:15,120 --> 00:28:26,879
for you guys to talk to people and any
researcher can actually read the

257
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,960
database and do whatever you guys want
we did they try to predict they did all

258
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:38,020
this go on have the data you can do it
was ok for now and what they wanted to

259
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:46,400
talk about their bodies methodology in
my hour so this particular just bitching

260
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:53,910
about and that is this some target in
C++ power and reduce couple 5-4 reserved

261
00:28:53,910 --> 00:29:09,110
but said it was anymore for its meaning
you know and austere form so between the

262
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:20,340
cells it's interesting so far but
researchers already on our white Jesus

263
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:25,310
finally but we found something we should
not be presented before on the US

264
00:29:25,310 --> 00:29:26,610
conference

265
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:33,149
so cute that some references on the
researchers and costs vary widely by bar

266
00:29:33,150 --> 00:29:38,670
and do not develop a Visual C++ and you
hope to carry out the interface and

267
00:29:38,670 --> 00:29:41,549
technologists and you found it
interesting

268
00:29:41,549 --> 00:29:50,740
CEO Larry to defend you told they both
but looking on this screen shots its

269
00:29:50,740 --> 00:30:00,150
shops don't show a brutal tables by
Texas but the Explorer plugin hand here

270
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:07,070
as we try to show our approach the small
assets of the samples and needs to be

271
00:30:07,070 --> 00:30:13,379
some kind of 100 names though they will
support you can stop by my no one that

272
00:30:13,380 --> 00:30:20,380
is OK on the crossbar just one of those
tables

273
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:30,440
separate the two you know so OK and
customer and you know some interesting

274
00:30:30,440 --> 00:30:34,320
that took place on Wednesday and
stonings and lower into the system

275
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:48,309
interface and it's my chart and has four
options and here is the cost per and out

276
00:30:48,309 --> 00:30:49,330
of deletion

277
00:30:49,330 --> 00:30:55,399
it's deleted my comment from CNC and
caused us dream about us so we have some

278
00:30:55,400 --> 00:31:04,740
restrictions in our approach and the
dogs dogs we're told tables for you

279
00:31:04,740 --> 00:31:12,490
don't meet us and so

280
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:24,350
share them some comparison exactly and
how so if you're walking around key in

281
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:32,000
custody are created to two different
option and did not create the same

282
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:42,440
interface while by one culture so if we
reconstructed tags but critics by the

283
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:52,160
Explorer plugin it's over and it's
exactly and shortest time limitation by

284
00:31:52,160 --> 00:32:00,610
our window on its ok let's try to find
some similarities between others to know

285
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:08,320
place and we took in the same way we use
it for this market research the same

286
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,939
tools and talking is saying that the OJ
and cocaine here it's helped some

287
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:16,630
similarities between tables in the
different number

288
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:26,470
ok and also all the names because it's
my new functionality of pics a Ford

289
00:32:26,470 --> 00:32:36,380
Explorer I can reach some construction
but they tell you already here and they

290
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:45,679
do so and looking deeply into the
constructors object for Edina and then

291
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:54,380
brought this increase con center and get
the call and provide some information to

292
00:32:54,380 --> 00:33:06,080
comments enter from the infected machine
and reconstructed types from the

293
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:13,379
Explorer and we can see this type so
very similar and our algorithm detects

294
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:19,630
it lowered and its looks like our
approach it's working and it's really

295
00:33:19,630 --> 00:33:22,020
good

296
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:27,520
files it see our new Cingular create the
object and you can start to bite the

297
00:33:27,520 --> 00:33:34,190
Explorer plugin and its detect
similarities into the car so definitely

298
00:33:34,190 --> 00:33:42,200
discuss this kind of similar to school
not just got nothing just just discussed

299
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:48,940
similarities between Copts and it's not
going for a new song sometimes do you

300
00:33:48,940 --> 00:34:03,860
attribute and in this case yes its share
the connection between

301
00:34:03,860 --> 00:34:12,779
which recognize it and found in five
borrowers and it's a connection between

302
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:17,350
this model if you look here you can
client you up to

303
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:23,449
between different interfaces and your
radio show called

304
00:34:23,449 --> 00:34:30,730
Bhutto tables down by here so it's good
Explorer so and other final results of

305
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:42,869
the Sun out of it it's alright the
previous slide show many similarities

306
00:34:42,869 --> 00:34:52,790
befallen who each other this setup them
out and in our opinion it's pretty much

307
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:59,619
interesting method to found some
connection between you and your way to

308
00:34:59,619 --> 00:35:13,170
you show up their Asian so something
quite so clear to conclusion of our tall

309
00:35:13,170 --> 00:35:21,090
and we have some some interesting
information after all so so cute

310
00:35:21,090 --> 00:35:27,430
conclude our though yes or basically we
made it almost to the end of this

311
00:35:27,430 --> 00:35:36,460
presentation just to recap what we were
speaking today about so we have

312
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:44,220
basically start to do in a distributed
large-scale in-depth analysis using IDE

313
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:51,810
approval which was like from personal
experience was very challenging because

314
00:35:51,810 --> 00:35:57,190
the year I dip role he was designed to
you minded tour interactive

315
00:35:57,190 --> 00:36:02,900
interacting with a researcher and here
we tried to put it in earlier that

316
00:36:02,900 --> 00:36:08,849
no do it without a year dialects and
without any interconnection the rain

317
00:36:08,849 --> 00:36:17,420
plugins and scripts in the same
environment so well surprisingly it was

318
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:23,359
it worked well because we were thinking
how do we have more problems with a

319
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:29,440
sander the performance we obtained or is
it was really interesting because you're

320
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:34,339
I'm not sure if they mentioned here we
had in our research team machines here

321
00:36:34,339 --> 00:36:42,619
eight cores machine and we were able to
run fifty IDA Pro instances are ashamed

322
00:36:42,619 --> 00:36:50,470
so until we were riding in federal 500 I
deploy distances so this that was quite

323
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:56,720
impressive and we would like also toured
bring attention of the year I deplore

324
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:03,740
plugin developer store like a call to
action toward added batch person to your

325
00:37:03,740 --> 00:37:08,229
blog in store to select a beer
integrations it their integration tour

326
00:37:08,230 --> 00:37:16,789
this area distributed it out and all the
other hand if you want or rather your

327
00:37:16,789 --> 00:37:23,119
plan on the large data say it on the
large set of samples please let us know

328
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,140
because that's what beer

329
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:34,140
interesting experience you can like that
stress test your blogging now we r reply

330
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:42,460
guess we were discovering that you eat a
lot of implementation which really

331
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:49,440
helped to prove improve the hotel they
could and of course we will share

332
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:54,130
results of the survey test two with the
community because these researches

333
00:37:54,130 --> 00:38:00,900
public and all the results will be
shared so all the resources of

334
00:38:00,900 --> 00:38:10,809
representations of this presentation
slides are correct data IDs will be made

335
00:38:10,809 --> 00:38:14,160
available so are pleased each year and
this lady

336
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:20,190
well we have a lot of detail I think
about several terabytes of the IDPs so

337
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:25,660
we are still figuring out logistics how
tour to provide this a tear to use or if

338
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:30,520
you have any suggestions please feel
free to drop so I can do to help us in

339
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:36,470
this so that would be a very very much
appreciated and this interest in this

340
00:38:36,470 --> 00:38:43,109
research or your significantly improved
year the year or explore plugging and we

341
00:38:43,109 --> 00:38:47,740
will be releasing a black cat addition
we are a lot of improvements

342
00:38:47,740 --> 00:38:52,740
well one of the main features this
finally Chris platform so you can come

343
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:58,490
pilot before we do plants but it's too
important to note that this plugin will

344
00:38:58,490 --> 00:39:03,479
be targeted all year Microsoft Visual
C++ hour-by-hour is because this is the

345
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:08,500
only thing we are using its able to ride
in the amount we were used in this

346
00:39:08,500 --> 00:39:13,869
research so you can basically get this
compile everybody is this research data

347
00:39:13,869 --> 00:39:24,049
if you acknowledge in 20 you elect
explicitly say thank you to all a good

348
00:39:24,049 --> 00:39:30,880
phone up 630 team and community over
your plugin developers could get officer

349
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:35,900
obvious because here without their
support previous research had not

350
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:43,890
existed and in the sharemarket wait I
would like to announce that they prove

351
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:44,799
the year

352
00:39:44,799 --> 00:39:50,150
kids in Boots Kids is available now in
their own excess so this is co-authored

353
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:58,690
by a mere ultimate Rosoff and in other
researchers here D practice so in this

354
00:39:58,690 --> 00:40:06,359
book we summarized it all our experience
we accumulated over the years while

355
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:10,470
working in the security industry and
into reverse in the approved kids

356
00:40:10,470 --> 00:40:16,038
include kiss so where is this book is
available at this URL it is it's in

357
00:40:16,039 --> 00:40:23,190
excess we're still working on it and we
will really appreciate any feedback on

358
00:40:23,190 --> 00:40:26,119
this boot what you would like to see
your voice you would like

359
00:40:26,119 --> 00:40:31,999
to act like a chapter is available there
is a table of contents and where we

360
00:40:31,999 --> 00:40:38,269
really looking forward to a year to the
feedback and that's about it

361
00:40:38,269 --> 00:40:56,839
thank you for attention I think we have
enough time to take some questions

362
00:40:56,839 --> 00:41:04,690
thanks for a great dark so what if you
can give me give some information about

363
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:10,200
the time required to process it million
samples and what kind of architecture

364
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:14,279
you had I thought you did present
tomorrow mister phillis part of it upset

365
00:41:14,279 --> 00:41:21,859
you could say it again so radical should
also to speak about how much time did

366
00:41:21,859 --> 00:41:30,229
you take and all the architecture of the
serious I think this question may be

367
00:41:30,229 --> 00:41:38,410
handled by Gabriel Rodriguez

368
00:41:38,410 --> 00:42:01,399
what kind of course memory could it have
any idea why she has around 16 gigs of

369
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:08,660
memory and eight course but each 04
deeds

370
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:21,799
how long did it take to process all the
samples this 1.5 days when and how much

371
00:42:21,799 --> 00:42:29,119
is a storage cleared so much discretion
it to store all the results I don't have

372
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:38,860
the permission not wrong to that or
something but thanks

373
00:42:38,860 --> 00:42:43,150
gets a construction you said that you
saw four percent of the machines

374
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:48,030
actually using gets sorry 4 percent of
them overusing get sick I missed the

375
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:51,940
part more you saying that you looked
into it and you can't remember that some

376
00:42:51,940 --> 00:42:56,690
definitely we're using it as like a
signature and IBM signature something

377
00:42:56,690 --> 00:43:02,730
what do you say you just hadn't looked
into that further yeah actually do they

378
00:43:02,730 --> 00:43:10,710
get tax deductions on the right approach
that we know that because it was not

379
00:43:10,710 --> 00:43:17,570
expecting that much what it did for
decades before all the oldies music

380
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:25,050
samples samples actually around 200
samples and we should get sick in the

381
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:31,080
samples for disabled athletes we all
know we open to double check fraud that

382
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:39,870
he was also found a function using get
sick and also found it

383
00:43:39,870 --> 00:43:43,930
dysfunction he scored mir leid organizes
a function by a pro

384
00:43:43,930 --> 00:43:56,339
confirmed it on 100 samples so we should
write and we don't know which these

385
00:43:56,340 --> 00:44:02,520
techniques 20 a more to actually go to a
simple and deepen our lives to

386
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:13,710
understand if you just look at more than
I did using get sick or not these early

387
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:21,190
on you stated that you only allies pack
unpacked portable executable so

388
00:44:21,190 --> 00:44:27,530
initially did you was there an automated
means to compare the size on disk the

389
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:35,330
virtual size or to use either pro
somehow to determine whether or not it

390
00:44:35,330 --> 00:44:45,430
yes that's ok

391
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:55,348
so and yes deported when I shareholders
what to do I think very much
