1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,339
good morning welcome to Black Hat 2015
day to just a couple of quick

2
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:08,500
announcements before we start if can
stop by the business holding shoreline

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:13,049
aid of a sponsored sessions in theaters
ANB be sure to check out the Black Cat

4
00:00:13,049 --> 00:00:19,900
Osterman breakers de J K and sponsored
workshops are in Mandalay J K and L

5
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:26,400
you are here you are in the Jasmine
boren for the session the applications

6
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,400
of these learning on traffic
identification if that's not what you

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:33,790
intend to be now is your chance to get
to a you intend to be if you put your

8
00:00:33,790 --> 00:00:55,940
phone on vibrate it'd be very much
appreciated thank you I'm glad to stand

9
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:57,730
here today

10
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:05,600
talk about applications running on
traffic identification of birth of our

11
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:12,500
place let me introduce myself and the
information processing PhD for several

12
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:20,430
years I have worked for the largest
telecom operator of the world's C&C see

13
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:27,830
now that I magnin researcher at qihoo
360 which is the largest Internet

14
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:37,020
security company in China how come you
reach experience of machine learning and

15
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:44,720
devote myself to the problem of
cybersecurity by machine learning and

16
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:51,850
they have many as the house there in
their colleagues our team because they

17
00:01:51,850 --> 00:01:59,289
had raised in security now we started on
the go and that is the Planning

18
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:05,640
Commission and nominate detection ok

19
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:09,580
and the contents are met hark are as
follows

20
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:19,140
first our records packed their
identification to explain who are you

21
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:25,700
planning briefly next introduced a
typical applications of our achievement

22
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:37,450
such as coal gasification unknown caller
identification and application

23
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:40,829
identification at last

24
00:02:40,830 --> 00:02:46,120
conclusions and future

25
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:54,250
identification of cybersecurity accurate
merging traffic trooper echoes

26
00:02:54,250 --> 00:03:01,440
applications it's important for network
management nominee detection and so are

27
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:09,540
we all know some traditional measure is
based on special are predefined path

28
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:21,899
such as standard HTTP part is the part
part of our is 443 however if a party is

29
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:26,130
irregular has never appeared it doesn't
work at all

30
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:36,970
anonymous their own signature features
Jimbo's counter this is amazing and

31
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:43,280
several security experts from static
dynamic and distinguish bowl features

32
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:51,480
but is very time-consuming and
labor-intensive also the signatures will

33
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:52,819
be invited

34
00:03:52,819 --> 00:04:02,540
have been proposed new not standard
recently some people had to have an

35
00:04:02,540 --> 00:04:08,560
automatic ways to identify changes they
want to leave the work of generating

36
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,180
rules and decisions to the computer this
procedure urinate includes three parts

37
00:04:14,180 --> 00:04:18,590
first correct useful features as many as
possible

38
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:23,729
it always need to compute the disco

39
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:35,240
associated costs such as that term in 20
between Packers packaged and so on

40
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:45,240
truth machine learning though most
popular mother is that is because they

41
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:53,090
can get through the work of
classification as Jenny rage expresses

42
00:04:53,090 --> 00:05:02,400
its rules for I didn't fade in the last
two model outputs predict results in the

43
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:09,080
whole process the difficulty is how to
choose appropriate measures it always

44
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:17,880
depends on experience that several
security experts

45
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,820
so is there anybody is needed

46
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:30,409
various community features in some and
supervised to raise their minds think of

47
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:38,540
learning artificial intelligence many
people have known the power of the

48
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:49,580
burning in the field of vision take part
in image recognition features should be

49
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:57,109
defined and instruct extract human that
feature extraction is very complicated

50
00:05:57,110 --> 00:06:04,790
now researchers used a burning
acknowledged the features can be learned

51
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:14,530
by machine very easy for original
feature too deeply are featured as tears

52
00:06:14,530 --> 00:06:24,650
to the eyes nose and eyes that some
fissures I learned the worst features in

53
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:31,250
speech and the semantic features in
nature of language processing also

54
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:37,960
successfully achieved by the learning
and loose amazing right

55
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:46,090
traffic identification so what I really
enjoyed it was related to our work

56
00:06:46,090 --> 00:06:54,000
because it has too many aspects and
explained by it can be used in our topic

57
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,500
ok

58
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:04,210
the basic learning hierarchical
structure that basically you need is

59
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:05,489
your own

60
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:12,120
there are at least a three-person the
structure and about them is they are

61
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:19,480
children present to import data I don't
they are in the middle of cool air into

62
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:24,880
prediction each pair of neighboring
layers it's connected because tomato

63
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:27,159
connection parameter W

64
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:33,470
the so-called chaining it's catching on
said home Optimo W near us in the same

65
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:45,220
day or are not connected to your network
I think there is a type of hearing that

66
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:52,580
we are at also has a rockfall structure
the difference is only heightened their

67
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:55,550
both in shifting

68
00:07:55,550 --> 00:08:02,050
outward bayer is added call with input
layer you can consider that the function

69
00:08:02,050 --> 00:08:07,290
is to restart important information as
much as possible

70
00:08:07,290 --> 00:08:21,130
is comprised information that is now
here's a classic brass classic

71
00:08:21,130 --> 00:08:29,690
experiment based on the left is pictured
includes hundreds more images his image

72
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:42,599
is $110 029 we've had trained them there
until reduced to certain costs there is

73
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:52,430
out and read picture they look like the
idea of the number maybe you can see

74
00:08:52,430 --> 00:09:01,219
what really is but her that's the
features for identifying these people

75
00:09:01,220 --> 00:09:09,750
didn't pretty fine shape is youthful
they are learned been accompanied her

76
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:18,410
if we stock several models as well be
decked out in cold air the height of the

77
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:27,510
cold air intake of the later on the
output layers of older laptop after

78
00:09:27,510 --> 00:09:32,860
often called her is generated

79
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:42,620
holder is their own especially those
nato differential such as the radially

80
00:09:42,620 --> 00:09:48,770
revised training and fine-tuning we will
spend time at a medico their revision

81
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:57,180
just know the structure and the process
there's enough ok we talked about not

82
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:05,130
background but we use it for sure there
is a relationship back to the digit

83
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:06,240
number

84
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:15,320
example is composed of pixels there's a
number six because because they are

85
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:25,260
great images for coming here are the
pics 0 from 0 to 255 our pillows in the

86
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:33,950
range of natural is 60 Lexi decimal
numbers after transforming her

87
00:10:33,950 --> 00:10:45,620
transformed to strain your phone died
Wednesday of course they represent 256

88
00:10:45,620 --> 00:10:54,240
characters taking distance it's very
similar to the image so it is it is a

89
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:01,680
reasonable earnings

90
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:12,099
to theatres and is training stage now
there is identifying stage like to see

91
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:18,250
people on the internet and associated
data of those things flow from multi

92
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:25,529
pockets for training data sampling is
necessary because of the large

93
00:11:25,529 --> 00:11:35,220
after transformation deep learning model
that can be deeply run at work that I

94
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:38,690
think older and so on

95
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:50,630
of testing data by the 10 weeks later on
I first used EPO clusters of their own

96
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:59,010
for raising the training speed we use
AMD high-performance grave graphic cars

97
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:05,709
coaching time is reduced to less than
three hours

98
00:12:05,709 --> 00:12:13,079
identification

99
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:37,260
and it will take several days just above
my machine at this sketch map show that

100
00:12:37,260 --> 00:12:44,150
have divided and put it into a modern
machines at first it's machine has

101
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:54,250
apparently there is a tab for gallery
and distribute p.m. parameter is the

102
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:57,520
parametered is that I just hope

103
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:12,689
parameter do and he's so the problem by
multi machines CPU and let's get into

104
00:13:12,690 --> 00:13:19,630
details we put upload and download
ultimate don't know they have

105
00:13:19,630 --> 00:13:29,360
alternately Dakota transformed to a long
sequence don't become a decimal

106
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:39,590
to go back to her pieces of data center
input layer the mother has changed

107
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:48,090
baghdad misérables and tested it snow
levels we can see outflows aeroflot

108
00:13:48,090 --> 00:14:00,200
numbers that are and how candid product
in general has caused that the numbers

109
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:02,150
bilities

110
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:10,720
if the number is 022 now it seems is big
enough so it's highly unlikely belongs

111
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,190
to us

112
00:14:14,190 --> 00:14:21,750
there are two ways to product if
logistic regression is concerned we can

113
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:33,560
take the medicine has also because that
hurts I saw such as there are also very

114
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:42,680
important i buy rejected take the
greater than the threshold they both in

115
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:50,959
this case maybe modern was unable to
load the other is the Maxima version is

116
00:14:50,960 --> 00:15:01,730
that is attached to some of the value is
always the same as the prediction

117
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:19,440
because a GDP is very traditional way so
we don't take into account the table

118
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:21,450
yesterday procedure on top

119
00:15:21,450 --> 00:15:33,560
told him popular product caused greater
than zero to see the table

120
00:15:33,560 --> 00:15:38,130
for those at the top as Mb

121
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:44,960
DCE RPC that was and TDIC has a
preseason

122
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:50,720
hundred-percent if we don't care either
reassure Arab critical to our our

123
00:15:50,720 --> 00:16:00,250
precision precision exceeds 99% in this
magic our message is as good as Basel

124
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:12,529
parts teenagers are turning on popular
machine unpopular persona non grata are

125
00:16:12,529 --> 00:16:19,070
most ardent fine particles in
traditional raise some red card labeled

126
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:29,130
by anon it means that are not here for
predefined draws so they can't be

127
00:16:29,130 --> 00:16:36,930
identified in media city we need truth
10,000 from this country where it

128
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:46,530
becomes the oldest English more than 60%
of the number and reassure those that

129
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:56,600
are picked out a book that's another
highlight a treatment

130
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:03,050
as we talk about besides identification

131
00:17:03,050 --> 00:17:12,409
automatic visual learning is also
possible degree of importance for

132
00:17:12,410 --> 00:17:24,329
original feature that have gone to get
deep into so let's see

133
00:17:24,329 --> 00:17:31,629
automatic learning result directly
figure A&B leads to the distribution of

134
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:38,909
top 10 teams and top hundred important
features it is a premier city that the

135
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:45,659
payload at home in the france very
important for identification from the

136
00:17:45,659 --> 00:17:48,240
Derby weekend CMOS available

137
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:56,429
fisher's to the head of distribution

138
00:17:56,429 --> 00:18:01,570
there's another feature of these are
figures the DRC shows the distribution

139
00:18:01,570 --> 00:18:08,689
of the most teachers that contrasted
this kind of features they on the tail

140
00:18:08,690 --> 00:18:14,580
of the payload base in the past we need
experts to decide which picture is

141
00:18:14,580 --> 00:18:20,769
beautiful and heart does it really work
now the problem has been sold by the

142
00:18:20,769 --> 00:18:28,039
learning these results testified dad
machine can take the place of people in

143
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:35,490
some special

144
00:18:35,490 --> 00:18:40,720
borrower people earning more though also
performs during bill identifying

145
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:49,520
applications be recalled the process
names and TCP flow data we used it said

146
00:18:49,520 --> 00:19:00,110
her as training data and also true deep
learning model the mother can be thirty

147
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:17,229
of them quarter after many times of
intimidation of Education accurate

148
00:19:17,230 --> 00:19:27,790
800 applications and identify and they
both did her performance is very

149
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:37,570
significant to the table this country
and these recisions maybe there are some

150
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:47,980
different from here but some of the
popular there are you folks mail fax me

151
00:19:47,980 --> 00:20:05,740
the procedure is 100% and extra work I
and saw ABA is called but most of them

152
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:20,620
are work 2012 the procedure is 96.3%

153
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:21,560
ok

154
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:28,129
some rights of work we introduce the
applications of depending on traffic

155
00:20:28,130 --> 00:20:44,550
identification and automatic feature and
application our contribution to us fax

156
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:52,480
line is reduced workload of the experts
people no longer need to instruct her

157
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,440
features but himself

158
00:20:54,440 --> 00:21:01,090
yeah there is also the problem of
computing and big data

159
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:04,330
the nasdaq

160
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:12,540
applying the model is the version of
your network to improved procedures of

161
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:24,700
identifying applications and encrypt
have expected learning ok then sorry if

162
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:31,430
you are you in the content priests over
be back by electronic evaluation your

email them to you

164
00:21:55,840 --> 00:23:27,379
be true change

165
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:47,090
feature and the rise and prices of
course that's supplies

166
00:23:47,090 --> 00:24:02,149
application

167
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:26,450
maybe that's according to the data may
be different with your view our troops

168
00:24:26,450 --> 00:24:36,039
different parameter

169

and they are

170
00:25:01,610 --> 00:25:10,770
Armada

171
00:25:10,770 --> 00:25:24,740
that you are not not the real Joshua

172
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:39,540
we have enough is enough to reverse its
large enough
