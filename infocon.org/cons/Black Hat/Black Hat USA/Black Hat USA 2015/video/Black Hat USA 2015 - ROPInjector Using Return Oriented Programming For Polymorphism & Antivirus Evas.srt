1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,820
so without further ado here to see you
rock band director using returned

2
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:13,190
oriented program for polymorphism in
haiti invasion and when my name is

3
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:17,800
construction like you so I'm going to be
sent you a new tone that we have

4
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:23,670
developed in the University of Wales
robbins actor Brian and this is joining

5
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:30,020
work of my colleagues Jorge Luis and
what is actually read online programming

6
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:37,360
representation techniques that allows an
attacker to execute a sequence of us

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:44,010
instruction name gadgets it's God's it
is a moral code that ends with

8
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:50,720
instruction or is there a sequence of
shots got it in a bag to perform our

9
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:56,260
military operation is at the core class
as you can see in the photo

10
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:04,220
what does the objectives we open the
objective of our research up to now has

11
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:09,400
been mainly used to bypass the nynex
academy member of defense mechanism than

12
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:17,880
honest that in this war we propose as a
polymorphic at their nothing and in

13
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:24,399
order to achieve antivirus evasion to
see an example we have one portable

14
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:31,729
execution executable and one well-known
sailboat and with our tool we create

15
00:01:31,729 --> 00:01:37,440
many different variations of the
portable execution that bypasses the

16
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:45,270
antivirus protection I want to see how
it works it takes a bit annoying for the

17
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:52,340
execution and then well known my word
thanks for the benign portable execution

18
00:01:52,340 --> 00:01:59,159
and ensure them I'll work within the
portable executable and we're not sure

19
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:04,420
if it is only four hits

20
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:14,370
why used widely used programming for a
device division called and this means

21
00:02:14,370 --> 00:02:23,050
there's not raise any suspicious brain
might be the instruction that we used to

22
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:28,810
put the address you got into the stock
market will see later how we'll proceed

23
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:37,370
with this issue may dash for any given
sent called to a base equivalent so this

24
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:45,420
is an Eric Holder genetic code and it
may use different group gathered all the

25
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:52,149
same something different dresses to
performance bike show more amorphous

26
00:02:52,150 --> 00:03:00,989
let's have a quick overview of them are
you were evolution and violence

27
00:03:00,989 --> 00:03:09,359
initially the modern world contains
plain cold and the antivirus huge

28
00:03:09,359 --> 00:03:17,730
signature shoe in order to detect the
scope than we have simplification and to

29
00:03:17,730 --> 00:03:25,048
detect them I would then divided use
regular expression after that we have

30
00:03:25,049 --> 00:03:30,090
more which is encryption the Muslim
world

31
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:38,060
encrypted selves and then divided
shooting analysis and 64 right I'm

32
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:43,019
reconstruction to they expect to the
portable execution to find possible

33
00:03:43,019 --> 00:03:47,730
malware and finally we have self
modifying code which is named

34
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:53,660
metamorphism which we will be their
mother would replace instruction to

35
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:59,760
other set of instructions and third
image using dynamic analysis and

36
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:06,069
behavior-based signature what are the
challenges of our first of all the new

37
00:04:06,069 --> 00:04:14,200
result in portable execution should have
a reminder that action then the portable

38
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,519
executioner produced probably execution

39
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:22,870
should not be corrupt or damaged the
torsion beam generic and automate it and

40
00:04:22,870 --> 00:04:23,840
should not required

41
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:28,789
writable code section to mutate because
this is an alarm for the end of Irish

42
00:04:28,789 --> 00:04:38,509
lets the steps of our to first of all he
has finalized the self-taught then have

43
00:04:38,509 --> 00:04:45,139
to find out from Gaza and the portable
execution then plans for the cell called

44
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:53,849
to the only to the equivalent obtained
in the missing if required if somebody

45
00:04:53,849 --> 00:04:57,960
is not agree with the possible exception
we have to inject it within the possible

46
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:02,969
execution without raising any other I
simply there our team building called to

47
00:05:02,970 --> 00:05:12,969
the portable execution and then parts
the new five let's analyze first let's

48
00:05:12,969 --> 00:05:20,080
analyze the first so-called analysis all
the necessary information in order to

49
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,719
safely replace the Central News
direction we've got it for its

50
00:05:25,719 --> 00:05:29,509
construction of the shellcode

51
00:05:29,509 --> 00:05:34,449
our tuning in to know what alleged it
reads arrived on set what direction are

52
00:05:34,449 --> 00:05:35,009
free

53
00:05:35,009 --> 00:05:39,719
modified its business where there's a
brown and if it's a branch worried

54
00:05:39,719 --> 00:05:47,130
glance whether there's a pretty sure if
it contains the dressing and whether it

55
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:54,819
use indirect addressing more we don't
like scale in the Bible structure why

56
00:05:54,819 --> 00:05:59,650
because it conflicts the use complex
indirect addressing much destruction

57
00:05:59,650 --> 00:06:07,849
like this one we don't we don't show why
we don't like them because they are long

58
00:06:07,849 --> 00:06:15,550
more than three months it is unlikely to
find gadgets with Greece instructions

59
00:06:15,550 --> 00:06:24,539
are rarely reusable so we don't need
them and at least two religious so what

60
00:06:24,539 --> 00:06:27,710
we're doing we have developed

61
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:36,380
procedural functionname unruly and what
this does this function it replaced the

62
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:44,800
complex function will see here we're
simply set of instructions can be found

63
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:50,450
it easier show we can only wear to
increase chances of finding suitable

64
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:58,110
Gaza and we have listened to be injected
the bottom execution so we have charter

65
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:10,150
instruction and reusable gadgets a
second step we want to find some guys in

66
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:18,460
the boardroom electrocution so first we
we search for intense instruction I have

67
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:23,580
a used three option of returns to action
the portability and then we set

68
00:07:23,580 --> 00:07:34,490
backwards for about 20 miles to find
candidate gadgets are automatically and

69
00:07:34,490 --> 00:07:40,220
is also remember destruction in Gaza
north of course during the rope chain

70
00:07:40,220 --> 00:07:49,210
execution it maximize usability of the
phone Gaza and a halt to inject and safe

71
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:56,859
from God yet which are safe from Gaza
modify non-free register at branches and

72
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:02,200
I do the stock or modified this be a
privilege or use indirect addressing

73
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:10,800
more now let's see how would transform
the so-called to that obtained without

74
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,900
distractions

75
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:20,080
media representation is an obstacle that
we use for matching then without a

76
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:28,070
partial refund is a portable execution
20 min media representation and then we

77
00:08:28,070 --> 00:08:34,860
found a mapping between these two
intermediate representation either 11 or

78
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,849
12 men

79
00:08:37,849 --> 00:08:44,279
this is a snapshot of intermediate
representation what this will take all

80
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:53,959
the similar structure and we've group in
group in with group them in different

81
00:08:53,959 --> 00:09:07,969
classes which we use them for mapping
let's see this Gordon structure which

82
00:09:07,970 --> 00:09:16,850
belongs to this type of action and this
is the gods on the portable execution

83
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:22,019
also belong to the same group action

84
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:32,690
one-to-one mapping now we have this
instruction and guidance actual

85
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:39,990
character and you can see we have one
too many 122 which means we call the

86
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:49,420
gadget twice in order to replace the
cellphone instruction know what happened

87
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:55,500
if the portable executions does not
include the required classes if we

88
00:09:55,500 --> 00:10:05,620
simply put up god's it this week of
sequential retirement instructions show

89
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:15,500
we want our 22 in center of God in a
benign looking way and to do this we use

90
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:21,860
the case in the txt section of the
portable execution which is which are

91
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:33,120
adding spacious left my little let's see
an example this is the missing gods and

92
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:40,899
ended in the slack show when shared

93
00:10:40,899 --> 00:10:50,660
the instructions in red as as you may
not this game is reduced but without any

94
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:58,360
show we have the normal flow of the
problem and we have all sure there are

95
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:05,999
the program last two steps

96
00:11:05,999 --> 00:11:13,819
five and six have to assembly and parts
into the portable execution five we have

97
00:11:13,819 --> 00:11:19,569
to ensure that the cold tile loans that
are obtained into the stack using pushes

98
00:11:19,569 --> 00:11:25,469
traction and the step 6 would have to
extend it takes the section and repair

99
00:11:25,470 --> 00:11:33,910
and relocation I want to recruit two
different modes to different method to

100
00:11:33,910 --> 00:11:40,610
pass the control of the net to represent
coat around fast which is which

101
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:50,429
surrounds more suspicious or land run
last with the results here is the code

102
00:11:50,429 --> 00:11:56,149
before the injection and here is the
code after injection you can see the

103
00:11:56,149 --> 00:12:10,189
actual file is extent say we have to
modify the extra memory in order to 25

104
00:12:10,189 --> 00:12:18,529
to be able to operate and if we find a
certificate and we recalculate

105
00:12:18,529 --> 00:12:29,019
protection as I said there are two
options to control to the money we won

106
00:12:29,019 --> 00:12:37,129
his first round first which race alarms
and we have two steals and the second is

107
00:12:37,129 --> 00:12:43,339
around last which isn't very very nice
up actually we find we tried to find

108
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:51,690
exit process and then we put before the
execution of the month

109
00:12:51,690 --> 00:13:08,510
we have used and tested using my bottom
ext not very not very well known

110
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:21,300
portable execution application like five
or so we have carry out a combination of

111
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:26,689
scenarios like we have tests the
original file without any parting

112
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:29,760
nothing an option

113
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:36,860
send code is executed at the exit of the
bottom of the portable version I sent

114
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:44,490
gold intact without any modification
that is also executed at the exit of the

115
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:50,260
portable execution and this is the third
case wasn't very very interesting

116
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:58,490
results and other scenarios that option
board execute first after in the age of

117
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:10,110
30 seconds and the said won't impact for
our evaluation we have two very popular

118
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:21,300
payloads that is the situation and the
metabolism and we have our transform

119
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:30,339
lives a portable execution to the voters
total includes undue reliance here is

120
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:40,850
the desire for the reserve should be
sale as you can see with great is that

121
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:51,040
contains no virus passed on from all the
violence with barry we have the rope

122
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:59,150
access our the outcome of our way
through to send boat and activates the

123
00:14:59,150 --> 00:15:03,620
same foot during the exit of the
portable execution as you can see we

124
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,640
have a proper

125
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:10,560
committee investor

126
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:19,300
we have the third but we have a cell
phone without any modification that is

127
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:24,660
executed during the exit procedure of
the part of the problem and this is

128
00:15:24,660 --> 00:15:36,030
surprised to see this result when we are
at the beginning of the program after a

129
00:15:36,030 --> 00:15:41,089
delay of 27th I can say that about 250

130
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:45,940
there's always about fifty 50 percent
show I'm not ready creating and defining

131
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:59,600
the red one is the same boat itself this
for them and it should be even better if

132
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:09,990
we are to leave at most of the cases
100% we bypass anti-violence detection

133
00:16:09,990 --> 00:16:22,510
on average we have ninety-nine 4471 the
outcome of this war signature made that

134
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:31,800
they can be bypassed my techniques like
Rob so we have we propose

135
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:40,689
in this is war behavior analysis
techniques like running right before the

136
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:48,709
exit process and section and
certificates provide full protection as

137
00:16:48,709 --> 00:16:55,750
we see we may regard we can recalculate
on the occasion

138
00:16:55,750 --> 00:17:03,760
nothing couple our proposal now come up
this early outcome of this work because

139
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:08,920
it's a work in progress we propose the
engagement of certificates and texture

140
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:15,140
the enhancement of behavior analysis and
the execution last but not least the

141
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:23,809
execution of behavior analysis and then
until the program really shocked this is

142
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:32,450
the presentation of my thank you very
much

143
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:59,519
the lights on your team riding the
shellcode in your hand

144
00:17:59,519 --> 00:18:05,559
intermediate representation to make it
even easier probably a lot of work

145
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:29,510
actually we have we made some test to
see how effective but try and see more

146
00:18:29,510 --> 00:18:54,559
issue in this area

147
00:18:54,559 --> 00:19:03,279
hi I'm just a quick question regarding
your some results do you know why

148
00:19:03,279 --> 00:19:05,789
there's a big difference between the two

149
00:19:05,789 --> 00:19:12,330
shellcode scripts the first one seemed
to have a higher rate in the second one

150
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:18,840
is it because of instructions generated
or was it just longer or was it actually

151
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:30,149
we haven't take have to see this happen
but we haven't done yet because very

152
00:19:30,149 --> 00:19:37,959
complex it's one project light-sensitive
she reads different structure guidance

153
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:53,340
we hang these actions to make more
experiment and investigate more

154
00:19:53,340 --> 00:20:00,850
correlations tried to run these

155
00:20:00,850 --> 00:20:11,260
MSF encodes no no thank you

156
00:20:11,260 --> 00:20:28,930
generated with standard Europe to email
for example no I'm not because we use

157
00:20:28,930 --> 00:20:58,100
that everybody use our country if we use
portable and we can hide

158
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:22,428
ask is that you can enjoy 3d versions
but they never even met protections real

159
00:21:22,429 --> 00:21:28,500
machines should be able to catch more
effectively definitely more effectively

160
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:43,260
the voters total better off just yet but
I C 88 percent to
