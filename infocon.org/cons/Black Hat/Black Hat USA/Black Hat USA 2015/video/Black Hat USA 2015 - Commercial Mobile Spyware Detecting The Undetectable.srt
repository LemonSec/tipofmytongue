5
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:25,130
this is and I apologize commercial
mobile spyware detecting the

6
00:00:25,130 --> 00:00:36,160
undetectable with Joshua Dolan and
Valerie handy for their do thank you

7
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:43,429
yes thank you all for being here so
again today we talked about commercial

8
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:50,070
mobile spyware detecting the
undetectable about the authors my name

9
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:54,829
is Josh Lederman second generation
digital forensics examiner my father

10
00:00:54,829 --> 00:00:58,609
helped start that Michigan State Police
Computer Crimes lad and the late

11
00:00:58,609 --> 00:01:03,219
nineteen nineties so I grew up around
digital forensics a group around and

12
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:08,400
case STK the old marriage where tools I
have a master's degree in digital

13
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:13,360
forensics from the University of Central
Florida have numerous certifications and

14
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,770
I'm currently working on a PhD in
information assurance from Nova

15
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:23,740
Southeastern University my co-presenter
co-worker valor hanky has a master's

16
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:26,869
degree and cybersecurity from the
University of Maryland University

17
00:01:26,869 --> 00:01:34,020
College and is also graduated us' Naval
Academy in Annapolis she also has many

18
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:39,649
certifications so why are we here today

19
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:47,390
today we are going to talk about mobile
spa where we first introduce our is a

20
00:01:47,390 --> 00:01:55,280
research methods and then results and
conclusion and take questions

21
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:01,850
so commercial mobile spa where you can
find it online through Google search

22
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:07,839
very easy to obtain quick Google search
for android-powered killed dozens of

23
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:15,690
hits he's an install lots of features
such as caption text messages pictures

24
00:02:15,690 --> 00:02:22,220
locations all sorts of stuff and stores
that data and a third party and most

25
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:26,550
server so if you purchase spyware

26
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:31,340
let's say and spying for example and
install a phone

27
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:36,989
the data on that phone that inspired
collection stored on servers and

28
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:44,980
depending and Mary be any enterprise
network so there's some variation

29
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:49,429
amongst the spammer programs run that
cut at minimum they will collect text

30
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:56,590
messages call history web history wi-fi
networks emails GPS locations others you

31
00:02:56,590 --> 00:03:00,780
can activate the microphone on the
device and listen and conversations I'm

32
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:06,209
going in the room without the phone
owners knowledge to activate the camera

33
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:09,329
eavesdrop on conversations are happening

34
00:03:09,329 --> 00:03:15,829
depending on the program so what we know
about these but what we know about these

35
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:19,190
types of programs while there hasn't
been a lot of research out there but

36
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:20,329
what has been done

37
00:03:20,329 --> 00:03:24,290
checkpoint like you and did a study
earlier this year they found over 20

38
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:29,250
different variants against a very
fragmented market and 18 families of

39
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:34,480
know they found two programs and spies
and spy tmobile account for over half of

40
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:39,470
all infections and now the maturity
talked about today we looked at more

41
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:43,790
than just those two more focus on us to
give you the most value for being here

42
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,950
if you have over 2000 devices on your
network

43
00:03:47,950 --> 00:03:56,450
percent chance of having at least one of
those devices being infected so are

44
00:03:56,450 --> 00:04:01,850
these devices legal and the answer to
that is well can't defense last year

45
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:04,859
last october the FBI

46
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:10,820
Virginia Office arrested the owner of a
similar one of these power companies

47
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:15,410
called stealth janie he later pled
guilty and pay a $500,000 fine that

48
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:20,548
company was shut down but that was kinda
watershed moment when it comes to these

49
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:25,039
mobile spyware programs and the past
prior to this they had been marketed

50
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:29,250
towards change spouses and fact one of
them was researching even ahead of

51
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:34,290
Valentine's Day special you can buy the
spammer 20% off on Valentine's Day about

52
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:38,430
that they're not market towards
employees and child mind to rain again

53
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:44,300
kind of changing course when it comes to
legal they have a legal disclaimer and

54
00:04:44,300 --> 00:04:46,460
most of the companies are still up and
running

55
00:04:46,460 --> 00:04:50,469
yes the FBI arrested the owner stealth
jeanne but the two largest are still up

56
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:51,160
and running

57
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:57,820
being MSPaint major mobile so why should
you care about this why are we here you

58
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:02,599
know if you are doing cyber security
enterprise 2012 care someone's spouse

59
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,940
Best Buy where her phone how would that
affect your organization

60
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:12,650
well we mention at this this parent
company store the day after party

61
00:05:12,650 --> 00:05:19,380
service so what can go wrong with that
earlier this year despite being the

62
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:24,360
largest a crime to the checkpoint study
was breached their servers paged and

63
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:27,500
what's interesting about this is my
first looked at them back to October of

64
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:33,540
last year they were using Amazon Web
Services AWS out of Virginia FB i dint

65
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:40,150
arrested still cheney the owner and a
sense move to Germany and you can see

66
00:05:40,150 --> 00:05:44,159
how that worked out to some third-party
server to server and they were breach

67
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:51,130
hundreds of gigabytes of data was posted
so for example corporate e-mails

68
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:56,050
wireless network information perhaps
wireless passwords text messages

69
00:05:56,050 --> 00:06:02,900
pictures emails all available now to
download for anybody who wants to

70
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:09,169
so here's what we did we took a samsung
galaxy s3

71
00:06:09,169 --> 00:06:15,520
running KK we capture both balto
analysis are volatile memory so we used

72
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,979
energy bug branch which is a free Google
tool we connected to phone and created a

73
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:27,680
shell window on it we then pushed man in
that cat 2 free open source tools you

74
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:34,070
can download them from get hub man being
supported by Danny Tendo who is really

75
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:38,800
an instructor so we push those two
memory so we ran Caprock announcing they

76
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,710
saw that Tampa fest which is a and
remembers mounted a sesh Devon this case

77
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:47,060
so I just kept himself for both
forensics people we want to minimize the

78
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:52,880
footprint their tools have of device on
the phone to capture that memory from

79
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:53,969
the writing process

80
00:06:53,970 --> 00:06:59,240
spam and strings on it and say so we
could find we also use to celebrate

81
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:05,870
celebrate for PC and physical analyzer
to do physical position analysis so we

82
00:07:05,870 --> 00:07:10,520
could find from the so-called
undetectable spending programs

83
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:15,080
about em Spain again be the most popular
speaker program sold on a subscription

84
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,030
basis

85
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:23,878
relatively inexpensive to buy they also
can have over a million customers

86
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:30,080
inspire you need physical access to the
phone for Android yet to modify the

87
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,440
security settings strong trusted ads
browse to the web site download and

88
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:39,229
install the apk when you purchase this
power program yet to enter a username

89
00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:47,190
password and account they will email you
a special code authorization code when

90
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:51,039
you're so this power you type it in and
there and if that is too hard for you if

91
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:55,900
you need additional assistance don't
worry there is tech support available so

92
00:07:55,900 --> 00:08:01,530
what will your own phone if you have
trouble you can go and their tech

93
00:08:01,530 --> 00:08:08,280
support people call and talk you through
it but I guess so

94
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:13,659
want to turn the phone they have command
control server just dashboard this would

95
00:08:13,659 --> 00:08:18,000
be where the adversary monitors
intrusion it's the c2 so you can get

96
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,569
call logs you can look at text messages
data cleansing you can look at Skype

97
00:08:24,569 --> 00:08:31,469
what happened all sorts of information
on here you can also save settings where

98
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:35,510
you tell the device ok when you're
hooked up to wifi only want you

99
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:39,240
transplant the pictures back to the city
where the server at that point or

100
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:46,930
cellular so you can monitor and control
the intrusion from here so what did we

101
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:50,510
find with em spy

102
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:55,540
well when we pulled the memory and
strings on it we found the settings from

103
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:58,770
the previous slide store locally on the
phone

104
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:04,810
ok cool so SMS you know that is turned
down that is Mabel C you can see enable

105
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:16,140
true WiFi only fault is that defaults
with are more though also captured the

106
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:21,189
location of the device so as at running
just to the latitude and longitude being

107
00:09:21,190 --> 00:09:27,570
captured and you can also see the
domains for example yet tht tout ceci as

108
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:34,290
one of the domains it's using which are
good packet capture we used a free

109
00:09:34,290 --> 00:09:40,560
open-source tool called short true and
took a packet capture so strong let's

110
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,979
try the packet capture sent text message
this power program kicked off and starts

111
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:50,810
any of that data back to the server and
again if you look very closely I don't

112
00:09:50,810 --> 00:10:01,489
consume all familiar demand on their the
THD SEC and we did who is the man to a

113
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:09,430
search and found out that the IP address
we looked it up is 136 243 253 185 again

114
00:10:09,430 --> 00:10:11,439
a German IP address now

115
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:18,840
previously that was using Amazon Web
Services Ashburn Virginia ok so what if

116
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,050
we find using the celebrate tool

117
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:26,630
well we found additional evidence that
the space program left behind

118
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:31,900
we found evidence and the web history
where the attacker headed pick up the

119
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:38,910
phone and browse to a website to
download the apk file we found that the

120
00:10:38,910 --> 00:10:44,100
process for the installation process and
solder route did it and read this

121
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:48,730
process if anybody in here is doing
digital forensics or computer forensics

122
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:54,310
and you have a celebrate a major looking
for spyware a great place to start as a

123
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:58,390
look at the installed applications and
scroll through those look at the

124
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:58,800
premiere

125
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:04,510
shins powerboats nations can be very
invasive typically aussie has

126
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:11,130
permissions to pretty much everything on
the phone a definitely stands out in

127
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:15,939
addition we had an Applications folder
continues to grow light data base it

128
00:11:15,940 --> 00:11:22,959
contained a log of all the data sent
back to the c2 so here's actually

129
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:27,529
internal that D be this was stored
locally on the phone so you could see

130
00:11:27,529 --> 00:11:34,269
the text messages URLs that were visited
you could see the locations and all

131
00:11:34,269 --> 00:11:46,730
sorts of information here store locally
on the phone mobile thank you again for

132
00:11:46,730 --> 00:11:52,029
coming by Valerie hanky and I'll be
talking about spy to mobile which is the

133
00:11:52,029 --> 00:11:59,240
second most common mobile spire
application subscription basis for 99

134
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:05,000
cents a day and in order to get a clean
image on our phone after a reused and

135
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:13,300
spy we bought a new rom on the phone
using Odin and then updated iPhone to

136
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:18,959
latest version of Android kick at four
point for point for Andrew to the device

137
00:12:18,959 --> 00:12:26,060
this is to ensure that we would have any
traces of MCI lost on the phone so just

138
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:31,770
like with them spy install a must by two
mobile requires physical access to the

139
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:36,709
phone the attacker has to go in and
modify the security settings to allow

140
00:12:36,709 --> 00:12:41,569
untrusted applications from there they
can open up a browser such as Google

141
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:47,060
Chrome and go to spy to mobile dot com
website from there they can go and

142
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:54,609
download and install its data underscore
backup ATK and once it is installed data

143
00:12:54,610 --> 00:12:59,870
backup but a widget on to the phone onto
the screen and it cannot be deleted

144
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:03,529
we tried several different ways to
remove it and the only way we found out

145
00:13:03,529 --> 00:13:06,990
you can move it and I just completely
wiping the phone and putting a new image

146
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:12,399
on it and so this looks just like the
settings which it a little settings cog

147
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:16,430
and so to the average user they're
probably not going to notice a widget

148
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:20,890
like this on their phone especially they
cannot be deleted from there the

149
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:27,870
attacker enter your e-mail address in
order to register with my tmobile so

150
00:13:27,870 --> 00:13:32,860
this is the command and control force by
two mobile is very similar to a spy in

151
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:38,490
the upper last you can see that we are
currently monitoring Samsung GTI 9300

152
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:45,589
which is our Samsung Galaxy s3 and we
can see the phones IMEI that the phone

153
00:13:45,589 --> 00:13:50,140
is connected and so if the phone is
turned off or put into airplane mode it

154
00:13:50,140 --> 00:13:54,380
would show that the phone is
disconnected the attackers able to track

155
00:13:54,380 --> 00:14:01,320
via GPS you can see here in the middle
it shows the last long in a date

156
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:05,500
timestamp of where the phone is
currently located can also monitor the

157
00:14:05,500 --> 00:14:11,490
battery level and the versions of
software on the right hand side we're

158
00:14:11,490 --> 00:14:16,700
able to see the user's contacts theaters
when contacting the phone and a phone

159
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:23,680
number two different text messages call
history and different applications such

160
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:30,489
as whatsapp and viber by to move was not
as robust as inspires doesn't track as

161
00:14:30,490 --> 00:14:38,700
many features but it's still cost
effective for an attacker so we did the

162
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:44,660
same kind of forensic analysis by
t-mobile that we did for MCI we looked

163
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:49,029
at the memory application memory and we
were able to squeeze in a text message

164
00:14:49,029 --> 00:14:55,760
to a phone number and where it spicy but
was able to capture the text message the

165
00:14:55,760 --> 00:15:05,800
calls SMS time and costs were sent on
july stuff and 2015 @ 18 2007 GMT by

166
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:11,469
t-mobile captures the time in unix time
and which is really user friendly so if

167
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:15,170
you throw it into a time conversion you
can get a time that makes sense to

168
00:15:15,170 --> 00:15:17,110
people

169
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:21,839
and you could see the content of the
text messages I love black cat 2015 and

170
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,510
it was sent to phone number

171
00:15:23,510 --> 00:15:33,569
5552 368 and their extra cool points if
anyone knows who's number belongs to you

172
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:37,640
we look at the application memory and
we're able to see all the recorded

173
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:43,050
wireless networks and buy t-mobile
doesn't just collapsed the wireless

174
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:47,380
networks that the phone connects to any
wireless network that is available at

175
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:51,550
that moment in that area so we had two
different networks available in our

176
00:15:51,550 --> 00:15:56,709
office we had a guest network and our
pen testing lab network and it shows

177
00:15:56,709 --> 00:16:01,920
both of those with their lives to marcia
tude and then it shows the wifi are

178
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:08,040
stored so we actually the phone to our
guest network in Colombia and its stores

179
00:16:08,040 --> 00:16:15,310
that and its tourist a lot of 2012 to
where we were so using shark for root we

180
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:19,670
did take a pcap and we're able to
analyze the network traffic for spy to

181
00:16:19,670 --> 00:16:27,189
mobile and it shows that a communicate
with IP address one of 7:22 127

182
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:38,410
top-forty using TCP over Port 7766 so we
threw this into a whois lookup figure

183
00:16:38,410 --> 00:16:45,839
out where this IP address was and it is
registered to Wild West domains LLC

184
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:56,210
and hosted by Amazon it ws in Ashburn
Virginia so we took a physical rep of

185
00:16:56,210 --> 00:17:02,590
the phone using cellebrite ufed for PC
and then analyzed the RIP using

186
00:17:02,590 --> 00:17:08,130
celebrates physical analyzer and we can
see the Google Chrome history where the

187
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:12,780
attacker went to spite you Mobile's
website and downloaded the data

188
00:17:12,780 --> 00:17:19,119
underscore back at ATK file and we can
see where spy to mobile is installed in

189
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:24,520
the root directory and if you drill down
into by t-mobile's folder structure

190
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:30,410
there is a single database called system
died GB and that is where all the data

191
00:17:30,410 --> 00:17:38,390
store collective eyes by two mobile so
here's a recap of the systems that TV

192
00:17:38,390 --> 00:17:44,390
and it shows what the attacker has
access to the metadata call logs

193
00:17:44,390 --> 00:17:50,750
contacts messages and all the different
wifi networks the phone had access to

194
00:17:50,750 --> 00:17:56,240
you can see that we just drove around
and we touch 65 different wireless

195
00:17:56,240 --> 00:18:01,710
networks didn't connection any of them
but I T Mobile just capture that that's

196
00:18:01,710 --> 00:18:09,680
a good way for an attacker to know where
their victim is so how do you know if

197
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,130
you've been infected the average user
they're probably not going to know that

198
00:18:14,130 --> 00:18:20,030
they have spyware on her phone so the
best bet is to always use a strong cast

199
00:18:20,030 --> 00:18:25,910
code and limit the physical access to
your phone to phone on your desk and

200
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:32,440
step away for a meeting or something
always check your also visited I think

201
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:36,940
it's been downloaded on the phone just
to ensure that something isn't something

202
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:41,140
you did always look at your security
settings

203
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:45,020
and determine if you have enabled
untrusted applications to be installed

204
00:18:45,020 --> 00:18:49,680
and I know many people that have droid
do their phones

205
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:54,260
people who have iOS devices might
jailbreak but just know that your phone

206
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:59,510
is more susceptible to spyware and
always look for a new widget or

207
00:18:59,510 --> 00:19:04,520
something doesn't look right on your
phone I'm an iOS years are and every

208
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:09,710
time they do and iOS update and software
version Apple has some new application

209
00:19:09,710 --> 00:19:14,650
that you can't delete on your phone and
you know just like with by t-mobile you

210
00:19:14,650 --> 00:19:20,670
might think just another application you
know Android for samsung whoever put on

211
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:25,600
there that I can't delete and if you're
ever on certain and just you know you

212
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:29,899
can always take a pcap there are many
free free tools open source tools out

213
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:37,340
there look at the data there's many free
forensic tools out there that you can

214
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:44,659
use to try to figure out if your phone
has been affected some similar work out

215
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:49,160
there we are the first ones to look at
commercial mobile spyware Taylor and

216
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:56,720
Robinson presented at DEFCON 20 on
commercial spyware we chose different

217
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:03,080
applications to look at and we chose the
top two and we also looked at the

218
00:20:03,080 --> 00:20:10,029
volatile memory

219
00:20:10,029 --> 00:20:17,330
here we are with Adela cybersecurity
please stop by booth 719 check us out we

220
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:25,739
have fantastic products and services we
have lots of talks and demos any

221
00:20:25,739 --> 00:20:35,320
questions

222
00:20:35,320 --> 00:20:44,639
now that we noticed the question was if
the spire applications utilize more

223
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:55,850
battery consumption and from from our
analysis we did not notice that so on

224
00:20:55,850 --> 00:20:59,040
the subscription services did you notice
that the spyware is still collecting

225
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:06,950
data after you'd stop paying the 99
cents a day or what not sure that we are

226
00:21:06,950 --> 00:21:07,970
able to tell for sure

227
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:12,580
subscription stabbed you weren't able to
log in but for example on spy t-mobile

228
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:17,960
we tried and we literally cannot
uninstall it so the undetected spyware

229
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:22,400
triumph over the bridge along our
website there's no installation tools

230
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:28,580
for that our program so presumably but I
have no way to know for sure you check

231
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:35,610
like pcap files to see if any more data
was flying out researchers collected at

232
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:40,159
once we finished and I think the phone
number was from Ghostbusters your tracks

233
00:21:40,160 --> 00:21:50,530
hi how did you get the memory
acquisition ok so what we did is we used

234
00:21:50,530 --> 00:21:56,590
ADB energy bug bridge which allowed us
to go from our laptop to the phone to

235
00:21:56,590 --> 00:22:00,629
create a shout shout since the phone is
rooted we are able to have root access

236
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:07,500
so then we used ADB to push man and that
cat from our laptop to the memory on the

237
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:11,620
phone and then from there just command
line if you check our white paper on

238
00:22:11,620 --> 00:22:16,300
that we literally go step by step with
screenshots with command-line syntax

239
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:19,030
telling how to do that

240
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:29,870
another question did you look into the
code implementation of these ok is there

241
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:38,850
any spyware or you don't need their
server put it on your own web server not

242
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:41,790
that I saw that doesn't exist

243
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:46,110
the ones we saw the ones we tested all
used their server

244
00:22:46,110 --> 00:22:49,889
but I guess there's something out there
that are customizable we try to focus on

245
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:55,059
the tattoo and things that are more
comment more popular things that you

246
00:22:55,059 --> 00:23:24,830
unsophisticated actors might do you have
one of the hosts but they moved to

247
00:23:24,830 --> 00:23:30,189
Germany know everything we can think of
is to avoid us' jurisdiction if they

248
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:36,799
hosted by foreign country can't say 100%
that's our speculation on that we can

249
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:44,690
talk to them so we can just s any other
questions

250
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:51,940
alright yes sir are there any known
Mobile Spy where they can be installed

251
00:23:51,940 --> 00:24:00,950
without physical access to any mobile
spyware applications that can be

252
00:24:00,950 --> 00:24:04,770
installed without physical access to
think there's a briefing earlier today

253
00:24:04,770 --> 00:24:12,040
and the from Josh Drake and I but not
that away not commercially available but

254
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:21,230
I'm sure there are some three other
agencies that can do that

255
00:24:21,230 --> 00:24:26,030
from an enterprise security standpoint
is it possible to build an ideal

256
00:24:26,030 --> 00:24:30,299
signature to detect these while they're
running on the wireless network within

257
00:24:30,299 --> 00:24:36,960
the enterprise possibly I may be
certainly have the domains you could

258
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,570
learn off of as far as that I guess it
depends on the phone to if you have any

259
00:24:41,570 --> 00:24:47,780
way to track process programs on the
phone but you could certainly off of the

260
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:59,440
IP addresses those those are standing
those are changing for us questions

261
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:03,900
thank you all for attending hope you had
a great day at Black Hat see all around
