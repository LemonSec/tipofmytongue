1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,560
I'll overwhelming to see you think
you're coming so today we'll be talking

2
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:12,489
about what's on iPod when it was built
for what the current popular anymore

3
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:17,130
projects today give us and especially
what we think they give us but they

4
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:26,140
don't just just do you know color you
know just to think up this is not going

5
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:30,529
to be any no mapping thousands of
keyboards and windows to get direct

6
00:00:30,529 --> 00:00:35,940
physical mapping for spring colonel show
called me not that advanced technically

7
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:46,718
but more on the methodological soccer
team next to me is that I R and 30 I can

8
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,899
has got in and I'll just go ahead and
get them might just to talk about what

9
00:00:52,899 --> 00:01:02,829
it is that we're talking about here just
to get the definitions up sixteen so one

10
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:07,270
of the things we didn't want to start
doing the stock then again he's not

11
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:10,950
gonna be there not be any show coconut
Cocos or anything like that which is

12
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,390
just more than 20 chill talk so if
you're looking for that too he will not

13
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:23,140
be heard you anyway so we were asked
when we hope this presentation to

14
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:26,880
explain what these were talking about we
just jumped into it and use it wait wait

15
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,600
what is the section I mean when you say
the words I remember now we accept it

16
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,869
but what is deception whether it can
mean so I would like for the next five

17
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:41,310
minutes or so to do through this and the
way we see it and been connected to the

18
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:43,060
talk of honey pots

19
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:49,060
breaking them and making them so much
and can be defined by many many people

20
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:53,920
are definition is essentially we want to
manage that doctors behavior nothing

21
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,039
more nothing was so that we can detect
them with you the first essential being

22
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:03,289
we're trying to do with many of the
security technology but a critical are

23
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:10,209
hutu already show you with no clothes or
very low rate which is really recall we

24
00:02:10,209 --> 00:02:14,800
want to be able to override for
investigation afterwards and more than

25
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,280
that we want to be able to control its
operating agreement start mediating that

26
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:27,319
occur through this technology so before
it even starts in academia we see them

27
00:02:27,319 --> 00:02:32,268
the shoulders or Stanley shoulders of
giants and marking the 90th Street cool

28
00:02:32,269 --> 00:02:39,720
in the section to write let's talk about
honey pots started in 1949 according to

29
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:42,590
the phone line here because they have a
lot of respect

30
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:47,030
fully work they've done to promote this
field to build open source projects on

31
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:55,570
their own dime so respected him and many
many many others all the way back in the

32
00:02:55,570 --> 00:03:00,489
nineteen eighties and of course we can
go to section two sons doing ancient

33
00:03:00,489 --> 00:03:06,530
China or to breach in ww2 just saying we
respect who came before us so critical

34
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:09,269
this is really attackers

35
00:03:09,269 --> 00:03:10,390
ducks

36
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:15,790
yesterday we look for mower payloads
will review these and these are

37
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:21,790
constantly change what doesn't change
much over a small dog walkers they

38
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:26,470
working away by a certain
decision-making process and methodology

39
00:03:26,470 --> 00:03:31,340
and these Joey meant to send some people
go to kill chain other people call it

40
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:34,770
something else and there are many many
different approaches this but that is

41
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:40,709
because if we know for a fact not what
to lure really going to use but rather

42
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:47,200
where the doctor is going to me what
their decision-making process there we

43
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:56,420
can catch them in other words what we
have to do everything

44
00:03:56,420 --> 00:04:00,089
vendors who ended up here comes into the
network usually right now for all

45
00:04:00,090 --> 00:04:04,360
operations they don't know what's going
on there were no situational awareness

46
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:09,690
that is what we're trying to use against
them if we can put options that you that

47
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:17,450
review the decision making process in
their general that is very far away so

48
00:04:17,450 --> 00:04:21,029
there's something called so you may note
some of you may not think it's a

49
00:04:21,029 --> 00:04:24,750
strategic decision making process for
tactical situation and whether they call

50
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:33,100
it a void in the seventies and is very
reasonable or observe orient decide

51
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,360
what I'm saying and what we are saying
and what everybody was saying

52
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:44,120
essentially if we can take over the
first 20 20 vision so when they're

53
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:49,670
trying to do something to look for
example of 20 movement they see what we

54
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:53,080
want them to see and they believe what
we want to believe when they proceed

55
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,200
according to that that is the way that
is what deception

56
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,229
told you can give us and you can come at
any anywhere along the rather come all

57
00:05:01,230 --> 00:05:07,010
the way over there liane reconnaissance
the only way out to exclude tration or

58
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:13,930
in other words this is what we're trying
to say thank you for the offer a couple

59
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:22,550
guys here that we know we weren't got to
keep thinking like you though the stuff

60
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:28,350
and then my life and beer and abstracts

61
00:05:28,350 --> 00:05:35,590
our view and economic shift so let's
consider intelligence operation let's

62
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:40,900
put ourselves in the shoes of
intelligence agency state sponsored Dr

63
00:05:40,900 --> 00:05:46,419
China or Russia mother who right now the
cybercriminal so you go through the

64
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:49,380
states where the US
intelligence-gathering

65
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:54,500
what you gonna do you do in areas like
what am I gonna do it how to apply for

66
00:05:54,500 --> 00:06:02,240
this little I'm gonna install on this
machine here my phone what happens if

67
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,780
the battery runs out too fast so all the
way there

68
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:12,289
but eventually come down to one rule
changes but always remains there

69
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:18,970
somewhere and that's a cox basic
intelligence operations visible from the

70
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:29,450
Chinese many would say you know when you
think about stocks the pic code includes

71
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:34,919
twelve years old apt one when they were
disclosed women they disappeared for a

72
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:38,049
long moment I authored or disclosing
were discovered by everyone to buyers

73
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:43,100
out there until they came up with for
Asians meaning what makes a threat after

74
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:47,950
powerful one of the things anyway but
after powerful is the research says

75
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:53,870
realities we just know they're using
whatever they can we see some changing

76
00:06:53,870 --> 00:07:02,010
that was just thinking that is there any
game you know or they planted in you go

77
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:08,680
and you don't get caught in the window
starting widest possible but no you know

78
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:13,860
every show you connect to computer you
know that we need to let you go

79
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:19,880
intentionally used you could get caught
here what other movie resources used

80
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:27,050
losing your cool under various other
service use trust corporation and that

81
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:33,600
his economic change were trying to do so
every step every move you make their

82
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:37,650
right if you know every step you think
you might get caught the news resources

83
00:07:37,650 --> 00:07:42,659
and economic change which is the cost to
you so there are many many of them to

84
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:47,129
savor deception buildings I would
disappear proliferation is complex

85
00:07:47,129 --> 00:07:53,659
but every suburb of their children other
eventually come down to one element

86
00:07:53,659 --> 00:07:58,529
attribute still it could be a very very
small element or it could be the main

87
00:07:58,529 --> 00:08:05,429
part of cooperation but the decoy as we
like to call it means something very

88
00:08:05,429 --> 00:08:10,159
specific means it means usually low
interaction which can be your Britain

89
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:12,190
which is what he's talking about

90
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:20,910
so that another guy but the other thing
we want to talk about that another time

91
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:28,500
to consider this year and you control
the machine completely it's your machine

92
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:35,469
nothing else you ever run into trouble
what can I don't know you could run with

93
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:40,090
machine you know dr. that's a 10 percent
alert single-edged just got and that is

94
00:08:40,090 --> 00:08:49,130
the power behind reception so cool jim
is long direction honey pots with all

95
00:08:49,130 --> 00:08:51,450
the time to russia now but they're not
there but when you look at the world and

96
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:55,470
we see this kind of the internet and we
can show this when you look at the world

97
00:08:55,470 --> 00:09:02,960
this is what people use now they're very
very useful for the internet some other

98
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:06,490
scans between customer interaction with
an attacker

99
00:09:06,490 --> 00:09:13,950
very loaded word could mean anything
when it comes to reaching targeted

100
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:19,440
available for the unskilled two
different levels and that my life but I

101
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,970
will tonight but works they are leaving
the condition and that is a really nice

102
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:28,560
packed so the MUA so when you Emily
something you felt really good

103
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:38,089
fingerprint that which is where the fuck
starts in one now I am directionally but

104
00:09:38,089 --> 00:09:40,820
on the other end of this week we're
looking at about the same thing before

105
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:46,830
you write are only strong this really is
that these are all I personally like to

106
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:50,570
call them so potentially nothing every
case they won't be real machines

107
00:09:50,570 --> 00:10:02,690
everything $100 you catch it but they
watch and generating more intelligence

108
00:10:02,690 --> 00:10:07,170
so you can assist with the risk

109
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:13,579
aspect of this so more about a
fingerprint thing and I'm almost done

110
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:19,140
this is critical because many other guys
here in this room or will you be

111
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:25,199
watching this doctor are watching the
stock they were really slowed it is

112
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:30,420
fingerprinting a little building to
connect with a punch so much server is

113
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:37,469
that but thats shoko to exploit what is
going on here so what is the purpose

114
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:44,370
behind the technical sense so upset risk
for example

115
00:10:44,370 --> 00:10:52,130
tour portable heaters and yes according
to be very critical for tour but

116
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:58,439
critical really weird or the anonymous
and be able to say hey that's an IP

117
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:05,850
address for real user behind or so there
is something we discussed if you can

118
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:14,600
tell you that I personally think yes but
the mother is in the state over the cold

119
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:23,130
right now it's so unfair with any legal
obstacles and say I can

120
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:31,779
discussion to be had thank you very much
ok so now let's get into more technical

121
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:37,220
stuff and just like to talk about what's
the difference between low and high

122
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:42,070
interaction on me but okay so this is
probably everybody in this room already

123
00:11:42,070 --> 00:11:46,279
know the belt go for a quick just
simulations and networking services that

124
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:49,520
you are on your network and then if
somebody talks today

125
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:54,420
service to publicize and haven't been
talking to anybody about then by

126
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:58,510
definition you know that something's
gone wrong it's probably an attacker

127
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:03,170
might also be like false-positive and
honey pots and swear it's like an

128
00:12:03,170 --> 00:12:07,589
agarose or something scan or Spiceworks
was just making up the network or

129
00:12:07,589 --> 00:12:12,690
something but it's a very very good
concept of how to get a tiger stripe and

130
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:17,520
wait it just do it as they simulate some
type of network service like somebody or

131
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:21,220
something P R you also remember and the
thinking is that if you write it

132
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:26,260
yourself it's very easy to monitor right
so I seem like a very very difficult

133
00:12:26,260 --> 00:12:31,510
political tomorrow for example you can
tell which guys trying to access if

134
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:32,689
you've written

135
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:36,490
are seeing yourself it's much harder to
do it if you're trying to understand the

136
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:41,450
article Windows users right because
changes virgins and it's it's it's it's

137
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:47,420
very dynamic the way works so minor
action on imports are you are

138
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:52,030
essentially getting the real system
working but then figuring out a way

139
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:56,329
about to monitor your network service
all the things that anybody service

140
00:12:56,330 --> 00:13:00,730
right and it's a very difficult thing to
implement because then you're sort of

141
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:05,320
walking in the path of regular security
anomaly detection writer trying to

142
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:12,730
understand what's what's the best thing
what's good thing so it's before we go

143
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:18,610
into our work along just like to discuss
the previous work that's been made so

144
00:13:18,610 --> 00:13:25,340
showdown this website called and they
are not saying you just put in an IP and

145
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:30,180
then it tells you are not and when we
just got to see it when we're looking at

146
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:35,689
previous research we could get it to
make our honey pots look like every

147
00:13:35,690 --> 00:13:40,980
single day we used it will look like a
real system on showdown so we didn't

148
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:45,310
really understand till later point what
they were looking for and then we

149
00:13:45,310 --> 00:13:53,199
realized that there's a lot that
simulation of SCADA system called and

150
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:58,610
there's been previous research by the
showdown team and later more important

151
00:13:58,610 --> 00:14:05,010
improvements by Sean murdering her about
detecting right so the first thing they

152
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:10,810
did was the name of the device is always
the same and then when people hear that

153
00:14:10,810 --> 00:14:15,849
and I'm configuring it to be different
than the serum is always the same so you

154
00:14:15,850 --> 00:14:19,910
gon showdown and search for that serial
number you get like 10 rushing around

155
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:23,560
the world they're running that skate on
your body and you think that one of

156
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,680
those IP's and running

157
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:30,660
runs scored and here I thought so what
we feel like we haven't talked really a

158
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:34,770
showdown but it's it's a really good
start but it's very incomplete in terms

159
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:43,079
of detecting most of our partners ok so
the way we do projects individually is

160
00:14:43,080 --> 00:14:47,580
by layering on more and more complexity
in terms of getting more stuff from the

161
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:51,380
attacker being able to collect more
intelligence allowed me to mitigate so

162
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:57,200
the first one is the most basic simple
ideas and already the most complex 10

163
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:02,350
also with artillery and we've cleared
hilary is just a script that you can run

164
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:08,850
on dedicated machines or on your own
machine what it does open up ports that

165
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:16,630
are very well known two attackers like
some 2 p.m. DNS and that's where all the

166
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:22,380
attacks usually happen and what it does
is it just gives you a kiss so if you're

167
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:28,410
still looking into some deep emails are
just very rule the just gives you

168
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:34,279
randomly and then inboxer I B and it's
another 30 using this like this really

169
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:39,110
reminds me of going up to a girl in the
club room saying I'm she's like the way

170
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:47,800
right click really rude but ok thankyou
thankyou so it's pretty obvious to

171
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:55,449
detect but our journey has a very basic
concept and just be able to block

172
00:15:55,450 --> 00:16:01,959
scanning and automatic exploitation and
box and it works really well but

173
00:16:01,959 --> 00:16:08,229
obviously if you're a target attacker
arguing that network doesn't pull any

174
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:16,180
difficulties and another thing that's
problematic with artillery locking up

175
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:20,069
and without really actually interacting
with the person talking to the service

176
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:24,560
it really depends on the species
protection in the network but most

177
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:30,579
networks don't have protection then you
can use that to be able to block any IPO

178
00:16:30,579 --> 00:16:36,520
on and that's a really problematic
especially running artillery on your own

179
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:41,240
machines and it even works for the gate
waste so I just sending two packets you

180
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:44,910
can just make every machine running
artillery just dropped from the network

181
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:46,370
but that's all

182
00:16:46,370 --> 00:16:53,970
always assuming you can do the speaking
part so artillery is worried that if you

183
00:16:53,970 --> 00:16:58,510
create a port that nobody should be
touching and somebody is touching and

184
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:01,880
that's an indicator of attackers
activity and that's a nice way of life

185
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:15,569
you know blocking automatic malware or
scanning attempts or whatever what we

186
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:29,500
learned here right now we have to start
thinking something and that changes

187
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:32,520
everything in the way we planned our
operations and that's something that we

188
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:35,740
can see very very closely with me know
tillery

189
00:17:35,740 --> 00:18:00,040
story actually starts just

190
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:13,539
she really liked

191
00:18:13,539 --> 00:18:29,789
just 30 and the law

192
00:18:29,789 --> 00:19:09,869
30 if you just try and run around saying
error 502 mission and also from the same

193
00:19:09,869 --> 00:19:16,139
problems you know somebody is running on
their machine just you know sending them

194
00:19:16,139 --> 00:19:22,269
to packets and then there you can just
like their machine from the syslog

195
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:26,149
servers where you want when you're
trying to say and using that to your

196
00:19:26,149 --> 00:19:30,859
advantage

197
00:19:30,859 --> 00:19:39,699
you need to implement the service if you
want anything interesting to get her

198
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:47,870
you should do that one so so little is
learn once we learned that you should be

199
00:19:47,870 --> 00:19:51,658
looking for indicators of the central
right just connecting to services and

200
00:19:51,659 --> 00:19:55,730
trying to see if there what I can get
from the first of all you need to

201
00:19:55,730 --> 00:20:03,190
realize during his own section like that
that error message or that manner and

202
00:20:03,190 --> 00:20:07,929
now we come to the nineties dole
probably one of the most famous any

203
00:20:07,929 --> 00:20:12,850
parts and it's been a real shame shame
to waste management made when it came

204
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:21,029
out to really really monumental work and
very great world assumption and what it

205
00:20:21,029 --> 00:20:26,799
says it's a very configurable platform
you can decide which services you want

206
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:33,799
to run and which scripts implemented
service and implement also is it like

207
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:43,549
DNS or somebody or TV or a sage right
and this is very very tiny TV shows for

208
00:20:43,549 --> 00:20:50,330
example somebody exchange although they
may have no way of being able to rely on

209
00:20:50,330 --> 00:20:51,629
a heart attack

210
00:20:51,630 --> 00:20:57,830
mostly people just use the custom like
the default scripts that come along down

211
00:20:57,830 --> 00:21:01,309
ed

212
00:21:01,309 --> 00:21:09,168
service and implementing and what
they're trying to figure out if somebody

213
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:15,940
trying to do and get done X or whatever
it used to be a very common stock of

214
00:21:15,940 --> 00:21:22,149
trying to realize you can get a shell
executions and what happens as soon as

215
00:21:22,149 --> 00:21:24,449
it receives the scatter across

216
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:33,530
exactly the same their listing every
time because you really realize just

217
00:21:33,530 --> 00:21:40,810
signature sponsor this is anh di S and
also doesn't really make sense in a lot

218
00:21:40,810 --> 00:21:45,820
of ways for example somebody who's
running the ISA server today that means

219
00:21:45,820 --> 00:21:54,090
they haven't changed website in just 10
years because of the time of the 2000 so

220
00:21:54,090 --> 00:22:00,209
it's a good idea but if you're looking
at this makes sense there's there's a

221
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:08,760
few issues and also and FTP script and
support the deal you like to do believe

222
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:15,379
so she writes don't do it justice and
the SSH service just doesn't do anything

223
00:22:15,380 --> 00:22:22,550
like to talk to and doesn't plan to
service so if an attacker is trying to

224
00:22:22,550 --> 00:22:28,919
exploit a machine like I'm gonna run my
days it's really interesting to me and

225
00:22:28,920 --> 00:22:40,500
becomes very very soon I just a possible
fix for the IAS is just random I just

226
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:45,850
get an empty list and also randomized to
buy counts and the serial number and all

227
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:50,860
the time to do it periodically because
for example some people told me just

228
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:55,229
randomized on every request but that's
also very bad because if you request

229
00:22:55,230 --> 00:22:59,520
like three four times using modified
just run along the spectrum then you're

230
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:06,320
also realizing its assimilation plan
something to deceive you

231
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:12,320
so what do you do when you're trying to
implement the service to seeing a doctor

232
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:19,460
she doing it with no indication
indications of how the simulation like

233
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:29,179
the previous projects we looked so what
essentially we can do so what is it you

234
00:23:29,179 --> 00:23:33,759
can learn here about Boehner's like you
saw earlier when you implement this and

235
00:23:33,759 --> 00:23:37,220
you actually start conversing in a way
to the service it's got to be a real

236
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:42,039
implementation you can find this thing
just see a wetsuit implemented and

237
00:23:42,039 --> 00:23:48,750
that's something that I will never have
to do but it's also an issue

238
00:23:48,750 --> 00:23:58,920
next is actually management platform
uses quo user interface where you can do

239
00:23:58,920 --> 00:24:05,100
template it conflicts sheen's that
serves example window she's an ex

240
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:14,010
machine then spent months going down and
really high level and one of the issues

241
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:24,760
and was pretty interesting so that if I
had known that script right so if you're

242
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:30,420
looking to script the script service
service service says it doesn't have any

243
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:35,250
windows always make sense

244
00:24:35,250 --> 00:24:41,530
close then maybe but the port is open so
your connecting to the sport and nothing

245
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:44,780
is interacting with you as soon as
you're talking to it and this is a

246
00:24:44,780 --> 00:24:48,379
situation doesn't ever happen on a
Windows machine makes it pretty obvious

247
00:24:48,380 --> 00:24:59,330
that no one does so just you know I'm
doing better service to the unjust

248
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:05,629
causing the port so we've also you're
out here and it's and we can learn from

249
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:12,790
implementing one service completely is
also not kept up a set of services

250
00:25:12,790 --> 00:25:16,250
machine creating them all makes sense

251
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:20,960
the main difference really hear that we
think let's just stop and think about

252
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,470
that tucker so we don't know what
services right we talked about going

253
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:27,080
from regular reports to starting to
implement them

254
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:31,040
condition is it looks real at the very
least we have to go through something

255
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:35,720
but nothing about your approaching a
machine that gentleman by itself she

256
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:40,320
always some of CNN IIS server running
Windows Server it's running something

257
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:44,360
that will never run what's lacking a
service that Windows will always run

258
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:49,500
that is weird that yells and screams
honey but when you run novel you have to

259
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:52,730
be very very careful about how you set
up your machines or their doctor will

260
00:25:52,730 --> 00:25:53,700
look at the whole

261
00:25:53,700 --> 00:26:06,070
and to be able to till the time he
bought the cooler cooler I wanted to

262
00:26:06,070 --> 00:26:11,700
take over medium interaction which means
it actually doesn't necessarily

263
00:26:11,700 --> 00:26:20,809
can use Against the Machine and this
caused a lot of stuff to be caught

264
00:26:20,809 --> 00:26:26,980
because as a jeweler more popular ones
unless you do it very easily so there's

265
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:34,149
been some research and one of the ones
we already here is that it's very easy

266
00:26:34,149 --> 00:26:38,000
to understand you are incapable once
you're in there because not all of the

267
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:45,700
SSH commands are implemented it's not
actually show show you can interact and

268
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:51,970
also it was which is very interesting is
they implemented W so what happens when

269
00:26:51,970 --> 00:26:59,620
I get some of the situation first thing
they do is download and run the machine

270
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:05,918
what they're trying to do this is to
work in the payload but then the

271
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:10,070
defender while they want to protect
themselves from it but you can also use

272
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:18,629
that for the thing or scanning other
machines and they have protection and

273
00:27:18,630 --> 00:27:24,399
this is another or detection that's
previously been around what happened was

274
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:31,719
the Kyoto Protocol for this age what he
would do as soon as they would be the

275
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:35,740
key exchange it was trying to

276
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:42,170
trying identification and that's the
same protocol is in the specification

277
00:27:42,170 --> 00:27:49,490
says they're doing it that way so yes
when you're looking at the neck after

278
00:27:49,490 --> 00:27:54,040
talking to people it's not a regular
basis each service and then in scott

279
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:58,710
breighton and this has been in the past
and just another way of understanding

280
00:27:58,710 --> 00:28:03,700
how to be ready to go when you're
running welcome and you name minus a

281
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:10,750
cozy the same you name it something that
we found and it's it's pretty

282
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:16,010
problematic if you would do all the
CNAME you don't see people saying I

283
00:28:16,010 --> 00:28:19,850
connected to the same machine and stuff
is really weird this is the name that

284
00:28:19,850 --> 00:28:25,010
the details and I have no idea what's
going on so young people not trying to

285
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:37,730
detect sensing that something is wrong
so jeans time to time or just random and

286
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:42,360
what we want to keep those that can be
used as a tool not only for detecting

287
00:28:42,360 --> 00:28:47,540
not just saying you have an attacker and
use that I was also trying to start

288
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:52,720
collecting because that's the thing that
will call you to me he does threat right

289
00:28:52,720 --> 00:29:00,240
and essentially see it when you doing
the WRC English commands so this is a

290
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:05,720
really a major shift in a way to medium
interaction I parts because we're

291
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:09,170
talking about defensive tackle you
adjust honey pots but they interact in a

292
00:29:09,170 --> 00:29:14,760
way with the doctor and the key issue
here is you can start profiling that dr.

293
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:21,450
essentially know that tucker is to
threats number 12 operation to sail and

294
00:29:21,450 --> 00:29:27,570
not just fail as in hey I don't much
like this was a few blocks or this let's

295
00:29:27,570 --> 00:29:31,220
move on the operation failure no
interacting with the machine itself so

296
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:34,380
simple as profile your comments saying
hey

297
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:41,730
let's move away and that's a major shift
in winter plus an operation and next up

298
00:29:41,730 --> 00:29:49,090
and down the most interesting ones we
looked at because it actually gets the

299
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:57,939
right way of getting as much information
from the words of one another it

300
00:29:57,940 --> 00:30:01,940
actually runs something called him you
that actually doesn't emulation of a

301
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:08,910
machine and it wants to exploit against
it and then captured the exploits and it

302
00:30:08,910 --> 00:30:14,350
doesn't have a number of services and as
soon as the machine is attacked and runs

303
00:30:14,350 --> 00:30:20,270
through bbm you and Daniel used to have
a lot of problems

304
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:29,950
action previously and some shearing then
it just tell you is dynamic and also

305
00:30:29,950 --> 00:30:36,710
this is where we got an email our
markets which is a great guy when he's

306
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:43,860
actually somebody starting in a few ways
of being able to do you fix these issues

307
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:48,580
and something that loaner action on the
box

308
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:53,470
guys figured out a long time ago when
you talk to people from the community

309
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:59,490
that always it's not clear and that is
he saying no matter how are we trying or

310
00:30:59,490 --> 00:31:04,809
I will never be able to simulate a
rolling machine and yes I always out a

311
00:31:04,809 --> 00:31:11,780
way of detecting it is inside the long
run if not gonna fix these issues that

312
00:31:11,780 --> 00:31:15,740
you just have to understand the lawyer
John probably just for a specific

313
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:27,090
purpose and that stop being so tiny and
services a GPS and the Certificate today

314
00:31:27,090 --> 00:31:30,980
as their own certificate is just call it
sure is

315
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:35,820
domain is dying and are more than I T
and even fewer services there's more

316
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:41,740
ways of texting one is that it allows
anybody to connect to the FTP server

317
00:31:41,740 --> 00:31:46,940
it's like any user any possible and I
haven't seen any real indication system

318
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:50,740
lets the same user connect with two
different passwords to this one away

319
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:59,380
with texting another way is implemented
deal he commanded the FTP service so

320
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:04,640
we're going to learn from them we want
to make the service exploitable 2010

321
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:09,530
next place Friday because somebody is
using an exploit and follow their fellow

322
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:12,940
we want to be able to give them the
option of doing that because then

323
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:20,909
medications very very much easier to do
towards this is this is really really

324
00:32:20,909 --> 00:32:26,610
really unthinkable just said detecting
the exploit so going back to what we

325
00:32:26,610 --> 00:32:30,500
said originally just about saying hey I
know if the connection or network that

326
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,880
can be naughty also Spiceworks it so
just saying hey ever really talked her

327
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:38,230
into interacting with its alert it's all
just saying I can blow their operation

328
00:32:38,230 --> 00:32:44,460
known say I can lower their resources
they eventually I can get their exploits

329
00:32:44,460 --> 00:32:50,970
30 day the credentials I can do
something which will lead to attribution

330
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:54,940
and that is a whole other level anyway
this tool to go to college so much

331
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:55,600
further

332
00:32:55,600 --> 00:33:00,740
has been there before it's not just
about hey this is a cool thing it's

333
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:04,760
about saying this video person
potentially affecting this country about

334
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:08,370
me it's about attribution is still on
international media interaction if you

335
00:33:08,370 --> 00:33:13,770
like so it's easy to fingerprint by
design but it's taken us to a whole

336
00:33:13,770 --> 00:33:27,330
other level operationally ok so you run
it and then you get his website running

337
00:33:27,330 --> 00:33:35,539
which number of factors because people
want you to explain like other stuff

338
00:33:35,539 --> 00:33:41,240
going on and what happens when you run
it through default page looks like this

339
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:49,250
and I'm sure anyway you know this is a
weird number just get off when you're

340
00:33:49,250 --> 00:33:50,210
using

341
00:33:50,210 --> 00:33:54,370
thinking is that it's very configurable
and you can change anything and it has

342
00:33:54,370 --> 00:34:01,169
its own file system that is simulating
machine and you can change any of the

343
00:34:01,170 --> 00:34:14,340
pages or certificates that you are so
welcome and the federal page this is a

344
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:23,400
really great entry power if you google
search that strain and brings up a lot

345
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:27,740
of interesting stuff and one of those
tough when we were doing it was one of

346
00:34:27,739 --> 00:34:36,549
the top web sites online that sell them
in morning last time so it's very early

347
00:34:36,550 --> 00:34:42,190
a dangerous when you're just having the
same default not realizing how to

348
00:34:42,190 --> 00:34:49,679
integrate 12 you're running and so one
of the things that catches in Ohio and

349
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:55,940
it just does it very very promiscuous so
if you'll just do it as a question mark

350
00:34:55,940 --> 00:35:04,170
and then directly into et si shadow and
just give you like you know make sense a

351
00:35:04,170 --> 00:35:09,820
lot of ways because it wants you to get
that PC shadow or the other files that

352
00:35:09,820 --> 00:35:12,730
user has spoken and diet

353
00:35:12,730 --> 00:35:20,109
simulated system right but this is this
creates a lot of problems like since the

354
00:35:20,109 --> 00:35:27,859
user has access to EC shadow over white
regular permission she should also be

355
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:33,750
able to access / progress very
problematic for her to try and simulate

356
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:40,350
because you can go through the PHD's and
seeing the actual processes running and

357
00:35:40,350 --> 00:35:46,880
then find out here if it makes sense
that this is an actual running that

358
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:53,230
you're seeing but at some point for
example gon to your side is running the

359
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:58,359
web and going to the memory maps of it's
obvious that the point that you can

360
00:35:58,359 --> 00:36:02,880
figure out the simulation and it's
behaving according to what you're doing

361
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:09,500
against the web and the only way to do
that is to integrate an actual at that

362
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:20,160
point but when we talk to the guys are
saying right this is we will never be

363
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:38,490
able to implement this way we can fix ya

364
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:48,029
for the incident a microphone wiry
because you just say thank you so

365
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:55,650
extreme that is just too and disabled
emissions but that doesn't make sense

366
00:36:55,650 --> 00:37:02,850
lennox permissions sense right and what
we learned is that the attacker

367
00:37:02,850 --> 00:37:11,339
exploiting simulate machine just got
your txt shoko class with us once

368
00:37:11,340 --> 00:37:16,470
allegedly put in his own files are
trying to steal the user's intention to

369
00:37:16,470 --> 00:37:20,770
take files and see where it's being used
for the really cool thing about this

370
00:37:20,770 --> 00:37:24,850
before we talk about the potential for
attribution to potential for taking two

371
00:37:24,850 --> 00:37:26,110
tools away

372
00:37:26,110 --> 00:37:30,560
list is of course can be about political
situations it's not it's never just

373
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:35,990
about IP addresses with your vision
becomes real now in Tucker needs to take

374
00:37:35,990 --> 00:37:39,919
no just about the machine and now it's
built to order they do their own thing

375
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:44,260
with the entire operation I can be
identified

376
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:48,400
integrally do my job if they go and work
on these machines which are due 2020

377
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:54,080
movement I can be potentially identified
and that changes the entire dynamics of

378
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:56,680
an operation how much effort you put
into it

379
00:37:56,680 --> 00:38:00,580
your cost of the operation and that is
the brilliance of Lucas really when he

380
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:05,029
puts it in its still as the internet
limitations would allow interaction I

381
00:38:05,030 --> 00:38:07,240
bought for immediate action

382
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:11,740
but he takes us to a whole other level
of making that I can think about these

383
00:38:11,740 --> 00:38:21,390
operations at risk as opposed to just
make all its risk of cervical cancer is

384
00:38:21,390 --> 00:38:30,069
a proprietary and it's a really cool
spots that are later the an open-source

385
00:38:30,070 --> 00:38:34,780
you know something else to configure and
with a lot of work it's it's actually

386
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:42,260
pretty simple to use it and also we had
a lot of fun working on it because every

387
00:38:42,260 --> 00:38:58,119
time kiss them sir sounds like fun
working with us so it doesn't really say

388
00:38:58,119 --> 00:39:04,220
it just runs services you can probably
imagine very very well

389
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:11,390
boundary alerting wright also alerts on
rockin quests and configure it is very

390
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:19,118
very important to do it very accurately
detecting cast and so for example he

391
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:25,640
says it's doing so and if you google the
source code you can find out there get

392
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:33,230
some friends and also the same basic car
with the HTTPS support and service

393
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:41,630
anything so simple to do that and get
out this website has reared on this

394
00:39:41,630 --> 00:39:42,640
website itself

395
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:49,660
indication isn't working doesn't have
been a real pleasure and also that a

396
00:39:49,660 --> 00:39:54,589
considerable amount of concurrent
connections towards blocks away so like

397
00:39:54,590 --> 00:40:02,840
seven until he also suffers from the
problem did you just send it for

398
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:07,900
society's then or like you and then you
can choose which I just want to block

399
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:13,350
away so what can we learn from places
where is that when you open source

400
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:21,609
community in the heart area products
offer from the same shoes ok know how in

401
00:40:21,609 --> 00:40:27,380
the world are deployed so what we did
was very specific scan and that is used

402
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:33,829
busy maps projects she just go online
music and i oh

403
00:40:33,829 --> 00:40:44,670
the web services periodically we just
took a scan and the 14th of July and any

404
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:50,019
other specifics since you have the
strength to say that many are and that's

405
00:40:50,019 --> 00:40:54,598
the only can we do but it shows like
very interesting stuff we will get into

406
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:58,440
right now just a disclaimer

407
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:03,869
the IP to an organization the standard
limitations apply right when you see the

408
00:41:03,869 --> 00:41:09,469
same IP being used by the same name same
organization all the time it's probably

409
00:41:09,469 --> 00:41:15,809
connected but it could also abandoned
house stinks hosting website at the time

410
00:41:15,809 --> 00:41:20,019
to respond it might have been a
different website we really nail down

411
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:26,089
what we think is the right attribution
to organizations so this is what it

412
00:41:26,089 --> 00:41:31,759
looks like the ones that are Taiwan and
the United States which deployed the

413
00:41:31,759 --> 00:41:38,959
most Danny parts which are publicly
exposed and so interesting to see the

414
00:41:38,959 --> 00:41:40,038
phone numbers

415
00:41:40,039 --> 00:41:46,180
taiwan wiews and after the United States
and will drop significantly there are

416
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:53,609
some very interesting countries here for
example you know countries and I guess I

417
00:41:53,609 --> 00:41:57,580
would imagine we're running on these
sites

418
00:41:57,580 --> 00:42:04,740
just a quick note that the country could
be different people were right on the

419
00:42:04,740 --> 00:42:10,649
silly to me that country naturally
attribution baby's dad right and when we

420
00:42:10,650 --> 00:42:17,620
start looking into your game and
declassified you are you can see the

421
00:42:17,620 --> 00:42:24,940
most points on the roller in 2010 in one
of the United States University shark or

422
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:30,080
want to go study there are ghosts are
you there and then another time when

423
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:33,880
he's University and one of the more
interesting so we found is that one of

424
00:42:33,880 --> 00:42:39,710
the top 20 years we found a lot of ideas
in that and then we went into that range

425
00:42:39,710 --> 00:42:44,850
they publish the show which these are in
the range of class service some of the

426
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:51,549
ladies and their ranges that costs are
there actual or you know the companies

427
00:42:51,550 --> 00:42:58,400
that was running these and also some
very interesting examples of

428
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,190
organizations because she didn't miss
you in advance for one the European

429
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:05,970
countries one of the biggest
international economic organizations use

430
00:43:05,970 --> 00:43:11,910
municipal authority in financial
services company a lot of time when he's

431
00:43:11,910 --> 00:43:20,490
down here and then we got one more hour
research blog one of the subdomains as

432
00:43:20,490 --> 00:43:29,040
Max 2009 as it is it's a mail server
just everything that I and one thing we

433
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:32,670
didn't cause a fire

434
00:43:32,670 --> 00:43:41,150
few routes to all that I he's in the
same subnet as well leave the points so

435
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:50,690
we went as we say he s service is giving
us what does it look like when you and

436
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:58,450
then we saw this so later we figured out
that open source projects out there

437
00:43:58,450 --> 00:44:06,569
called the modern three packages a lot
of different parts together and when

438
00:44:06,569 --> 00:44:16,029
you're loading it shows off and probably
one cases where we just got the lessons

439
00:44:16,030 --> 00:44:20,280
learned and here we really tried and
figured out how based on the detection

440
00:44:20,280 --> 00:44:25,089
of those projects that we saw how he
would build the ultimate robot or the

441
00:44:25,089 --> 00:44:32,808
ultimate the suction tool and just
realized these flaws are easy right

442
00:44:32,809 --> 00:44:41,559
shoulder press show here and there right
design like marcus evans emo there's

443
00:44:41,559 --> 00:44:47,250
really no way to fix this this is always
be a problem in all ways to tackle on

444
00:44:47,250 --> 00:44:54,280
rational thoughts and you will never be
able to capture or many thanks to her

445
00:44:54,280 --> 00:45:01,780
through using so what can we do to make
a good decision

446
00:45:01,780 --> 00:45:08,970
lesson to be learned from December and
kiwi sort of figured out it's still what

447
00:45:08,970 --> 00:45:17,040
they were for making something just
seeing any way you can get in forensics

448
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:23,850
to mitigate and that works to play the
service which artillery for example can

449
00:45:23,850 --> 00:45:31,350
do is just randomly then you gotta play
like we saw multiple occasions over the

450
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:37,819
program and then you gotta make the set
of services makes sense lyrics I know

451
00:45:37,820 --> 00:45:42,300
about that though some services are
genuine and it doesn't make sense for

452
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:48,000
all machine to look like that if another
series doesn't work that way so we want

453
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:52,790
to be able to get her to succeed against
us because the best way of collecting

454
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:56,370
forensic data that you can use to make
sure you want to meet the service is

455
00:45:56,370 --> 00:46:01,880
exploitable from Ron exploits and
obviously the next stage is being able

456
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:08,430
to make it possible to unknown exploits
right and you really can ever achieve

457
00:46:08,430 --> 00:46:14,490
this the state so I really cool things
too many important things to mention at

458
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:22,399
this point is that by itself as we've
seen it using the nineties for example

459
00:46:22,400 --> 00:46:28,570
is something that rumors that I will try
to describe is a machine that tucker

460
00:46:28,570 --> 00:46:32,780
went into for example there already on
your network if they also get there we

461
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:36,120
can catch them in the act which is a
major difference we're separating the

462
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:41,080
entire video deception campaign where
deception strategy or methodology from

463
00:46:41,080 --> 00:46:47,420
the early but the decoys a tool and used
to run back in the early two thousands

464
00:46:47,420 --> 00:46:51,400
and people connect meeting weight would
we were afraid to lure them in which

465
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:57,010
direction we had to take him in whenever
we deploy them and when you when you

466
00:46:57,010 --> 00:47:02,390
actually considering that is already
compromised the Tigers already ended up

467
00:47:02,390 --> 00:47:05,650
in you find it changes drastically

468
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:11,710
it's all about getting into the position
it's about making this this check fusion

469
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:17,069
possibly afterwards and a something that
really important to understand the stage

470
00:47:17,069 --> 00:47:25,270
and you know the optimal situation and
the fantasies Sheena attackers taking an

471
00:47:25,270 --> 00:47:31,690
actual machine to them like to write
this is just the way it was played as a

472
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:38,000
pyramid and we really hope seeing the
real she's solution very soon will your

473
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:43,720
leasing Co responsible to study was
completed in nineteen I mentor and just

474
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:48,078
really like to thank everybody who has
been working on these projects projects

475
00:47:48,079 --> 00:47:51,789
and all the people who is also this is
the research and here we have time for

476
00:47:51,789 --> 00:47:52,579
questions

477
00:47:52,579 --> 00:47:55,279
yeah but before the questions that
really important people have been

478
00:47:55,279 --> 00:47:57,130
working really hard with us

479
00:47:57,130 --> 00:48:01,329
disclosure vulnerability

480
00:48:01,329 --> 00:48:05,220
operationally so we talked a little
people and try to coordinate with a

481
00:48:05,220 --> 00:48:07,640
little people to make sure people don't
get hurt in which is another reason

482
00:48:07,640 --> 00:48:11,848
we're not disclosing code so valuable
new costs from last up in all these guys

483
00:48:11,849 --> 00:48:15,839
so I want to go through names I can't
actually see them to just read about it

484
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:19,609
don't sounds lame but the important to
us personally I want to see him try to

485
00:48:19,609 --> 00:48:24,049
put up to 3 p.m. names so I don't think
about them but I think the site is in a

486
00:48:24,049 --> 00:48:33,349
few minutes or so

487
00:48:33,349 --> 00:49:16,690
what you're getting into the building
but also into it right now just stole

488
00:49:16,690 --> 00:49:19,330
some holds a break in Palo vulnerable

489
00:49:19,330 --> 00:49:27,009
services are operating system and they
go to monitoring and so it's people

490
00:49:27,010 --> 00:49:39,460
tried any other questions

491
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:59,380
towards other questions

492
00:49:59,380 --> 00:50:24,700
so through to know it's very very well
not believing me but more importantly

493
00:50:24,700 --> 00:50:28,299
removing deception technology and
methodology which is why we're going

494
00:50:28,299 --> 00:50:32,519
through this and showing what works and
I we can make you better make sense

495
00:50:32,519 --> 00:50:39,089
other questions for those who like to
think quickly

496
00:50:39,089 --> 00:50:45,259
named elmer resume right here upset with
scans and our partner on sitting right

497
00:50:45,259 --> 00:50:48,210
there and everybody else if you have any
other questions want to talk to us

498
00:50:48,210 --> 00:50:52,579
please do and wanted on a project and
everybody else Lewis Marcus everybody

499
00:50:52,579 --> 00:50:55,500
and tell you what
