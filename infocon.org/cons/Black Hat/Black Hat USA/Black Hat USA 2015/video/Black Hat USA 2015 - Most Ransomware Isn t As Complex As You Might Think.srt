1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,250
this afternoon we have Indian kurta who
will be talking about most ransomware

2
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:09,400
isn't as complex as you might think as
always please remember to move your

3
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:15,440
regular mobile devices on silent so that
we're hearing just thank you very much

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,789
hi good afternoon everyone thanks for
showing up I have the pleasure of having

5
00:00:20,789 --> 00:00:25,910
the last session hopefully it's not the
curse of having the last session so

6
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:29,070
brief about my background sign my
computer science professor at

7
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:32,369
Northeastern University in Boston I've
been doing malware research for last 10

8
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:36,760
years or so and I helped build some
popular malware analysis systems like

9
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:42,050
movies exposure weapon it that some of
you have maybe using the past almost one

10
00:00:42,050 --> 00:00:45,399
of the co-founders of last thing that
does your day

11
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:49,820
threat protection so you work on malware
and last nine laps actually our research

12
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:56,800
on this work is partially based on a
study that my student my PhD student I

13
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,010
mean cause actual work done and I
published with some co-authors at a

14
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:05,908
conference called Mr 2054 there's a
scientific paper that goes with this

15
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:10,030
presentation if you google for cutting
the Gordian knot a look under the hood

16
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:13,860
of ransomware attacks goes on a spit out
the PDF and you know if you're

17
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:17,630
interested in the technical details I
would refer you to that paper so there's

18
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:22,280
definitely more information there I was
short session so that's why it's going

19
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:28,350
to be a short talk show some key to take
away from this presentation so the

20
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:32,490
majority of ransomware actually launches
relatively straightforward attack tables

21
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:36,530
when I see that ranch and we're both
menswear isn't complex some people are

22
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:40,770
gonna find out probably gonna say no but
ransom mayors malware you know they do

23
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:42,570
all these things actually complex

24
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,839
look at some examples you want to look
at the big picture on my aim is to set

25
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,220
the problem in perspective to show you
that not all of them actually our house

26
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:56,250
complex in many cases you got to see
relatively straightforward attacks and I

27
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:00,280
think there is school we should be able
to do things to actually detect some of

28
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:05,000
these attacks more more more efficiently
so things like using bad cryptography or

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,100
the use of standard cryptography library
is right which is something that

30
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:13,140
you might actually used to detect them
somewhere or sometimes files are deleted

31
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,299
but they're not wiped off this price
told you might actually have the chance

32
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:23,130
to recover the data so multiple rounds
where exactly equal so compared to other

33
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:26,769
types of malware ransomware actually has
a very distinct predictable behavior

34
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:31,670
right so we gonna go through some
examples for malware not granted there

35
00:02:31,670 --> 00:02:36,339
is a specific type of malware about he
does things that are quite unique around

36
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,370
somewhere things like a ransom notes
with background activity background

37
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:44,040
noise change of the entropy of files
right when things are being encrypted

38
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,890
the entropy of files change its original
or large numbers of file so these are

39
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:52,410
typically things you might not see any
other malware or in benign still there

40
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,370
so hopefully we should be able to use
these things to detect malware

41
00:02:55,370 --> 00:03:01,190
ransomware more effectively so what I
want to discuss the significance of the

42
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,550
ransomware threat so definitely is a
threat I'm not saying that it's not a

43
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:08,830
threat but not all threats are very
complicated although they might be

44
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:13,080
successful you want to look at the
complexity and sophistication of attacks

45
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,840
so what do you mean by complex and why
do most people think that when when they

46
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,400
hear of ransom really think it's
actually a very complex where the attack

47
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,480
mechanisms to actually see all their
work at nine tomorrow at a large scale

48
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,019
and one other mean renting weaknesses so
they do certain things but can you

49
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:36,040
actually use these weaknesses to be able
to detect ransomware more effectively

50
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:40,440
develop technologies that actually use
these weaknesses to detect a transformer

51
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,670
and also I'll be talking about the
better mitigation so my aim is to

52
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:50,089
hopefully close black hat with a
positive message right now all is lost

53
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:53,430
we should be able to actually do a
better job of at least detecting things

54
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:58,120
like rent somewhere just to recap say
what he goes around somewhere but what

55
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,140
are the typical be here is that pc

56
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:03,500
typical ransomware attack while of
course the Commission will be

57
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,450
compromised

58
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:09,190
than the ransomware were being sold
wright also attacked the Eagles executed

59
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:12,890
if there's an attack failed the
ransomware would be informed the victim

60
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:18,060
of the attacks or other types of malware
is actually quite distinct behavior at

61
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:21,810
something bad happens to you you get
infected and the ransom

62
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,990
tells you that you have been infected
right for you don't always have this

63
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:31,250
luxury in other types of malware but he
tells you that you saw the victim would

64
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:35,160
need to pay up of course otherwise the
data would be kept hostage or it will be

65
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,160
destroyed so any malware that actually
fits this category today like to say is

66
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:44,150
mine somewhere and you've been reading a
lot of course in media about this

67
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:50,479
because we've been seeing ransomware and
people are being attacked so classic

68
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:54,870
ransomware ransom notes will be
something like that so it is social

69
00:04:54,870 --> 00:04:58,720
engineer of course it looks like it's
coming from the Tennessee FBI all these

70
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:03,520
organizations at the same time it's also
the prison system right now and the

71
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,090
attackers are socially the victim into
believing that the victim has been

72
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:12,750
caught boasting illegal content right
and deceive you don't pay up

73
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,370
you want to be arrested the government's
not come after you and many people of

74
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:20,740
course especially and users are
technically sophisticated and a fall for

75
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:25,630
these camps for one interesting side
note of course is that there have been

76
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:30,610
cases where the bad guys who are
actually posting illegal content fell

77
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:35,110
for the socially drink scams and they
gave themselves up to police so maybe

78
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:39,260
that's one good thing that run somewhere
has done no one in a million years

79
00:05:39,260 --> 00:05:44,960
here's another example again these all
look quite similar the computer has been

80
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,880
locked its support from the FBI you have
to pay up in three days otherwise not

81
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,669
going to be arrested and many people
actually things and that's why

82
00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:59,460
effective but it's not too different
from other types of matters that you see

83
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:04,070
for example state TV where you know you
think that your bit buying a TV product

84
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:10,300
was actually FTE product so how has
ransomware evolved over the years

85
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:14,440
well the ransomware call said that she
dates back to the end of the eighties

86
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:18,919
right to the beginning of the nineties
so people came up with this idea it has

87
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:24,150
been around for a long time but it has
be rediscovered so clearly ransomware

88
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:27,630
attacks have actually decrease in the
number of numbers over the last five

89
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:30,760
years so we've been seeing more and more
of a ransomware

90
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:36,090
some of them are no more sophisticated
than easier variant damages are being

91
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:39,770
reported and it's interesting that
people like this idea of encryption

92
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:42,780
deletion especially is magical

93
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:46,280
that's why there are many reports and a
typical end user

94
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:51,570
you know thinks that ranch where is a
very complicated also this is fueled by

95
00:06:51,570 --> 00:06:56,190
many security report that talk about the
sophistication and the complexity of

96
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,070
individual attacks

97
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:02,010
report might save you just saw this
example know this sample does barry

98
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:05,570
encryption in a very very good way and
you cannot recover the data because the

99
00:07:05,570 --> 00:07:10,320
encryption to some reports like that
create the general impression and the

100
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:13,990
public that you're faced with a new
threat that is very difficult for that's

101
00:07:13,990 --> 00:07:18,580
impossible to prove quite as if the
information has been encrypted you know

102
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:25,109
very very good then we cannot decrypt if
you don't have the key there is truth in

103
00:07:25,110 --> 00:07:25,600
that

104
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:30,020
so some attacks are effective in simple
ones are effective here is an

105
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:34,890
announcement from the FBI that actual
reports that you know many people were

106
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:37,340
victims off the wall

107
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:41,760
many people ended up actually paying
money to keep the world and eighteen

108
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:46,070
million dollars were lost there is
damage right but the question is if you

109
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:50,159
look at the code if you analyze the
attack how much sophistication react to

110
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:54,690
seeing their right is this another type
of Stuxnet for Army dealing with common

111
00:07:54,690 --> 00:07:59,860
sense and common behaviors that you'll
see no other Mallory is around a lot

112
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:04,420
different than other types of malware
that we see out there

113
00:08:04,420 --> 00:08:11,650
somali and uses of course are victims of
no such attacks all is generally are

114
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:15,539
well protected so are typical company is
not going to be scared around somewhere

115
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:20,050
because they're going to have good
backup policies hopefully or you're

116
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:23,850
going to have systems that are more
effective against malware but there are

117
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:28,470
smaller organizations for example this
an example from a small town in

118
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:32,260
Massachusetts where the police and the
pain the ransom because their machines

119
00:08:32,260 --> 00:08:36,229
were attacking know they could not
recover the data but why is that

120
00:08:36,229 --> 00:08:39,750
happening is it happening because the
rent somewhere is very complicated or is

121
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,020
happening because the organization was
you prepare

122
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:46,000
and didn't have the right defenses
alright security policies so in this

123
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,860
case yes France and we're attacked them
but any other type of malware could have

124
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:57,490
also attacked them so what does complex
when we talk about this very complex

125
00:08:57,490 --> 00:09:03,330
very sophisticated so typical way of
measuring ransomware sophistication is

126
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:08,770
to look at the code and evasion by any
person is going to say oh yeah this is

127
00:09:08,770 --> 00:09:12,600
very complicated because you having a
tough time detecting it because we're

128
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,240
having a tough time to take to get it
must be complicated as short a certain

129
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,520
sophistication

130
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:22,850
will get things like packing we look at
dynamic checks we look at encryption

131
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:27,110
right by the using a good encryption
algorithm or Rd using a week 10 these

132
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:30,890
are the type of things that we actually
look at and I'm you say it's actually a

133
00:09:30,890 --> 00:09:35,540
complex attack so evasion of course is
not something that you only seen

134
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:38,349
ransomware you also see it in other
types of our

135
00:09:38,350 --> 00:09:43,030
actually common behavior it's not unique
to ransom ransom for things like storing

136
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:49,280
against the analysis environment or self
modifying called that adapts itself in

137
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:52,160
this work we actually looking at the
sophistication of the attack after

138
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,939
compromise so we need to look at what
ransom actually does he look at the big

139
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:01,560
picture of course their samples out that
do more nasa things than others but are

140
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:05,010
there and solve complex on these attacks
and then you can make up your mind about

141
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:14,480
it so to be able to do this he collected
samples so we took a look at the

142
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:20,230
ransomware look at samples from 2006 to
2014 we looked at more than 1,300

143
00:10:20,230 --> 00:10:25,890
samples covering 15 families including
modern family is like triple over the

144
00:10:25,890 --> 00:10:30,210
wall so we did this by a crawling the
web looking at public repositories

145
00:10:30,210 --> 00:10:35,400
getting some data from last night as
well and we analyze these files and try

146
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:39,540
to gain some insight into what we're
actually seeing what we saw in the past

147
00:10:39,540 --> 00:10:42,630
but we actually see today

148
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:48,670
so we did automated dynamic analysis for
all the samples in some cases the sample

149
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:52,829
issues we actually thought it was
necessary said he did

150
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:57,810
manual analysis 2001 challenge here is
if you are looking at any malware

151
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:01,540
samples how do you actually know that it
belonged that family holding on to its

152
00:11:01,540 --> 00:11:03,469
grip the local couple etcetera

153
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:07,640
so our methodology was that be
cross-checked with virustotal and three

154
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,439
or more scanners actually agreed on the
sample and gave it the same name he said

155
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,540
ok this looks like a sample from the
local group the Lola tetra so be created

156
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:21,280
a labeled dataset and all the samples
the actually looked that showed some

157
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:26,800
ransomware behavior

158
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:33,150
attacked a lot so encryption of course
is a popular thing right about 5% of the

159
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:38,600
samples that he actually looked at were
using some sort of encryption is

160
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:44,100
generally why well known that all the
samples used to implement this

161
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:49,040
encryption themselves so basically the
malware authors decided that they wanted

162
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:53,370
this so this custom encryption which
actually lead to mistakes will there be

163
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:58,860
many reports where you actually look at
the encryption actually not implemented

164
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:03,450
well or the attackers make mistakes like
leaving cheese on this and you can

165
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:06,730
actually use these things to decrypt the
data for this is something that has to

166
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:11,200
happen quite a bit in in the past so it
was not perfect

167
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,150
recently me seeing more samples that
actually use standard libraries right so

168
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:17,850
current popular families like the locker

169
00:12:17,850 --> 00:12:22,710
the wall used the video script libraries
so these are standard libraries and they

170
00:12:22,710 --> 00:12:27,240
are being used because their standard
libraries DVD Video the crypto key to

171
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,210
solving engineering so if something is
encrypted with them of course is

172
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:37,480
difficult to decrypt it right especially
the question though is is the softest

173
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:41,860
education or is this just puts off
enjoying every good for feed you know

174
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:46,640
that you don't implement encryption
algorithms your soft you things that

175
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:51,689
other people have implemented a verified
so this is actually good for the fact

176
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:54,740
that they are using standard libraries
is good practice

177
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:59,600
it just makes their products more stable
but it's not that sophisticated in this

178
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:04,820
and stop using standard libraries are
using strong krikalev is actually a

179
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:08,899
double edged sword for the attackers at
this at the one hand they can actually

180
00:13:08,899 --> 00:13:13,060
create damage that it makes you know
that's the rumor smoking that stuff for

181
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:17,699
us but the same time if UD dynamic
analysis if you look at this piece of

182
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:22,279
cold before it reaches the end users it
gives you the chance to catch certain

183
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:26,500
things such as to use of these libraries
so if you see something suspicious using

184
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:31,360
the library's meat-axe use that against
out some hope and you know that your

185
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:37,050
potential dealing with iraq somewhere
simple

186
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:42,339
deletion mechanisms so what 36% of the
five on the five most common ransomware

187
00:13:42,339 --> 00:13:43,830
found in a dataset

188
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:50,430
deleting files up the files but actually
be deleted so most of the deletion in

189
00:13:50,430 --> 00:13:54,660
fact was quite straightforward how would
a professional person do this he would

190
00:13:54,660 --> 00:13:59,600
actually came to wipe the disk so that
the data is it's difficult to recover

191
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,790
the data I could write or do this so you
would wipe that smile off to this but

192
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:10,449
most of them were of course lazy and
they were directly working on the master

193
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:15,510
file table entries and marking things as
being deleted but the data was still

194
00:14:15,510 --> 00:14:21,029
remaining on disk right so yes it was
deleted but he had the potential and the

195
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:24,529
possibility of recovering the data in
some of these samples because it wasn't

196
00:14:24,529 --> 00:14:29,959
actually completely corrupted right to
recover he was actually possible in many

197
00:14:29,959 --> 00:14:34,430
cases right for just because you are hit
by ransomware doesn't mean that you

198
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:39,760
cannot recover the data in some cases if
it's a simpler variant you might be able

199
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:45,040
to recover the data to but at the same
time this user could be an effective

200
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:49,279
venue for detecting around somewhere
doing analysis if you see that you know

201
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:55,149
a lot of nfte activity is being done BB
bulk deletions are being performed

202
00:14:55,149 --> 00:15:00,339
during the analysis that might be the
chance to say he does look suspicious

203
00:15:00,339 --> 00:15:04,440
be nice wouldn't typically do this
combine it with other things that you

204
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,279
see maybe

205
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:09,670
would give you the possibility of
detecting run somewhere more effectively

206
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:17,790
so many samples of course also locked
the desktop that another classic

207
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:22,420
ransomware behavior rather than deleting
things rather than encrypting them what

208
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:25,670
is a simple attacked you basically
locked the desktop and you keep the

209
00:15:25,670 --> 00:15:31,029
users although the desktop this is
classic ransomware behavior so more than

210
00:15:31,029 --> 00:15:35,689
60% of the samples we looked at you
think of this historically this was a

211
00:15:35,689 --> 00:15:40,290
very popular staying in the past few
things like create desktop to create a

212
00:15:40,290 --> 00:15:45,670
persistent your desktop and you just
locked user all the machine and because

213
00:15:45,670 --> 00:15:49,219
the end user is not very technically
sophisticated there is lost they can't

214
00:15:49,220 --> 00:15:53,249
recover the data but in reality the data
still damn right so you do have a chance

215
00:15:53,249 --> 00:16:01,620
to recover the data another approach is
to display HTML pages and disable

216
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:06,499
certain components so that is actually
difficult for the user to get rid of

217
00:16:06,499 --> 00:16:14,439
that so again deadlocked and they can't
access their machines in all cases a

218
00:16:14,439 --> 00:16:18,250
message was displayed to the victim
might remember the ransom note that you

219
00:16:18,250 --> 00:16:22,160
know I showed at the beginning if you
think about it they have very similar

220
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:26,980
messages right it says maybe there's a
local maybe that is the north of a

221
00:16:26,980 --> 00:16:32,199
payment so if you think about it these
messages are quite similar so we should

222
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:34,508
be able to do some sort of analysis as
well

223
00:16:34,509 --> 00:16:37,079
to be able to detect these type of
attacks especially if something is

224
00:16:37,079 --> 00:16:40,829
blocking the desktop and display it so
you know wait it's not that complicated

225
00:16:40,829 --> 00:16:44,399
also from the defense point of view
because there are things we can do

226
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:49,569
automatically to be able to detect this
type of an attack so locking mechanisms

227
00:16:49,569 --> 00:16:55,099
are also typically a nuisance but the
data is typically not harmed so the data

228
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:59,139
still there and if you feel more
technically sophisticated user can be

229
00:16:59,139 --> 00:17:03,160
skipped on like the desktop without
paying up of course what you're seeing

230
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:07,908
is that if there are simple things the
attackers take the simple route because

231
00:17:07,909 --> 00:17:10,809
it's you know you still make the money
you don't have to be super complicated

232
00:17:10,809 --> 00:17:15,459
so you know this is something that he
also seen other types of malware not

233
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:17,760
just in Renton where they take the
easiest path

234
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:25,930
better mediations so can we actually do
things to mitigate the threat no better

235
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:33,000
way so the Achilles heel of ransomware
actually is that the ransomware has to

236
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:36,790
inform the victim that the attack has
taken place this is actually quite

237
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:39,820
unique to run somewhere and this is
something that you don't see in other

238
00:17:39,820 --> 00:17:41,030
types of malware

239
00:17:41,030 --> 00:17:46,430
nasty mouth where he tried to remain
hidden he tried to remain healthy he

240
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:50,220
might inject themselves into other
process he's because you up he s you

241
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:53,740
wouldn't see it running right there
trying to hide activity and he tried to

242
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:59,070
remain over longer periods of time to be
doing bad malicious activity in the

243
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:03,850
background compared to that found
somewhere actually as defenders to us

244
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:08,669
gives the advantage that is actually
informs us light sweet tells us how you

245
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:13,880
been attacked just sold your files from
the defense point of view if you ally

246
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:17,580
saying something before it reaches the
end users it gives you that advantage it

247
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:23,820
tells you I am bad and I'm actually
infected you so this behaviour in ransom

248
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:28,740
yours nature right so this is something
that is difficult to change because the

249
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:33,070
attack you know this is how money is
made with rent somewhere and there are

250
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:38,820
certain behaviors that are predictable
so things like entropy changes when you

251
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:43,230
actually encrypting files the entropy of
that file changes which is one way that

252
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:47,400
you can detect that the file has been
corrupted or if a modal dialog is

253
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:50,900
displayed and there's some background
activity at the same time this is

254
00:18:50,900 --> 00:18:54,770
something that you can use to detect
suspicious man somewhere like behavior

255
00:18:54,770 --> 00:18:59,470
or accessing honey files what are you
doing dynamic analysis and you put these

256
00:18:59,470 --> 00:19:03,830
files that look like interesting files
but you create them and suddenly you see

257
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:07,230
that they are being touched and their
enterprise change so somebody's

258
00:19:07,230 --> 00:19:10,600
encrypting them this is behavior that
you would not seen

259
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:15,699
benign but this is something that run
somewhere do so the behemoth actually

260
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:18,780
should be predictable nature be
detectable so we should be doing a

261
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:25,470
better job in dynamic analysis systems
in catching things like that

262
00:19:25,470 --> 00:19:26,610
an example

263
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:30,899
so if you look at the locker and you run
it in a dynamic analysis environment the

264
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:35,400
types of behavior do with C will be
things like the auto stocks as modified

265
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:38,880
right why because the attackers trying
to make this persistent every time you

266
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:43,260
boot the same things the spate you would
see things like memory activities you

267
00:19:43,260 --> 00:19:46,460
would see network activities sold for
the things that you would also seen

268
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:50,900
other malware samples will be displayed
typically by around somewhere to put one

269
00:19:50,900 --> 00:19:54,830
thing that you would see potentially
will be evasion attempts right so they

270
00:19:54,830 --> 00:19:58,850
might be checking for specific image
file names or they might be checking for

271
00:19:58,850 --> 00:20:04,000
certain names not automatically get
typically listen to sound boxes or they

272
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,669
might look for certain indications that
the code is running in a sandbox to be

273
00:20:07,669 --> 00:20:11,870
able to detect this so yes evasion is a
possibility and that's this is what we

274
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:16,540
actually often say that say its
complexity but this is not connect

275
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:20,500
around somewhere but what is unique to
run somewhere is that you might see file

276
00:20:20,500 --> 00:20:24,850
activity so you might see things like
you know that distinct is searching for

277
00:20:24,850 --> 00:20:31,090
files across mounted drives or you might
see . it's it's a meeting or directory

278
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:35,379
site so you run it there is some
division but it sometimes bantamweight

279
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:39,230
like things that I because he's trying
to encrypt all the files very suspicious

280
00:20:39,230 --> 00:20:43,540
if you look at the report other things
you might be able to see it will be

281
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:47,730
loaded libraries right to see a bunch of
libraries are loaded their stand it was

282
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:53,600
their current operations but one thing
that actually pops up is that this using

283
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:58,500
crypt based on PLO right and what is
that that is actually Microsoft based

284
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:02,940
cryptographic API DLL so this quite soft
doesn't actually tell you that you're

285
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:07,130
dealing with a malicious sample because
be nice for fixed also use this when you

286
00:21:07,130 --> 00:21:10,610
start combining these things combining
these behaviors you have

287
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:14,990
usage you have won something that's
actually searching for many files in

288
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,650
some cases it might be displaying
something and doing this in the

289
00:21:17,650 --> 00:21:21,360
background when you start coordinating
these things and combining them we

290
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,909
should actually be doing a good job
protecting instincts and he's behavior

291
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:32,070
is actually not too complex so these are
things that we should be able to catch

292
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:36,270
so the key takeaway is again the
majority of the ransom actual launch is

293
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:39,889
relatively straightforward attack
penalty if you look at the attack that

294
00:21:39,890 --> 00:21:41,100
is taking place

295
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:46,669
yes encryption happens right and option
might be good but if you are doing some

296
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:49,870
analysis may be at the gateway or
something before this thing actually

297
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:51,409
hits to users

298
00:21:51,410 --> 00:21:54,040
you know you should be able to catch
things like the use of standard

299
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:58,420
cryptography libraries and even after
infection in some cases bad trip to ease

300
00:21:58,420 --> 00:22:02,390
use there are many examples of that or
things like files are deleted but

301
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:05,360
they're not wipe off this right so again

302
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,050
typically my little sis take the easiest
path and they don't always put a lot of

303
00:22:10,050 --> 00:22:12,879
complexity into whatever they create

304
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,230
it's not always Stuxnet that we talked
about that actually shows a lot of real

305
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:22,170
complex it compared to other types of
malware that tries to remain no style

306
00:22:22,170 --> 00:22:25,730
feat in the background ransom actually
has a very distinct predictable behavior

307
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:30,080
it does these things and we know that it
does these things things like ransom

308
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,810
note to the background behavior so you
might be able to do or see our full you

309
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:38,060
look at these images may go to magically
tried to expect certain words and then

310
00:22:38,060 --> 00:22:42,879
use them during your detection face to
actually detect malicious code like mine

311
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:48,990
somewhere or the changing the entropy of
files this is a difficult to to hide

312
00:22:48,990 --> 00:22:52,300
you see that happening you know that the
file is being equipped to fight for

313
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:57,270
things like that review indication that
allows you to catch on somewhere better

314
00:22:57,270 --> 00:23:04,520
with better technology or the duration
or large numbers of files so thanks so

315
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,990
much I have 23 minutes for questions
you'd like to ask a question

316
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:12,750
otherwise I'm happy to take questions
offline I'll be here thank you
