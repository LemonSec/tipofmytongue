1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,510
hello and hope my role on today will
tell you some stories about my name is

2
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:16,240
Alexander itself basically for now we're
totally unemployed researchers and

3
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:23,570
penetration testers also we lack of
matter a bit so I think we'll get up

4
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:29,750
it today to find a way out tried to
cover some engineering parts of our

5
00:00:29,750 --> 00:00:37,329
research how it went and then the second
part on Excel will tell you about kind

6
00:00:37,329 --> 00:00:43,989
of business and talked about things with
this kind of stuff

7
00:00:43,989 --> 00:00:48,230
small project

8
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:56,010
total needed to create our own urine
test network and as you all know there

9
00:00:56,010 --> 00:01:02,750
is an open source project doesn't convey
beat but it's no matter how also visits

10
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:10,789
to Gianni and so it couldn't help I will
go and how slowly started to walk to

11
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,090
look towards

12
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:20,520
kinda cheap hotels as a platform to
build on and apparently followed by the

13
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:35,500
way you Apr 21 of its sold to a number
of Chinese science no matter that its

14
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:48,010
officials contend it works in some
promising feelings about what awaits us

15
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:57,810
turns out that the past our goal wasn't
as simple as we wanted to be an

16
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:08,759
excellent way so we tried to look into
it kind of dip and found out after

17
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:12,700
looking for the publicly available
interfaces were found on the web

18
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:18,859
interface with us and with it and found
out that both consisted of two both

19
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:30,620
while many bars and write about so one
thing a personal attention it was at 26

20
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:35,640
pin to cannot amend boat and we thought
we could get some interesting stuff of

21
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:39,950
the 10 26 pants could be a lot of fun

22
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:47,929
some debugging face especially when it
says kinda debug folder keep things

23
00:02:47,930 --> 00:02:55,840
simple way to do it because it's
flipping through walls so we don't find

24
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:02,890
and started to prague all the pins
Senate title house in another trying to

25
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:06,380
find some correlations and electrical
problems

26
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:16,690
pendant 60 positions sold that one of
the teams and secondly when I responded

27
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:28,030
will eventually find out that this is
Josh p.m. sticks and rocks so we

28
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:29,100
discovered that

29
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:34,630
those rare talks there by connecting was
also know that the Xbox has attracted

30
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:42,240
quite a bit of attention in the security
community and so it was kind of

31
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:44,640
interesting things for us

32
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:51,089
found out the CPU the kind of action /
for them and the fact that it's going to

33
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:59,480
boot to flesh so how did it go

34
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:08,310
the body was waiting for a key press and
if it didn't look impressed on the yacht

35
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:13,160
interface it would it turn normal mode
to the main software which recorded

36
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:22,360
blooper remote where everything is as
usual it's kinda and it's not a web

37
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:28,870
interface he also previously opposite if
we interrupted the boot up process by

38
00:04:28,870 --> 00:04:36,140
press any key to adopt him to the some
kind of weeks what shall we call it a

39
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:41,680
radical mode in which you can definitely
tell it the metrics as long as like

40
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,890
discovering all kind of things so again
about the loophole mode is just the

41
00:04:46,890 --> 00:05:01,620
plain woman so just conflagration face
for the concealer kinda boring opposite

42
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:02,830
retro most

43
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:16,409
an instant rice we found out that it
exposed some debug capabilities even

44
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:28,330
interpreter football 5+5 system Texas
and basically broken support so sorry

45
00:05:28,330 --> 00:05:35,419
one by one the debug subsystem it has
good help in half

46
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:41,920
so it has all the things you need to
debug your looking less code for the

47
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:47,840
truck's brakes on step like trains
disaster all kinds of things more than

48
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:56,289
that it can even manage some running
task what can be kinda memory dumps

49
00:05:56,290 --> 00:06:05,590
memory at its greatest manipulation and
even-handed approach into it so no one

50
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:13,359
was there for us like one of the most
interesting thing was found that the

51
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:22,070
show itself the tractor show was in fact
kind of see interpreter so you could

52
00:06:22,070 --> 00:06:28,430
write to see code and executive and
executed line by line by line

53
00:06:28,430 --> 00:06:35,790
resting place so I tested we wrote some
code

54
00:06:35,790 --> 00:06:49,170
personality and now try to show them how
it worked for us so I came to this

55
00:06:49,170 --> 00:07:06,610
device get in the front seat conversion
and then just gotta based on our code

56
00:07:06,610 --> 00:07:18,740
credence assault trust structure and
member of Xbox minded tribe interest in

57
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:38,430
the past hour and then we just issue 4
comments to connect and write something

58
00:07:38,430 --> 00:07:46,790
like I do you think so it's kind of like
you had a nice personality for sure I'll

59
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:56,620
just hold a pencil and executed right
away

60
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:03,919
also ahead for flash file system access
right out of the box it has all the

61
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:05,979
usual comments

62
00:08:05,979 --> 00:08:11,699
2004 system list editorial director is
recursive listing which you can see on

63
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:19,600
the right you can take your files by all
the way around you can see in the left

64
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:26,840
corner apartment of the main
configuration file you have seen which

65
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:35,699
Toyota sold critical condition said it
was time to sell as it wasn't already

66
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:41,960
enough these guys also left some
networking capabilities so we could

67
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:51,440
transfer files back in first gear and
remote shell so also

68
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:58,370
started looking for what's running
actually on this board we found please

69
00:08:58,370 --> 00:09:01,379
three interesting tusks self explanatory

70
00:09:01,379 --> 00:09:06,970
the tell it to be served and WGBH

71
00:09:06,970 --> 00:09:14,269
proceeded to face as they lost task with
the red line you see it down it's a task

72
00:09:14,269 --> 00:09:18,800
which actually boots up some may say a
prayer for the blue pill mold if we're

73
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:25,540
really only because it will just go
first and resume to the normal function

74
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:42,829
of it so that come out again here in
this society long-running map is all of

75
00:09:42,829 --> 00:09:55,569
them but the problem when we should the
review process or device we can not see

76
00:09:55,569 --> 00:10:05,939
this anymore so we wanted to do how to
work with this kind of forward first

77
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:11,709
time with first place we wanted to get
rid of all these past two hours and you

78
00:10:11,709 --> 00:10:19,699
are still we made an assumption that
during the boot up the system actually

79
00:10:19,699 --> 00:10:29,128
the service started before it jumped
over the global mode so trying to it is

80
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:35,019
that simple little cold trying to
connect to the toilet and issues some

81
00:10:35,019 --> 00:10:41,499
comments to stop them but into
medication and on the right you can see

82
00:10:41,499 --> 00:10:49,980
the logo this actually talking to us
conduct a mild one out and then you can

83
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:54,899
see that just stopped and talked to
people which

84
00:10:54,899 --> 00:11:01,410
after which would connect our script and
can connect to the 23 portal thomas

85
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:08,079
Howell and throw away all these wires
and closed about what communis well tell

86
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:21,319
it so much we needed to get the code of
the main software global called a lot of

87
00:11:21,319 --> 00:11:30,498
ways to do this the most obvious by time
is just to dump it all with the comments

88
00:11:30,499 --> 00:11:40,759
after the firmware of the blue contacts
and then parse it but it's kind of slow

89
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:46,019
most remember that there was wbrc

90
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:58,079
which is kind of famous stuff such as a
sport model which made public is dumping

91
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,540
the whole memory by this

92
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:10,009
means so it was the things we tested and
they work out for awhile it gave us food

93
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:20,319
ready for the right side console itself
and does ready to go for analysis it

94
00:12:20,319 --> 00:12:23,300
would be even more awesome if someone
could write

95
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:30,649
natural tobacco use in this capability
is with her report profile chillin

96
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:40,190
Metasploit remember in Redmond our song
but somewhere out there so this time we

97
00:12:40,190 --> 00:12:50,380
came to the best of our out for us for
complete analysis

98
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:56,640
as I've already mentioned we had broken
power the bug symbols and we had a

99
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:03,420
simple table which we need to talk early
with a lot of code with it was simple

100
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:14,900
but a Python script and after which it
looks quite what you can see all the

101
00:13:14,900 --> 00:13:21,980
simplest this kind of miffed example one
function which relates to how this

102
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:29,040
device handles its licensing licensing
actually is this long basics to

103
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:34,420
fostering on the down side

104
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:39,649
which is which turns out to be encrypted
by ace

105
00:13:39,649 --> 00:13:40,710
and

106
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:55,120
small about task was to find out how to
decrypt it we did it wasn't a problem we

107
00:13:55,120 --> 00:14:03,100
found out that there is a static part of
key which is limited and actually the

108
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:11,090
rest was just last six fights last six
characters of so-called that the

109
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:16,740
UniqueID of the device that it was quite
simple as a binding global which

110
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:24,990
tourists searching for a licensed mental
preparation of main features such as

111
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:35,340
data bandwidth and our capabilities from
Microsoft 10 2012 cells so analysis

112
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:38,200
actually wanted

113
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:44,030
to execute our corner booth homo here we
didn't want to stay or always in this

114
00:14:44,030 --> 00:14:53,939
blog entry the bootloader and again it
was placed always do it first is long

115
00:14:53,940 --> 00:15:01,210
and boring the law the former director
rich clawed back hopes all goes well as

116
00:15:01,210 --> 00:15:09,070
alternate tricks arms caches and so
nothing as we thought was quick and

117
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:19,390
dirty and the plot to be quick but it's
just thought we wanted to try to take

118
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:29,100
over control dynamic loads and loads so
far this we needed some kind of some

119
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:39,210
piece of software which could be
injected upon written upon some

120
00:15:39,210 --> 00:15:43,480
obviously security function in the blue
pill

121
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:46,560
actually which rose

122
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:55,020
the one that those entering the password
for web interface we're over it was

123
00:15:55,020 --> 00:16:01,100
small but that

124
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:05,660
as you can see it opens a socket

125
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:12,370
received some compounds he called on the
circuit ok i'm for it and

126
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:21,900
balance practice balls in your task out
of them so when somebody wanted to look

127
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:27,770
into the first pictures from the socket
would empower called the executor to get

128
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:34,449
everything back nice and clean but it
was not quick

129
00:16:34,449 --> 00:16:40,439
actually not trust us to be created
equal

130
00:16:40,439 --> 00:16:48,959
during a so second batch of these
devices were found out that some of them

131
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:54,000
did not have anything of this interfaces

132
00:16:54,000 --> 00:17:03,860
that described right now I wasn't telnet
no WBR proceed looking to go out it was

133
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:07,130
kind of sad for us because we wanted to

134
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:13,470
buildup on the cheap little but for him
to continue to research to give it back

135
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:21,079
to the community 20 kind of its result
this interface is that was not what it

136
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:30,909
so we tried to think hard whether it was
lost and there was no actually

137
00:17:30,910 --> 00:17:39,050
we took a while I guess I'll just 26 pin
connector

138
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:51,510
time we found out that we did it from
kind of moments away with it also

139
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:55,990
depends on ground where did had to do it

140
00:17:55,990 --> 00:18:01,240
which we're blessed with a target now
open source

141
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:04,390
sketch for the banana

142
00:18:04,390 --> 00:18:09,040
connected all the prince told of these
nicotine so that I didn't do it started

143
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:17,409
but fawcett looking for JTAG pins and I
like the critical it's quite slow

144
00:18:17,410 --> 00:18:20,200
process on the marina and

145
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:26,610
nonetheless have to somehow or so we've
got it and it was a total you actually

146
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:31,280
checked all bones and all these great
thanks

147
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:37,010
so this was a doctor we need to follow
to

148
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:43,100
achieve this availability of the
platform at the cheap fun and

149
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:52,250
interesting to build on so we connected
in a strange way to gain the right

150
00:18:52,250 --> 00:19:03,620
adapter so we just very connected to the
attack beans on the board eventually was

151
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:09,010
refreshed version of open LCD that
suppose been banging you can use the TPS

152
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:10,250
had written up to

153
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:14,430
so there you go

154
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:20,260
we try to connect with you this process
will you can for some special

155
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:22,530
information and so on

156
00:19:22,530 --> 00:19:23,889
was

157
00:19:23,890 --> 00:19:34,250
actually the arm 926 EJ process and kill
can see that not what we expected so

158
00:19:34,250 --> 00:19:37,570
what's wrong with it what's wrong with
optimism

159
00:19:37,570 --> 00:19:48,030
turned up no there was another set of
people the boat on his jumper pins was

160
00:19:48,030 --> 00:19:51,760
some label underneath it

161
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:59,240
talk which said JTAG mode 0 and one
turns out that switch and generous with

162
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:05,910
good access different interfaces for
different devices there are still this

163
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:12,700
and our process that we were looking for
that I want was when we set up the jump

164
00:20:12,700 --> 00:20:21,270
of the day technology so terrific

165
00:20:21,270 --> 00:20:25,779
here is the output open Oct was
conducted successful

166
00:20:25,779 --> 00:20:27,830
and

167
00:20:27,830 --> 00:20:33,529
full blown debugging interface with
remote to be attached to openness of the

168
00:20:33,529 --> 00:20:41,340
interface you can register as modified
by a modified jumbo loan without us help

169
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:47,889
but wait we really drop

170
00:20:47,890 --> 00:20:51,710
and will total the way we could make it
more convenient

171
00:20:51,710 --> 00:20:55,040
grandis improved from the first look

172
00:20:55,040 --> 00:21:05,970
it can connect to remote but shows kind
of bullshit members so drunk that we

173
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:11,050
tried to google google some of these
messages and actually internets for

174
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:18,620
things it was to the rescue and was sold
this problem was a small bush actually

175
00:21:18,620 --> 00:21:23,469
people already doing the fold them all
the change to us of court some

176
00:21:23,470 --> 00:21:28,250
modifications and try again

177
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:39,720
and their egos can expect more of the
convenient interface to analyze it on

178
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:47,360
the run time it has all these all you
need is just to dump all this memory

179
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:59,560
again using generic it's doable then you
just ripped apart a script quarterly no

180
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:08,179
symbol table to hold you in the banking
and do whatever we are kinda glad to see

181
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:15,940
it cuz it restored our faith that with
such capabilities we could modify the

182
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:22,070
control flow in any way would like to
for example just replace it with a

183
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:24,939
well-liked from while first time to sell

184
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:35,920
so the girls and the conclusions for my
pot the kind of the cloaks both

185
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:43,050
engineering hardware stuff we must
always some devices and not all away

186
00:22:43,050 --> 00:22:52,800
during the last time and actually quite
a few times we see this

187
00:22:52,800 --> 00:23:00,639
real-time also expects a lot of medical
devices USB modems smartphones you name

188
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:08,440
it especially was much about where they
like that sometimes when you think there

189
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:17,670
is no walks this season and poking
around underneath it it's two weeks

190
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:23,780
folks controlling over the radio Paz
stuff require real-time operational so

191
00:23:23,780 --> 00:23:29,870
the last time to load close

192
00:23:29,870 --> 00:23:33,110
friends and colleagues well what can do
this

193
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:45,209
similar research about the trucks and
telecom telecom devices this thinks we

194
00:23:45,210 --> 00:24:17,500
think that due to increasing deployments
of deployments on target devices with

195
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:22,540
increased work site has some more
thorough and deep research from the

196
00:24:22,540 --> 00:24:30,149
community from all you guys there are
things to be researched and

197
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:40,310
that I think to be found please go poke
with your finally spoke out there that

198
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:48,879
you can hack so this was a fun part of
the song was stupid pictures now it's

199
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:55,730
kinda hard core with audio from Alex say
about our actual telecom paintings so

200
00:24:55,730 --> 00:25:04,730
please welcome our site

201
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:18,190
part it was about 12 thought you know
about weeks forms but actually watch

202
00:25:18,190 --> 00:25:25,280
networks for example on the on the
screen you can see you in September so

203
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:31,460
that's connected internet security
gateway which is connected to the US to

204
00:25:31,460 --> 00:25:36,710
the song so there are too many different
region people here

205
00:25:36,710 --> 00:25:44,700
variations that will blow your mind but
actually want to hear it what does

206
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:46,690
security gateway

207
00:25:46,690 --> 00:25:53,980
ordinarily p.m. it protects all the
connections on trust that if you're

208
00:25:53,980 --> 00:26:01,980
looking to the white party London
channels these details and trusted

209
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:08,780
because everything inside the core
network is trusted you don't want to

210
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:15,678
mess with it works in the main road so
there is no between two to get the

211
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:22,690
household and guys from the concern some

212
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:33,950
thought that a key or europe seem good
way to protect this connection against

213
00:26:33,950 --> 00:26:41,750
malware or evil purposes what is
actually obscene or if it's just

214
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:52,150
randomly to the SIM card and it returns
to 52 or sector reform its over there

215
00:26:52,150 --> 00:26:59,340
here that the security securely inside
the SIM card you repeated three times to

216
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:07,040
get enought metro and with this you can
connect with them on the reverse side

217
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:20,980
there is a Sturgis with these they do
the same things every picard really

218
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:28,830
secure element it seems legit but
basinger summit indication you can take

219
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:37,560
the SIM card out of the cell and
everyday 2020 GSM networks are not reply

220
00:27:37,560 --> 00:27:44,770
protect protection so their first prompt

221
00:27:44,770 --> 00:27:50,100
control over the time to sell over the
New York we take SIM card out of the

222
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:58,820
terminal inserted into day two different
pairs of random number and he came from

223
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:07,200
this and with the piece of software
software and data actually can connect

224
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:13,110
from the cell to yourself and gain
control over sensitive information that

225
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:21,070
is possible through through this channel
there is a way to do horrible things to

226
00:28:21,070 --> 00:28:26,779
connect elsewhere not connect him to
sell to you but we think that would be

227
00:28:26,779 --> 00:28:36,060
there is well known as trucks 1

228
00:28:36,060 --> 00:28:47,139
that has different levels of EP 10 this
variance is simple you create the state

229
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:56,830
troopers and substituted in construction
and actually there is consideration for

230
00:28:56,830 --> 00:29:10,360
such a thing you can connect most of the
based on but actually it's small text

231
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:16,709
their presentation will be made public
later so you can just the world take

232
00:29:16,710 --> 00:29:23,850
this configuration inside the tunnel
things interesting it's because its

233
00:29:23,850 --> 00:29:32,770
interface that is kind of protected
areas with you open points 100 already

234
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:38,080
said there was on the details from
outside from the inside there was

235
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:50,820
different kind of bolts from samples
centerfire 10069 there is a CPA Review a

236
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:59,689
different kind of things but too many
shoulders increases you need Benjamin so

237
00:29:59,690 --> 00:30:11,240
so it's Gold Coast here and there are
two different parts of it its initial

238
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:21,310
hamas this provides basic authentication
of the cell where the FBI and serving as

239
00:30:21,310 --> 00:30:26,230
your mouse cursor from moving from one
place to another

240
00:30:26,230 --> 00:30:31,260
delegating program provides
congressional pretty apart for example

241
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:34,070
provides information to vote

242
00:30:34,070 --> 00:30:44,280
channels scrambling codes and so this
provides access to get away it's a it's

243
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:58,440
a key component to so many other so what
are you can we stations enabled them up

244
00:30:58,440 --> 00:31:03,160
into pieces you can get information
about users connected to this one to

245
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:09,590
sell you can get in formation abode
difficulties for goodness sake and so on

246
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:16,850
and so forth but there is also not much
interest because we want to create our

247
00:31:16,850 --> 00:31:26,129
own network so we provided IP address of
the way home gateway and undersell

248
00:31:26,130 --> 00:31:33,640
connects to it with a clear political
especially in the sales we're in the

249
00:31:33,640 --> 00:31:39,190
core network you should send your
details on this incident elsewhere

250
00:31:39,190 --> 00:31:45,550
because it was really good and there's
nothing to be done and what happened to

251
00:31:45,550 --> 00:32:00,090
sell connected to the way ready to help
us we have four different begins

252
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:08,080
that night the second sandbar shark
accepting requests and hopefully it will

253
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:18,240
be but can't accept the request just
like that there is a protocol which is

254
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:25,039
the base for the all the connections
from the photocell to the core network I

255
00:32:25,039 --> 00:32:35,510
L scandal in Linux Linux thinks where I
want it has been things to access your

256
00:32:35,510 --> 00:32:44,350
software it's widely used in telecoms
but long story short every 23 minutes

257
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:51,939
breaks no good reason maybe it's what
was available so maybe it was my hands

258
00:32:51,940 --> 00:33:01,700
and after the recession but its protocol
that is used for get away and as pretty

259
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:08,690
simple issues Cerberus story itself or
network and you can just accept it and

260
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:11,250
when the user connection to you

261
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:16,820
accepted as well so that so

262
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:21,330
come to the moment without any
connection to regional telecom software

263
00:33:21,330 --> 00:33:31,340
hardware or software was ready to accept
users to eat well and achievement but

264
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:41,139
not easy there is different domains
inside the telecom network its sales

265
00:33:41,139 --> 00:33:44,070
domain

266
00:33:44,070 --> 00:33:57,240
voice messages and PAS domain for
internet when to sell it to a different

267
00:33:57,240 --> 00:34:03,060
to the office so location of it requests
and if you try and just accepted it will

268
00:34:03,060 --> 00:34:12,370
fail I was about to die and didn't know
what to do i dont no specification bowed

269
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:17,350
5:30 discs just as PDFs with different
versions with different information

270
00:34:17,350 --> 00:34:25,350
documents linking to the other documents
that these documents and other ways and

271
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:35,630
so there is a plane planes to read but
there are a number of things that really

272
00:34:35,630 --> 00:34:40,260
useful for creating a network it's

273
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:47,230
2400 aid its basic core network
protocols describes pretty much

274
00:34:47,230 --> 00:34:54,719
everything about how to connect how to
manage the connection and took indicate

275
00:34:54,719 --> 00:35:01,810
and also provides information about
indication encouraging networks there

276
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:03,540
are different boss wants

277
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:12,390
news I C 03 genetics are protected from
the jet X Games to the base station so

278
00:35:12,390 --> 00:35:20,920
it's really impossible but we found some
different things that enjoyable inside

279
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:31,210
not normal behavior for example we can
issue an interview request prior to was

280
00:35:31,210 --> 00:35:39,780
information about inside and so this
commission actually is

281
00:35:39,780 --> 00:35:51,130
that information that you used to pull
someone over the air and control the

282
00:35:51,130 --> 00:36:00,490
subscriber I am I so we can create our

283
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:08,470
sure that want to be need to also but
can provide information about where the

284
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:15,740
person he is and what he's doing so and
the user can be ended by both the SIM

285
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:23,240
card and by phone so if you take out the
SIM card from but other one

286
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:30,870
telecom network can also follow you and
when the same they that they can't

287
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:40,190
storm cell phones don't trust them there
is jim information you provide inside

288
00:36:40,190 --> 00:36:42,220
information about

289
00:36:42,220 --> 00:36:49,890
the network connection for example you
can use his full name you can change the

290
00:36:49,890 --> 00:36:56,080
time zone for example here trouble and
different local time

291
00:36:56,080 --> 00:37:06,970
well there are interesting talk on the
book had last year about personal issues

292
00:37:06,970 --> 00:37:16,259
yes protection we brought us it was
based on the internet connections so

293
00:37:16,260 --> 00:37:24,580
what's running faster and justice is
blowed but there are different

294
00:37:24,580 --> 00:37:30,819
restrictions for example the main one is
so all the data is claimed to shoot so

295
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:44,690
you can't just send information to plant
in Tennessee next just sense in beating

296
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:54,630
the past and we all take it without the
station and the most interesting part

297
00:37:54,630 --> 00:38:01,700
about him here he's not really there are
different opportunities to bypass

298
00:38:01,700 --> 00:38:10,970
integrity checks those checks that way
station

299
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:12,879
specification

300
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:21,599
it's impossible but with the bed copes
but if it is to use it you can do

301
00:38:21,599 --> 00:38:23,309
different things

302
00:38:23,309 --> 00:38:34,119
example conditions can send ever to rest
on your cell base station and for

303
00:38:34,119 --> 00:38:48,580
example you can take her to chase them
with us

304
00:38:48,580 --> 00:39:21,970
Redhill and our whole we issued comments
to bring it to life

305
00:39:21,970 --> 00:40:06,740
difference

306
00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:24,200
2004 and that is why Boston tickets
because we don't have any information

307
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:27,919
about he's distorting

308
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:33,930
SIM cards we just posted

309
00:40:33,930 --> 00:40:50,399
of every person as you can but it's kind
of dog do now service subscribers that i

310
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:57,369
connect into a fender self said it was
can see multiple sources that doesn't

311
00:40:57,369 --> 00:41:07,980
mean but the most interesting part is by
nurses can be used to give give a team

312
00:41:07,980 --> 00:41:20,470
from the SIM card there were researched
by speakers and you can conduct all

313
00:41:20,470 --> 00:41:28,419
those attacks that the transcript of
countries by the air over 3G so if

314
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:33,430
you're desirable to gene your phone
still not protect it and the update

315
00:41:33,430 --> 00:41:42,399
fails I wouldn't it be later what are
indications integrity control in the GSM

316
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:52,020
introduced this year just to say thank
you for it as a condition just four

317
00:41:52,020 --> 00:42:01,038
bytes of data that is sent back to base
station and that's it doesn't operate

318
00:42:01,039 --> 00:42:13,259
the phone doesn't address space station
for example there are two keys that is

319
00:42:13,259 --> 00:42:22,619
used to build and dignity for decorative
and ask for proof of things to keep both

320
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:28,650
for client base station they both should
know this kid and it should be saved by

321
00:42:28,650 --> 00:42:40,239
and recipes redundant but there is a
standard that it's not well known their

322
00:42:40,239 --> 00:42:46,459
opportunities to connect four different
cells example SIM card doesn't provide

323
00:42:46,459 --> 00:43:01,269
just a key indication when it came out
indicating and as for it just it was

324
00:43:01,269 --> 00:43:12,790
among them into attacks

325
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:21,650
others to talk more generally better
they are using

326
00:43:21,650 --> 00:43:28,640
protection against replayed takes so you
can just take one confirmation from the

327
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:38,680
scene cuts for a longer time but there
is an opportunity for just me just for

328
00:43:38,680 --> 00:43:48,169
you yes it's just a month indication we
sent only one randomly turned to the SIM

329
00:43:48,170 --> 00:44:00,650
card it received 64 bit key and but we
should obtain integrity and savory

330
00:44:00,650 --> 00:44:09,329
come up with an idea why we just needed
some way so we decreasing but forcing

331
00:44:09,329 --> 00:44:16,960
resistance to 64 bits and actually there
is an opportunity to create rainbow

332
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:23,520
tables for UMTS the kitchen and to break
it in the matter of seconds so maybe in

333
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:31,990
a matter of minutes and there are some
actual quote from the standard where

334
00:44:31,990 --> 00:44:42,589
they can continue until he's 40 Frankie
foreign keys for the simple whatever

335
00:44:42,589 --> 00:44:47,270
possible doctor richter's if you want to
connect someone to 3G network you can

336
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:55,869
use Creek and topping kisi forgiving
rent this information to any subscriber

337
00:44:55,869 --> 00:45:08,590
to the time to sell you can use such
information from the cancer cells

338
00:45:08,590 --> 00:45:23,520
area and without the proximity to the
gym or just use smart card for those who

339
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:31,910
will understand this screen shows that
all data that sent

340
00:45:31,910 --> 00:45:43,670
card is just one issue actually predict
connection what I getaways in couple of

341
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:52,750
days we are going to issue talk it for
themselves

342
00:45:52,750 --> 00:46:01,070
create your own the box you can have
functional security gate with management

343
00:46:01,070 --> 00:46:08,640
so you can have me get away and
secretion to connect some or all of your

344
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:14,589
SIM cards to the femtocell and receive
SMS from it it's a serious ocean-going

345
00:46:14,590 --> 00:46:23,590
so this code will be updated there will
be different cures for example for now

346
00:46:23,590 --> 00:46:38,740
we're going to carry over the 3G create
our own region that we have friendly

347
00:46:38,740 --> 00:46:48,229
femtocell actually can be bought from
different changes

348
00:46:48,230 --> 00:47:00,210
marketplaces and the knowledge about
this is not everything that good books

349
00:47:00,210 --> 00:47:05,220
because there are different
opportunities to do things wrong and

350
00:47:05,220 --> 00:47:11,069
different opportunities to do things
right and actually it's kinda think like

351
00:47:11,070 --> 00:47:15,890
that you can use by itself to do this

352
00:47:15,890 --> 00:47:22,990
opportunities for future plans are you
going to pride diplomat analysis

353
00:47:22,990 --> 00:47:30,319
analysis of the digital signal process
there are different opportunities to

354
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:37,040
over 4,000 because I someone is friendly
interface because there are different

355
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:48,869
opinions $0.02 entertainment of the
protocol and have fun we are thankful

356
00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:53,520
for friends and colleagues different
guys from the internet

357
00:47:53,520 --> 00:48:01,850
helped us in our search form slump or
mister off or Michelle Marie for

358
00:48:01,850 --> 00:48:06,130
different stuff thankyou any questions
