1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,129
good morning and welcome to the second
session and briefings that black had

2
00:00:03,129 --> 00:00:07,160
2015 just a couple of announcements
first of all there will be a reception

3
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:13,080
tonight in the business hall at 5:30 the
Business College located in Shoreline a

4
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:22,330
also the party awards take place tonight
in Mandalay BCD at 6 p.m. we want to

5
00:00:22,330 --> 00:00:28,880
thank you for coming and you are in
Laguna currently for the breaking HTTPS

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:36,329
with BGP hijacking IR Tim Jago one
reminder please no matter how cool your

7
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:39,950
ringtone is we really don't wanna hear
it so make sure those cell phones are on

8
00:00:39,950 --> 00:00:48,719
silent and with that are two handed over
to thank you very much so

9
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:51,820
higher one

10
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:57,730
standard my name is ok for those of you
who don't know how to spell this story

11
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:05,640
right there in the title breaking a GPS
will be hijacking and first of all

12
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:14,000
what's the BJP hijacking well I guess
some of you almost have you are already

13
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:21,619
familiar with the terms however let me
do some introduction and might well

14
00:01:21,619 --> 00:01:28,920
doing this will also agree on some
important definitions and the first of

15
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:39,910
those definitions is what the internet
so from that maintenance point of view

16
00:01:39,910 --> 00:01:43,759
and not the social network point of view
yet but that prompted technical point

17
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,740
the Internet

18
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:52,380
consists of Internet service providers
and protein all the packets in the

19
00:01:52,380 --> 00:02:00,429
internet is down between those internet
service providers we call them

20
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:09,750
autonomous systems through the use of
border gateway protocol BGP

21
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:17,060
well basically it works like this
autonomous system connects to another

22
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:23,440
autonomous systems grow as export
permissions and if the permissions are

23
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:31,590
granted it starts to announce to other
systems that it can provide and access

24
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:39,390
to set up a network of those systems
propagate the announcement and finally

25
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:46,500
there's a route established and present
in the internet so the internet knows

26
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:53,870
where to go if we need to send it back
it to these not work well

27
00:02:53,870 --> 00:03:04,340
so the Internet is only when it sold
begin autonomous systems used to trust

28
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:10,720
each other and routing was based on
trust as a result of their arrows at the

29
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:18,879
concept of hijacking that autonomous
system that starts to announce of those

30
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,319
prefix without your permission

31
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:24,890
different reasons why this could happen

32
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:33,309
well from evil governments trying to
silence public media to spammers trying

33
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:39,040
to use and used other space in order to
send junk mail

34
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:45,769
whatever there's a problem and different
mechanisms arrived to prevent ordering

35
00:03:45,769 --> 00:03:52,190
use the problem of hijacking
technologists include a test sets wrote

36
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:55,400
objects are PTI BJP sec

37
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:01,889
however some of those technologists and
mechanisms only allowed to sell the

38
00:04:01,889 --> 00:04:07,160
issue partially and others are not
implemented globally you know the

39
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:12,680
Internet is a global network so if we
security practice should be applied

40
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:23,729
globally but was applied only in a
specific geographic regions so now

41
00:04:23,729 --> 00:04:35,419
nevertheless there were very few cases
of BJP hijacking registered recently for

42
00:04:35,419 --> 00:04:41,799
instance the most recent case
investigated by our company was spammers

43
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:48,729
stealing a large portion of allocated
assigned but at that time

44
00:04:48,729 --> 00:04:52,248
unused and not announced

45
00:04:52,249 --> 00:04:58,329
IP address space to overcome black least
to continue sending digital garbage

46
00:04:58,329 --> 00:05:06,879
least me as a big surprise for you when
do you wanna start using your fresh you

47
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:15,409
AP before the space an expensive one
year and then you find out that most of

48
00:05:15,409 --> 00:05:23,129
your fresh new older the seating that
inspire hopes yet this case was almost

49
00:05:23,129 --> 00:05:30,549
half a year ago so speaking about
hijacking yeah quite rare situation

50
00:05:30,549 --> 00:05:45,998
however the applause and ASP politician
allow another problem to a rope like an

51
00:05:45,999 --> 00:05:52,829
example of a road click is multi home
cinema system so no transit traffic that

52
00:05:52,829 --> 00:05:58,499
important salts from a local beer and
due to a mistake in a configuration send

53
00:05:58,499 --> 00:06:06,169
them to upstream internet service
provider so and it starts to

54
00:06:06,169 --> 00:06:13,520
to work with transit traffic which it
isn't ready to handle duet human error

55
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:21,180
the recent is is to accomplish and on
the scene though since I B networks and

56
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:26,879
network prefixes including those of
Facebook tutor one operator level 3

57
00:06:26,879 --> 00:06:35,460
their consequences included internet
slow down nearly worldwide so and that

58
00:06:35,460 --> 00:06:42,049
situation with countermeasures against
leaking is given much worse than the one

59
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:48,919
we are hijacking unlike a jking early
Qing isn't is it took even isn't even is

60
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:51,258
it to define if you find out

61
00:06:51,259 --> 00:06:58,740
IETF draft with the definitions long
paper describes what they're owed

62
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:08,419
leaking is so it's hard to even to
define it let alone the event so nobly

63
00:07:08,419 --> 00:07:11,659
slow down and actually denial of service

64
00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:18,669
up the possible results of meat leaking
or hijacking getting traffic network

65
00:07:18,669 --> 00:07:23,149
from all over the world allows
man-in-the-middle attacks identity

66
00:07:23,149 --> 00:07:32,860
proofing and more 20 game may be
implemented through an unauthorised use

67
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:39,069
or vulnerable network equipment and
border altars and it's quite another

68
00:07:39,069 --> 00:07:44,759
coincidence that those internet service
providers who are bad in implementing

69
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:48,939
prefix filtering and security black
sista back to open hit have the

70
00:07:48,939 --> 00:07:56,960
equipment and gateways and parched for
quite a long time so as I said

71
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:01,448
previously hijacking is quite rare
nowadays

72
00:08:01,449 --> 00:08:11,599
on the other hand thing happens here and
there there are approximately 5,000 or

73
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,259
out

74
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:15,680
leaking in the whole internet right now

75
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,570
now at the moment most of them go
unnoticed

76
00:08:19,570 --> 00:08:25,849
some of them remained there for years
until finally somebody gets killed

77
00:08:25,850 --> 00:08:33,979
it's got discovered though wrote leaks
and hijacking quite different concept

78
00:08:33,979 --> 00:08:40,029
chile as defined in the said idea
proposals up their consequences for

79
00:08:40,029 --> 00:08:45,820
network security are similar as in most
cases so we are here discussing them as

80
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:57,770
one question is a common caused by human
error but we don't doctors still prefix

81
00:08:57,770 --> 00:09:05,410
is intentionally well generally it might
be because they don't see profit in

82
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:10,829
hijacking and most of them are afraid to
get caught

83
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:15,560
afraid of getting caught let's review
some methods proposed by community to

84
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:25,750
detect hijacking the post of them is
tracking code is in the autonomous

85
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:30,610
system paths for a network with Excel
there somewhere in the world using

86
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:37,279
whatever tools you choose either
manually or automatically the next one

87
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:42,980
is a tricky at that time to leave fields
of incoming IP packets networking

88
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:49,529
equipment is built in such way that
there's a receipt for that that it will

89
00:09:49,529 --> 00:09:56,100
decrease their way out of the field on
each hole on the way so that detail

90
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:04,579
would not be the same in case when
hijacking starts next Mon cheap time as

91
00:10:04,579 --> 00:10:12,149
you know you can't fight the speed of
light so if you need to forward packets

92
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:17,089
through a network infrastructure you'll
let us see

93
00:10:17,089 --> 00:10:22,170
and if you need to if you need to
process the tickets on your own terms

94
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:27,360
and network equipment then you're going
to end the processing time so the

95
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:33,499
overall it and say it will increase so
there are ways to detect problems with

96
00:10:33,499 --> 00:10:40,209
wrote however those wastes might as well
be insufficient for example here with

97
00:10:40,209 --> 00:10:49,739
say biggest ASP defined business to find
out what's the abnormal autonomous is

98
00:10:49,740 --> 00:10:57,459
you need to know well how the ordinary
01 looks like so when no problems so you

99
00:10:57,459 --> 00:11:03,800
need to know the state but the
difference and you need to have some

100
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:09,269
monitoring solution and history of
announces just to find out what and

101
00:11:09,269 --> 00:11:16,040
where exactly has gotten more notes that
you to field of and make it is just a

102
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:23,019
field in and in IB pick it goes through
the hands of a man in the middle so it

103
00:11:23,019 --> 00:11:27,970
could be easily mental to mimic the
normal behavior and just some point so

104
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:39,529
entree salads and whatever so it's
possible to mangle so what's there as

105
00:11:39,529 --> 00:11:44,730
its it said previously you can stand
stand the speed of light handling the

106
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:50,399
bigots you need to add processing time
and let them see so finally the

107
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,860
difference will be opus like they were
in the in the case of Telekom Malaysia

108
00:11:54,860 --> 00:12:02,179
let's review a simple example of this
popular example so figure while there's

109
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:09,179
an autonomous system which announces its
proof exists or its upstream Internet

110
00:12:09,179 --> 00:12:14,949
Service Provider see well it comes and
goes and walked four years and till one

111
00:12:14,949 --> 00:12:21,628
day and autonomous system starts to
announce more specific break prefix

112
00:12:21,629 --> 00:12:29,130
although websites to its own upstream
Internet Service Provider be

113
00:12:29,130 --> 00:12:36,530
what's happening next as we know in most
of the cases about networking equipment

114
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:43,600
is built and sit up in such way that
there are more that the more specific

115
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:49,070
announcements will be preferred over
less specific one of the rockies aspin

116
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:54,380
it's not sure yet but however general
and almost everywhere in the world that

117
00:12:54,380 --> 00:12:59,120
more specific prefix will we and the
traffic will start to flow into the

118
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:15,600
autonomous system so the players will go
up and web sites located in those the

119
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:23,090
stolen network segment engage their
services even still available yeah users

120
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:28,150
immediately noticed the latency has
increased that the web pages are loading

121
00:13:28,150 --> 00:13:32,949
slowly that the emails being sent north
as fast as they used to be things of

122
00:13:32,950 --> 00:13:33,580
that sort

123
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:39,130
next user it's called a technical
support for their services and finally

124
00:13:39,130 --> 00:13:44,730
the issue it reaches of the network
operations center of autonomous system a

125
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:51,770
retirement system is a ghost autonomous
system probably it will escalate the

126
00:13:51,770 --> 00:13:53,550
issue up to

127
00:13:53,550 --> 00:14:00,150
autonomous system B and finally ate and
be resolved the problem it may take some

128
00:14:00,150 --> 00:14:06,750
hours minutes days several at most a
homer of the issues going to be result

129
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:13,720
next other autonomous system is going to
undergo some investigation and probably

130
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:20,620
is likely to attract public attention I
so finally that permissions to set up

131
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:26,600
roads in autonomous system will be based
on a reduced so that kind of a deck is

132
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:31,040
probably going to be implemented on
there once for each autonomous system in

133
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:36,199
control that makes the check very
expensive one and then

134
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:43,760
result of Investigation their attacker
even risks to get so other states go

135
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:50,030
higher once again and the only result of
all this stuff is well did not have

136
00:14:50,030 --> 00:14:55,530
service so probably probably the
disclosure of some plant a plain text so

137
00:14:55,530 --> 00:15:02,150
just unencrypted an unimportant did not
that interesting

138
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:07,640
another service is a much easier and
cheaper done with some kind of dinosaur

139
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:14,470
NTP amplification and its cheaper at
home so that's the way to go

140
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:23,810
so looks like the speed of light works
cue however we could hide the increased

141
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:31,949
latency from most of the users what is
what if only a small portion of users

142
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:33,470
will be affected

143
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:44,080
is it possible let's review another
example well figure 1 is the same eight

144
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:53,550
announces its brief existence we get two
autonomous system starts to announce

145
00:15:53,550 --> 00:16:00,229
well just the same prefix of the same
site to its upstream be what's going on

146
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:04,970
next as we see that preference of the
more or less specific routes isn't isn't

147
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:11,070
playing anymore so there should be a
preference on the based on the

148
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:18,320
principles so what those prints but in
sports our preference won't be random

149
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:23,880
really what their sake of simplicity
let's ignore their orbiting pluses for

150
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:31,110
moments and lets you know just for the
sake of simplicity again let's assume

151
00:16:31,110 --> 00:16:37,020
that B&C interconnected so

152
00:16:37,020 --> 00:16:46,079
situation falls into general one or two
cases and independence on the

153
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:53,170
relationships between B&C commercial
relationships if be traffic from see

154
00:16:53,170 --> 00:17:01,770
that first be will propel that malicious
wrote because that's the traffic from

155
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:07,800
its client it will get paid for that and
if it propels the route from the

156
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:16,379
provider it should be for that so that's
economical and will be further out

157
00:17:16,380 --> 00:17:22,580
coming from its clients or religious one
and see will be around coming from one

158
00:17:22,579 --> 00:17:26,579
of its planes that I ate a good one

159
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:35,460
or be a poison so in case she prefers
the malicious owed by jacking will go

160
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:45,200
probably will go global if she prefers
huge out so that so-so and vice versa

161
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:56,070
now see mice traffic from be then first
he will be there ought to be a good one

162
00:17:56,070 --> 00:18:02,139
from its cool and and we will have to
choose it will prefer either they're all

163
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:07,810
coming from C or they're all coming from
in the former case that hijacking

164
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:15,419
wouldn't even occur in the latter case
the hijacking will go global to be and

165
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:22,870
wouldn't be propagated to the rest of
the world remember this and enjoy this

166
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:31,639
figures for now this is the easiest
example but it illustrates the idea we

167
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:38,820
just said that B&C are interconnected
but what if they are not and there's

168
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:46,020
more autonomous systems involved in the
process that game becomes harder and the

169
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:48,920
result depends on the relationships
between

170
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:55,150
in C but on the relationships on all the
way between them so they provide us our

171
00:18:55,150 --> 00:19:02,100
clients the beatings that kind of think
so but that simple case are your

172
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:08,310
strengths the idea of the prefix may be
hijacked locally so that only specific

173
00:19:08,310 --> 00:19:15,450
geographic illogical regions would be
affected in fact that's how it should be

174
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:20,970
in a cast works for CDN sand in our
souls mitigation services and cloud

175
00:19:20,970 --> 00:19:25,560
services and whatever we GNE goes the
same prefix is announced

176
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:32,629
safe from both United States and China
and United users from United States and

177
00:19:32,630 --> 00:19:40,030
Canada are owed to do the data center in
the United States and on the other hand

178
00:19:40,030 --> 00:19:46,680
all the asia goes to change so that
Asian region is actually is allocated

179
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:53,230
for that cloud service from the rest of
the network for that perfect in that

180
00:19:53,230 --> 00:20:00,790
case the insulation made and would be
the point where policies and communities

181
00:20:00,790 --> 00:20:07,230
of local beers that can make an
announcement even more local so ever

182
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:15,360
installed on the local users will notice
the difference and for most of the users

183
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:24,179
say put the customer Bates things will
go the same way

184
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:32,070
relations for all this arrived us we're
done with introduction sin el final

185
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:34,210
question is

186
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:40,100
why would we need that why'd you steal
prefix locally for well two or three

187
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:45,350
years in the whole world so sitting far
from your client's far from your

188
00:20:45,350 --> 00:21:00,320
customer base so there's a procedure
this procedure how we obtain keyless

189
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:06,290
certificate for domain for a certificate
of authority the procedure is generally

190
00:21:06,290 --> 00:21:07,460
as follows

191
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:15,700
firstly we need to register on our
website and then we should generate a

192
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:20,790
Certificate Signing Request well it's
highly discouraged but some certificate

193
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:25,360
authorities will even allow you to take
the private key from them so no senator

194
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:32,110
questioned this case but doesn't matter
so you create a sign in her quest you

195
00:21:32,110 --> 00:21:41,020
uploaded and then you need to prove that
you're reading the owner you are really

196
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:46,610
in control of the domain that you are
going to certify that you want to verify

197
00:21:46,610 --> 00:21:50,770
and for your convenience

198
00:21:50,770 --> 00:21:57,230
there are plenty of options to do this
there are certificate authority will

199
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:05,520
call for you to send an email to some
kind of email address like postmaster at

200
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:14,510
the target domain it may point you to
custom that you need to boot in the his

201
00:22:14,510 --> 00:22:18,350
records may give your

202
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:23,870
specific HTML page that you need to put
under a specific your eye on your site

203
00:22:23,870 --> 00:22:31,570
is offering you a custom took in in that
you Putin Janice TXT record and so on

204
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:38,340
the thing is you need to choose only one
of this method so either its web page

205
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:44,809
done and it's ok what's happening on
next certificate of authority since

206
00:22:44,809 --> 00:22:54,350
Robert so I bought two aside well takes
from five to ten minutes but goes to

207
00:22:54,350 --> 00:22:55,030
your site

208
00:22:55,030 --> 00:23:01,678
checks that there's a token that's a
page so the owner of the domain he just

209
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:08,190
what they asked him for so probably his
and controlled so then the ownership is

210
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:13,200
verified and finally you get your
scientists are typically it well you

211
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:20,010
need to pay money for that but sometimes
Obama actions and finally maybe even you

212
00:23:20,010 --> 00:23:32,520
don't need to show your credit card data
so what what are we going to say next

213
00:23:32,520 --> 00:23:36,220
first of all

214
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:41,910
you need to be in control of a border
out of control

215
00:23:41,910 --> 00:23:47,990
autonomous system next you need to find
a certificate of authority that's close

216
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:56,210
to your autonomous system in a logical
sense so it's it's that there are no

217
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:57,630
more hopes

218
00:23:57,630 --> 00:24:02,020
123 of that that kind of thing

219
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:09,760
hopes between you and the chosen
certificate authority then you need to

220
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:16,610
reject a prefix locally the pics that
are staying the IP address which aims

221
00:24:16,610 --> 00:24:26,439
website so the following will should
apply the victims customer base should

222
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:32,450
be in the other parts of the world
should be in United States while you're

223
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:38,220
sitting in China white vice versa so far
from there so the victims autonomous

224
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:48,180
system will notice nothing and it was
announced is local so we need we need to

225
00:24:48,180 --> 00:24:54,410
build it in such a way that the chosen
certificate authority traffic is routed

226
00:24:54,410 --> 00:25:03,230
to us as I wanted to the hijacker so
next we are going to register with CAA

227
00:25:03,230 --> 00:25:08,050
in question we're going to applaud
Certificate Signing Request get an HTML

228
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:15,100
page then sit up bench engineered so
whatever web site of your choice

229
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:21,459
applauded the HTML page make sure it's
reachable and then you pay and obtain

230
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:28,120
their science certificate for the domain
in question so that Taylor certificate

231
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:35,260
that's one way to do that there's
another one

232
00:25:35,260 --> 00:25:37,860
well sometimes

233
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:46,549
authoritative DNS is sitting in another
network so it's easier to will might be

234
00:25:46,549 --> 00:25:52,639
easier to hijack that one network so
hosting the authoritative DNS or locally

235
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:58,970
so that DNS provider should noticed
nothing nothing as well

236
00:25:58,970 --> 00:26:07,390
well then you need to configure it in
that way that the certificate of

237
00:26:07,390 --> 00:26:13,299
authority nearby looks at you and then
you register you applaud you set up a

238
00:26:13,299 --> 00:26:19,240
nobody and not in a budget DNS server
you said it set up the genus txt recur

239
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:26,160
to pay and you obtain the science
certificate the next the way well

240
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:32,580
sometimes well the genus ovis are loaded
stuff websites

241
00:26:32,580 --> 00:26:40,939
highly lauded however no one kills who
is server goes down well five minutes to

242
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:51,120
midnight so just the same you need to
jack the prefix hosting server near the

243
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:56,909
certificate of authority so set up
several of your choice and said that

244
00:26:56,910 --> 00:27:02,290
they can get critical in this particular
case may be kind of prevented or

245
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:07,700
investigated later by a certificate of
authority using a popular decrease

246
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:11,860
server with complete cash however

247
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:26,649
that's the point that not almost always
there so summery the hijackers look we

248
00:27:26,650 --> 00:27:32,150
need to design locally so we can get on
a bus system should not doubt noticed

249
00:27:32,150 --> 00:27:35,030
nothing or almost nothing here

250
00:27:35,030 --> 00:27:39,990
well there should be some problems far
from their customer base for some meant

251
00:27:39,990 --> 00:27:46,220
so most of the time network operations
centers of Internet service providers

252
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:53,340
don't care about that kind of stuff so
the network issues happen so it's

253
00:27:53,340 --> 00:28:03,189
probably be investigated the resulting
Killa certificate is a global due to how

254
00:28:03,190 --> 00:28:08,490
it's implemented in operating systems
and browsers

255
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:15,110
certificate authority cash his plane so
get out Florida's with intermediate so

256
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:26,129
it's their certificate which is
generated by certificate of authority in

257
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:30,980
Singapore China or poland or whatever
will be steel billet in the United

258
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:36,320
States United States dammit so the
resulting Killa certificate can be used

259
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:43,559
for men the middle at X anywhere in the
world and vice versa

260
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:50,300
just as we can steal victims prefix near
their certificate authorities autonomous

261
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:52,570
system we can as well

262
00:28:52,570 --> 00:28:57,919
steal their certificate authorities
prefix near the big gym so to Mundell

263
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:06,279
on the way back that's kind of complex
to implement so it's easier with UDP

264
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:13,849
well however you need to build some kind
of sorry sorry well deep packet

265
00:29:13,849 --> 00:29:19,960
inspection or whatever so it will take
time but it's just as well possible that

266
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:28,219
might be of help when you're autonomous
system is near the victims one so you

267
00:29:28,219 --> 00:29:35,989
can't find autonomous system for prom
week however you found out of 34 from

268
00:29:35,989 --> 00:29:43,190
there the question how do we do local
hijacking

269
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:48,339
first of all you need to find a border
router and put it under your control so

270
00:29:48,339 --> 00:29:57,399
vulnerable one whatever I don't care how
it's implemented because it's possible

271
00:29:57,399 --> 00:30:02,768
so you need a broader alter next you
need to find out

272
00:30:02,769 --> 00:30:08,979
bought the relationships near your peers
near Euro Tour so their customers

273
00:30:08,979 --> 00:30:11,629
provide us beatings

274
00:30:11,629 --> 00:30:16,849
this is mostly in most cases of this
information is secret but not a

275
00:30:16,849 --> 00:30:22,178
top-secret there are services on the
Internet is one free.com.co.net

276
00:30:22,179 --> 00:30:27,919
which figures out this information while
on our business using only public data

277
00:30:27,919 --> 00:30:33,440
so this is a double-double and the thing
is

278
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:40,349
and communities will also might be of
great help

279
00:30:40,349 --> 00:31:03,429
well doing this while trying to announce
locally well no mitigating the problem

280
00:31:03,430 --> 00:31:16,590
that's not so now has received one thing
one thing and it an important one

281
00:31:16,590 --> 00:31:22,090
this is the case with Jermaine validated
to certificates but not with extended

282
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:26,919
believe it once because the policy issue
extended the lead to certificates

283
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:32,030
required request to pass through more
additional checks and to provide

284
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:38,800
supporting documents it takes time weeks
for example so recent initiative Google

285
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:44,040
with certificate transparency which is
currently being implemented for extended

286
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:49,460
validity certificates may also be of
some help however

287
00:31:49,460 --> 00:31:54,010
dating that German ownership is an
important case with extended the lead to

288
00:31:54,010 --> 00:31:58,480
certificates as well just the rest of
the checks is the subject of further

289
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:07,630
analysis not covered here so next what
can we do that there's a problem because

290
00:32:07,630 --> 00:32:16,580
public key infrastructure that's built
into pls just shouting it doesn't take

291
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:22,840
into consideration that there are flaws
in Internet charging that most of the

292
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:29,679
time the internet marketing can't be
believed however that you less public

293
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:35,480
infrastructure is something that's built
into operating systems and devices and

294
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:44,900
it's not easy to change that there's an
underlying problem that's a problem with

295
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:50,330
Internet routing so that the problem
we're implementing security practices

296
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:57,449
however just as we know this is a good
example there's ipv6 that's being

297
00:32:57,450 --> 00:33:02,269
implemented for ten years so

298
00:33:02,269 --> 00:33:11,159
probably the internet remote assist for
now and we are going to solve its as

299
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:21,789
well for now we have to go with four
prongs the first of them is monitoring

300
00:33:21,789 --> 00:33:27,950
that's able to detect hijacking far from
there from your customer base if pointed

301
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:36,839
out three they are so well there are
even free ones so come on your next one

302
00:33:36,839 --> 00:33:41,168
whatcha prefixes as a whole the BJP
monitoring one do all the work for you

303
00:33:41,169 --> 00:33:46,549
you need to check what what problems are
there with perfect sense when it

304
00:33:46,549 --> 00:33:54,749
notifies you you need to react next one
for the gipper Text Transfer Protocol

305
00:33:54,749 --> 00:34:05,429
there's a proposal that significant
meaning what that does is when the

306
00:34:05,429 --> 00:34:10,520
browser for the next to the site for
them to the website for the first time

307
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:17,219
the website also that here's my
certificate and eat will not change in

308
00:34:17,219 --> 00:34:24,520
few months or years so that if there's a
Sports Illustrated ticket

309
00:34:24,520 --> 00:34:31,918
the browser will show you apparently
next their browser plug-ins that help

310
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:39,618
you to be warned when certificate of the
site that you are using frequently I

311
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:43,819
changed certificate patrol for Firefox
and so on

312
00:34:43,819 --> 00:34:53,918
next there are new concepts of public
infrastructure for example Dinas based

313
00:34:53,918 --> 00:34:57,279
one day so fine lol

314
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:05,940
maybe it's time to think about how it's
going to be implemented one note told

315
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:11,130
about browser plug-ins that their view
from the Mozilla plugin website about

316
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:17,000
this certificate Patrol has found a
problem so while using certificate

317
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:22,790
cultural he found out that sites like
Google or Amazon I changing their

318
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:30,720
certificate buy certificates quite
rapidly so one two or three months so

319
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:37,689
there's one thing that is going to you
need to choose either you generate a

320
00:35:37,690 --> 00:35:44,200
short leave too difficult which you can
recycle if it's stolen or whatever or

321
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:51,609
you use a long sleeved certificate which
is going to help you in case there was

322
00:35:51,610 --> 00:36:14,309
one so the public interest is not
working

323
00:36:14,309 --> 00:36:39,380
I'm running out of battery is it's not
working

324
00:36:39,380 --> 00:37:04,519
now and so maybe I'll think out loud to
speak out loud I owe their hear me to

325
00:37:04,519 --> 00:37:06,308
hear me now

326
00:37:06,309 --> 00:37:13,630
ok so finally there's a problem with
public infrastructure problem with

327
00:37:13,630 --> 00:37:27,109
internet charging so that now that
george et to discuss those problems

328
00:37:27,109 --> 00:37:35,509
sound bites so as we know there are
flaws in public infrastructure chart

329
00:37:35,509 --> 00:37:43,779
thing that not reliable so there are
corresponding risks those risks can be

330
00:37:43,779 --> 00:37:50,299
mitigated with what grounds however the
better design of a public infrastructure

331
00:37:50,299 --> 00:37:57,609
might might help to do it easily more
easily and finally be monitoring systems

332
00:37:57,609 --> 00:38:02,348
are useful so if you're in charge of
network security in a large Internet

333
00:38:02,349 --> 00:38:07,589
Service Provider even small in a small
one so if you are charged phone network

334
00:38:07,589 --> 00:38:12,420
setup network operations will start
using them right away

335
00:38:12,420 --> 00:38:16,859
built for you so silly questions
