1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,529
I'm job or and I'm here with Alexandria
want to talk to you about our research

2
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:09,590
into the security of Square Enix mobile
card reading device the square reader

3
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:15,610
will also talk a little bit about
yourself more generally and why that's

4
00:00:15,610 --> 00:00:18,529
an interesting and timely research topic

5
00:00:18,529 --> 00:00:22,670
first a little bit about what's we are
computer engineers with a focus and

6
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:30,560
software engineering I personally got
into InfoSec younger younger years of my

7
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,379
life and that turned into research with
a number of professors at Boston

8
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,309
University in our packing a device
firmware and collaborative encryption

9
00:00:39,309 --> 00:00:44,468
Alexandria runs her own iOS development
company and also conducted research at

10
00:00:44,469 --> 00:00:50,500
BU she researched the security TLS after
managers of ransomware Artemis our third

11
00:00:50,500 --> 00:00:53,800
member and he can't hear he's out of the
country

12
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,730
alright here's where we're headed we're
going to start off with a little bit of

13
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:00,898
motivation and talk mobile point of sale
then we're going to jump into the

14
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,409
specific vulnerabilities we found at the
square reader will talk also about how

15
00:01:05,409 --> 00:01:09,530
to prevent against these vulnerabilities
and some challenges that square faced

16
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:17,390
and implementing fixes let's talk mobile
point of sale of sale differs from

17
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:21,330
traditional point-of-sale and a number
of weights we like to highlight three

18
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,960
important differences and he called the
3 C's

19
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:32,100
sale its compact cheap incompatible
compared to traditional sale and because

20
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,449
of this it appeals especially to small
merchants and merchants who are on the

21
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:36,850
move

22
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:41,869
such as food trucks shops so I'm taxis
farmers at the farmers market etcetera

23
00:01:41,869 --> 00:01:46,689
and a number of providers have
recognized this is an interesting space

24
00:01:46,689 --> 00:01:52,679
with a lot of room to grow and that
includes square Paypal Amazon group I

25
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:58,159
meant to it and some smaller providers
as well so why do I care about mobile

26
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,869
point of sale what I think that others
should care what we've seen a lot of new

27
00:02:02,869 --> 00:02:06,649
hardware and software coming out last
five six seven years and its compact

28
00:02:06,649 --> 00:02:10,259
sheep incompatible so it faces
challenges such as stricter size

29
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:12,569
constraints lower hardware budgets

30
00:02:12,569 --> 00:02:17,159
and having to interface with phones that
are usually used for purposes outside of

31
00:02:17,159 --> 00:02:23,450
transaction processing in addition to
transaction processing which makes it

32
00:02:23,450 --> 00:02:29,420
harder to securities new devices are
branch office coming from lots of

33
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:33,798
different providers it's not just square
and each provider usually rolls their

34
00:02:33,799 --> 00:02:39,389
own solution to this problem also the
hardware and software is being rapidly

35
00:02:39,389 --> 00:02:45,230
adopted and it will pass a market and
we'll talk about that in a second but

36
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:49,909
the kicker here is that these devices
are handling sensitive credit card

37
00:02:49,909 --> 00:02:54,828
information of customers and all of this
combined together kind of creates this

38
00:02:54,829 --> 00:02:59,400
potential recipe for disaster and that's
why I think everyone should care about

39
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,719
what point of sale square says that we
protect your data like your business

40
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:08,750
depends on it because we because it does
this is a testament to the fact that the

41
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:12,799
reputations and livelihoods the provider
companies depend on the security of

42
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:17,620
their data center providers care of
course their customers care they don't

43
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:21,560
want their credit card information
stolen and we emphasise professionals

44
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:28,299
care because it's our job to secure
these companies data we recognize the

45
00:03:28,299 --> 00:03:32,069
state of things stayed in the market and
the potential here we decided to take a

46
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:37,138
look and while we choose square well
couple of slides ago I said rapid

47
00:03:37,139 --> 00:03:43,419
adoption square is one of the largest
providers that we seen it processes tens

48
00:03:43,419 --> 00:03:48,799
of billions of dollars and its US
dollars in transactions every year now

49
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:53,819
and upwards of a hundred million in a
single day the company's valuation has

50
00:03:53,819 --> 00:03:58,500
increased a hundredfold over the past
five years or so and they processed over

51
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:03,729
a billion transactions to date at the
same time square it's not an easy target

52
00:04:03,729 --> 00:04:08,060
they have a bug bounty program where
they've closed a couple hundred bucks

53
00:04:08,060 --> 00:04:12,930
since its inception until we expect that
given its size and its bug bounty

54
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:17,789
program all abilities we find in square
might easily apply to other providers

55
00:04:17,789 --> 00:04:23,030
and furthermore that we find packs a lot
of people and the

56
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:28,570
market right so how exactly to the
square to work in case you haven't seen

57
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:32,710
it it's the devices here to the right
it's a dongle that plugs into your

58
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:36,190
phone's audio port and has a magnetic
just like you'll find a tape player

59
00:04:36,190 --> 00:04:41,850
recorder when you run that head over the
magnetic strip credit card

60
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:45,900
the varying magnetic field on that
credit card straight will produce a

61
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,729
varying voltage across the leaves
overhead which can then be decoded into

62
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:53,220
bits that represent the credit card
information you can see at the bottom

63
00:04:53,220 --> 00:05:00,650
waveform from the beginning of a slight
and it's very much like a microphone

64
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:06,020
it's just audio essentially and so by up
to the microphone port the square

65
00:05:06,020 --> 00:05:08,539
register a poor another appt
candy-coated into credit card

66
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:13,910
information now earlier models of the
reader the second version and this is an

67
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:19,780
unencrypted this is an unencrypted one
they contain no active components no

68
00:05:19,780 --> 00:05:23,429
integrated circuits so it's essentially
a magnetic head connected directly to

69
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:29,720
the headphone and microphone import and
put up a phone and later models in the

70
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:37,030
middle is the version 3 recall ps3 and
these have active components that apple

71
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:42,520
pie and crypt the signal so the phone
actually sees an encrypted version of

72
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,690
this white and the waveform is not
coming directly from the magnetic head

73
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:49,520
and on the right is to ask for the most
recent version of the square reader and

74
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:52,700
that's what we'll be talking a lot about
today

75
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:58,219
all right let's move on to discussing
the actual vulnerabilities to be found a

76
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:02,650
used the word unencrypted a couple of
slide to go and hopefully that raised a

77
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:07,919
few red flags because these earlier
models but square reader are in fact and

78
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:12,469
secure if you are connecting a magnetic
head directly to the microphone input of

79
00:06:12,470 --> 00:06:18,590
a phone then that the rock credit card
information encoded bits are going to be

80
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:22,989
exposed to anything that can get in the
middle of the headphone input and the

81
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:29,460
official square register their servers
so this includes anything listening in

82
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:35,090
on the audio channel and also any apps
that

83
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:36,390
impersonate the officials

84
00:06:36,390 --> 00:06:41,710
crap and this is a problem that was
pointed out to square by a number of

85
00:06:41,710 --> 00:06:47,409
companies a while ago and squares
response was to implement encryption and

86
00:06:47,410 --> 00:06:51,790
they deprecated the old readers in the
process and said that they're no longer

87
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:56,380
supported and it turns out that we found
this was not true

88
00:06:56,380 --> 00:07:00,120
up until just a month ago that you can
use any of the older models of the

89
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:03,550
square reader with the square register
app and still process transactions and

90
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:06,910
we found that to be a problem given the
potential for the man-in-the-middle

91
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:13,320
attacks all previous readers continue to
be secure for daily use

92
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:18,010
square claim this on their website up
until May of this year despite the fact

93
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:22,219
that they had discontinued and
deprecated the older unencrypted readers

94
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:27,650
many years ago and even the initial
encrypted reader year ago so this claim

95
00:07:27,650 --> 00:07:32,049
can really violate the trust which is
sometimes blind trust that consumers

96
00:07:32,050 --> 00:07:35,600
having these companies it's important to
be aware of the claims that you're

97
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:39,050
making if you're offering payment
solutions

98
00:07:39,050 --> 00:07:45,890
next up we looked at replay attacks so
whenever you swipe the card produces

99
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:50,219
essentially audio right and the question
is can we record the audio and play it

100
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:55,760
back multiple times to the square apt to
initiate transactions multiple times

101
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:01,159
with the same swipe and it turns out
that we can because square prevents

102
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:08,190
against that and that's great when you
look at an encrypted swipe your not just

103
00:08:08,190 --> 00:08:12,390
sending two square servers the credit
card information in encrypted form but

104
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:15,890
you're also sending a transaction
counter and that's produced by an

105
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:22,340
integrated circuit and the actual square
reader device and transaction counter

106
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:26,789
increases with every single swipe for
that reader and act as sort of an

107
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:31,680
identification number and square serve
receive the same identification number

108
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:34,479
twice they'll deny the transaction

109
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,510
however they're not taking things as far
as they can and they're still in a bit

110
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:41,330
of insecurity here because you can
playback swipes to square service out of

111
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:47,240
order what I mean by that is I can
record fifty swipes and let's label them

112
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:48,279
1 through 50

113
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:53,680
and I can send all of those except white
number 32 square servers and then many

114
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:57,410
weeks later after I processed an
arbitrary number of transactions with

115
00:08:57,410 --> 00:09:03,209
square and maybe even more swipes I can
playback number thirty and initiated and

116
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:09,239
complete a transaction for the credit
card swipe and this is an issue because

117
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:14,170
where does happen information to stop
this but they're not they know that they

118
00:09:14,170 --> 00:09:17,709
have an out of order transaction but
they're not preventing against that and

119
00:09:17,709 --> 00:09:22,809
that allows merchants to stockpile
encrypted swipes and later use them to

120
00:09:22,809 --> 00:09:26,160
initiate delayed transactions where they
can charge the customer and arbitrary

121
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:28,860
amount of money even on a different
square register account

122
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:34,999
than the one that made this way and use
social engineering is necessary to carry

123
00:09:34,999 --> 00:09:41,499
out this attack now we made application
that makes this stack a little more easy

124
00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:47,970
and assist with it it's a proof of
concept with the web app and it will

125
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:52,809
record the extra swipes at transmitted
to a server and it allows merchants to

126
00:09:52,809 --> 00:09:59,689
play them back at a later time slot me
demo that right now so I'm and you come

127
00:09:59,689 --> 00:10:08,410
to me wanna buy something take your card
and I'm talking to you and then going to

128
00:10:08,410 --> 00:10:11,740
open up the square up and actually
charge you for what you intended to buy

129
00:10:11,740 --> 00:10:17,740
you think that the first swipe was just
didn't even register properly and then a

130
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:24,389
couple of weeks later when you're not
looking I'm going to go back to my

131
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:31,809
interface and I'm going to use this
special cable I've made to play back

132
00:10:31,809 --> 00:10:45,589
from the computer I happen to the square
at no charge you for a dollar or you

133
00:10:45,589 --> 00:10:47,970
know more than that

134
00:10:47,970 --> 00:10:52,970
there you go

135
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:59,670
actually still out the transaction and
we tested this for many weeks after the

136
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:02,979
site has actually been made and after
having taken a bunch of other swipes

137
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:16,279
between the time it was made and the
time that we process the transaction

138
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:20,850
rights next up we're going to jump into
our global mobility as we found and I'm

139
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:29,959
going to hand things over to Alexandria
to take it you're so square isn't solely

140
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:33,040
a software company store and take a look
at the Harbor vulnerabilities that we

141
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:39,269
encounter which their harbors actually
pretty cool so we started by dissecting

142
00:11:39,269 --> 00:11:43,170
it square reader and you can see in the
picture this is what it looks like when

143
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:49,719
you open one up there's a ribbon cable
that connects the point to it from this

144
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:55,069
site but not very noticeable anyway
there's ribbon cable that connects the

145
00:11:55,069 --> 00:11:59,089
headphone jack to the magnetic card
reader which is in the middle and the

146
00:11:59,089 --> 00:12:04,490
bottom right is the encryption chip now
square claims quite frequently and

147
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:09,069
articles and on their website that they
appointed sweeping corruption but as we

148
00:12:09,069 --> 00:12:11,979
can see from this image that's not
exactly true

149
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:16,809
best thing claim that they have a decent
encryption because the encryption chip

150
00:12:16,809 --> 00:12:20,649
is not directly at the point of Swype on
the magnetic head and this is where the

151
00:12:20,649 --> 00:12:26,800
vulnerability we encountered lies we did
a hardware encryption by Pats we started

152
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:30,349
by breaking open the square reader

153
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:36,790
tamper resistant casing which makes it
temporarily fairly typical to get into

154
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:40,099
his career until you have a little bit
of experience with it without making any

155
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:47,230
damage the outer casing then we
initiated a two-faced isto you start by

156
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:51,529
putting a jumper connection at the two
top contacts there actually a set of

157
00:12:51,529 --> 00:12:53,430
contacts in the top right hand corner

158
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:58,029
the probe with a voltmeter and see what
parts of the security they connect to

159
00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:02,819
and if you take the two at the top then
you can bypass the encryption chip

160
00:13:02,819 --> 00:13:06,309
except for a little bit of background
noise in order to get rid of this

161
00:13:06,309 --> 00:13:10,969
background noise all you have to do is
either crush the encryption ship one

162
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:14,699
connection on the back of the ribbon
cable and crushing the connection is

163
00:13:14,699 --> 00:13:20,019
actually much easier and more reliable
waiting crushing the ship

164
00:13:20,019 --> 00:13:22,689
here's a video of me actually
implementing the hardware encryption

165
00:13:22,689 --> 00:13:30,949
bypass it takes under 10 minutes to do
not set up you can see even though they

166
00:13:30,949 --> 00:13:34,540
have a temporary encasing it becomes
pretty easy to do it when you had a

167
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:40,219
little bit of practice and you can feel
like you're cracking clamps and the

168
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,809
tools that it takes to do this are
things that you can pick up at any Radio

169
00:13:43,809 --> 00:13:49,059
Shack it takes a soldering iron some
solder a little bit of wire screwdriver

170
00:13:49,059 --> 00:13:51,610
and a pair of pliers and that's it

171
00:13:51,610 --> 00:13:57,999
in reality that's things that most of us
have in our homes already been crushing

172
00:13:57,999 --> 00:14:00,509
the encryption ship you just want to
make sure that you maintain a connection

173
00:14:00,509 --> 00:14:07,089
so that you have a complete circuit and
then takes a little bit of superglue you

174
00:14:07,089 --> 00:14:26,990
hold it together and you're done but
it's an encrypted

175
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:31,690
this is a figure showing the waveform
from the square reader in different

176
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:35,760
stages during the hardware encryption
bypass in green you can actually see it

177
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:40,130
with the encrypted saying all this is
the square reader that's for untouched

178
00:14:40,130 --> 00:14:45,020
we haven't done anything to it then in
blue you can actually see what it looks

179
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:49,310
like when you have done that jumper
connection you have that way form but

180
00:14:49,310 --> 00:14:54,270
it's being blocked by that background
noise the last one in pink is what it

181
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:58,980
looks like when you completed the entire
heart bypass you can see there's no

182
00:14:58,980 --> 00:15:05,360
noise and there's a beautiful way for
now this is an attack vector in two ways

183
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,990
the first of which is a malicious
marching can easily use this to steal

184
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:13,000
your credit card information anonymously

185
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:19,339
a malicious March and I go to the market
selling raspberries and I have a

186
00:15:19,339 --> 00:15:24,100
customer come up to me all I have to do
is take me now unencrypted reader which

187
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:28,240
then looks like a completely encrypted
reader and they have a lot of trust in I

188
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,839
swipe their card and they leave and they
get there as berries and they have no

189
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,910
idea that I've just on their credit card
information there's no record of it

190
00:15:36,910 --> 00:15:42,029
because I could even never actually
there are two ways of handling it right

191
00:15:42,029 --> 00:15:48,390
because what square has done is
deprecated these readers now in part due

192
00:15:48,390 --> 00:15:49,829
to our research

193
00:15:49,829 --> 00:15:54,040
so the unencrypted ones so there are two
potential things for me to do after I

194
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,810
swipe their car and got their credit
card information first as I can pretend

195
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:00,910
like I ran the transaction and they just
get home and realized that I didn't

196
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:04,390
actually charged them they don't know
how to find me they probably don't

197
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:07,959
really remember my business name and I'm
in the winter and I have their credit

198
00:16:07,959 --> 00:16:09,140
card information

199
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:13,020
the second route is to just pretend like
the reader has been having issues lately

200
00:16:13,020 --> 00:16:16,120
and switch it out for an encrypted
reader and then actually charged that

201
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:19,950
either way that it hasn't read that much
suspicion and they have really nothing

202
00:16:19,950 --> 00:16:23,889
that ties you back to stay on their
credit card information

203
00:16:23,889 --> 00:16:28,929
also this is a quick easy and cheap way
to make a credit card skimmer especially

204
00:16:28,929 --> 00:16:32,160
for someone who's a layman and doesn't
have much experience with this sort of

205
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:37,199
thing it can be very hard to make a
credit card skimmer that small and easy

206
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:43,479
to use for them this is something that
you can buy at best buy for $10 and then

207
00:16:43,480 --> 00:16:50,790
get a refill on Foursquare or so the
cost of it is virtually nothing we made

208
00:16:50,790 --> 00:16:56,279
an extension to swordfish apt to
facilitate the city tech it recorded a

209
00:16:56,279 --> 00:17:01,429
swipe it transmits the audio to an
external server it decodes the audio and

210
00:17:01,429 --> 00:17:05,769
then it stores it and then it also sends
it back to the iOS App we're gonna show

211
00:17:05,769 --> 00:17:13,680
at that moment it

212
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:25,290
here it is a small square reader lol
also have one up here where we

213
00:17:25,290 --> 00:17:28,670
implemented the hardware encryption
bypassed but didn't put the cover back

214
00:17:28,670 --> 00:17:39,560
on if anyone's interested in seeing it
up close out the top card which artery

215
00:17:39,560 --> 00:17:52,950
bypass up on the web app keep in mind
the number sold so many ideas and we

216
00:17:52,950 --> 00:18:04,960
played up the number just for security
purposes

217
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,940
so we're gonna talk a little bit up
countermeasures in these countermeasures

218
00:18:07,940 --> 00:18:11,649
don't really just pretend to square they
can pertain to any company working in

219
00:18:11,649 --> 00:18:16,309
this area or in a lot of other areas as
well the first thing for the software

220
00:18:16,309 --> 00:18:21,220
tech this really important is to remove
the claims of the old model security if

221
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:25,899
you know your product is insecure then
you shouldn't be claiming it is at the

222
00:18:25,899 --> 00:18:31,219
bottom line they should also enforce the
deprecation of the old models instead of

223
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:37,480
just saying it should implement it and
make sure that it is bullet proof beyond

224
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:41,000
that you should definitely make sure
that your products are easy to

225
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,190
deprecated in case

226
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:50,520
security issues come up signals will
help to prevent fraud so that you can

227
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:54,520
easily over your customers and you can
be easily alerted that something isn't

228
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,440
going quite right

229
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,770
also it would be important for this to
decline the stale swipes based on

230
00:19:00,770 --> 00:19:05,649
transaction counter so if it's not
monotonically increasing don't let it

231
00:19:05,649 --> 00:19:09,549
happen on the hardware side again

232
00:19:09,549 --> 00:19:14,690
enforce the deprecation it's very
important it doesn't automatically

233
00:19:14,690 --> 00:19:18,470
resolve the issue but it makes it a
little bit harder as we've seen for a

234
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:23,159
malicious merchant to utilize this
tactic additionally what would really

235
00:19:23,159 --> 00:19:26,370
help solve this problem 100% is just too

236
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:29,459
movie encryption shipped directly to the
magnetic head and then Potter as an

237
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:33,110
assembly in that way you wouldn't be
able to crush the encryption ship were

238
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:36,240
removing corruption all without
destroying the magnetic head and making

239
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:43,740
it useless we disclose these reports to
square in December of 2014 and received

240
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:49,580
mixed results on the software side like
I said we reported in the summer of 2014

241
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:53,740
and the tree are see issue and told us
they had a transaction transaction

242
00:19:53,740 --> 00:20:00,049
counter in January of 2015 they looked
into recognizing the couch out of order

243
00:20:00,049 --> 00:20:03,720
and denying those transactions but found
that it was difficult because multiple

244
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,750
data centers can be hard to sync with
race conditions and also they have a

245
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:13,700
special thing from merchants where they
actually let them

246
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:18,440
use the reader's and offline
transactions and with different square

247
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:21,970
register accounts so that can make it
hard to make sure that they are

248
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:30,429
monotonically increasing be implemented
all but one of the suggestions that we

249
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:31,880
have made here

250
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:37,230
declining still swipes based on a
calendar days implemented big move the

251
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:41,299
claims of the overall security in May
and then by July enforce the deprecation

252
00:20:41,299 --> 00:20:47,029
they had implemented racinos but they're
still not declining still swipes this is

253
00:20:47,029 --> 00:20:50,659
understandable I'm minute-to-minute kind
of basis but when it gets to the point

254
00:20:50,659 --> 00:20:54,019
of weeks or months it doesn't make sense

255
00:20:54,019 --> 00:20:59,639
make as much sense and we've opened a
huge security hole where like why

256
00:20:59,639 --> 00:21:04,639
exactly would emerge in need to play
back that's why back after a month's

257
00:21:04,639 --> 00:21:08,490
time or two months time they probably
want their money

258
00:21:08,490 --> 00:21:15,289
the hardware side we were not as
fortunate were already aware of the

259
00:21:15,289 --> 00:21:19,879
possibility that someone might tamper
with our readers in this way this attack

260
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:24,049
allows any malicious merchant to collect
credit card information anonymously from

261
00:21:24,049 --> 00:21:29,610
their customers using scored best and
latest equipment yet to the best of our

262
00:21:29,610 --> 00:21:35,139
knowledge they have no plans to fix this
issue if you sound bytes we hope you

263
00:21:35,139 --> 00:21:39,629
guys take away from the talk we identify
software and hardware vulnerabilities

264
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:45,289
that are separate attacks and we really
hope that you take away from it that

265
00:21:45,289 --> 00:21:50,490
mobile plant sale is a rapidly growing
and really interesting area that has the

266
00:21:50,490 --> 00:21:53,100
potential for a lot of security
vulnerabilities that have yet to be

267
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:57,129
explored especially as we start moving
away from the magnetic stripe and it's a

268
00:21:57,130 --> 00:22:02,490
contactless payments there are a lot of
all abilities to be explored their thank

269
00:22:02,490 --> 00:22:03,950
everyone for coming

270
00:22:03,950 --> 00:22:07,769
big thank you to professor I
trachtenberg audience today for all of

271
00:22:07,769 --> 00:22:11,720
his support and please complete this be
your feedback surveys if you have any

272
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:16,000
questions feel free to stick around
otherwise feel free to go thank you
