1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,010
welcome back at you were expecting that
many people will be excited that there's

2
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:15,960
so many people here so you comin over
here but i wanna go to do with you guys

3
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:22,740
really talking about what is the problem
that's my research trying to address bro

4
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:38,489
order checks out a little bit more read
all together with open source framework

5
00:00:38,489 --> 00:00:40,968
that route

6
00:00:40,969 --> 00:00:54,489
little bit about the lumberjack and I'm
okay with this will be a lot of that has

7
00:00:54,489 --> 00:00:59,180
been products so treats

8
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:15,539
laws security organs like it a lot of
people security architecture you start

9
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:57,500
middle and really like but do you like
it

10
00:01:57,500 --> 00:03:07,579
that's why the developers are so really
we're all so when we do get roseanne

11
00:03:07,580 --> 00:04:00,910
themselves what that means that we could
blow out like

12
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:28,300
probably the first here's a few sample
input that they have they have over 40

13
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:32,650
inputs that are really nice things like
TCP or UDP collector for things like

14
00:04:32,650 --> 00:05:11,429
this log files on the console doing
things they do things like GeoIP you can

15
00:05:11,430 --> 00:05:16,640
see where traffic is going to in and out
of your network in there really a nice

16
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:20,020
one that I like is the translate which
is another community plugins which

17
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:23,180
allows you to really enhance the data to
are managed to get into that a little

18
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:27,800
bit later then you gotta put that data
somewhere so what they call the Elks

19
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,230
stack is elasticsearch

20
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:36,640
so they were really really tied into the
elected elasticsearch court but also do

21
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:41,510
things like boorda syslog alright other
traditional relational databases email

22
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:46,960
pager duty they have quite a few
different incentives so I highly

23
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:50,960
recommend you to look into what they
have since they can probably integrate

24
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,090
into your existing tools

25
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:59,070
so what we gotta do so it's not just a
one-time use many of these things like

26
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:03,639
you know TCP collector send it through
quite a few different filters and then

27
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:08,020
I'll put it into mobile different places
and when should do stand out to make

28
00:06:08,020 --> 00:06:10,719
sure you're getting the right
information you really meant mix match

29
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:15,570
and play with the ones that are to your
manager you get something that looks

30
00:06:15,570 --> 00:06:21,260
like this you can start visualizing cool
things and you look up addresses and

31
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,330
ports

32
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:27,139
histograms and show you know of traffic
so we can see here there might have been

33
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:32,560
a weird anomaly in the middle of the day
so it's a lot of information and you

34
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,889
might do some anomaly detection by
looking at it but it doesn't really mean

35
00:06:37,889 --> 00:06:42,919
much a lot of information and you need
contacts on how you do that so what do

36
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:46,460
you want to use to do that is something
that is sort of threat intelligence

37
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:49,930
there's quite a few different ways we
can do it but there's a really cool with

38
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:57,280
Bro actually jumping ahead with all that
data is that a lot of information and

39
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:02,500
it's really drinking from a firehose one
of my coworkers analogy is that it's

40
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:07,350
like it's like finding a needle in a
stack of needles right and it's the

41
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,550
security data that you're getting is not
it's becoming more than just big data

42
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:17,780
it's Leo be stated so some but there is
no way to get around this and solve this

43
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:21,039
problem that's what threat intelligence
so there's a company called critical

44
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:26,810
stack and they are a free online service
is going you login account and it's a

45
00:07:26,810 --> 00:07:30,389
point-and-click integration with
intelligent bees that are out there so

46
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:33,620
you can just sign up for the things and
just choose I wanna know about command

47
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,979
control sir i want to know about or
maybe I'll hashes or maybe I want to

48
00:07:38,979 --> 00:07:39,710
look at

49
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:45,430
malicious domains and hosting this is
quite a few of them he doesn't start

50
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:48,990
their agent and aggregates all this
information can pull it together he

51
00:07:48,990 --> 00:07:53,599
writes it into what is known as bro code
so right that's broken read this

52
00:07:53,599 --> 00:08:00,169
information over a hundred different
speeds now dated and they're getting

53
00:08:00,169 --> 00:08:03,020
close to having it over one million
indicators of comp

54
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:06,180
so as your data is looking at this in
real time you can reference threat

55
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:10,430
intelligence and be able to know if you
know the day the information coming out

56
00:08:10,430 --> 00:08:13,710
of your environment is malicious or
their malicious file fascist things like

57
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:18,318
that it's really cool that I was also in
this is if you are collecting packet

58
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,819
capture data you can records

59
00:08:19,819 --> 00:08:26,979
intelligence do similar threat
intelligence with logs that get into

60
00:08:26,979 --> 00:08:31,860
using the custom filters in the message
filtering get the really cool

61
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:36,729
information out at custom fields to
really admitted at the logs that are

62
00:08:36,729 --> 00:08:41,610
coming in to give you additional context
and do things like you I P Dave matching

63
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:46,570
and the really cool and is using the
friendly does this not just a high level

64
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:50,720
of you know what you gotta do you know
we can really you know what I'm your

65
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,740
nerd glasses and in and out as we look
at some code here so this is what a

66
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:59,770
typical logs dash normalization ships
out of the box that's going to normalize

67
00:08:59,770 --> 00:09:04,370
and Apache and pull up things like the
the IP address input into the you know

68
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:08,950
the client feels like a word but in the
method column you know and so on and so

69
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:09,300
forth

70
00:09:09,300 --> 00:09:13,430
there's a lot of information which is
cool for you know when you're just doing

71
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:17,819
and getting a concept up as you start
deploying this this configuration files

72
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:22,350
gonna get very messy very quickly what I
like to do is utilized custom patterns

73
00:09:22,350 --> 00:09:25,959
so I can take all of that rejection and
code and thrown into a custom pattern

74
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:30,680
directory for a different rule file for
each one of my devices normalizing and

75
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:34,649
then just create a rule I D reach one of
those messages that are normalized then

76
00:09:34,649 --> 00:09:37,779
I can just reference to a lady in the
configuration file and it makes it

77
00:09:37,779 --> 00:09:41,689
really clean to look at really simple
but there's additional data that we can

78
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:46,620
use this for there's not just for
cleaning up a configuration we can do is

79
00:09:46,620 --> 00:09:50,120
add conditional filtering off of this
meeting start looking at you know what

80
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:56,180
message is actually coming in by
referencing the the regex what message

81
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:57,099
looks like

82
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:02,170
looks confusing but as you get you going
to do is remove your capture groups from

83
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:09,219
your configuration and then just throw
that data up near conditional so

84
00:10:09,220 --> 00:10:14,139
not very interesting but this allows us
to do is use the field functionality in

85
00:10:14,139 --> 00:10:17,850
logs that we can do things like add
metadata to the information do things

86
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:22,069
exceed doing you know adding action
object and status which may not be in

87
00:10:22,069 --> 00:10:27,319
the log message but we can infer from
what I like to do with it is at a rule I

88
00:10:27,319 --> 00:10:32,290
D which not necessarily will give you
security context but it cleans up the

89
00:10:32,290 --> 00:10:37,379
operational performance of logs that so
long as a top-down normalization engine

90
00:10:37,379 --> 00:10:40,050
so it's gonna go through from the top
and start hitting all of your regex

91
00:10:40,050 --> 00:10:43,639
rules of the road that using at the
bottom of your configuration you're

92
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:47,860
wasting precious cycles to try to get
that regular expressions you can run can

93
00:10:47,860 --> 00:10:53,149
continue our reports for your most
commonly used and then just bubbles up

94
00:10:53,149 --> 00:10:57,129
to the top of your configuration file
another large stash is performing a ok

95
00:10:57,129 --> 00:11:05,240
you do things like GeoIP they ship out
of the box for the Elks back with you I

96
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:10,129
P templates that you get up and running
the problem is they give you one when

97
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:13,490
you get things like a source IP and a
destination IP

98
00:11:13,490 --> 00:11:18,089
shoes so we gonna do is kind of massage
the templates a little bit and get it to

99
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:26,750
be able to see the information that you
really care about how do we do that we

100
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:32,000
can pull it out of there are people out
of elastic search so he was a very

101
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:35,420
simple cream under the command line and
it comes out the template that is

102
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:39,389
currently being used by large stash and
you can just copy and replace what you

103
00:11:39,389 --> 00:11:43,639
want to use you take you know that uip
feel that it doesn't understand or you

104
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:46,819
can do things like your source IP
address your destination IP addresses

105
00:11:46,819 --> 00:11:52,149
proxy addresses so on and so forth
there's no limit to how many just

106
00:11:52,149 --> 00:11:57,600
noticeable command line pop up the
template you're good to go off so Dave

107
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,180
matter is an interesting one so doesn't
seem like it to be very interesting as

108
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:04,099
you're collecting data in real-time as
the data that's coming in is gonna get

109
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:08,480
logged that time stamp as you collected
where this is valuable as when you're

110
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,779
doing the bro packet capture analysis
his bros gonna look at the time stamp

111
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:17,110
from your packet captures and throw that
into the log message so we can do is

112
00:12:17,110 --> 00:12:17,820
look at the

113
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:21,830
at the time stamp from the actual dog
and use that for the time stamp in the

114
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:25,980
message so when you feed all the your
packet capture logs from Bro analog /

115
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:29,230
just getting a huge dump of information
you know right when you collected the

116
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:32,050
data you can do it and spread that
information over time as you can see in

117
00:12:32,050 --> 00:12:35,390
Amelie isn't gonna see the history of
the potential attack they're looking at

118
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:42,199
me by Nicola no its threat intelligence
so the threat intelligence is a piece

119
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:45,750
that doesn't really ship with large data
gonna get a massage would make it do it

120
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:50,570
so there's the translate plugin with the
translate plugin allows you to do it at

121
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:55,360
a community plugin doesn't ship with its
you install it allows us to do lookups

122
00:12:55,360 --> 00:13:00,030
of IP addresses so in the example here
and doing a translation on my

123
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:05,069
destination IP field event ODST IP I
take the you know what I find a

124
00:13:05,070 --> 00:13:11,400
destination IP looks at you know the the
tourists to see that exists if it does

125
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:16,829
what I do is I just throw the word yes
in a field called Corexit and I want to

126
00:13:16,830 --> 00:13:22,370
go into Gabbana I can just run a quick
search any message that says tour exit I

127
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:27,480
P yes and this is done for any field so
I can do things like towards the babies

128
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:33,110
and control servers militias known
phishing campaigns there's really no

129
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:39,050
limit to what you can do you can do up
to roughly to a half million signatures

130
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:44,209
while that's where I can hit my limit
but I was running on a Raspberry Pi so

131
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:50,160
that might have been you know because
according as you get transcripts

132
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,949
collects data on a regular basis

133
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:58,310
normalize it into a young file and large
nationalist reenact every 300 seconds or

134
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:03,109
minutes you can figure out if that's too
much or too little but just in real time

135
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:07,890
you can get this information for you
threat intelligence so what does that

136
00:14:07,890 --> 00:14:14,720
get us here is a standard out with a log
/ message to the wrong message that I

137
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,579
normalized using

138
00:14:16,579 --> 00:14:20,079
you know everything that I just talked
about things like our IP addresses by

139
00:14:20,079 --> 00:14:27,429
little hard to see my mouth to appear
addresses in our reports and you know

140
00:14:27,429 --> 00:14:32,799
it's the valuable data gets out so we
get things I carsey eat eggs using any

141
00:14:32,799 --> 00:14:41,079
using the field we have our threat
intelligence knowing that this is a tour

142
00:14:41,079 --> 00:14:46,540
and get rdy he did it really

143
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:50,129
and handling that data to give it
additional context that we may not have

144
00:14:50,129 --> 00:14:53,799
had before so bored when you're looking
at c'mon we just saw a bunch of IP

145
00:14:53,799 --> 00:14:57,350
addresses you know what does that mean
we start making it you know a little bit

146
00:14:57,350 --> 00:15:01,860
more valuable to us GeoIP maps and and
see you know all of the militia psyches

147
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:06,199
are coming into my network you know were
they talking to you know and you know

148
00:15:06,199 --> 00:15:13,508
what are they talking back on here maybe
you know your critical asset is a green

149
00:15:13,509 --> 00:15:20,799
pasture internal database red flag right
so you're adding additional context all

150
00:15:20,799 --> 00:15:23,369
of this information

151
00:15:23,369 --> 00:15:28,449
another visualization of greatness
decade or so this is the information

152
00:15:28,449 --> 00:15:31,599
that we're getting from critical stack
so instead of just looking at IP

153
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:35,529
addresses were building that context
around what we know is malicious or what

154
00:15:35,529 --> 00:15:40,329
someone is telling us is malicious so
it's all good

155
00:15:40,329 --> 00:15:45,019
doing all this stuff in real-time which
is actually we all want real-time

156
00:15:45,019 --> 00:15:50,709
detection but the problem with that is
let's say your assets are talking to an

157
00:15:50,709 --> 00:15:55,279
IP address me check it against our
threat intelligence says no we're good

158
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:55,709
to go

159
00:15:55,709 --> 00:16:02,189
I'm good I'm safe an hour later that's
no malicious IP address on file already

160
00:16:02,189 --> 00:16:07,738
done your real time analysis you don't
know that you've been on this is where

161
00:16:07,739 --> 00:16:13,179
art artist framework comes in so this is
a open source of you to look at what

162
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:20,319
it's going to do is any doctor who
thinks it's not the actual spaceship

163
00:16:20,319 --> 00:16:21,640
they were doing

164
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:27,310
but it wasn't gonna do is ingest IOC did
so that things like sticks are Yarra

165
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:31,530
being able to look at Starbucks
observables things like while hashes IP

166
00:16:31,530 --> 00:16:35,530
addresses but also look at a
vulnerability scan data we can tell you

167
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,600
if you know this is a known

168
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:43,670
intelligence known malicious IP
addresses known as things like that but

169
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:48,930
we can also build more complex stuff
using you know the format from either so

170
00:16:48,930 --> 00:16:52,729
we can build things like we know what
shell-shocked vulnerability looks like

171
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:56,710
let's go search for it so you can take
your vulnerability scan data feed it

172
00:16:56,710 --> 00:16:57,370
through TARDIS

173
00:16:57,370 --> 00:17:04,300
to know if any of your assets have been
exported to think of it you know a time

174
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:07,129
or two of all of your friends o'clock
data right so instead of just real time

175
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:12,240
you go back and look at it and it's
available here from the trip wires get

176
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,609
home page or go down noted I will be
doing a demo at Arsenal little bit later

177
00:17:17,609 --> 00:17:20,119
this afternoon if you're interested in
seeing kind of a hands on it how it

178
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:24,149
works so I highly recommend you can do
it so here's a visualization of how it

179
00:17:24,150 --> 00:17:28,120
works so for example we're gonna take a
sixer sidewalks observable feed it into

180
00:17:28,119 --> 00:17:32,149
art artists framework search your you
know depository whether that's you know

181
00:17:32,150 --> 00:17:38,010
something like he'll see anything that
has an open API then call you know do

182
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:41,210
searches for remotely and then just
double that information out into a

183
00:17:41,210 --> 00:17:47,270
database so just wrap up here you know
three key things are going to take away

184
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:51,040
from today using network security
monitoring with log is very powerful you

185
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:54,930
should definitely look at doing it if
you're not doing it already using

186
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:58,950
security tools with intelligence threat
intelligence wear whatever provider it

187
00:17:58,950 --> 00:18:03,710
would be you should be doing this
somebody knows something is bad you

188
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:07,610
should be looking in your environment to
see if it's there that real time or you

189
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:16,419
can also do it as a historical analysis
so I said they are gonna get home on my

190
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:20,190
homepage link is up here there's going
to be a few scripts available and and

191
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:25,190
also you have things like your bro
normalization rules for large stash you

192
00:18:25,190 --> 00:18:29,380
scripts to to pull data from the
internet

193
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:33,920
format into the files get up and running
in a really cool script that will allow

194
00:18:33,920 --> 00:18:38,410
you to analyze a lot of packet capture
data and heated through the bro ideas

195
00:18:38,410 --> 00:18:45,650
and those log files out intelligently so
happy dads day open any questions if

196
00:18:45,650 --> 00:19:00,230
anybody has anything like tcpdump real
sharp things like that it's only normal

197
00:19:00,230 --> 00:19:11,960
pcap format then you're good to go I
have not anybody else
