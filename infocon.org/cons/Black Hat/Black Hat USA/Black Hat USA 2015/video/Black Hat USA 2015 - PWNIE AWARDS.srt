1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:12,660
alright welcome to the 2015 tony awards
for this is this your first tony awards

2
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:19,520
if it's your first pony words you have
to fight back

3
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:32,509
alright so that means is that people
don't come back after one term so the

4
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:36,649
pony awards ceremony celebrate the
successes and failures of the Investec

5
00:00:36,649 --> 00:00:47,899
community this is the 27th year of the
pony award we appreciate black hat

6
00:00:47,899 --> 00:00:55,480
hosting us for its entire existence 26
so let me introduce the judges we have

7
00:00:55,480 --> 00:01:05,620
just seen bombing you know

8
00:01:05,620 --> 00:01:21,900
Brandon Edwards decorate also known as
dr. read by the hacker alias dr. we have

9
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:30,490
to find Travis Goodspeed and Travis is a
new addition to the judges panel this

10
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:34,520
year we have another new addition who is
basically attached at the hip to Chris

11
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:55,810
policy Charlie Miller Dr Charlie Miller
and of course but I'm pretty sure you

12
00:01:55,810 --> 00:02:08,810
guys are here to see us start with the
awards so horny for probably most

13
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:16,930
antiquated category we have on here now
because Sarah side bugs basically at

14
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,860
this point right because they've all
been

15
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:31,090
that fly yeah yeah I mean they're badass
in the nineties they were bad and its

16
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:41,440
steps in my head and I don't know how
important the nineties next I don't know

17
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:48,720
match I don't know computers so the
nominees for Best set aside our

18
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:57,550
compression vulnerability in ASAP if
you're not familiar with ASAP you

19
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:00,830
probably shouldn't be at this conference
because it's all the business bullshit

20
00:03:00,830 --> 00:03:07,250
the cool thing was there were two
vulnerabilities in the decompression

21
00:03:07,250 --> 00:03:13,350
algorithms which remains wildly popular
by the 2001 slick antitrust and that's

22
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:21,250
how they were actually implemented as a
result code execution and the nice thing

23
00:03:21,250 --> 00:03:25,620
about this right it's not like you're
happy my computer where it's all

24
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:31,650
pictures of my dog and you know I stuff
this is all business contacts so pretty

25
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:36,870
pretty high profile you get a lot of
good contact they can sell for crack

26
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:49,560
cocaine the parties without nomination
for something involving the obviously

27
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:58,410
neil has to have a bug in here just a
ton of overflows in the ntpd several

28
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:05,310
where basically everything everything
that could have been wrong with this

29
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:14,140
code was shockingly stephen rote rote
girl and put it all out I know everyone

30
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:19,269
so surprised that that something
involving the probabilistic and very

31
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:29,470
complicated but I'm calling magneto
shoplift vulnerabilities apparently this

32
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:34,530
things used everywhere the web except we
don't know about it because it's ok it

33
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:40,119
was the bingo card it was following
clues as well injection

34
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,760
it was basically everything that you
could ever find it a server was this

35
00:04:44,760 --> 00:04:49,050
should probably be used for training
material for future research because it

36
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:56,190
literally contains 11 everything that
you could ever find thirdly there's the

37
00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:17,780
one that I don't know much about and
I'll tell you for a fact wins

38
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:23,289
make them

39
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:38,199
with new metal like to accept his new
medical if any of you are not near

40
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:57,249
Meadowood do come up to the front

41
00:05:57,249 --> 00:06:05,649
next-generation client-side portability
because what's better than reaching out

42
00:06:05,649 --> 00:06:09,359
across the internet owning that one
special person in particular

43
00:06:09,359 --> 00:06:16,888
so this award is worried that according
to the person who discovered exploited

44
00:06:16,889 --> 00:06:21,589
the most technically sophisticated and
interesting client-side vulnerability

45
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:34,939
nominees for best kinds i'd bug are
dramatic effect will plant by jus room

46
00:06:34,939 --> 00:06:38,789
also I like her I like to add for the
record if you don't brand your

47
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:43,639
vulnerability we will try and be like
you know look very distinct possibility

48
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:47,959
and you name it after the Civic aspects
of it but we're trying to go bad jokes

49
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:58,339
if you remember it better because the
details are really hard so this was ok

50
00:06:58,339 --> 00:07:04,049
so this is one bug to rule them all as
one single vulnerability in Adobe font

51
00:07:04,049 --> 00:07:06,750
rendering code surprise

52
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:12,590
code execution on Adobe Reader break out
of the sand box on the Dolby reader and

53
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:14,549
wait for it wait for it wait for it

54
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:18,990
privilege escalation through the Windows
kernel

55
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:34,020
care about the sandbox stop next nominee
trouser snake I mean what's the ability

56
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:38,990
to a campaign that exploited a
vulnerability in the action was blown

57
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:43,430
know it's pronounced Olay Olay package
manager that allows for the lodging

58
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:48,710
photo lab chemist accused bypassing all
medications and all that stuff because I

59
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:53,120
surprised sometimes there are bugs that
don't involve corrupting memory and it

60
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:59,230
can be searched for generically by
static analysis so called Santorum and

61
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:08,940
it was discovered and exploited by
unknown their nominee it's a setup I

62
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:24,210
think we did you guys get it explain the
joke he later set up by Tavis Ormandy no

63
00:08:24,210 --> 00:08:29,688
stranger to anyone in the research
community traps

64
00:08:29,689 --> 00:08:51,340
and

65
00:08:51,340 --> 00:09:47,510
and try harder I don't know where I
could just should win like really late

66
00:09:47,510 --> 00:09:57,030
for you guys to rate on track with a
razor sales things if they hadn't sold

67
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:27,360
their products so hard it would play for
you

68
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:49,560
set down if you don't supply a video we
have to dance so for all the ways that

69
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:58,930
last night weekend and we had extensive
discussions about what makes a privilege

70
00:10:58,930 --> 00:11:09,489
escalation bug bit and champagne we
concluded that we would like to stick to

71
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:16,170
focusing on the bed itself rather than
the larger research class that it might

72
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:19,199
belong to so with that in mind

73
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:36,399
nominations for 2015 I'm sorry I'm not
wait for some of you may have some

74
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:40,370
really interesting research that come
out of the academic community starting

75
00:11:40,370 --> 00:11:45,180
at Carnegie Mellon University with
regards to hardware fault injection will

76
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:51,680
specifically targeting the deer and chip
and that research was picked up by some

77
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:54,699
Google researchers

78
00:11:54,700 --> 00:12:10,550
anyway they wrote a Piercy exploit that
has a bunch of that slipping into magic

79
00:12:10,550 --> 00:12:14,170
stuff that results in kinda level
religious coalition and also the

80
00:12:14,170 --> 00:12:19,270
demonstrated browsers sandbox escape
capabilities but they're not done the

81
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:24,170
research and academic community is
continuing to build upon that the

82
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:27,719
researchers out of France and Austria

83
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:33,230
something called written in JavaScript
it's a similar type of PRC and we're

84
00:12:33,230 --> 00:12:35,880
very interested in continuing to watch
this space

85
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:44,610
next is loading your hardware from
JavaScript kinda cool what's that space

86
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:51,560
you will be alright you will be back
next year everybody including those the

87
00:12:51,560 --> 00:13:00,500
team including a woman moving on in
politics is an Android exploit based on

88
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:05,860
a Linux but I believed by some
up-and-coming people known as Jeanne

89
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:13,300
team and I think they are presenting
that research right here at the next

90
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:21,550
nomination UEFI this is really
interesting research that is based upon

91
00:13:21,550 --> 00:13:26,689
some weaknesses in the modern day
replacement to the BIOS which Microsoft

92
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:30,410
Live pushed out with Windows 8 and
beyond for security features but this is

93
00:13:30,410 --> 00:13:34,839
all about security weaknesses that come
along with the security features which

94
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:39,030
is an opportunity that some of us are
interested in these days

95
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:49,030
Windows API that Corey calemburg and his
team rider I believe just got this

96
00:13:49,030 --> 00:13:56,780
ability is in a Microsoft API that can
be taken advantage off for kernel level

97
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,810
actually its use a lands to

98
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:03,449
ring at minus two which is

99
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:15,430
privileges I believe which is kind of
awesome in UEFI machines pretty much

100
00:14:15,430 --> 00:14:21,329
everywhere and nobody really knows what
this is going forward so pretty awesome

101
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:29,010
research next nominee at each year
TrueType fonts this is a reply in the

102
00:14:29,010 --> 00:14:36,890
teacher engine within 132 again keen
team they presented this research there

103
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:44,449
in the air and I believe they also used
it to take away some cash money can

104
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:52,410
stick with earlier this year and last
but not least the blend ability but we

105
00:14:52,410 --> 00:14:59,279
have already addressed this was also
nominated for privilege escalation again

106
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:03,410
using the same vulnerability twice once
in a day before my code execution and

107
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:10,300
again in windows for privilege
escalation and covered earlier this year

108
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:14,089
that says a lot for being nominated in
two separate category that's how awesome

109
00:15:14,089 --> 00:15:25,990
the bug is so despite their the really
intense competition judges came to fish

110
00:15:25,990 --> 00:15:34,750
and despite the competition

111
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:56,040
presented by the amazing research that's
going on with this

112
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:35,769
speech but anyway we didn't expect to
win races and integer overflow which is

113
00:16:35,769 --> 00:16:44,079
probably a thing I guess numbers aren't
aren't forever and some kind of about

114
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:50,638
this it's not an average nursing he is
not an average of nineteen exceptional

115
00:16:50,639 --> 00:17:00,220
so his cape and I know how to use my
iraq here's the thing I love playing

116
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:07,829
this thing here for like 20 mins

117
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:53,720
mixed up in real-time to the marketing
and the rapper was alright but alcohol

118
00:17:53,720 --> 00:18:07,549
is a prerequisite for being a pony judge

119
00:18:07,549 --> 00:18:26,820
donations but I got two dollars three
buttons and a couple of stickers and we

120
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:34,779
want to remind the rest of you if you
could donate more you could win easily

121
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:42,730
bribed group on the plant worse than
FIFA up here easily without further ado

122
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:56,549
I present the nominees for the threat
but Tony most innovative research says

123
00:18:56,549 --> 00:19:01,840
this is the pony ward for which is
probably why would they like the most

124
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:12,949
prestigious award to win for one year
represents the best of everything we got

125
00:19:12,950 --> 00:19:25,410
I am actually acts so our first right to
do this is one about there were

126
00:19:25,410 --> 00:19:30,630
allegations place or at least proposed
for colonel exploitation

127
00:19:30,630 --> 00:19:34,720
these guys discuss how they work to
circumvent how to make it better

128
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,170
bunch of academic dude whose names I
won't say well done

129
00:19:38,170 --> 00:19:50,290
dudes I mean our first things I can't
say that next up is this is my first

130
00:19:50,290 --> 00:20:05,940
time at the polls great thank you so so
next up modern platform supported kids

131
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:12,010
are really going every hour so this this
is about their able to take advantage of

132
00:20:12,010 --> 00:20:21,080
hardware heard you know they were able
to use hard various harder features

133
00:20:21,080 --> 00:20:26,030
mostly Intel platforms to assistive
technologies for instance in telegraph

134
00:20:26,030 --> 00:20:29,940
and also known as trusted execution
technology to build a protected from

135
00:20:29,940 --> 00:20:33,750
liability or modification by the
operating system this is why when I

136
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:38,850
write books I always have him as a co-op
also passed middle manager in the game

137
00:20:38,850 --> 00:20:43,659
right now if I were you I would work for
you know so yes it's the best action

138
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:55,580
items these guys were able to wear
things to have kids that the right but

139
00:20:55,580 --> 00:21:07,580
advanced enterprise as far as I know
this is a group who has logo and that's

140
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:17,000
all I know you have to be a real
experience gonna change the world never

141
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:22,730
gonna be the same so so well done but
sadly dry but now has been nominated for

142
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:28,560
Mosinee research and I have not every
biker guess next of abusing silent

143
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:35,600
mitigation these are a bunch of boys so
they look that Internet Explorer and

144
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:45,939
and try to explain I E harder these
explain exactly how this new how you

145
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:51,910
could still explode in some situations
and how to make it better so pretty like

146
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:54,480
to talk about before I met him

147
00:21:54,480 --> 00:22:03,460
code injection hacker who are I used to
do real work for the next year

148
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:09,650
best hacking will be an award and then
finally and perfect forward secrecy by

149
00:22:09,650 --> 00:22:16,580
again a bunch of economic duty we didn't
even bother to list their names as a

150
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:21,750
logjam so this was a day where my boys
at the end of day could sit sit between

151
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:25,070
conversation

152
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:34,059
downgraded and so it's like explore
where the which means I mean boys and so

worker bee so

165
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:57,730
I'm pretty good at the memory corruption
hiring

166
00:25:57,730 --> 00:26:03,350

vendors as we want oh my god this

175
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,800

just like that the cream rises to the

176
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:27,440
top so anyway i mean the vendors are so

Seagate now as I love has nothing to do
with this storage

182
00:27:58,730 --> 00:28:04,750
they're pretty shitty about it but when
I think they're pretty terrible it's a

183
00:28:04,750 --> 00:28:23,120
Samsung it's a Chinese company right now
anyway there was this really terrible

184
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:28,330
man and mental that happened with the C
gates and and and and Android for the

185
00:28:28,330 --> 00:28:31,250
something and it was awful

186
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:38,510
still none of us are patched and I run

189
00:28:56,620 --> 00:29:10,580
this

190
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:29,059
suffocating title as you come to this
day I was on vacation when that happens

191
00:29:29,059 --> 00:29:46,570
well done it takes a lot of guts to come
up and accept some of these awards we

192
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:59,010
appreciate it I want that guys by the
lawyer is also looking for a job I

193
00:29:59,010 --> 00:30:14,990
recommend threat but the judging thing
we're sitting there and we're totally

194
00:30:14,990 --> 00:30:33,690
guys that's just like ya rightfully
height of the judges are not eligible to

195
00:30:33,690 --> 00:30:46,750
win in a previous year I was now has not
had enough it was for the original

196
00:30:46,750 --> 00:30:54,919
iPhone changes everything is seven
before like any of these people were in

197
00:30:54,919 --> 00:31:05,399
there I asked to present the coolest
stuff that you know the most badass hack

198
00:31:05,399 --> 00:31:08,699
and then I drink too much champagne and
when I wake up they tell me that I have

199
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:16,320
to do most of which is a tiny stuff so
the nominees for this section

200
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:37,399
bash shell shocked I heard I shouldn't
use bad is that right I is a show it's

201
00:31:37,399 --> 00:31:44,658
nice but that means I don't know Bastian
tax

202
00:31:44,659 --> 00:32:00,399
text message here like sending illegal
to crash anyway only nikita my phone so

203
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:08,928
I could answer god damn text messages
that's only tax but it's just a denial

204
00:32:08,929 --> 00:32:12,850
of service so what you should do is
figure out how to weaponize this and

205
00:32:12,850 --> 00:32:21,779
then come back next year and finally and
this man is near and dear to my heart

206
00:32:21,779 --> 00:32:41,799
aches what they figured out you could
use the floppy disk controller to this

207
00:32:41,799 --> 00:32:54,250
is pretty tough game related but I'm
doing the other things I might as well

208
00:32:54,250 --> 00:33:02,120
as she took this controller and she's
writing a crude for a min there

209
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:10,539
something out of range beyond the end of
the file in this paper that buffer is a

210
00:33:10,539 --> 00:33:19,840
Tetris game as an exit 260 file and just
touch whatever time he and the amount

211
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,340
that you boot from it

212
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:23,770
Tetris Tetris

213
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:30,710
and who take PRI d its which is the
rainbow colors and that's nifty venom is

214
00:33:30,710 --> 00:33:52,800
not so

215
00:33:52,800 --> 00:34:21,560
are there any bash developers in the
audience Ryan was asked the question by

216
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:28,040
a reporter what are you thinking when
the shell shocked exists and Ryan's

217
00:34:28,040 --> 00:35:09,790
response my plan worked for 25 years and
for failing and epic manner

218
00:35:09,790 --> 00:35:19,250
basically these people have have let you
down not only as an industry but as

219
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:26,490
personal human beings it's your parents
telling you that they're not angry with

220
00:35:26,490 --> 00:35:34,350
you pointed and that's that's just
fucking worse that's worse

221
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:37,100
shouldn't be

222
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:45,680
is that OPM breach which I believe when
I checked Wikipedia last stands for the

223
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:52,100
office of personally mother fucker data
so that's pretty

224
00:35:52,100 --> 00:36:00,610
those fuckers there is now a house
everything that you told them to get

225
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:03,400
your TAS that you did weird in college

226
00:36:03,400 --> 00:36:12,340
everybody knows now so raise a glass to
college to I did some real weird shit so

227
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:18,010
awesome someone read about it some day
when they write my biography the next

228
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:24,530
one is + bank it was a Polish bank we
were not tech savvy enough to use Google

229
00:36:24,530 --> 00:36:28,710
Translate so we don't know much about it

230
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:37,839
the cool thing was they pulled up until
guy said he was on vacation

231
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:42,020
classiest move ever which was like that

00:37:26,630 --> 00:37:36,319
data this is honestly something I didn't
bother researching before coming here

239
00:37:36,319 --> 00:37:43,650
today against the winner was not a
winner

240

Justin who wear shoes I'm sure he's

242
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:11,450
really nice looking dog it's hard to
grab a stable code base and make really

243
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:17,098
secure privacy where web browser I know
just what I thought to cause I crack

244
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:23,529
that shit out a weekend but we can all
be all stars like me right now this and

245

251
00:39:50,280 --> 00:40:25,500
a bad knees I'm I guess where I there
was a nation for this and they called it

252
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:36,030
and thought they were funny and so but
it was not funny it was terrible so we

253
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:57,830
actually replace it with 3:15 so I kill

showing the award winner before the
first time this practice Charlie topping

255

the hackers responsible for delivering

260
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:08,149
the most damaging widely-publicized or
most importantly larious ownage so let's

261
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:12,960
go for the nominees in the nominees are
first Kaspersky Lab owned by Jupiter

262
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:39,030

268
00:43:41,950 --> 00:44:02,009
will give this to Morgan for offering
these I am NOT anesthesia as hacking

269
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:07,210
team probably found out it will be a bad
idea to take credit for his work but

270
00:44:07,210 --> 00:44:26,260
yeah Thnkx fishing and hiking stores by
15% on this would also like to mention

271
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:57,650
that threat but commissions for also
exploits this is the way it's not me

272
00:44:57,650 --> 00:45:15,539
it's hard to hear from the stage so
candidates they can go make more music

273
00:45:15,539 --> 00:45:28,770
because the winner is widely cracker

274
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:40,720
as when you're here why they did it was
great being a great music

275
00:45:40,720 --> 00:45:48,399
anyone who's heard you take it literally
have all these ponies and his bag so

276
00:45:48,400 --> 00:45:55,630
we've been doing this for a long time
with original brownies make sure all

277
00:45:55,630 --> 00:46:02,550
clear on that I like the better one Gio
hot and stuff and the songs like a bad

278
00:46:02,550 --> 00:46:09,260
idea people I knew what you gotta do is
a black male your friends in writing

279
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:27,300
songs so anyway thank you just hate this

280
00:46:27,300 --> 00:46:38,870
only based on the availability of a real
artists who can actually create a

281
00:46:38,870 --> 00:46:43,180
masterpiece such as this

282
00:46:43,180 --> 00:46:49,160
each other on the back a little bit
industry who have helped shape our

283
00:46:49,160 --> 00:46:53,649
industry which I know we all appreciate
it's very rare that we get the

284
00:46:53,650 --> 00:46:57,650
opportunity to really create our own
futures and so tonight we get to

285
00:46:57,650 --> 00:47:04,230
acknowledge a few people who have done
that on our behalf and we will be one

286
00:47:04,230 --> 00:47:12,740
particular individual with the Lifetime

American side of things I haven't

289
00:47:38,620 --> 00:47:46,880
actually been a thought leader in space
down there in the nineties he's laid and

290
00:47:46,880 --> 00:47:52,620
continues to lead generations of hackers
and offensively minded security

291
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:58,420
professionals and we are very very
excited to think about his contribution

just to be nominated for his work

298
00:48:44,490 --> 00:48:52,879

privilege of meeting me she yet but I

299
00:48:52,880 --> 00:49:00,830
believe that he is a leader within keen
team any of them and that he thinks his

300
00:49:00,830 --> 00:49:06,600
leadership and learning for the last
three years or so and he continues to

training analysis he started a company

304
00:49:54,510 --> 00:50:07,559
security last week of his life

305
00:50:07,559 --> 00:50:15,630
