1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,150
you are in room gah exploiting ax ax in
functionality with will then be for

2
00:00:10,150 --> 00:00:22,448
exploiting air taxi and file upload
functionality and the booth review the

3
00:00:22,449 --> 00:00:27,529
presentation talking about sorting X
melodies external XML and these two

4
00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:31,840
different files uploading do about to
essentially exploit the vulnerability

5
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:42,670
primarily focused on XML documents so
introduced talk format of it

6
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:48,450
entities in the context of that and then
took a little further exploitation so I

7
00:00:48,450 --> 00:00:51,520
created a get-out page doesn't have
anything on it right now but tonight on

8
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:57,469
how the slides some references also like
my notes from the demos and then coat so

9
00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:01,379
I have a tool that are introducing
that's helped me a lot of the testing

10
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:08,990
process so introduced office open XML
XML it's it's what we all think about me

11
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:13,979
think of office documents so it's you
know docx pptx access all acts scratchy

12
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:19,619
power point where it can open file
format to go buy microsoft word came on

13
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:24,960
the heels of the antitrust suit its open
in the sense that the specification for

14
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,380
the apartment is open so there's an ISO
standard or its broken up into four

15
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:34,490
parts they're pretty extensively part 1
it's five thousand pages long

16
00:01:34,490 --> 00:01:39,860
it's basically like an encyclopedia of
the format itself the goal from having

17
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:44,759
opened was to create interoperability
right before this is doc rtf so by

18
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:48,460
making it opened the hopeless have other
people developing software it open it up

19
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:58,320
and allow people to use these documents
will prob 2003 and became knots 2007 and

20
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,460
now it's pretty much the standard for
the most part

21
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:09,429
format itself basically it's just got to
XML and media files inside of it so this

22
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:15,040
is actually an image from the 2007
introduction to Microsoft saving up and

23
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,150
says but include your zip archive and
then everything else of inside and I

24
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:24,650
usually break it up into three parts one
would be that document properties at the

25
00:02:24,650 --> 00:02:28,660
top there and that basically assigns a
ninety-two any files in the archive

26
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:33,000
itself so you not like carrying around
to the different parts it's just a night

27
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,330
on the right

28
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:41,390
images videos out our point presentation
this is the picture is starting to

29
00:02:41,390 --> 00:02:45,160
PowerPoint and then in the bottom left
the other probably most important part

30
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:48,970
as word and I'll spreadsheet about this
is actually the the content that you're

31
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:52,580
seeing up on the page there and also for
the markup language in the way that is

32
00:02:52,580 --> 00:02:57,670
formed terms of the general partner like
let's say you want to write an

33
00:02:57,670 --> 00:03:01,809
application and you wanted two parts
were documents microsoft recommends you

34
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:06,430
with parts in this order first you apart
their relationships file which is an XML

35
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,750
file and that assigns I D

36
00:03:08,750 --> 00:03:13,640
any file in the document next year
likely parsing content type stocks which

37
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,720
is essentially a mime type list and says
if you have an image inside this is an

38
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:26,140
image size PNG PNG inside its image /
P&G or namespace and next mall then you

39
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:30,518
probably depending on where you are
going to have to do to take apart the

40
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:34,850
following documents are so far where
this is going to be / where its document

41
00:03:34,850 --> 00:03:39,670
objects and that's the main cocktail
documents so I should budget for the

42
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:43,850
first part 2 there can be multiple
relationships different opportunities

43
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:52,320
and they're gonna be testing a web app
on the web app allows you to upload it

44
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:57,880
worked out to an end to it you want to
test to doing the attack inside of the

45
00:03:57,880 --> 00:04:00,859
white rapper in the inside of the word
as you uploaded to the web about

46
00:04:00,859 --> 00:04:06,930
particular document you dismiss what
process you take the word document

47
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:12,019
tonight you can see all the files inside
you can see in the image but there's

48
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:15,560
content types that XML relationships but
also the files

49
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:21,570
just talked about you put that smell
energy into one of these files you

50
00:04:21,570 --> 00:04:25,290
probably want to target one of the files
that are parsed first so they

51
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:30,480
relationships or content types that
extra mile backup that's actually you

52
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:36,050
have a valid word document this point it
won't open an office doesn't respect Dr

53
00:04:36,050 --> 00:04:41,510
apt D but it's technically by the
specification of valid word document so

54
00:04:41,510 --> 00:04:45,730
you take that uploaded your web about
other web outside its gonna unzip the

55
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:53,110
file and execute your whatever you've
done your external XML any improper then

56
00:04:53,110 --> 00:05:01,820
you're making money on sacbee.com and
the very similar situation so familiar

57
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:08,250
with slack you have these groups your
wits for cooperation more or less on

58
00:05:08,250 --> 00:05:11,940
steroids kinda thing and so what are
things you can do is you can share

59
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:17,410
either so you can upload files to share
with other people

60
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:22,630
it had by putting external XML energy
into I started with content types that

61
00:05:22,630 --> 00:05:25,680
are small but you can also do their
relationships while it's actually

62
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,510
probably more preferable that to do the
relationships while put the external

63
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:36,789
entity into their backup uploaded into
the site and connected back somewhere

64
00:05:36,789 --> 00:05:44,919
different so the call is easier on
Facebook so Facebook's career site

65
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:49,299
allows you to upload your resume is a
third party sites that up to you to

66
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,830
upload your resume but if you had
external XML anything inside of it

67
00:05:52,830 --> 00:05:57,180
connected back and he could do all the
nasty things associated with a seating

68
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:02,880
read from a file system USSR out make
outbound connections for him if he

69
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:09,330
pretty well so this is what the link is
in the references but he got 6504 it so

70
00:06:09,330 --> 00:06:15,020
that's that's pretty good for you that
offer something anybody who's done this

71
00:06:15,020 --> 00:06:19,870
tactic for notice that it gets annoying
you have a lot of documents you were

72
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:25,020
like trying to edit inside of that small
so they tried to do was to automate the

73
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,729
process least for me a little bit so I
wrote a tool that it

74
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:33,998
original version is out there now but
didn't want to be up there tonight a lot

75
00:06:33,999 --> 00:06:47,110
more features I don't show it off so so
usually the first thing I'll do is all

76
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:56,680
set up just a basic I got a seat pls
because the external entities are using

77
00:06:56,680 --> 00:07:00,059
Kinect back out and so it's like a
really easy test to know that is working

78
00:07:00,059 --> 00:07:08,669
I'm sure many people also there so
there's two 2 most of the tools to build

79
00:07:08,669 --> 00:07:13,188
note which basically just means we're
gonna be building the word document you

80
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:16,649
can give it any file you want so if you
have so sometimes when I'm doing testing

81
00:07:16,649 --> 00:07:21,680
for this it'll require specific type of
file but different but it required a

82
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:26,110
spreadsheet with the specific column it
was looking for so you had to prove so I

83
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:30,999
wanted to back door while there's also
some sample files and here I just want

84
00:07:30,999 --> 00:07:37,149
to test it out without using a specific
also specify built not specify the file

85
00:07:37,149 --> 00:07:40,949
and then that allows you from there to
just choose the type of attack you want

86
00:07:40,949 --> 00:07:44,919
to do so I wanna do a remote et do so I
guess most people familiar with the

87
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:47,969
public remote et

88
00:07:47,969 --> 00:07:53,180
basically allows the document the nice
thing about both remote DTD is it even

89
00:07:53,180 --> 00:07:58,719
if external enemies are disabled it
still might trigger so choose that

90
00:07:58,719 --> 00:08:06,998
connect back to IP I have set up really
matter in this case is just go look for

91
00:08:06,999 --> 00:08:12,509
it on the server so does it opens up the
document casey's on a target a specific

92
00:08:12,509 --> 00:08:17,509
so I'm not use the relationships while
that's the first one that's parsed it

93
00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:22,919
looks insert the energy into that
creative out where documents now we have

94
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:28,599
this ballot or document here though it
can actually test out an application

95
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:37,599
even older version of XO platform here
hope this doesn't freak sweet I'll the

96
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:43,919
files uploaded and we see that we have
to connect back so we know that external

97
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:48,000
entities are in this case both DVDs
actually allow an external DTD is

98
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:53,340
allowed so from there you begin to do
the nasty stuff that you want to do this

99
00:08:53,340 --> 00:09:07,230
attack

100
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:15,890
and actually just like most people I
just try and get next melody and their

101
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:21,230
first place I usually put it is actually
another doctor Empire so opening up say

102
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:25,330
we're talking about XML putting the
energy into the top of that and then

103
00:09:25,330 --> 00:09:30,340
uploading the file to see it that string
is that president that it does also in

104
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:36,190
the tool in the casey you just wanna do
the basic test there's no security

105
00:09:36,190 --> 00:09:41,190
application to allow vanity but it is
nice and the case where all talk about

106
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:45,230
later like friends to cross site
scripting testing unlike a large-scale

107
00:09:45,230 --> 00:09:52,080
having any connection and it next one
recursive X melodies so again I don't

108
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,130
usually test for this because it's a
deal ice conditions the idea being that

109
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:59,770
it's billion last attack you create a
very large workers and with your

110
00:09:59,770 --> 00:10:06,100
energies and that exceeds the memory
stop crashes but it takes a look at some

111
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,920
of the library's parts these files so if
you are going to parts of our economy

112
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,199
and our hearts of PowerPoint you might
use one of these up here they're pretty

113
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:22,350
common so at you I dot export growth and
job open lol Open XML SDK for.net and

114
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:27,070
the nuclear it would be if you do it
will be going to the CDs but there are a

115
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:32,730
couple interesting things her hair one
if you're gonna do the patching process

116
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:37,590
you're probably doing two then possibly
two places one could be the library

117
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:42,860
explicitly disabled and the other might
be that say the JDK of the GPS actually

118
00:10:42,860 --> 00:10:48,680
depending on depending on it being
disabled other interesting things being

119
00:10:48,680 --> 00:10:53,640
that this is pretty late like 2014 it's
pretty waved actually have this patch in

120
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:57,970
here and i think is a betting man if I'm
in attacking application I'm probably

121
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:05,180
going after job it's mostly latest patch
and how would you tease still typically

122
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:09,479
work and its job and was the first one
that actually happened to see it will

123
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:16,800
have all the jobs of inversions with it
with an ace disabled by default XML SDK

124
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,670
as far as like a client was patched
pretty early

125
00:11:19,670 --> 00:11:24,060
but it also supports a lot of features
that are they may not be found in the

126
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:30,939
other library so they can be interesting
to talk about their futures for the tool

127
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:35,000
wanna adding cross-site scripting
testing imagining that if you're

128
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:39,690
uploading a document and the streets are
to be presented from the document that

129
00:11:39,690 --> 00:11:43,400
it might be nice to use their accent
that he's actually just having the

130
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:47,670
document itself again if you are a good
script at office now we get parts

131
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:53,030
downgrade would become embassy and Gigi
rather than actually having a script

132
00:11:53,030 --> 00:12:08,890
again so having it in XML we're sort of
skirting the process a little bit

133
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:12,420
example one that I'm at our place I
would have these symbols and I just got

134
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:20,040
that the bird seed symbol that you're
not sure the actual name yeah so putting

135
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,110
the symbol throughout the document the
nice thing about doing it this way is

136
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:29,320
that France's that are filed under the
comments are in different files so we

137
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:32,230
have this simple linear and replace it
go through the process going

138
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:36,090
NDP Jacksonville actually placing the
entity into it rather than going through

139
00:12:36,090 --> 00:12:40,940
each one of my hand so I would usually
cheap like a complicated by like this

140
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:47,880
ass comments headers as a drawing and
shape here and so it provides the

141
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:59,900
opportunity to try to attack at
different points again we choose our

142
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:05,170
energy in this case on its gonna do
seated up at cars so this is actually

143
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:06,709
putting

144
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:12,130
that characters were using into into
seated appeal and then it's just gone

145
00:13:12,130 --> 00:13:15,870
through the whole process of replacing
it in all of the different locations now

146
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:22,680
you can upload into a nap and check
movie possibly maybe even a small skiffs

147
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,560
we might be able to get an error out of
it that's all about like even if i cant

148
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:39,349
across the script in there and we can
get more information out of it so let's

149
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:42,450
say you have a file with your cross site
scripting strength that you always like

150
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:45,910
to check before you know you don't want
to take my hand you don't want you to

151
00:13:45,910 --> 00:13:50,510
what happened here basically create a
file for each other once you have so

152
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:57,640
it's a file descriptor on one line 40
lines along with all of your different

153
00:13:57,640 --> 00:14:03,610
actors so it was seated in this case
I've 77 checks and usually doing so it's

154
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:09,020
inserted into the file at all the
different places just got these are

155
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:16,790
things I was running in to try to make
it a little bit easier if i text so this

156
00:14:16,790 --> 00:14:21,670
is actually from a relationship while
you'll notice the relationship I D the

157
00:14:21,670 --> 00:14:29,020
type of the file and then specify as you
are the target which is in itself so

158
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:35,220
nothing inside of there just trying to
at least call there by the specification

159
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:39,550
it shouldn't allow you to actually break
out of that but the libraries all handle

160
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:42,300
different the day goes by with
interesting it's what I was playing with

161
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:46,459
the libraries they all end in a little
different manner someone air out someone

162
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:53,880
to handle it gracefully so it's just
checking for other file formats also

163
00:14:53,880 --> 00:15:00,700
added in SPG and then Office or
OpenOffice open offices is basically the

164
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:04,920
same process the only difference is the
files inside of it so it's a the main

165
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:09,750
content files now called / word doc
medoxomil it's called the content topics

166
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:18,190
most interesting thing about LibreOffice
the sport's SPG SPG though by the

167
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:19,900
specification you could put in

168
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:25,569
an XML file it's got a custom XML file
so that could actually be an SVG and

169
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:33,530
actually in the specification they use
necessary GSR example that I've been

170
00:15:33,530 --> 00:15:38,060
kinda plain where r been hoping to find
some place it where this was sort of

171
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:43,469
buried in there but each link Harbor so
you can set a hypertext link to go back

172
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:48,240
to something as soon as the moscow is
over it in all parts of Word says it can

173
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:52,870
be a drawing ml in terms of what's
interesting about this for like sales

174
00:15:52,870 --> 00:15:59,960
office is you can put it you can also
have a program of remotely so if you so

175
00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:04,970
I got happens game who are demonstrating
this morning hope it goes ok but this

176
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:09,500
game or you have a hyperlink over it
when you run your mouse over it it's

177
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:15,170
actually goes and fetches an executable
remotely and I runs locally so so

178
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:28,079
they're going to use ask him to do that
we're on the brink and so you can see

179
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:33,180
that somebody being urged to this is
impacting people he's a great tool so

180
00:16:33,180 --> 00:16:37,359
you can see if edging the exe running it
locally so I'll be another thing where I

181
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:44,370
mean I don't think the attack is gonna
work but you can't set it to attack as

182
00:16:44,370 --> 00:16:54,610
you upload it also goes and fetches a
link for you automatically

183
00:16:54,610 --> 00:17:07,980
XSLT transport so how do you move in the
specification library use it but it's

184
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:11,849
really interesting what it says on the
specification is if you have this value

185
00:17:11,849 --> 00:17:17,669
and your markup and you press Save As to
an XML it will go on a remote xl2 for

186
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,470
you

187
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:24,620
Robert so he would stop this inside of
your word document upload into a web app

188
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:29,629
and then you do a say about us and it
should be what it should do it it would

189
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:33,950
actually go pressure XLT and running for
you which would open up a whole nother

190
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:40,179
attack doctor if the library supports
embedded documents is another one that's

191
00:17:40,179 --> 00:17:44,260
throughout their so you can have a word
document with a spreadsheet inside of it

192
00:17:44,260 --> 00:17:49,470
and so you can actually accurate actor
in there the better example may feel

193
00:17:49,470 --> 00:17:53,250
like open office where you can have an
SVG in there so you could actually have

194
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:59,690
your tax inside your ass bitch you so
there's no stop meth and your attacker

195
00:17:59,690 --> 00:18:06,080
alias so I think there's a lot of SRF
opportunities

196
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:09,199
one thing you can put into a trip for
instance whether you win or documents

197
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:14,220
you can put a remote file in there and
say it and have it set to go up to as

198
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:18,830
it's used so as you open a word document
every time that infection image a

199
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:23,070
similar example arson attack by using
another one would be like an external

200
00:18:23,070 --> 00:18:27,559
connection and Excel spreadsheet so you
mention pivot table that has a database

201
00:18:27,559 --> 00:18:31,520
connection that updated every time these
are all opportunities to require the

202
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:38,080
library to go and do something for you
so testified you choose you in terms of

203
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,730
just the the process of the classic XXII
you know it smells and the most popular

204
00:18:42,730 --> 00:18:47,970
on the sort out there now it's affected
I usually use the hotel usability did

205
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:51,919
first start with you see if it works and
then move on to the market like stacked

206
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:58,400
actors canary testing so this would be
an auntie allowed so for instance as I

207
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:04,190
said a doctype isn't allowed to DTD is
now out so I'll usually use that to seek

208
00:19:04,190 --> 00:19:07,090
a date and get back in area and there
can I get that

209
00:19:07,090 --> 00:19:12,100
external entity and there again across
the script and testing usually in three

210
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:17,080
different categories one is that suited
attackers talking about that using plain

211
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:21,399
no XML parser should allow you to have
the script act but I mean it's it's

212
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:26,230
worth testing and the third would be
attributed so using the example of the

213
00:19:26,230 --> 00:19:30,130
comments they are filled in the comments
that are in the XML that you can add it

214
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:34,900
so I can filled with you can't get it
through the UI but if you go into the

215
00:19:34,900 --> 00:19:40,450
comments that XML file actually playing
around in their obscene comments

216
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:47,690
presented in this is probably gonna be
in the relationships idea anything

217
00:19:47,690 --> 00:19:51,020
that's gonna allow you are right i mean
it could possibly be in what's called an

218
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:54,090
external target which is the example
from SRF

219
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:57,699
just look up external target and
specifications it it's it's remotely

220
00:19:57,700 --> 00:20:05,960
flexible value so you could possibly
also through their XXII attacks and then

221
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:14,780
the same as document conversion to this
was like the XLT transform attack it's

222
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:19,490
so whatever Julie Smith the CFPA just
film string of finding this and brownies

223
00:20:19,490 --> 00:20:24,830
and products and so was kind of thinking
about like why are we seeing this book

224
00:20:24,830 --> 00:20:30,460
or a slack sort of the late in the game
and i i think it's because the libraries

225
00:20:30,460 --> 00:20:34,580
are you going to restore the libraries
of parsing XML on one part of the site

226
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:38,210
may not be the same one supports
uploading files so it might be said

227
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:42,620
about 40 hey we double batch to us but
it turns out the ones that are parsing

228
00:20:42,620 --> 00:20:46,889
the Opera web upload or document are not
the same libraries and even the

229
00:20:46,890 --> 00:20:55,140
dependencies into that so doctor export
J actually has a coat but it shifts with

230
00:20:55,140 --> 00:21:00,330
all mobile version of Apache about it
but she knows SVG files so that's where

231
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:05,580
the embedded documents could come into
play matches exist

232
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:13,840
obviously many are very recent so by the
recent ones I mean the settings office

233
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,490
lots of service area for exploitation
lots of areas to attack

234
00:21:17,490 --> 00:21:21,150
also tons of one touch research target
so I'll try to think about this all of

235
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:25,390
the applications in the enterprise even
know just application for a job that

236
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:30,590
handle it were documented and so was
mine like spam filter like any sort of

237
00:21:30,590 --> 00:21:35,030
DLP solutions I started targeting
collaboration environments because they

238
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:40,440
loved latina people's files so uploading
into those and seeing where it goes and

239
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:46,630
then also say any sort of like its
messaging we're sharing a cloud-based

240
00:21:46,630 --> 00:21:58,700
server will say slides to be up there
any questions from anybody
