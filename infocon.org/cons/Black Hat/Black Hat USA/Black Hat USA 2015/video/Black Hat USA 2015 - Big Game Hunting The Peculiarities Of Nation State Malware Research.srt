thank you so much for being here

2
00:00:05,299 --> 00:00:11,000
couple quick announcements there will be

5
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:34,899
Mandalay Bay gah for the session big
game hunting the peculiarities of

6
00:00:34,899 --> 00:00:41,270
Nations feet malware research with
Morgan marquee bore and Mary on marcia

7
00:00:41,270 --> 00:00:47,129
lack thank you so much and please make
sure to silence your cell phones enjoyed

8
00:00:47,129 --> 00:00:56,260
the talk just bread looks sounds like my
life so welcome to big game hunting

9
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:03,739
peculiarities and nation state malware
research on Morgan Mikey block and I'm

10
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:07,929
currently the director of security at
first look media animal cell researcher

11
00:01:07,930 --> 00:01:13,619
at the University of Toronto hello
everyone my name is very much like a

12
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:21,520
senior researcher at a startup named 542
they are very happy to be part off the

13
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:28,580
probably most of us like a talk in
history we're here today

14
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:36,590
speaker and their skin sticker price at
our third party unfortunately clatter

15
00:01:36,590 --> 00:01:38,000
couldn't make it today

16
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:44,480
you know we are we are all tired er
sorry

17
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:50,560
yeah we've got a lot to get there is
probably get on that talk about your

18
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,880
yard is a nation state malware research
day so we'll we'll kind of talk a bit

19
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,250
about the rise of threat intelligence
how the AV industries of the transition

20
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:03,700
to that and some of the practices will
talk about a novel approach and binary

21
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:08,650
attribution and some of the more
unpleasant side effects being targeted

22
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:16,110
espionage will cover lies the dentist
tell when things actually get bizarrely

23
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,820
personal I'm not your Twitter has been
the best for our industry and then you

24
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:22,750
at the end you know cause you're gonna
be experts on the topic

25
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:27,130
gonna kind of have a choose your own
adventure you know I analyzed along with

26
00:02:27,130 --> 00:02:33,090
us nation state malware session sorry
but I want to land a bit of context to

27
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:39,700
all of this you might remember back in
early 2010 when Google announced that

28
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:45,179
the been hacked by China the heck
occurred in 2009 but a lot of the

29
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:50,959
narrative that sort of happened over the
next six months or so was you know we

30
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,400
learned it wasn't just google it was
hacked by China that Silicon Valley had

31
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,200
been hacked by China and then we kind of
let everybody had been hacked by China

32
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:01,200
and there's a lot of like you know sort
of just beating and finger wagging and

33
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,769
China how could you have a couple of its
Silicon Valley companies are very angry

34
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:08,959
with you and of course we learned that
it wasn't just trying to that was

35
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,060
hacking everybody know some of you guys
might remember an incident at the

36
00:03:14,060 --> 00:03:21,520
beginning of the mid 2010 2011 you know
Stuxnet was discovered the world's first

37
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:28,739
cyber digital cyber cyber weapon and you
know this was allegedly a joint effort

38
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:33,920
by the USA and Israel to sabotage Iran's
nuclear program this actually lead to a

39
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,119
whole family is really malware falling
out just pesky called the Tilted

40
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,820
platform I think we had two crew as well

41
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:49,359
cows attribution is tricky ride but so
they they called the tilde platform

42
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:54,989
because of the tendency of them awaits
you create temp files it started with a

43
00:03:54,989 --> 00:03:57,440
tilde d

44
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:06,180
more recently the malware used by the
allegedly British government toward

45
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:11,490
regional was out of Snowdon documents
revealed that the GCHQ had hacked

46
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:18,030
telecommunications provider Belgium and
also the European Union variety of

47
00:04:18,029 --> 00:04:20,548
people released analysis on this and we
talked a little bit more about it later

48
00:04:20,548 --> 00:04:27,929
turns out with intelligence hasn't been
the only European intelligence service

49
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:38,050
being active on the floor sector just
recently in Germany that the French

50
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:51,380
government was also using to buy most
recently probably remembered that risky

51
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:57,560
appears to be deployed around equation
which is allegedly the in the sort of

52
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:02,700
the take away from this is that you know
everybody's hey everybody all the time

53
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:07,950
or at least all of the big countries
sort of using acting as a tool of

54
00:05:07,950 --> 00:05:14,039
espionage and the smaller countries
which they were and we also learned some

55
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,160
other interesting things

56
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:19,330
WikiLeaks released the spy files and
truth

57
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:24,310
leaving 12 under this was sort of a
series of promotional materials from

58
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:29,419
conferences where sort of surveillance
equipment and capability was salt from

59
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:33,568
these we learned that hacking team and
Fisher and move in with selling exploits

60
00:05:33,569 --> 00:05:37,409
and implants and trojans and that sort
of thing and you know the end of the

61
00:05:37,409 --> 00:05:40,960
next few years we learned that actually
everybody was selling exploits and

62
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:47,270
implants and Trojans someone tried to
sell me some of the door so what what

63
00:05:47,270 --> 00:05:53,359
this is actually meant the sort of the
state of the industry is that anyone who

64
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,780
has wanted the win the whole or in fact
even staying in this hotel and I woke up

65
00:05:58,780 --> 00:06:04,138
in the morning there's a tag on my door
which it will threaten collagens I'm

66
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:07,469
sorry this is actually kind of lead from
sort of AV which was once the red-headed

67
00:06:07,469 --> 00:06:12,090
stepchild of security seemed like it was
actually pretty cool baby has rebranded

68
00:06:12,090 --> 00:06:18,429
itself as three until we call it easy to
point out some of your probably familiar

69
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:22,960
with the web 2.0 statement that if
you're not paying for the software then

70
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:27,909
you other product well I V 2.0 has
managed to do one bit of you the product

71
00:06:27,909 --> 00:06:36,360
and you're still paying for this
software by myself actually I grew up in

72
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:39,979
the air so that's how I saw them over
what should it become the first

73
00:06:39,979 --> 00:06:46,060
intelligence industry how that happened
while the customers the product so we

74
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:50,889
see some very very interesting shift the
most peculiar shift I received in the

75
00:06:50,889 --> 00:06:55,289
past few years with malware detection
has kind of transition to Melbourne

76
00:06:55,289 --> 00:07:00,568
watching so still are secure the process
to stop motion detected in detail but

77
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:04,060
what is also happening is that our
security products and others watching

78
00:07:04,060 --> 00:07:09,219
trying to gather intelligence about what
the Morris doing what comes from

79
00:07:09,219 --> 00:07:16,569
cooperated and who else is effective
tomorrow so like something

80
00:07:16,569 --> 00:07:24,210
like a robbery at a house so what we see
in front until industry is an ongoing

81
00:07:24,210 --> 00:07:31,599
robbery you have a house that is being
breached by thieves stealing stuff going

82
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,248
on again

83
00:07:33,249 --> 00:07:36,429
Realtors will be stopped

84
00:07:36,429 --> 00:07:40,219
colleges in the company's security
companies are watching these thieves

85
00:07:40,219 --> 00:07:41,759
going into company that works

86
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:47,629
watching feeds spreading in the company
and watching movies during data off the

87
00:07:47,629 --> 00:07:51,050
computer and then there are
investigating whether these come from

88
00:07:51,050 --> 00:07:56,479
why the thieves steal exactly what they
still whether these are two other

89
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:01,248
targets while and then there are the
report about why the feeds on Stardust

90
00:08:01,249 --> 00:08:09,209
so if you compare this was something
something we're doing alright so we have

91
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:17,509
to acknowledge watching we have tracking
inventory Institute who are active and

92
00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:23,930
another thing in this industry is that
on some textures and their intentions

93
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,909
are good publicity for the company's

94
00:08:25,909 --> 00:08:34,639
actually this kind of activity so we
have our famous members being numbered

95
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,089
being

96
00:08:36,089 --> 00:08:43,759
remains and it was interesting part of
this is probably the precious treasures

97
00:08:43,759 --> 00:08:51,630
as I call it the highly highly targeted
so we have a process through which are

98
00:08:51,630 --> 00:08:57,120
particularly interesting for publicity
because they actually caused public

99
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,689
interests they are public interest and
they do in fact not target large group

100
00:09:02,689 --> 00:09:09,610
of people so as a security company you
another nation and its customers by

101
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:14,110
publishing these kind of fun but you
create laugh publicity this is why their

102
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:24,870
precious treasures like searching for a
needle we have issues are thousands and

103
00:09:24,870 --> 00:09:30,360
more than thousands and thousands more
samples each day depending on which

104
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:34,480
report you read the numbers rising but
what is happening with all of these

105
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:38,589
samples with the helix is there being
traded their being sent out there being

106
00:09:38,589 --> 00:09:42,760
spread everyone has the same steps of
the should have the same time such a

107
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:48,380
system according to their being tucked
her being categorized when you are

108
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:52,950
searching for these precious treasures
you're not happy with the historic

109
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:55,120
because you can't find your needle in
the haystack

110
00:09:55,120 --> 00:10:02,589
so what we're talking about today is
that we want to find a needle needles in

111
00:10:02,589 --> 00:10:13,060
haystacks different options together
your conscience talking about threat

112
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,660
intelligence and there is no really
feasible

113
00:10:16,660 --> 00:10:22,689
definition for presentations same
happens with these like the vocabularies

114
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:34,440
you see us through our telemetry system
also in the second more telemetry and

115
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:39,360
for the divisions are very good sources
to help us find stuff that we already

116
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,300
know because I was used in the coast
that we have to find other samples today

117
00:10:44,300 --> 00:11:00,819
we had another just recently are leaked
documents and country star on this stage

118
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:07,950
to the documents to and they want us to
link to credibly linked by the reason

119
00:11:07,950 --> 00:11:16,220
there's no way to infect machines are
people who are infected and last but not

120
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:21,620
least my first one and most clear one
because I still can't quite believe how

121
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:25,139
much information on our business

122
00:11:25,139 --> 00:11:35,850
music's changed from one person to
another well we think we live right I

123
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:40,989
call this our endpoint wars' so tell me
they are effectively they are collected

124
00:11:40,989 --> 00:11:48,639
from into effect at any point to get
this data was actually written in the

125
00:11:48,639 --> 00:11:55,579
differences within colleagues and
patients with didn't end until the

126
00:11:55,579 --> 00:12:01,049
reports were we learned that we are
actually working engines as they were

127
00:12:01,049 --> 00:12:05,439
intended to detect threats these
positions are filled with red indicators

128
00:12:05,439 --> 00:12:14,279
are used to detect present too many good
friends and also to change what happens

129
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:19,679
when she is this agent receives data
from the security company and sent back

130
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:24,759
from his actions she has worked the
following ways we have our agent

131
00:12:24,759 --> 00:12:39,199
positions which we have our engagement
suspect you doing there because the

132
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:44,069
threat indicators need quality assurance
indicated percentage points and their

133
00:12:44,069 --> 00:12:52,809
tests of course not initially life and
22 2010 in PA system and also the

134
00:12:52,809 --> 00:12:58,540
turnout overtime to be false positives
or to be high risk indicators need

135
00:12:58,540 --> 00:13:03,589
higher valuation or whatever so this is
very important for actually improving

136
00:13:03,589 --> 00:13:09,220
threatened what happens with this data
there is information being collected

137
00:13:09,220 --> 00:13:13,459
from the machines such as signature its
findings about when the signature hit a

138
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:17,479
certain simple frequencies how often
does it take then of course the sample

139
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:25,480
itself what they do is they test their
signatures on the machines and sent back

140
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:31,230
samples to have the security company
check what the sample actually doesn't

141
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:37,769
have a false positive another thread so
we have to sign exchange of data what is

142
00:13:37,769 --> 00:13:42,410
happening in the end point was that of
course is all avoiding on signature

143
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:57,279
generation testing but we have their
recent years for the short frequency

144
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:03,039
shot by the time they hit on samples and
high-frequency which will tell them

145
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:11,649
either very fast spreading or false
positive but these are just going by

146
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:18,129
there is and effectively lead to a
certain indicators which helps companies

147
00:14:18,129 --> 00:14:28,579
analyze the middle but in the end of
course but we have security products

148
00:14:28,579 --> 00:14:34,388
that are mostly not free as you might
know which are still of course adding to

149
00:14:34,389 --> 00:14:40,809
the security presence but also adding to
the actual value after security vendor

150
00:14:40,809 --> 00:14:50,019
another very interesting watching last
year's are the fungus among us as we

151
00:14:50,019 --> 00:14:55,569
call it a lot of interesting places
exchange from person to person a lot of

152
00:14:55,569 --> 00:15:02,549
interesting information as to what
happens in our industry is that we have

153
00:15:02,549 --> 00:15:07,699
a lot of enemies so you might find
yourself all of a sudden being good

154
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:15,149
friends with the person who had never
expected to talk to you because this is

155
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:22,049
a very social experience that are there
any way you might also find yourself in

156
00:15:22,049 --> 00:15:28,499
a situation where people you trust us or
actually are more interested in

157
00:15:28,499 --> 00:15:36,729
half so we might get into detail here we
have some very interesting split with

158
00:15:36,729 --> 00:15:42,999
our friend right i mean the interesting
thing with a lot of the this of the big

159
00:15:42,999 --> 00:15:47,639
nations they like him hasn't come out is
that you know sort of someone will

160
00:15:47,639 --> 00:15:56,049
release a report like we we just covered
this but it's frequently you know a lot

161
00:15:56,049 --> 00:16:01,709
of a lot of the stuff is known by
multiple actors prior to release so when

162
00:16:01,709 --> 00:16:05,388
I started looking at region a little
while ago I discovered that it was kind

163
00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:08,919
of like the worst kept secret in the
three intelligence industry and then

164
00:16:08,919 --> 00:16:12,319
there was actually a variety of large
companies that had known about this for

165
00:16:12,319 --> 00:16:18,108
use Microsoft definitions going back for
it for real-time Kaspersky semantics of

166
00:16:18,109 --> 00:16:23,159
other AV companies knew about it was
always working on this journey with the

167
00:16:23,159 --> 00:16:26,039
writing very smart people and I was
working on releasing it with with

168
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:33,098
Claudia when it got leaked that we were
going to publish very shortly

169
00:16:33,099 --> 00:16:37,509
at which point I think semantic
published a report on a Sunday night

170
00:16:37,509 --> 00:16:42,189
first time they've done that he followed
up very shortly afterwards and we were

171
00:16:42,189 --> 00:16:45,809
sort of a couple of hours after
Kaspersky now unless you think this is

172
00:16:45,809 --> 00:16:48,809
this is not there's no bitterness here
instead of relating this is an example

173
00:16:48,809 --> 00:16:53,689
of story but I mean this is this is
actually sort of one of the things are

174
00:16:53,689 --> 00:16:56,149
you looking at samples you like she
discovered that a lot of people have

175
00:16:56,149 --> 00:17:03,470
them and then there's this kind of like
just like where do you go at least it's

176
00:17:03,470 --> 00:17:09,419
kind of complicated before we get to the
big game hunting into the bigger mom

177
00:17:09,419 --> 00:17:15,039
very very sad stories about the
beginning actually being hunted down to

178
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:20,888
let me tell you what we have on our
beginning we actually didn't didn't hurt

179
00:17:20,888 --> 00:17:23,040
real

180
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:30,570
so many of the thing is our industry
actually forgets about Cecil we're more

181
00:17:30,570 --> 00:17:35,560
interested in the gunman shot sisal how
sophisticated the bullet that killed

182
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:40,310
cecil was and you know maybe maybe
whether or not we can blame the blood

183
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:46,169
manufacturer for any wrongdoing sorry I
mean these these kind of win

184
00:17:46,170 --> 00:17:51,290
facets of retribution like who did it
who built it who wrote it who operated

185
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:56,100
it how sophisticated is it like a scale
of one to Stuxnet would you give us a

186
00:17:56,100 --> 00:18:02,480
nine it is it's kind of interesting
because i've i've had really bizarre

187
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:08,070
interactions of people maybe companies
at conferences sorry I do a little test

188
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:12,820
he likes to work at Google and Google
has this thing with if they think you

189
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:16,720
been targeted by nations they know where
to put a banner on your Gmail account of

190
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:21,000
people here familiar with that unlike
raise your hands if you people how many

191
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:27,020
people here have actually received this
banner right now you can go ahead with

192
00:18:27,020 --> 00:18:33,700
the thing it doesn't work like that but
also a couple of years ago I attended an

193
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:36,710
Arab Bloggers Conference in the Middle
East where a lot of people have done

194
00:18:36,710 --> 00:18:41,570
independent blogging about the political
situation during the Arab Spring and I

195
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:44,710
was talking to them about security I
asked the same question and it's

196
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:51,380
actually about half of the audience and
sorry I was talking to an antivirus

197
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:54,910
researcher actually seemed to me like
how you win you get some of these

198
00:18:54,910 --> 00:18:59,640
samples that you're very interesting
stuff and I was like oh you know I

199
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:04,250
should like people have targeted like
singing to me he's like what

200
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,830
cheating

201
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:10,980
sheeting how is it cheating by god no no
you're not doing enough kneeled

202
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:16,850
processing of the haystack blogs lot of
something which I think actually sort of

203
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:20,100
reflects the sort of interest of the
industry which is really not people

204
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:25,549
related at all unfortunately in in
certain situations right like to

205
00:19:25,549 --> 00:19:27,990
especially in countries where the rule
of law is not particularly robust

206
00:19:27,990 --> 00:19:30,970
countries in conflict and that sort of
thing

207
00:19:30,970 --> 00:19:39,940
espionage is a tool that is used to
enforce more things rather quickly this

208
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:46,000
guy's name is Tom occur in the syrian
activists was seized by the Syrian

209
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,539
police he was tortured and beaten if he
thought he was going to die and this

210
00:19:50,539 --> 00:19:54,179
line we're stuck with me this is a
computer by the way that contains an

211
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:58,409
image of the compromise hard drive which
contains a rabbit recordings to Skype

212
00:19:58,409 --> 00:20:04,470
conversation so forth he said my
computer was arrested before me this

213
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:09,409
one's name is a las hobby she is
probably unknown to most people in this

214
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:14,370
audience but you're probably familiar
with this she's actually a patient zero

215
00:20:14,370 --> 00:20:17,719
and that she was actually the person who
was like wait to see email looks really

216
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:21,460
suspicious and it ended up on my plate
and that your body of work of the

217
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:25,590
Citizen lab which lead to the first
public attribution finger cymbals her

218
00:20:25,590 --> 00:20:33,029
husband does a four-run seized by the
Iranian security forces no one knew what

219
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:39,389
happened some held for forty eight days
for spreading political misinformation

220
00:20:39,389 --> 00:20:46,969
mainly through comments on Facebook this
guy I'm amounts of United Arab its

221
00:20:46,970 --> 00:20:52,620
pro-democracy activists he was giving
talks about democracy in the Middle East

222
00:20:52,620 --> 00:20:57,590
is an interesting topic and he was being
physically beaten after some of the

223
00:20:57,590 --> 00:21:01,360
talks he was given you really sure how
people knew where he was going to be I

224
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:07,740
did some analysis on his drive and found
out that he had a hacking team plan on

225
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:13,140
it has people here yeah I know right

226
00:21:13,140 --> 00:21:21,080
Giants from hacking thing was I i'm
sorry I saw her for Mac Android has a

227
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:28,610
medical condition but sample actually
talks to this IP address which is

228
00:21:28,610 --> 00:21:35,179
actually a very small range which
briefly to the office of the shake and

229
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:42,130
people say attributions tricky so this
brings us to the case about putting his

230
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:47,040
men which some of you may be familiar
with these intelligent I'm loyal and he

231
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,290
was investigating the bombing of a
Jewish Community Center killed nine

232
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:54,230
people people there was sort of
accusations of political skullduggery

233
00:21:54,230 --> 00:22:00,030
that the Argentine government had coming
up a ron's involvement exchange for oil

234
00:22:00,030 --> 00:22:06,560
and he was going to bring charges
against the President of Argentina as

235
00:22:06,560 --> 00:22:10,870
well as several high-ranking cabinet
ministers unfortunately he was found

236
00:22:10,870 --> 00:22:16,540
dead of gunshot wound to the head under
very suspicious circumstances there were

237
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:20,170
no powder burns on his hand was ruled a
suicide but a lot of people thought that

238
00:22:20,170 --> 00:22:24,510
you know maybe he was murdered because
of the charges and the Salida protests

239
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:28,680
around argentina is a really big deal
and kind of you know it's a conspiracy

240
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:35,390
of JFK proportions and Argentina know if
this pertains to this talk is that

241
00:22:35,390 --> 00:22:40,450
police were doing investigation because
apparently he had a conversation with

242
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:43,460
the head of the Argentine Security
Intelligence Service is the day he died

243
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:46,870
as they were trying to confirm this so
they started doing for instance devices

244
00:22:46,870 --> 00:22:53,939
now this was reported in a very small
argentinian paper this paper then said

245
00:22:53,940 --> 00:23:01,650
that the police had uploaded a bunch of
files from his computers to an online

246
00:23:01,650 --> 00:23:11,220
antivirus tanna telemetry telemetry and
publish the name of the file

247
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:21,120
which is enough sorry this file matches
one sample only a political monasteries

248
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:30,059
is a multi-platform implant brat remote
access tool

249
00:23:30,059 --> 00:23:35,760
this is a screenshot of the control
screen so it started its life is as true

250
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:40,658
service which is a proof of concept
Android malware and then I got rewritten

251
00:23:40,659 --> 00:23:43,490
as head wind which became like a for
sale

252
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:48,470
remote access tool then was rebadged
again as on reach home and continue to

253
00:23:48,470 --> 00:23:53,620
be sold and currently doing the rounds
alien spot I think like just proud

254
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:58,360
strike wrote about being targeted taxes
the samples i cant NGO as you can see it

255
00:23:58,360 --> 00:24:01,139
will check your screen listen to your
phone calls

256
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:04,549
take photos a whole lot of stuff that
you expect from one of these types of

257
00:24:04,549 --> 00:24:12,530
implants now we look at looking at this
malware you know if we're able to

258
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:15,879
discover command control demands and
then click on the map malware samples

259
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:19,270
command control demands a look at
network indicators with his command

260
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:25,730
control domains are situated so on
social the tightening by the same actors

261
00:24:25,730 --> 00:24:30,270
so sorry this group the people who
compromised him we're talking to other

262
00:24:30,270 --> 00:24:35,980
people this was the timing lower on one
of them it's it's like a face that don't

263
00:24:35,980 --> 00:24:40,130
you men from the Embassy of Ecuador the
document is real but it was definitely

264
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:48,880
bearing how it treats and so this this
relates to the sale of Saab aeronautic

265
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:55,429
equipment I think between Brazil and
Argentina if we look at the compilation

266
00:24:55,429 --> 00:25:00,970
time on the mountains mins malware it
looks like they started spying on him

267
00:25:00,970 --> 00:25:07,230
six weeks before he died January 18th
this year and the malware was built on

268
00:25:07,230 --> 00:25:14,130
the 1st of December 2014 nearby
syndicators points axes Argentina and

269
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:18,610
Uruguay we also see the used to hosting
services

270
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:27,260
and the USA Germany and Sweden so you
know could've been anyone up something

271
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:32,600
not take it you think there's a general
public perception perception that she

272
00:25:32,600 --> 00:25:37,270
uses really done based on my enemies
which is not true that uses almost never

273
00:25:37,270 --> 00:25:41,639
done based on binary but business
context however there's interesting

274
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:47,760
cases such as like the bar which is
allegedly French government number that

275
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:57,590
I mentioned before talking about this
document describes the Spanish told us

276
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:02,959
that the Spanish talk to the bar which
was supposedly operated by the French

277
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:09,390
government to spy on individuals in
Canada people polishing the current over

278
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:15,460
people writing this document for the
Canadian intelligence service so far was

279
00:26:15,460 --> 00:26:17,540
one of these cases are frenemies

280
00:26:17,540 --> 00:26:25,580
what happened was that the document was
leaked before most of the researchers in

281
00:26:25,580 --> 00:26:28,049
the security community got their hands
on the sample so as soon as the

282
00:26:28,049 --> 00:26:33,460
documents were published in the very
people they can be seen from our samples

283
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:39,049
maybe I would like to have such a such a
dropper to publish it however we managed

284
00:26:39,049 --> 00:26:46,280
to get their hands on these samples
before most other bar and figure out

285
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:53,190
that the bar actually didn't come alone
bars for also was different contents on

286
00:26:53,190 --> 00:27:02,940
the machine was not the only tool bar
was documented in this paper happens to

287
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:09,540
borrow money but there was another
Trojan actually scripting box by

288
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:15,049
incorporated the script and we should
all those groups and change its behavior

289
00:27:15,049 --> 00:27:20,570
to a certain extent at runtime but but
he was not on the road to a more there

290
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:21,689
was caspar

291
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:28,879
you know so we are only seven families
for me like a look at these parties and

292
00:27:28,879 --> 00:27:37,399
that ok I i see the way that they show
code share share tactics sure what to

293
00:27:37,399 --> 00:27:42,750
explain another person who is not very
difficult to prove so we thought that's

294
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:46,629
what better way to actually linked by
now he's probably with each other to

295
00:27:46,629 --> 00:27:51,799
link bento together eventually get the
chain link families with each other and

296
00:27:51,799 --> 00:27:58,779
linked at least by his house to a
certain extent so get there is by the

297
00:27:58,779 --> 00:28:07,200
restyling tree right because what you
usually see is because things are

298
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:12,820
tradition where you see that our based
their conclusions are based are public

299
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:19,189
conclusions on facts that are hard to
understand and hard to prove the proof

300
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:27,250
from outside so we try to do is give it
all to actually make a strong statement

301
00:28:27,250 --> 00:28:38,519
of other assumptions binary anything
about bias is generally always want to

302
00:28:38,519 --> 00:28:44,139
know them over control them over who
were the victims was operation nearly

303
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:49,370
other people interested in what you
actually does but this is a very hard to

304
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:54,789
to answer from the standpoint of
journalists so you never answered

305
00:28:54,789 --> 00:29:00,379
questions so we actually want is you
want to link binary into a context 1

306
00:29:00,379 --> 00:29:07,559
2013 and these kinds of people what they
want when the context we can't get

307
00:29:07,559 --> 00:29:15,210
contacts from what we can get is it
leaked from the region otherwise so he

308
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:19,289
had a chance that we have a binary which
is the context like it was at the bar we

309
00:29:19,289 --> 00:29:22,940
can you manage to put the other
batteries just think the bar and this

310
00:29:22,940 --> 00:29:30,360
way linked to the alleged operators in
this situation

311
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:40,240
telemetry she comes from interpretation
so text summitry helps authorship

312
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:46,570
attribution and pieces of tax or
increases Coast source so what economic

313
00:29:46,570 --> 00:29:47,899
say what this is

314
00:29:47,900 --> 00:29:52,750
source code can be attributed to its
author based on a considerably large

315
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:58,920
subsamples we can save Greece this code
was written by a certain person does

316
00:29:58,920 --> 00:30:03,660
indeed research linked by me is like
compiled binaries to their authors are

317
00:30:03,660 --> 00:30:08,640
there stairs because of problems with
its attribution

318
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:15,980
what you're interested in poverty not
after that the guy that the person who

319
00:30:15,980 --> 00:30:22,270
wrote the Melbourne but you want the
operator or the owner of this is the

320
00:30:22,270 --> 00:30:26,660
first problem second problem is that the
classical italian mature yet reviews

321
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:35,570
compiled binaries usually the compiler
or the salary cap washer everything that

322
00:30:35,570 --> 00:30:45,129
the person left in a very different
kinds of different cuz we we tried to

323
00:30:45,130 --> 00:30:53,090
dedication re results from his we see
there's like handwriting you can see the

324
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:57,970
spreading of saying all this as the
other one because using the same tactics

325
00:30:57,970 --> 00:31:05,270
and the same style but how do we have
put into that up so I just do is spread

326
00:31:05,270 --> 00:31:13,000
are the main usually for texts of the
machine bolts blank spaces was variable

327
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:19,640
names placement of comments that are off
the street and so we just do with the

328
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:20,360
binaries

329
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:27,820
different domains where you collect
attributes and try to get big problem

330
00:31:27,820 --> 00:31:34,490
with this is that faith or are in the
most of our tries to hide this region of

331
00:31:34,490 --> 00:31:37,700
course but the assumption is

332
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:43,740
that it is never possible to eradicate
all the attributes the one can collect

333
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:49,690
from you can manage to be considered a
big set of attributes we can conclude

334
00:31:49,690 --> 00:31:54,630
that not all of these attributes are
faked at the same time our goal is to

335
00:31:54,630 --> 00:31:58,559
unite human influence as a nation we
don't want the co-author of the binary

336
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:04,460
and we don't want to classify the
compiler you want to classify the user

337
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:14,630
of the Miller right that you just
described now have a right quick look

338
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:23,389
and learn them all of us not forget the
four categories that I mentioned so we

339
00:32:23,389 --> 00:32:29,649
try to spread the attributes to as many
as we can grab to be sure to search for

340
00:32:29,649 --> 00:32:36,939
human author so yes a string constants
implantation and the infrastructure to

341
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:44,440
raise the level on which were so she for
relay the BIOS not find the compiler or

342
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:54,139
human but the proof of concept
collecting all the different attributes

343
00:32:54,139 --> 00:33:03,019
putting all together in spreadsheets
like budget you can see the yellow lines

344
00:33:03,019 --> 00:33:08,029
indicate an overlap was identified in
the different BIOS and you can see the

345
00:33:08,029 --> 00:33:13,269
seller's your show and what bar are
certainly worth it because it was a

346
00:33:13,269 --> 00:33:18,550
beautiful what does that tell us your
farm

347
00:33:18,550 --> 00:33:21,620
give a beautiful case study because
there is really come with a lot of

348
00:33:21,620 --> 00:33:29,330
shower trays this help us make them all
to the bar and conclusively

349
00:33:29,330 --> 00:33:34,720
alleged operator the French government
so we have a link to the bottom over

350
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:38,160
which was going to end but which was
linked to customers who think they know

351
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:42,490
which was again so it's beautiful
picture and now I can actually draw

352
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:48,300
conclusions so we have to borrow it was
buying we have money which will spread

353
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:53,590
through a spear phishing campaign and
the the reno casper spying Syria was

354
00:33:53,590 --> 00:33:57,520
being spread as a reconnaissance and
Syria into those for you and we know

355
00:33:57,520 --> 00:34:03,180
that this number so we can finally
composed at least give away the

356
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:11,830
interests of the operator and also tells
us is that operate the French government

357
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:17,270
has denied that there was running in
2008 which is why the hell with French

358
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:34,520
government need this approach is a bit
of Science and attribution because a lot

359
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:38,310
of a lot of what we have in the industry
is currently what I call soft

360
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:41,719
attribution you know like a temp file to
chill too deep or something like that

361
00:34:41,719 --> 00:34:47,299
and sorry for instance the region is
actually the house we did on that is a

362
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:52,800
really great example and sorry that this
malware was links to an attack on the

363
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,230
European Union

364
00:34:54,230 --> 00:35:00,420
conducted by the British intelligence
now I mean region actually again one of

365
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:06,330
these not well kept secrets in the
industry and actually showed up on a a

366
00:35:06,330 --> 00:35:09,750
private malware mailing list but maybe
ninety nine months before publication

367
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:14,840
and the thread was on difficult to
reverse Chinese malware and you know

368
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:18,060
people putting samples are like oh my
god this is the school was going to take

369
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:22,740
a break and this does this does that
some impressive these samples and you

370
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:27,339
know sort of reading list and they like
the super interesting Chinese AP gmail

371
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,260
chat iPhone

372
00:35:28,260 --> 00:35:38,630
and then sort of you know two hours
later like it looks interesting and

373
00:35:38,630 --> 00:35:43,060
sorry using a technique much the same as
Marian describes you know with the

374
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:48,620
Animal Farm Baba money and dinner so now
we're together with a lot of people I

375
00:35:48,620 --> 00:35:55,190
spent many many many months are putting
together a picture of the sort of highly

376
00:35:55,190 --> 00:36:00,270
sophisticated and full-featured and plug
it in many different components of

377
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:03,640
course you know you find this looks like
it's related in trying to figure out

378
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:08,470
what it does and again you sort of
speech the motivated the actors so you

379
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:15,580
know finally we found a sample which
look like this and so it was filed now

380
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:19,470
known as you can see it actually
contained a region sample but it also

381
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:25,689
contained a bunch of other data which
gives us winery context and so what we

382
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:30,590
have is we have the log of a forensic
still running the system we have problem

383
00:36:30,590 --> 00:36:35,350
on logs which sort of you know that its
process monitor too tall for inspecting

384
00:36:35,350 --> 00:36:41,390
what's going on in a Windows system so
now we have the region sample right if

385
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:46,890
we look at the other files you'll find
out where the miners found so this was

386
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:55,600
found in a demain called company could
build them so we have a username and I D

387
00:36:55,600 --> 00:37:02,720
and for those of you have a long memory
Britain GHG building talk like a

388
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:07,399
traditional this is what I would call
soft attribute right because like wow I

389
00:37:07,400 --> 00:37:13,260
mean really what you have is you have
felt almost hacked by the GCHQ you have

390
00:37:13,260 --> 00:37:16,730
some malware that was used on the bills
economy but maybe

391
00:37:16,730 --> 00:37:23,470
you know i mean by multiple actors like
I mean if you look at them our that sort

392
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:25,980
of thing there's sort of a strong
suggestion but this is what we called

393
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:30,670
some of the soft attribute ride whereas
the the hot attribution came late up

394
00:37:30,670 --> 00:37:37,110
when people shaking the Snowdon
documents found some code which fell out

395
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:41,220
which is called quality now now kriti

396
00:37:41,220 --> 00:37:45,169
Kaspersky said in a blog post looking at
the code closely which includes the

397
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:49,480
concluding always liked in July
functionality to the region by March 25

398
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:54,640
unplug them a friend of mine said it
better I think when he said even blind

399
00:37:54,640 --> 00:37:59,350
Freddy could see that he quit his
original again so yeah this is what we

400
00:37:59,350 --> 00:38:03,110
call a hot attributed that we actually
have leaked documents from the code

401
00:38:03,110 --> 00:38:07,670
authors you know and this is the code
that was linked to code that was found

402
00:38:07,670 --> 00:38:11,160
elsewhere have region which sort of
links back back back you know it's it's

403
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:17,569
exactly what Marion had upgrade pretty
diagram of describing what happened with

404
00:38:17,570 --> 00:38:26,350
no of course the real peculiarities of
doing this type of research is that you

405
00:38:26,350 --> 00:38:30,170
know you released research release
papers and of course people who have

406
00:38:30,170 --> 00:38:37,800
paid to do professionalism is not a like
damn you got me could keep that up you

407
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:41,510
know i mean you guys are probably
familiar with this guy because he he he

408
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:44,420
was put in a really unfortunate
situation which is awesome I was spying

409
00:38:44,420 --> 00:38:47,730
upon millions of tens of millions of
americans and he didn't want to admit it

410
00:38:47,730 --> 00:38:50,910
on national television say sort of
debate and rub it all not wittingly

411
00:38:50,910 --> 00:38:55,879
which he later on when the came out that
he lives in the city tried to answer in

412
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,310
the least untruthful manner possible

413
00:38:58,310 --> 00:39:03,500
know this is actually a bunch of people
that have been implicated the production

414
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:08,490
of patients they malware that have told
sort of wildlife winds of confront said

415
00:39:08,490 --> 00:39:15,959
I mean when Fisher sold Bahrain Egypt
lied about they got hacked the dogs came

416
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:21,670
out they did packing team recently ran
into some trouble as we know them in

417
00:39:21,670 --> 00:39:24,800
their seats and stuff like this in the
past is absolutely no evidence that

418
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,990
links us to these samples and of course

419
00:39:27,990 --> 00:39:33,379
you know well I could be talking about
any one of a number of cases I mean the

420
00:39:33,380 --> 00:39:36,170
life of continued even after they got
hacked is a screenshot of this

421
00:39:36,170 --> 00:39:40,910
assignment is like a lot of lies by
companies don't don't like to target

422
00:39:40,910 --> 00:39:47,299
contains and of course the security lead
toward its John Adams like the tar

423
00:39:47,300 --> 00:39:55,030
contains all of your viruses would you
sell which sort of an interesting simply

424
00:39:55,030 --> 00:40:00,170
because what up since when do people who
sell capability to nation states take to

425
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:02,790
Twitter to argue with security
researchers about whether or not they

426
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:06,650
say the stuff they say is true this game
has gotten really bizarrely personal

427
00:40:06,650 --> 00:40:11,560
like i've i've sort of being harassed
and lambasted on Twitter by various

428
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:17,430
people working for companies selling
surveillance equipment surveillance and

429
00:40:17,430 --> 00:40:22,290
in fact checking team released this
statement publicly about me and they

430
00:40:22,290 --> 00:40:25,320
said that I was a tireless will try on
the issue of privacy is like to finance

431
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:29,100
and then of course link this to the fact
that I clearly love eating criminals

432
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:35,380
terrorists to get insurance just
business they only mention me a hundred

433
00:40:35,380 --> 00:40:39,990
and seventeen times daily email archive
and then of course the photos of me and

434
00:40:39,990 --> 00:40:45,040
audio recordings and that sort of thing
but again I'm sure it's just business I

435
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:50,090
actually think they should I thanks me
because if in the leaked emails you

436
00:40:50,090 --> 00:40:54,619
actually see this email so they did
meeting with a customer called Phoebe

437
00:40:54,619 --> 00:40:59,830
soyuz these cool code names we can
figure out who they are but I mean as

438
00:40:59,830 --> 00:41:03,500
you can see later on down the article
about a link to FB i quietly from secret

439
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:10,800
surveillance and they say if anything
good came out of the Citizen lab

440
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:13,970
articles that have brought them to
contact us to see if it was true it was

441
00:41:13,970 --> 00:41:21,339
widely expected thank you so what did
the FBI read one of my reports and then

442
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:28,130
decide to purchase the software this
game just gets weirder and weirder

443
00:41:28,130 --> 00:41:33,400
not intended result to mention that we
talked about a bunch of peculiarities

444
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:39,140
will discuss the bunch of the major
nation state families hard and soft

445
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:48,549
attribution a novel approach to winery
context and I think now it's time for us

446
00:41:48,550 --> 00:41:53,620
to do choose your own adventure story
because because everyone here is now

447
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:58,880
experts cause that's why you paid a come
to black hat so let's let's do this

448
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:02,330
together we're going to introduce a
malware family we call

449
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:15,380
yes the name of the more I actually to
be honest we came up with yesterday only

450
00:42:15,380 --> 00:42:19,300
because we didn't have a name for 340 we
have multiple names right before we went

451
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:25,730
through the numbering we have a pretty
6986 66 we called at Firefly on based on

452
00:42:25,730 --> 00:42:29,880
the classical approach to give just
arbitrarily decided to stick to the

453
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:39,430
cross training collision caused the cut
is 35 samples without up with

454
00:42:39,430 --> 00:42:46,460
compilation times ranging from 2002 to
2011 which is a kind of old has been

455
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:51,950
around for a long time so I mean person
stands out is actually the longevity of

456
00:42:51,950 --> 00:42:56,120
them out so this is about one person or
a group of people writing now wait to

457
00:42:56,120 --> 00:43:00,500
get out over nine years is a long time
if you think about the malware families

458
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:05,310
that lost that long rethinking Stuxnet
equation region you know some of the

459
00:43:05,310 --> 00:43:14,490
demo well-funded operations the
component to this too is

460
00:43:14,490 --> 00:43:20,209
small and pretty plan by the string
office location with excellent social

461
00:43:20,210 --> 00:43:28,350
support security products on the system
as a defense mechanism including see so

462
00:43:28,350 --> 00:43:37,660
you could point me to a direction is
control component

463
00:43:37,660 --> 00:43:44,359
device driver to defend myself with
Sultan get their hands on the driver if

464
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:50,580
you could help us out there with the
very happy as well orchestrated

465
00:43:50,580 --> 00:43:57,380
component which job and other executable
exe which was used to launch and monitor

466
00:43:57,380 --> 00:44:02,250
other processes this is your partner so
the process doesn't pop up on the screen

467
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:15,300
and still be controlled by the launching
of what is actually about the sample is

468
00:44:15,300 --> 00:44:21,230
actually prepared to run on old when the
sources all around windows ninety five

469
00:44:21,230 --> 00:44:28,470
to 10 me this based on you but also
because there is a check and function in

470
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:35,220
there for checking bpm after searching
for any value to look for any value that

471
00:44:35,220 --> 00:44:45,368
means new executable when this year
before that PE your schedule was his

472
00:44:45,369 --> 00:44:52,010
interview with Microsoft Office for
Budget 2011 the sixteen-bit platforms so

473
00:44:52,010 --> 00:44:55,300
at this time we got really interested

474
00:44:55,300 --> 00:45:00,900
right sorry this takes us on a script
samples written possibly more in the

475
00:45:00,900 --> 00:45:09,370
modern era between 2007 2009 however the
implementation strategies a string

476
00:45:09,370 --> 00:45:13,540
disciple indicate that this malware
targeting Windows in Tizi platform I

477
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:16,710
mean when doesn't he seems like a really
low platform to be targeting and like

478
00:45:16,710 --> 00:45:21,860
2009 however as you might remember
governments change technology platforms

479
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:23,410
very very slowly

480
00:45:23,410 --> 00:45:26,490
government complaining about microsoft
deprecated by the ante for and Windows

481
00:45:26,490 --> 00:45:30,939
XP yes we are prepared to do

482
00:45:30,940 --> 00:45:36,000
archaeology there but what was
interesting about the sample is its

483
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:40,420
persistence me thought it doesn't do the
the son of tricks but uses show

484
00:45:40,420 --> 00:45:45,580
extension officer chose tension for you
I can handler and when the shell which

485
00:45:45,580 --> 00:45:50,759
modern operating systems will be whens
Explorer so everything Explorer icon for

486
00:45:50,760 --> 00:46:02,080
a specific part of this is that the
Miller checks and started running in the

487
00:46:02,080 --> 00:46:08,910
context of the prop men window so the
window of the process right now if you

488
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:13,379
look at this probably isn't going to win
the Pac Man

489
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:19,590
program manager which is the shell
before the Windows Explorer being

490
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:27,590
introduced to 3.1 being deprecated with
Windows Vista looking at running more

491
00:46:27,590 --> 00:46:40,190
holder for the reminder to Missouri
sessions also even so the Hawks 2-13

492
00:46:40,190 --> 00:46:46,010
system activity and Curtis type into the
machine and also some of the customs lol

493
00:46:46,010 --> 00:46:55,130
which again we didn't get our house on
so if you have any hint and six months

494
00:46:55,130 --> 00:46:57,870
time

495
00:46:57,870 --> 00:47:14,609
but like archaeologists didn't listen
our an awesome or a grave robbing

496
00:47:14,609 --> 00:47:29,430
by the restored from security products
and just not execute certain

497
00:47:29,430 --> 00:47:38,029
functionality when certain security
person present as to the east of the

498
00:47:38,029 --> 00:47:44,529
network communication so the samples
were very very careful not to take off

499
00:47:44,529 --> 00:47:49,999
any security product on the machines
just by being raised and communication

500
00:47:49,999 --> 00:48:08,450
just different methods to make a network
including dial-up connections which

501
00:48:08,450 --> 00:48:25,269
occasion to the muscles done by jacket
coat to the standard brother to an

502
00:48:25,269 --> 00:48:30,839
instance of which used to bypass
firewalls and local security settings

503
00:48:30,839 --> 00:48:40,920
for them or have your samples from
Safeway which show a possibility but

504
00:48:40,920 --> 00:48:45,720
have a special for you to grab security
settings from Kaspersky Security product

505
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:50,180
but this is interesting because usually
obviously in boulder is that it tries to

506
00:48:50,180 --> 00:48:55,480
find savings just find and evade
security presence of multiple vendors

507
00:48:55,480 --> 00:48:59,190
but this one was just out for Kaspersky
products so this leads us to believe

508
00:48:59,190 --> 00:49:02,640
that the attackers riding mower

509
00:49:02,640 --> 00:49:09,140
new operating system in your network
settings did you process on the system's

510
00:49:09,140 --> 00:49:13,549
so we have a very very targeted attack
and

511
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:21,960
interesting fact that we didn't tell you
yet was naming convention off fast that

512
00:49:21,960 --> 00:49:29,900
would be really but this kind of mower
so all of our market or samples which

513
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:43,740
are starting with killed so the campus
of nato and around the value for you may

514
00:49:43,740 --> 00:49:47,569
remember marian's binary star long as
she approached him before if we apply

515
00:49:47,570 --> 00:49:51,230
that to the smell whether we can
discover the actress margot 45 seconds

516
00:49:51,230 --> 00:49:56,120
left that approach is actually really
laborious so what we gonna do is we're

517
00:49:56,120 --> 00:50:00,120
going to use the attribution Magic eight
Ball to figure out who this was the

518
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:03,549
audience would like to roll with me
shake the Magic eight Ball and we will

519
00:50:03,550 --> 00:50:08,120
discover that the person behind this
long and targeted mailing campaign was

520
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:10,770
fantastic

521
00:50:10,770 --> 00:50:16,720
alright thanks a lot guys we have more
than marianne and cloudy are in absentia
