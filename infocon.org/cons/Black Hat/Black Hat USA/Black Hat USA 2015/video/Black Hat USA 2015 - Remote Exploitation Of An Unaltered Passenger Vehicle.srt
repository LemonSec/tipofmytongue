1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,090
ariane yeah we're on the computer I got
I know how to use this part I don't know

2
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,690
if we need introductions anymore

3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,719
policy director of vehicles care
research and I active Charlie Miller

4
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:21,570
security engineer tweener together we
are wild stallions alright people about

5
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,710
it that's why we don't practice
otherwise out a cut that jus got that

6
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,029
disclaimer I think we got second place
last year it was like I was joking

7
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:34,219
around which is gonna be again if you
don't like it that way we have ninety

8
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:38,980
page paper due to its gonna be long and
has all the details as a lot information

9
00:00:38,980 --> 00:00:42,790
this is a year's worth of work probably
more we can pack it all ended talks so

10
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:50,250
you know get the paper released on
Monday has everything we did and more it

11
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:57,180
won't be as entertaining but not before
we start please please just stop saying

12
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:01,370
whatever you have with everything you
make is on a couple kids you're gonna

13
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:05,429
look silly so here is our guys carrying
the bag but this is from some newspaper

14
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,340
a Daimler engineering executives as
there is no way back mercedes-benz from

15
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:15,960
outside the car and then he goes on to
say you can't really control gateway and

16
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,539
you have to go through that and then I
go way a gateway of any sort of that

17
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:24,240
have been compromised right I think so
you mean we have to hack the gateway to

18
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:24,990
do that

19
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:31,899
overview talked about how he got remote
code running on the head unit from wifi

20
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:33,159
seller

21
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:36,439
payloads and then we're going to talk
about the part that talking took us

22
00:01:36,439 --> 00:01:42,479
forever which was the 850 stop reversing
then some cyber physical stuff

23
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:46,070
and even more fun about this closure
blah blah blah yeah and then even though

24
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:53,750
we told prices drop any new driver
dropped a good job in law just kidding

25
00:01:53,750 --> 00:02:02,370
but somewhere that I saw a Chrysler
executives just pooped his pants remote

26
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:05,830
attack surface so you know a lot of
people think about remote attacks just

27
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:11,920
as this right there's telematics WiFi
Bluetooth tire pressure monitors all

28
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:19,109
kinds of stuff we focused on the wifi
and the telematics systems because we

29
00:02:19,110 --> 00:02:21,950
felt that would give us the best shot
for a web

30
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:26,560
lots of different ways that cars take
input from outside world these are some

31
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,610
of them as time goes on the more of
those absolutely I think our apps are

32
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:33,630
going to start pushing an hour to see
all that stuff that people familiar with

33
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:38,950
so that's the first the first bit of
remote access you gotta get data to the

34
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:42,670
cars and as we found out the chips that
do that

35
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:46,890
wireless data peace don't usually at
least in our case did not do

36
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:51,089
communications with in-vehicle network
so can buy stuff or linear flex or any

37
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:55,480
of that so you have to figure out a way
to get from that remote piece to the

38
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:59,130
peace that communicates with the car
right to separate pieces that sometimes

39
00:02:59,130 --> 00:03:03,440
a heart problem right so someone tells
you they can remotely hack your car and

40
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:06,180
then they they say something like oh and
then you could just do break something

41
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,790
they might not realize that the second
set was like really hard and I we first

42
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:13,390
saw this I think we were under that
assumption as well but now we're smarter

43
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:20,029
can message analysis if you want to send
messages that do things you need to

44
00:03:20,030 --> 00:03:22,610
understand their ideas and their data
right

45
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:27,180
the best way we found to do this as good
a car and record them with sniffer see

46
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:30,880
what they do change them all that good
stuff you need to do this part if you

47
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,420
want physical control you don't have to
have you know physically physically

48
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:37,910
jacked into the car to do it when you're
doing it remotely but you need to begin

49
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:38,340
with

50
00:03:38,340 --> 00:03:41,100
writes this is the one part where you
need a car at least for a little while

51
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:45,359
so maybe it's a rental or at some point
you need to figure out how the messages

52
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:49,580
work it's going to be specific for a
particular manufacturer model year we

53
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:49,940
don't

54
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:54,160
exactly what the details are but you're
going to get a little bit and we

55
00:03:54,160 --> 00:03:59,359
released 04 Ford Toyota and now Jeep so
there's some information out there

56
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,940
lastly can message injection right you
have to find a way from a remote source

57
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:07,880
to make that promotes or send it to the
internal source that sends out a message

58
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:11,900
that does cool stuff this is what you
want to do right you wanna control car

59
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:18,329
turning up the radios by but you know
ready to ditch even finer speaking of

60
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:23,960
its so as this bitch's fine I noticed
when I put the slide deck the brakes

61
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:26,880
aren't working in this picture that's
why he's going to ditch the brake lights

62
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,360
are on

63
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,700
so you can tell like something is so
there's probably a physical switch the

64
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:36,520
lights and the rest is that anyway so
little by the vehicle you want it you

65
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,039
don't know yet 2014 Jeep Cherokee I
think that's been out there nice car

66
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,930
it's a great car like it I highly
recommend it

67
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:44,500
yeah I would drive it

68
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:52,540
MCI chrysler as a you connect unit that
was the infotainment system the thing

69
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:56,890
that did communication to the outside
world made by Harman they do all kinds

70
00:04:56,890 --> 00:05:01,450
of audio video stuff but there's heavily
used in automobiles as the headline is

71
00:05:01,450 --> 00:05:04,380
basically the same in the middle that
looks kinda like a computer screen at

72
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:07,850
the touch screen and then maybe some of
the stuff kind of around it exactly

73
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:11,890
that's what most people think of as a
car computer right and if you take these

74
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:16,659
guys apart you can see there's a screen
that he touch used a Sierra Wireless

75
00:05:16,660 --> 00:05:22,830
chipset to do sell air and and wireless
communications and then the other

76
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:29,210
daughter board piece was gonna sell us
be 850 so they've literally there was an

77
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:32,820
air gap because it's too daughter boards
but in reality we're gonna show you how

78
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:38,540
it wasn't truly an air gap and the stuff
and Unix right so the main chip on their

79
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:42,460
necks and it was a processor

80
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:47,008
and you know it's kind of Linux like and
so you can get a shower at some point

81
00:05:47,009 --> 00:05:51,120
and commands and so is it was nice for
us because it made us miss me like sort

82
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,479
of familiar with the half the command
you expect to work don't work there is a

83
00:05:55,479 --> 00:05:58,960
real quick

84
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:04,090
jailbreak Charlie gave you a teaser last
year the jailbreak during our talk right

85
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:08,318
it was a great way for us to learn about
this system dumped by their is off to

86
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,669
reversing traffic basically everything
you want to do when you try to hack the

87
00:06:11,669 --> 00:06:17,299
system invaluable this absolutely
positively is not required for what

88
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:22,729
we're talking about today just to make
that very very clear but I did a video I

89
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:27,949
know maps so here is how effective
jailbreaking so now it's as if you can

90
00:06:27,949 --> 00:06:34,659
see in this case is jailbroken normally
doesn't say that a yes again like if I

91
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:38,289
want to attack some car in California I
don't have to get there with USB and

92
00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:43,159
jailbreak but for us to get by network
files are in play around it was useful

93
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:49,620
yet so we talked about all those
different remote attack sources and the

94
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,560
first one that we went to look at

95
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:55,889
was wifi because that was something we
kind of understood where I could use we

96
00:06:55,889 --> 00:06:58,930
don't know too much about in like tire
pressure monitoring systems like I know

97
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:02,039
nothing about so we want to start with
something that was kinda familiar and we

98
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:07,169
started with wifi so this is the screen
you get for WiFi and Noah said by

99
00:07:07,169 --> 00:07:12,030
default you get wpa2 as your recession
mention that the Jeep and some other

100
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:17,049
cars they offer up a wifi hotspot so you
can get the back seat and get on the

101
00:07:17,050 --> 00:07:24,330
internet the kids can be on the Nintendo
DSi I really liked it but so so in order

102
00:07:24,330 --> 00:07:28,979
to do that you need to have this
password to get onto BB 2 so if you want

103
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:33,440
to attack a car over this like wi-fi
hotspot that it generates there's a

104
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,539
couple problems with it

105
00:07:34,539 --> 00:07:38,969
one is at its not all my fault you have
to pay for it as quite expensive so like

106
00:07:38,969 --> 00:07:44,070
35 bucks a month I bought this for like
a year so you know you're welcome to

107
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:48,849
welcome everyone to challenge paid 300
bucks you can actor ever get that money

108
00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:50,130
you're welcome

109
00:07:50,130 --> 00:07:51,920
anyway the point is not many people are
gonna be

110
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:56,330
us and even if they did if you did buy a
car was on you have to figure out how to

111
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:01,750
connect to the wpa2 network which is a
natural so we'll still talk about that a

112
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:05,680
little bit just to show how work because
for a while this is the only way we knew

113
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,050
you know how to take the car so the
first thing that you'll see as this is

114
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:17,270
the reverse engineering of the way the
password generator for the BPA to system

115
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:23,820
and you'll see that they they call time
and then they figure out Random Password

116
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:29,200
link between 8 12 and then random
characters like Dora case I forget

117
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,830
Saskia numbers there's like 60 of them
or something

118
00:08:31,830 --> 00:08:36,280
62 so the point is you get this really
long password and that's random and you

119
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:39,240
can't just guess it very easily it's
going to be really hard to guess even if

120
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:42,919
you're cracking it you know they're not
gonna be like doing it right but the

121
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,040
Bank today based it on time

122
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,689
means that there's really only one
password for every second

123
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:52,320
the car with you know that second and
the time when they could return the car

124
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,860
so if you've got time the very first
time you turn the car on then you can

125
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:01,000
have a pretty good guess what the
password is and so is this a numbers I

126
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,970
do have a PhD in math

127
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:08,550
yes I can use a calculator as well as
the next person maybe do the math you'll

128
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:11,540
find out that if you know what year it
is but you probably have a pretty good

129
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:17,410
idea because it's you know a car they
did on the cards right you can guess to

130
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:23,000
it like building 15 million password
tries before you would guess that if you

131
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,840
want to just care about a month so it's
like 50 million per month and then you

132
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:31,660
can make make some assumptions but the
point is you could imagine doing attack

133
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:37,420
in like an hour which is kind of a drag
rights you have to find a car on the

134
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:42,709
highway driving next year for an hour
that's just creepy but Charlie I asked

135
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:46,820
you what happened how does it get the
time are you sure we have practice I

136
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:50,690
know it's great amazing I get so yet so
then you're like ok fine well how does

137
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:54,500
it know what time it was because the
very first time you turn the car on like

138
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:55,550
it doesn't necessarily

139
00:09:55,550 --> 00:10:01,649
know what time it is right and so this
is some of the code that that sets the

140
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:06,980
clock initially and you can see it tries
to get me a fifty real-time clock survey

141
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:10,800
fifty is like the other chip that will
talk about later the one that has direct

142
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:15,050
communications with the site at work and
so it's trying to get the time through a

143
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:20,769
cellular phone gets time but it falls
down here and it's as I get it fails to

144
00:10:20,769 --> 00:10:26,519
get that time it defaults to the first
day the first month of 2013 January 1st

145
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:32,130
2013 that's a faulty right so I was like
ok whatever but I looked at my password

146
00:10:32,130 --> 00:10:35,430
in it was just like a long complicated
thing and so there's mapping between

147
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:39,709
what second clock was turned on and your
password right where you can go

148
00:10:39,709 --> 00:10:44,910
backwards with that mapping to as I
wonder what time I turn my car so I

149
00:10:44,910 --> 00:10:51,140
looked as i turn my car on January 1st
2013 32 seconds and so what that means

150
00:10:51,140 --> 00:10:56,019
is Roger my car on it didn't know what
time it was it's a 32 seconds for the

151
00:10:56,019 --> 00:10:59,940
like wifi thing that kinda like get
going and that it created the password

152
00:10:59,940 --> 00:11:04,459
from that as a yes you can imagine cars
coming out of plant right being turned

153
00:11:04,459 --> 00:11:09,109
on and they're all have a a very small
subset of passwords right so you would

154
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:12,750
expect maybe they're only be like 10 or
20 different passwords and and and

155
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:15,640
really so you don't have to creep on
someone for an hour you'll have to creep

156
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:16,790
on him for a couple seconds

157
00:11:16,790 --> 00:11:21,520
yeah I like how you're so worried about
creeping on someone by driving people

158
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:22,160
all the time

159
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:26,689
crash in them but you know what I don't
know what to get creeped out but I don't

160
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:32,040
mind driving so so so it's actually not
that difficult to figure out what the

161
00:11:32,040 --> 00:11:37,730
password is undefeated wpa2 network in
this case and so you could connect to a

162
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:41,250
WiFi network but the biggest problem is
you still have this issue where they

163
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:47,110
probably don't have wifi in the first
place so so let's just forget about that

164
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:51,970
issue for a moment and and power on
which is what you do any research so you

165
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:53,630
can run and maps can

166
00:11:53,630 --> 00:12:00,360
of the wifi hotspot and you'll see
there's much open ports the one that we

167
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:07,650
care most about as port 6667 which map
says IRC we were pretty stuff like sweet

168
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:13,270
things when I receive this is also
joined town hack I was like I knew this

169
00:12:13,270 --> 00:12:17,920
guy was cool but now add I just really
love it so it turns out tonight IRC it's

170
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:25,530
something called the bus so if you know
nobody buses inter-process communication

171
00:12:25,530 --> 00:12:30,709
mechanism so like different processes
can I talk to each other like it's like

172
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:35,660
our PCs and so it's way different
processes on a machine can talk to each

173
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:40,329
other you can set it up which right away
you start to think like well probably

174
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:44,460
maybe I shouldn't be able to pretend I'm
a process on a machine and talk to other

175
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:49,100
people would think so that's how I would
sign it right but the desire to bust out

176
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,450
of that and they have on that occasion
built into it is where you need to have

177
00:12:52,450 --> 00:12:57,010
some sort of passwords years I don't
know because I G Ben have one so you can

178
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:01,450
see over here on the right part of the
devious profiles you can try too often

179
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:06,580
you get off I don't want to be i'm just
some anonymous do the Jeep says okay you

180
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:10,810
have a session so basically this is our
PC with no authentication right as you

181
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:15,930
can remotely connect and then we'll show
you can do stuff right so probably not

182
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:18,780
intended by the manufacturer I wouldn't
think so

183
00:13:18,780 --> 00:13:21,770
so we use the program called defeat
which will show you in a second but it

184
00:13:21,770 --> 00:13:27,030
looks like it's like and then we when we
wrote our scripts and not to give that

185
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:32,230
to give away the ending that he's our
exploits as well we use something called

186
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:37,390
the bus ISL does D-day you can fired up
it looks like this you can see all these

187
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:42,340
like Carmen services that you can talk
to each of these services has different

188
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:48,670
methods that you can call here's an
example of using negative again to find

189
00:13:48,670 --> 00:13:52,339
out different for particular services
what methods are available and you can

190
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:54,590
just read I hear and see some of the
more interesting ones that are like

191
00:13:54,590 --> 00:14:01,620
there's a service call harmon service
lair manager and has methods like UD TV

192
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:06,080
HMI 12 and all this kind of crazy stuff
right but imagine how many things are

193
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:09,980
implemented this right it easy to use to
make calls it works everything strings

194
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:12,980
awesome right so I'm sure there's just
methods beyond that the department heads

195
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:17,050
right so so already right now as you can
probably imagine doing things to the

196
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:21,520
Jeep that were bad but of course we want
to shell right I should mention that the

197
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:28,060
bus service runs as root so if you can
get a shell one small detail what you

198
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:34,050
can expect an example to use a deep but
anyway so the person we were like ok

199
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:37,650
let's start looking through these
methods and see if there's anyone has

200
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:42,220
some sort of vulnerability that would
allow us to get you know commander and

201
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:47,010
the first thing I thought of command
injection right because they not to mess

202
00:14:47,010 --> 00:14:52,260
with Shell code and you know she'll code
is a shopping is was out all day like I

203
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:56,670
spent enough time in my life I don't do
that anymore so I looked around and

204
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:00,910
found this napped rail service which
will like a really great service I don't

205
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:06,310
know what it really does but it has a
trail bro yeah it gives you shells I

206
00:15:06,310 --> 00:15:14,109
know for sure it should be called
shelter right so here is like this

207
00:15:14,110 --> 00:15:17,800
particular services back by Lua scripts
you can just read the lure and see if

208
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:20,939
there's problems and you can see here
you're allowed to pass in through this

209
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:25,540
method programs which is like in this
case of file name and then it just sells

210
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:30,349
out of the system and runs remove your
filing so if you give a filename like

211
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:36,120
you know blossoming calling off it'll
just run that stuff or just give it a

212
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:45,740
slash and that it removes I don't do
that I dot / manager is broken so anyway

213
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:49,830
this is bad this is from this alone if
you're connected to wifi you get you can

214
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:55,000
get stuff running and I was like all
proud of myself I was like you know I've

215
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:58,710
been there I've been hacking for 15
years or whatever

216
00:15:58,710 --> 00:16:02,400
and you know this is really awesome and
I found a bug i knew it would be there

217
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:06,360
and then it is stated we felt there was
like one start looking at code is just

218
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:12,760
everywhere just quit there was so many
of its just but then my leg elation what

219
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:17,510
a super hacker I was kinda came down
when I looked further down the those

220
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:21,550
methods for natural services eg a shell
service that's all there is one of them

221
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:27,870
called execute and so you can probably
guess where this shell does it doesn't

222
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:35,210
kill you now know what it does is if you
give it a command it executed so if you

223
00:16:35,210 --> 00:16:39,210
want to own one point four million
vehicles there's four lines of Python we

224
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:44,750
wanted to be sexier that's it so yeah so
you can see this is four lines up I like

225
00:16:44,750 --> 00:16:48,660
he says and in the end though to execute
method then and then that you specify

226
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:52,079
the commanders in this case it's like a
cannon shells and stuff and then I say

227
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:55,290
they have like netcat all those good
utilities already on there for you so

228
00:16:55,290 --> 00:16:57,910
you don't even have to do it there are
air

229
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:02,730
invoke them so remote Rochelle four
lines of Python challenge if so that's

230
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:10,940
it that's the Taco Bell CA get out so
one funny thing is that at DEFCON and

231
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:14,120
like a last year we're talking about the
attacks are so the Jeep and we actually

232
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:20,239
showed one point chris is eloquently in
this picture is showing that you know

233
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:24,500
and a map of the Jeep and you can see
port 6667 is open and of course we

234
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:27,660
laughed about how was our see it so
basically that was what I will talk this

235
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:34,450
year's about was on that flight lesser
we're done like that you can xoxo now

236
00:17:34,450 --> 00:17:37,740
now we can execute we're on the
infotainment system right on the head

237
00:17:37,740 --> 00:17:43,920
unit that means we can execute a bunch
of cool Lewis groups that do stuff we

238
00:17:43,920 --> 00:17:47,070
rewrote GPS tracker 3000 which

239
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:51,300
3001 is down really silly but we'll
worry about that then it'll just be

240
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:56,620
retro yeah that it will be like in 10
games but basically what it is we got

241
00:17:56,620 --> 00:18:00,629
the Jeep to send its GPS coords to web
server and we would pull that web server

242
00:18:00,630 --> 00:18:05,320
every so often and then put a pin drop
on a Google Map so I can we get this

243
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,010
running

244
00:18:06,010 --> 00:18:08,550
and I could watch Charlie go to the
grocery store and i can tell you hey

245
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:11,760
speeding up because the Pens are getting
for their part of a slowing down the

246
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,490
pizza getting closer together so we have
nice google map tracking for all your

247
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:19,780
essay needs you can track him wherever
he goes it is pretty sweet ending and

248
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:22,860
like we did this it so you don't
actually even need to run code to do

249
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:28,159
this is just one of the methods that the
bus service exports exactly you don't

250
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,260
even need to exploit it just ask it
right

251
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:36,440
what your GPS a-gps like that yeah you
know as you see a policy in the white

252
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:37,000
videos

253
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:42,910
HVAC we could turn AC heating on you
give it a you get a number

254
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:47,640
blows blows cold air and Eddie
greenberg's face I think that's why this

255
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:53,410
method was design it's funny because all
these things you can put in this cold up

256
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:56,740
here so you can see how simple does
everything I turn on the ignition let's

257
00:18:56,740 --> 00:19:00,110
play super hard and I was like memory
corruption and we're doing here besides

258
00:19:00,110 --> 00:19:04,949
it like nowhere to run a script we wish
it was sexier but I liked it being easy

259
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:10,550
yeah way better than a radio volume you
can just give it a number I think nine

260
00:19:10,550 --> 00:19:18,070
the latter 32 the loudest or something
that is not reasonable so here is some

261
00:19:18,070 --> 00:19:24,360
of the command get out of here I can't
do it like hard to do that using a

262
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:29,850
computer that here's here's a Charlie
card so this is basically all those

263
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:35,610
things a lot of things we can do over
the just under you can have this is like

264
00:19:35,610 --> 00:19:43,780
a magician showing that we're not a
Charlie get this Carson style she had a

265
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:49,649
form that you could have some Bros

266
00:19:49,650 --> 00:20:10,510
so it's it's so loud and this is what we
did on the highway so he turned off the

267
00:20:10,510 --> 00:20:15,980
car better and then going back to normal
how likely do you think that would fix

268
00:20:15,980 --> 00:20:24,090
it but it does this bill blass figured
if you can control the radio HIV care

269
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:27,770
you know that air conditioning in your
GPS you can we didn't become a teacher

270
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:31,120
on the microphones anything that has to
adjust the radio you can do at this

271
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:38,080
point so that was again I was like super
fun and like you know I like it was once

272
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:44,129
the next person but still like this
whole well the guy has to the individual

273
00:20:44,130 --> 00:20:48,660
has to buy WiFi only it's like me would
pay 30 bucks and we learned the first

274
00:20:48,660 --> 00:20:52,060
time around we plugged in and send
messages and control cars we thought was

275
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:56,149
so cool that everyone should all over us
all together put it like nope there's no

276
00:20:56,150 --> 00:20:58,950
holding back this time every time we
thought they'd jump who had to make it

277
00:20:58,950 --> 00:20:59,320
better

278
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:03,510
right that would have been the headline
story have to buy wife I don't buy a

279
00:21:03,510 --> 00:21:09,890
setback to wifi industry like 10 years
so so reliability wholesalers are

280
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:17,030
closing all across America and Asia so

281
00:21:17,030 --> 00:21:29,379
the route but we can do this over
cellular network because not only do our

282
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:36,260
way but like everyone's will be will be
vulnerable and said just so the first

283
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:39,940
thing like we did was we design that's
that the sea and you can see all the

284
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:45,710
parts except the one guy is not just
bound to like the wifi interface for

285
00:21:45,710 --> 00:21:49,480
example is bound to all interfaces as
well as well it seems like maybe you can

286
00:21:49,480 --> 00:21:53,570
get to it over the social network of
course we had no idea how to do that I

287
00:21:53,570 --> 00:21:57,050
don't know how cell phones working
honestly I don't like i know i phones

288
00:21:57,050 --> 00:22:01,879
where I don't know how they like talk to
us so we need to find out what day

289
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:06,410
Peterson the GPS that we could try to
try to talk to every so often think of

290
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:09,920
course there's sort of interesting
things was like all these IP addresses

291
00:22:09,920 --> 00:22:15,210
we had no matter which but the UAP 0 is
the one for the wifi interface and then

292
00:22:15,210 --> 00:22:20,310
you get this PP's 2011 the left is what
your IP addresses like locally on the

293
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:24,179
Sprint network and then the other one
6828 whatever is what it looks like if

294
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:27,060
you connect out to a service like
outside the spring lunberg on the

295
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:31,179
Internet in general so if you saw in
your view no logs that the IP address it

296
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,080
would be there right

297
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,699
so the first thing you want your
adventure trying to sell like I had no

298
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,800
problem I know when they saw the files
is like you buy something it's easy but

299
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:43,560
I like three femtocells and I would try
to get them working and I have to call

300
00:22:43,560 --> 00:22:48,889
sprint and I got a phone with a contract
that I no longer need and every time I

301
00:22:48,890 --> 00:22:52,410
get a new femtocell for me baby brand
new and I would call it like I yeah

302
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:56,950
that's still one house it's credits
though it so I bought like three or four

303
00:22:56,950 --> 00:23:01,030
if into the cells are all stolen but we
eventually got one working so it was

304
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:06,399
nice how he still at them to defend tell
so after this I'm out back

305
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:13,750
Fox so anyway that we we heard that the
femtocell and I got on

306
00:23:13,750 --> 00:23:17,740
a cell phone at Sprint cell phone
connected to them to sell the Jeep

307
00:23:17,740 --> 00:23:21,350
application is this the spread from the
south and then I was able to talk to

308
00:23:21,350 --> 00:23:26,320
port 667 from my phone to the Jeep so
then we we were no longer have to worry

309
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:30,950
about whether wi-fi was on like even the
wifi has never been turned on its entire

310
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:35,480
life connections on and I can talk to it
yeah we were so we are static right

311
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,760
because it's like hey we're we're doing
all this over seller we didn't need to

312
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:42,070
change anything right at four line
Python actually only thing that needed

313
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,659
changes was the IP address

314
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:47,570
yeah that's a couple days that was took
it as some research I'm right there but

315
00:23:47,570 --> 00:23:52,899
yes and that we have extended from you
know only people who have wifi to anyone

316
00:23:52,900 --> 00:23:56,030
but we still had to be within the femto
cells were injured ever remember this

317
00:23:56,030 --> 00:23:59,960
the the seller service is on you don't
have to buy it right if you have this

318
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:04,070
head unit it exists whether you are not
paying for a thing it does exist whether

319
00:24:04,070 --> 00:24:08,790
you know it or not so I got excited and
I drove so first i got really come to us

320
00:24:08,790 --> 00:24:12,860
all and I saw its the work that I was
like I was like maybe the range of US

321
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:17,250
cell tower right I don't know what that
is like a mile I don't know you know so

322
00:24:17,250 --> 00:24:21,760
right so but anyway it was like more
than 30 metres I was like yes we're

323
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:27,950
getting gaining range so that I drove to
the airport by my house and let the Jeep

324
00:24:27,950 --> 00:24:33,320
at my house I try to from there and it
still worked as I like nice we're up to

325
00:24:33,320 --> 00:24:39,300
like five miles or something right then
I was like Chris try it so he tries from

326
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:45,720
Pittsburgh I'm in st. Louis it doesn't
work like man there's some may be a type

327
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:52,760
one tower like you know the house maybe
it's like a few hours anyway it was a

328
00:24:52,760 --> 00:24:57,990
bummer so we had no idea exactly how far
worked and so that I was like I'm going

329
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:02,020
on a road trip so I turned on my car in
my driveway I took off my other car down

330
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:10,110
the highway agency I'm like a little gas
truck stop so we're very beautiful but

331
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:13,929
instead I try from there it still works
and I were talking like 60 70 miles or

332
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:18,700
something and then finally finally I get
my

333
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:23,650
act together and get my nice spring
contract with have a contract for two

334
00:25:23,650 --> 00:25:29,580
years now said it as a wifi hotspot use
my computer to use that as a hotspot lo

335
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:33,689
and behold blaming I can be charlie's
car from Pittsburgh and st. Louis so

336
00:25:33,690 --> 00:25:37,650
basically he totally screwed up earlier
and totally screwed up earlier I was

337
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:40,880
like I can't get to it cuz i dont not
internet and then I relearned how to

338
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:49,040
internet and that Internet it right so
that's that's anyway the point is now

339
00:25:49,040 --> 00:25:54,030
it's it's no longer like 10 miles it's
very far we don't know for sure how far

340
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:57,470
at this point it turns out it anywhere
in the Sprint network which is like the

341
00:25:57,470 --> 00:26:01,390
entire united states nationwide probably
stomach and that probably some Mexico so

342
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:06,010
so now you can just scan the internet
and we know what we're looking for 66 67

343
00:26:06,010 --> 00:26:11,810
and if you find that port it's either
IRC server on the Sprint network or

344
00:26:11,810 --> 00:26:15,919
vulnerable be considered a win-win it's
either a car or an IRC server in either

345
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:22,900
way we're in a good way it's like so
then we ran like a scanner oh and we

346
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:26,460
also noted like we don't know for sure
which burns IP ranges but just by every

347
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:29,480
time you turn the car on up to get a
different IP address and is doing that a

348
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:33,260
bunch you can get an idea of where it
shows up and so it seems like it's

349
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:37,550
always in 21 . something or 25 not
something so we think it's just to class

350
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:41,560
A's it may or may not be but also less
than that but yeah whatever if you scan

351
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:45,530
that you finally get are used to be able
to get to that later so back in the day

352
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:53,740
camp I like it I got a day last week ago
so yes he just can't cars and know that

353
00:26:53,740 --> 00:26:57,610
they're vulnerable because its service
with on and just you don't have to worry

354
00:26:57,610 --> 00:27:02,699
about what version of that services are
like talking to you and you can do stuff

355
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:08,050
right now then likelihood you can take a
little bit more and it was essentially a

356
00:27:08,050 --> 00:27:11,370
web server that you can download
information from right at that thing it

357
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:15,320
gives you information so we did that so
that we have been nominated for Best

358
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:19,710
server-side exploit for the ponies but I
would nominate judge so you don't

359
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:20,480
qualify

360
00:27:20,480 --> 00:27:29,010
anyway you could so we got can't really
on top here at GPS a-gps operations

361
00:27:29,010 --> 00:27:34,970
vehicle just by asking politely on
imports of 67 and then we also got the

362
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:39,799
number will be a goal which you can look
up and see what kind of hard as he wrote

363
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:45,960
this clever script called shut up dave
is it goes back to shut up in a long

364
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:52,120
tradition of shut up scripts here's our
citizens targeted towards david says his

365
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:56,459
aunt I'd jump hack and anti Steinhatchee
and he says having cars easy stupid

366
00:27:56,460 --> 00:28:00,580
pointless no impact no impact their
impact right away

367
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:06,649
days so it can run the script and it
just cans internet finds cars that were

368
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:11,850
vulnerable and then tells you what kind
hardest part is right and I'm probably

369
00:28:11,850 --> 00:28:16,730
the scariest moment of all my research
was with the very first time I ran that

370
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:20,880
and got the GPS information and I was
like calling Chris Isaak Chris I just

371
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:26,780
did it and and it's a car that's driving
across Oklahoma right now is like no let

372
00:28:26,780 --> 00:28:30,580
me do it that I did it was like it's
right across rats as I quit too real for

373
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:36,020
me she saw that I was like too real for
me it was way more fun when it was like

374
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:39,820
my car in my driveway and that it was
like oh my god there's all these cars

375
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:47,110
are available and we want it so
originally when we talk to Chrysler and

376
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:52,178
they told us that it was only two dozen
forty miles and really ask with

377
00:28:52,179 --> 00:28:57,280
individuals how many cars were affected
and so we did the scanning besides just

378
00:28:57,280 --> 00:29:03,190
being you know just to see what kind of
car you could find that were honorable

379
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:05,980
and like what year is what makes what
model that kind of stuff how many there

380
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:10,780
are three ran the script a little bit
and these are the cars we found that

381
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:14,280
were vulnerable like just scan the
internet the sweetest I was dotted viber

382
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:19,950
for sure yes we found the diver and it
was like the Super top of the line 12

383
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:24,919
likes RT version they get someone's been
a pretty bad and then we could have

384
00:29:24,919 --> 00:29:26,290
liked

385
00:29:26,290 --> 00:29:31,010
substation because we didn't do that but
we gotta say this is a list of vehicles

386
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:34,210
in the interesting thing from us before
I call the recall happened was it was

387
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:39,150
like natalie was it is a party music
2013 cars cars and so on so lots of

388
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:44,700
vehicles under the terms i say more than
this that we never just happen to find

389
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:50,690
has been scanned and so again now we
know that the answer of how many older

390
00:29:50,690 --> 00:29:54,460
models 1.4 million cuz I said the
recalled but we didn't know and so the

391
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:58,910
way we did it was I was out running and
I was like a way to figure this out

392
00:29:58,910 --> 00:30:03,850
right like I was candid and like there
there should be a way to this and turns

393
00:30:03,850 --> 00:30:06,840
out I had this great idea and I went
home and google it and some dude who

394
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:12,129
like one of the population of the house
did the exact same thing and so the the

395
00:30:12,130 --> 00:30:16,560
day you have to think about scanning
cars everything turn on and off your car

396
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:19,909
you get a new IP address but I was
getting the VIN number so I scan like

397
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:24,580
two thousand cars and I know so I only
found twenty that I found a duplicate

398
00:30:24,580 --> 00:30:28,220
the number four and so so that means I
would expect that there must be like a

399
00:30:28,220 --> 00:30:30,190
lot of cars right because if I would've

400
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:33,380
dozen cars and they're almost all
duplicates of each other and then

401
00:30:33,380 --> 00:30:37,700
there's not that many cars right things
are unique to a car right there like

402
00:30:37,700 --> 00:30:41,060
your fingerprints of each car has
advanced and they don't change right so

403
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:46,240
so I was ahead like we've come up with a
poorly on which turns out like dude had

404
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,190
formulated numbers and a number that
came up with was like around 400,000

405
00:30:50,190 --> 00:30:54,550
which turned out to be a low estimate
more conservative and pretty low right

406
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:59,409
but anyway it was a lot of course but
that's why we did this king of it so far

407
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:08,200
in the story we can only play with the
radio very cool

408
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:15,480
anyone can they say that but go ahead so
what we had to do now is figure out how

409
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:19,940
this part where we stayed these diagrams
last year a black hat and it was we knew

410
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:23,620
the radio touch both can buses we just
need to figure out how this is one of

411
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:26,530
the reasons we chose the cheap in the
first place because it has this diagram

412
00:31:26,530 --> 00:31:31,930
ok be on the radio you're on all the
campuses like game over we assumed we

413
00:31:31,930 --> 00:31:32,750
named it

414
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:36,390
carcass that's what we thought we could
get into the easiest right but we are on

415
00:31:36,390 --> 00:31:41,510
the way you know the way it actually
works as you have this home at board

416
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:47,110
that has all your like stuff on it and
it was connected to a daughter board

417
00:31:47,110 --> 00:31:52,590
that had a fifty chip through a serial
line that was implemented spy for their

418
00:31:52,590 --> 00:31:58,040
communications right 0 prefer yeah I
don't know what's in them a fifty is on

419
00:31:58,040 --> 00:32:02,600
the can that work to be a fifty can sink
a messages you can listen to us is that

420
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:06,929
we're on can you can only talk to the
others if there's a problem we can't

421
00:32:06,930 --> 00:32:11,000
send him messages and to control car we
said you need can message injection and

422
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:15,350
this is why I Chrysler and other
companies have have correctly said I

423
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:19,780
know there's isolation between the time
are less important this system and can

424
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:23,879
you know there's on separate systems
they can't you know and so they're kinda

425
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:28,020
right that you know there are many
months that I tried to send a message

426
00:32:28,020 --> 00:32:31,690
from the home a job trying to figure out
there is enormous riding through escapes

427
00:32:31,690 --> 00:32:34,730
trying to figure out which ones may be
able to send a message I spent a lot of

428
00:32:34,730 --> 00:32:38,860
time trying to figure that out right but
there wasn't a was separate but but as

429
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:43,649
we know close only counts in horseshoes
and hand engaged so kinda is it is it

430
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:52,790
right we identified the the ship as the
850 FDA 3 Series chip at the nice thing

431
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:56,220
is we knew we had a firmware for it
because it came in I said you could

432
00:32:56,220 --> 00:33:01,600
download offline so when you stick it to
update the USB stick updating your car

433
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:07,520
you can update updates that you know the
files on the ship also can can refine

434
00:33:07,520 --> 00:33:12,450
and update the view that Egypt with it
with new firmware if so you know long

435
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:16,170
story short there's also a script that
says hey take this as a parameter and

436
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:21,240
flash of 850 chip over spot and there's
no code signing and there's really no

437
00:33:21,240 --> 00:33:25,320
checks so all you have to do is come up
with a bootleg firmware that you wrote

438
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:29,810
herself that does stuff and you can
update the chip no questions asked so

439
00:33:29,810 --> 00:33:35,580
that's how you get from being on edit it
to actually being on the 52 I'm gonna

440
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:39,470
fly to the rest of these guys it's
really boring but looks to the paper we

441
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:41,680
read data sheet a lot we read

442
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:45,380
a lot of data sheets we read a lot of
data sheets this is three months worth

443
00:33:45,380 --> 00:33:46,760
reading data

444
00:33:46,760 --> 00:33:51,290
basically reading data sheets finally
the nice thing is a pro had a processor

445
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:56,270
module for them via the 850 s we found
the base addresses this is hacking that

446
00:33:56,270 --> 00:33:59,590
Mr robot yeah this this is the part
where you just sit there for three

447
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:02,850
months going through all this crap even
Christian Slater really really wants a

448
00:34:02,850 --> 00:34:10,360
car exactly so he set up the segments we
found a bunch of cool values there's GDP

449
00:34:10,360 --> 00:34:14,530
relative addressing again be the paper
is a bunch of sections we found where I

450
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:19,310
can buy furs were right cross reference
letters to other pieces in the code and

451
00:34:19,310 --> 00:34:23,500
we found hey according to the data she
hears values that set things like the I

452
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:28,699
D and the data and all that good stuff
are only problem was we couldn't call

453
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:33,779
this function directly from anywhere so
we knew we could set up there and we can

454
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:37,150
do we could get this function to send it
to be wanted but we had no way to call

455
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:44,139
it so what do we do we're like ok we'll
find the spy parser and figure out if we

456
00:34:44,139 --> 00:34:49,710
can sense my messages and then basically
trampoline that code into some other

457
00:34:49,710 --> 00:34:57,530
cove where we're at show code code code
so basically made no sense trying to

458
00:34:57,530 --> 00:35:02,870
find it so we were we personally looked
in the firmware existing to see if there

459
00:35:02,870 --> 00:35:07,410
was some way the OMAP considers signal
to send like an arbitrary can message

460
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:11,350
but no matter how hard we looked we
couldn't find that way so we decided we

461
00:35:11,350 --> 00:35:16,100
were going to have to make a method that
would do that and then we would send spy

462
00:35:16,100 --> 00:35:20,279
message you know so perfectly paced
message to the Big Daddy same ok send

463
00:35:20,280 --> 00:35:22,140
this message with this data now please

464
00:35:22,140 --> 00:35:26,040
and that's that sidebar

465
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:31,770
there's a bunch of many copies to pick
sides buffers that take the size from

466
00:35:31,770 --> 00:35:36,880
spy message again I think we gave up
looking for these after a few so you

467
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:41,460
could reflect like we're going to
reflash the NBA 50 chip because there's

468
00:35:41,460 --> 00:35:45,650
no code sign but even if the head coach
saying we could have bypassed that by

469
00:35:45,650 --> 00:35:50,600
exploiting these memory corruption bugs
in the city but likely be didn't

470
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,759
basically nothing hard

471
00:35:52,760 --> 00:35:58,850
shoko by hand that's kinda rate
basically it was hey use this by Curtis

472
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:03,339
trampoline if it ceases bite it jumps to
jumpstart shoko that we put in unused

473
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:07,240
section of the wrong or show code sets
up the buffers bababababa sends a

474
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:12,939
message returns we're all good that's
how you send messages from being on a

475
00:36:12,940 --> 00:36:18,180
wireless chip through spy to reprogram
the V eight fifty chip the VA 50 now

476
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:21,899
contains are back toward firmware if it
receives this command it's going to look

477
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:25,530
at these bites if it seems that bites
going to travel into our code that's

478
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:29,190
gonna take the data out of the spy
messages we just sent and use that as

479
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:33,680
Candida we can send arbitrary messages
so that's how you can physically control

480
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:42,100
car from wireless to internal bypass
thanks by fast as the so called

481
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:47,230
celebration one small hurdle that we had
to bypass on the way though was the

482
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:51,520
system while is designed for the IMF to
update DVD chip is only designed to do

483
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:55,930
that like with the USB stick n and a guy
sort of pressing the buttons and in all

484
00:36:55,930 --> 00:36:59,149
sorts of which we don't have a goalie
and so there was some sort of exercise

485
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:03,480
are going to do that and it's kind of
hard because you can only update the

486
00:37:03,480 --> 00:37:08,690
benefits and other mode and if you put
in a remote it like resets the on that

487
00:37:08,690 --> 00:37:12,060
ship and then you lose control anyway if
you want details

488
00:37:12,060 --> 00:37:16,350
it was it was likely difficult happened
what happens when it goes wrong

489
00:37:16,350 --> 00:37:22,830
yeah dad is it was covered under
warranty every time which is the best

490
00:37:22,830 --> 00:37:24,549
part

491
00:37:24,549 --> 00:37:29,140
i mean you know one day I gotta say for
a crisis they stand behind their product

492
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:34,400
that's for sure so every time that we we
would message was sent twice that if you

493
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:39,179
mess up lasting to be a fifty then it
has huge doesn't work anymore and so the

494
00:37:39,179 --> 00:37:44,199
first time when I was flashing it and
you can't there's no output going out /

495
00:37:44,199 --> 00:37:49,039
I don't know if I was like this I just
turned it off as I have never came back

496
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:54,059
on again don't do that and the like the
real up a mechanism doesn't let you do

497
00:37:54,059 --> 00:38:01,259
that it has safety have no say so then
again I take it to dealer like what

498
00:38:01,259 --> 00:38:11,039
happened I was like as I get the screen
doesn't come on anymore so I tried to

499
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:18,410
use like like like the screen is all
black I don't know I just text just like

500
00:38:18,410 --> 00:38:26,420
I think they're buying it right i mean
so I never lied that's true they're like

501
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:31,539
work the screen in our there like what
what what happens I just doesn't come on

502
00:38:31,539 --> 00:38:32,660
that's

503
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:40,359
true and then the second time I think I
just screwed up something in their guy

504
00:38:40,359 --> 00:38:45,359
was like don't work and then like ok as
I do something wrong and then i got

505
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:50,369
really was very very careful objects
like I think it at 33 they might be like

506
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:56,750
don't come back so let's see ya sure to
go through very simply how how this

507
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:01,380
works right you get on a sound that when
I how would how would this attack houses

508
00:39:01,380 --> 00:39:04,190
go down to get on a cell network right
you have your cell phone you have your

509
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:09,880
laptop you have mass scanner scanning
for cars you find my sanity you connect

510
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:14,270
to it then you get code running automat
chip right at home at chip can send can

511
00:39:14,270 --> 00:39:19,950
messages so from that on that trip you
reprogram the g8 50 chip with your back

512
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:24,169
toward firmware that way you can send
messages to the home at ChIP chip takes

513
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:29,190
that data sends it on this pile onto the
fifty to be a pity consumed that you

514
00:39:29,190 --> 00:39:33,760
have it back toward the senate can
messages then you put Indiana ditch that

515
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:41,039
step for our rhetoric and messages as
the one thing that a real quick is that

516
00:39:41,039 --> 00:39:45,309
if you walk onto a jeep you don't know
it's IP address and we don't no way to

517
00:39:45,309 --> 00:39:46,670
really find its IP address

518
00:39:46,670 --> 00:39:50,970
besides booked into the GPS and then
just gained all the jeeps until you find

519
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:55,390
that one that's one limitation all the
Jeep sendak and individuals which is

520
00:39:55,390 --> 00:39:58,879
kinda backwards

521
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:05,589
even know how to run the same here is
here is like the whole attacked chain so

522
00:40:05,589 --> 00:40:11,660
explain so we're going to buy the
actually reflash invaded Egypt and then

523
00:40:11,660 --> 00:40:18,598
be able to send campus is like the whole
tax but so I stand it I said to exploit

524
00:40:18,599 --> 00:40:21,730
its downloading the firmware is
rebooting right now you can see it's

525
00:40:21,730 --> 00:40:28,940
black it's not last and right now it
takes like 30 seconds for the vehicle to

526
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:36,900
be completely replaced messages so
you'll notice that we're so good to very

527
00:40:36,900 --> 00:40:40,359
scarce now it's rebooting back up into
normal mode at this point the back

528
00:40:40,359 --> 00:40:44,410
toward former zaire we're good to go see
that's how long it took to get something

529
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:44,640
back

530
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,828
firmware so you would notice the screen
off a little bit but it's not alarming

531
00:40:47,829 --> 00:40:52,259
by any means but don't care about the
car don't have a car you can do that

532
00:40:52,259 --> 00:40:58,440
while driving on the road or whatever
else I guess about it we've been working

533
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:01,549
on this a long time because it's winter
when this video they were very

534
00:41:01,549 --> 00:41:08,019
responsible for the so long ago they're
still on the ground fast forward a

535
00:41:08,019 --> 00:41:15,919
little bit more so this one i'm waiting
for the white by the comeback out this

536
00:41:15,920 --> 00:41:22,779
is what the big way it is I want to get
into something straight out here and

537
00:41:22,779 --> 00:41:30,910
Charlie yards and other time as like 7
a.m. or so hours I'm gonna tell the turn

538
00:41:30,910 --> 00:41:41,049
the windshield wipers on which requires
campus to that end and hack right there

539
00:41:41,049 --> 00:41:47,859
so if there are prone to own every once
a Jeep in 30 seconds but in reality it's

540
00:41:47,859 --> 00:41:54,288
a year's worth of work maybe a min on
that and maybe getting slow

541
00:41:54,289 --> 00:41:59,529
alright so we had to get a diagnostic
tools I'm gonna burn through this as

542
00:41:59,529 --> 00:42:00,049
well

543
00:42:00,049 --> 00:42:04,579
enforcing the Jeep they were set at like
near seven grand and I told them I was

544
00:42:04,579 --> 00:42:08,150
you know the best tuner and Western P A
four jeeps they look me up

545
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:12,619
paid for all that their security locks
right to get security access to talk

546
00:42:12,619 --> 00:42:16,299
about these things before it wasn't
traditional couldn't find the algorithms

547
00:42:16,299 --> 00:42:20,900
actually in the code it was job so it
didn't outright nice for us but we

548
00:42:20,900 --> 00:42:25,329
couldn't find anything that she skated
strings after digging around for a while

549
00:42:25,329 --> 00:42:28,789
we found these constructors where they
actually took those files that were

550
00:42:28,789 --> 00:42:34,400
encrypted in the previous screen and
upper right and decrypted them and the

551
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:37,849
cool thing was all their decryption
passwords really speaks at this one is

552
00:42:37,849 --> 00:42:44,549
generation ratio so it's pretty cool as
I word up they wrote their mechanics

553
00:42:44,549 --> 00:42:48,630
tools and Java and then there were words
on reverse it they you know paper this

554
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:52,769
commercial is greater than Christmas
luck and that he skated hard slap to the

555
00:42:52,769 --> 00:42:57,519
face just totally reversed I do condone
violence on crappy code that's only

556
00:42:57,519 --> 00:42:58,459
thing I can do about it

557
00:42:58,459 --> 00:43:02,178
for also we could figure out checks on
the car they were different than

558
00:43:02,179 --> 00:43:05,209
anything we've seen best way to do that

559
00:43:05,209 --> 00:43:08,959
grab yourself some hardware get yourself
some firmware version sells some

560
00:43:08,959 --> 00:43:13,640
firmware and then look for X or as we
figure that's involved and lo and behold

561
00:43:13,640 --> 00:43:18,299
we found the checks and routine so
everything is in the Jeep so that'll be

562
00:43:18,299 --> 00:43:21,179
our package and it will show you how to
do all that stuff and that allows you

563
00:43:21,179 --> 00:43:24,759
said arbitrary can misuse of whatever
you want instead of just before we had

564
00:43:24,759 --> 00:43:28,159
to replay because we didn't know the
checks so we had to be paid message we

565
00:43:28,159 --> 00:43:31,439
saw but with this week and crafts
arbitrary messages with any bites from

566
00:43:31,439 --> 00:43:35,279
this checks in with routine and it would
fix it up so that was like a couple

567
00:43:35,279 --> 00:43:40,640
weeks too so it was so all that was left
was finding messages to send like how do

568
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:43,609
I control this year and how to control
the brakes and the way to do that is you

569
00:43:43,609 --> 00:43:47,969
just drive around and make those
situations happen and and then record it

570
00:43:47,969 --> 00:43:52,079
so you remember last year and if you
came to our time last year we had this

571
00:43:52,079 --> 00:43:57,289
video were trying to get automatic
collision prevention system to engage we

572
00:43:57,289 --> 00:44:02,119
could capture packets and absolutely did
that was so I gave way to see what we

573
00:44:02,119 --> 00:44:06,210
did is we got some cardboard boxes out
and we drove into them

574
00:44:06,210 --> 00:44:17,030
top US and so like afterwards after
talking it up it's like it only works on

575
00:44:17,030 --> 00:44:19,130
metal like how to this year

576
00:44:19,130 --> 00:44:25,609
medal by the way that people Home Depot
cause I thought we are sociopaths trash

577
00:44:25,609 --> 00:44:32,660
cans so we ask so we we this year and we
also put a phone with a camera on the on

578
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:36,160
the day we're gonna hit if we had hoped
he would stop in time so that's what

579
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:42,730
this view is no this is trying to find a
place to actually do the testing set up

580
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:45,690
the trash cans and people just keep
walking to the trash Josh Cadzow

581
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:50,510
cammarata it had a scare this little
girl out of the parking lot here so we

582
00:44:50,510 --> 00:44:57,740
finally found a place to do it so here
we are

583
00:44:57,740 --> 00:45:02,569
this is heading towards the camera the
camera exploded upon impact so that I

584
00:45:02,570 --> 00:45:05,740
think that's so if you listen to get
here fast forward like hauling ass

585
00:45:05,740 --> 00:45:06,540
around the corner

586
00:45:06,540 --> 00:45:09,940
anyway that's the end of that camera
footage for some reason you'll find out

587
00:45:09,940 --> 00:45:18,619
why so here is the side view footage it
got a little bit loud and

588
00:45:18,619 --> 00:45:25,849
once again prevention system did not
work this out front of his kids school

589
00:45:25,849 --> 00:45:27,279
by the way do it

590
00:45:27,279 --> 00:45:32,430
heavy metal did not make any difference
at all so don't try to be tested doesn't

591
00:45:32,430 --> 00:45:44,410
work on a box on the movies so we gotta
hurry up but we figured out eventually

592
00:45:44,410 --> 00:45:47,828
have to do that but these are the Lua
scripts that we've reduced to actually

593
00:45:47,829 --> 00:45:51,569
said meant that can message on the car
in this weird format look at the paper

594
00:45:51,569 --> 00:45:55,369
the type of format how we hear some of
the stuff we can do you can make the

595
00:45:55,369 --> 00:45:59,190
windshield wipers come up with like the
spray is hard to see what was going on

596
00:45:59,190 --> 00:46:05,579
of course we did not play any reemerge
as you see we tested the turn signals

597
00:46:05,579 --> 00:46:13,029
just skip the turn signals don't want to
see that signals alright it's a major

598
00:46:13,029 --> 00:46:20,789
you're going to hear I'm doing 70 but if
you look nice but I swear officer I

599
00:46:20,789 --> 00:46:30,789
wasn't speeding you can do as well so
here I am pulling up and I got the car

600
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:41,930
lock and walk away you should hear that
be twenty lakhs as we're just they way

601
00:46:41,930 --> 00:46:46,220
they were fast we're here a bit then I
sent the commands unlock the doors over

602
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:49,359
the cell network of course David live
for quite some time after you turn it

603
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:53,549
off and lock the doors and I can get my
coffee back in their child adopted in

604
00:46:53,549 --> 00:47:01,440
their lives in me I came act like I was
a dog was like you know my car and then

605
00:47:01,440 --> 00:47:05,339
here is what we actually did greenberg
said here's where you make the

606
00:47:05,339 --> 00:47:09,489
transmission stop functioning I'm giving
an old gas I'm a drive but it won't go

607
00:47:09,489 --> 00:47:10,609
anywhere

608
00:47:10,609 --> 00:47:20,210
try switching gears it still time to
stock and stock so that those are normal

609
00:47:20,210 --> 00:47:26,609
campus just you guys indicted diagnostic
once again like check out our old papers

610
00:47:26,609 --> 00:47:30,710
and stuff for the difference between
those shares the brakes networking which

611
00:47:30,710 --> 00:47:34,980
is what we put in individual yeah we
don't put ourselves in that they were

612
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:40,130
not that Greenberg so chris is trying to
stop here but you can see he's still

613
00:47:40,130 --> 00:47:46,460
actually moving so we we we think we if
we did not research we could do those at

614
00:47:46,460 --> 00:47:50,559
speeds someday but that's for later
today so I'll skip over how you do the

615
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:55,269
more complicated tax but here's the
effects of here is controlling steering

616
00:47:55,269 --> 00:48:01,569
touching anything essentially it takes
the CEO offline that we send messages

617
00:48:01,569 --> 00:48:04,900
pretending that where they see you
picking up with the traffic that way

618
00:48:04,900 --> 00:48:09,420
only our messages and its messages won't
be as I'm driving his car from remotely

619
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:22,789
if you listen to write next time I Drive
next to a poll to market so tight

620
00:48:22,789 --> 00:48:27,299
parallel park so I will hit the ball but
I didn't say what you can control this

621
00:48:27,299 --> 00:48:33,819
area pretty well pretty awesome breaking
the same way taken offline earlier said

622
00:48:33,819 --> 00:48:41,000
the message without some of president
breaks

623
00:48:41,000 --> 00:48:50,460
so we should be just like yeah we just
closed it and October

624
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:55,530
the cool thing that happened was after
Greenberg story happen not only did they

625
00:48:55,530 --> 00:49:00,720
eventually the recall and sand have
fixes for the thing but britain black

626
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:05,600
sport 667 traffic now so you can get to
even the cars that are passed which is

627
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:09,390
like super yeah yeah that's the biggest
fix this print not allowing you to get

628
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:16,660
on that port yeah that's good right now
there's no cars here is a video

629
00:49:16,660 --> 00:49:21,920
rendition of us disclosing this
information some website had its fucking

630
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:29,200
hilarious duo had been sharing to find
the companies out there did not

631
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:33,120
acknowledge your credit them for their
work rice animal bots look very scared

632
00:49:33,120 --> 00:49:37,109
he looked scared and then this is me
trying to get other people I meet us on

633
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:41,930
their vehicles and they say no if I let
us test selfish jerks

634
00:49:41,930 --> 00:49:47,649
affected the Pats is that instead of
what's been open either filter pics

635
00:49:47,650 --> 00:49:55,440
compact cars got recalled because that's
cool hackers did something that physical

636
00:49:55,440 --> 00:49:58,720
change happen and it wasn't within the
community it was within the real world

637
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:03,339
so that's not what we're most proud

638
00:50:03,340 --> 00:50:10,270
lawmen one of their laws so that's
something we worked with these centers

639
00:50:10,270 --> 00:50:17,450
and they issued this legislation
introduced in today the story about this

640
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:20,980
but we made the stock go down if we are
less are many writers shorted it but

641
00:50:20,980 --> 00:50:25,960
we're honest people and then just a
rebel a bit like traditional bugs like I

642
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:31,320
always find that perfected the stock
price this is stage fright sorry j.k

643
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:37,840
alright if you're really cool Twitter
will follow you the day after that wire

644
00:50:37,840 --> 00:50:41,210
story comes out to make sure you have to
know more Bishop yes I now chrysler

645
00:50:41,210 --> 00:50:45,650
files got to this real quick

646
00:50:45,650 --> 00:50:49,100
compromises are capable right we don't
have to prove this anymore we don't have

647
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:53,960
to do an eye on every car just know that
it's it's possible this is not a

648
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:59,860
Chrysler Fiat issue this is everybody
issue this is this is a tier ones that

649
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:02,650
give him stuff and this is the telecom
companies that provide them

650
00:51:02,650 --> 00:51:06,170
communications they all need to work
together to get this fixed it was better

651
00:51:06,170 --> 00:51:09,150
that Sprint block the poor in Chrysler
release the patch than just one of them

652
00:51:09,150 --> 00:51:14,600
acting alone and like I said hackers can
make a real difference this isn't just

653
00:51:14,600 --> 00:51:19,279
InfoSec anymore we affect the real world
people know about this stuff that aren't

654
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,240
in the industry and it's awesome and we
want people to continue to do this work

655
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:26,029
take this new cars do not stop and
that's it thanks everybody
