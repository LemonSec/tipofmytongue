1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,290
we're going to talk about third-party
code party libraries the risks if you a

2
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:09,620
little bit what's going on and they
would also also offer up some potential

3
00:00:09,620 --> 00:00:16,189
solutions for you so many JP the sea so
crisp a security been doing

4
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:18,650
vulnerability intelligence for a long
time

5
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:24,169
runaways BTV and data loss did you know
that I'm joined by can't believe I am

6
00:00:24,170 --> 00:00:29,949
Kimberly price director of red team for
crowd before this I work in security

7
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:34,840
incident response at blackberry and data
analytics and threat intelligence that

8
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:41,020
Microsoft had crazy cat picture poster
on there but she didn't like that so

9
00:00:41,020 --> 00:00:48,320
every Friday on Twitter it's Kat writing
so you're the cash alright so what are

10
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,199
we here to talk about and really for
most organizations and most people it's

11
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,489
no big question mark still most people
don't understand sort of what this

12
00:00:57,489 --> 00:01:01,570
third-party library stuff really means
and in many cases people really

13
00:01:01,570 --> 00:01:06,130
understand how it's impacting them at
their organization right to try to get

14
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,839
your head wrap around the issues as part
of the biggest problem this whole

15
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:14,369
third-party risk so what happens when
you don't think you understand what's

16
00:01:14,369 --> 00:01:15,060
going on

17
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:18,850
well you turned to sort of metrics are
some sort of what's going on out there

18
00:01:18,850 --> 00:01:24,009
in the world right and so security space
we love our metrics right well we seen

19
00:01:24,009 --> 00:01:26,310
better reports coming out things coming
out

20
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:33,479
unjust up all probability statistics
blackout in 2013 Steve Christie and

21
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:39,320
Brian Martin were here and it's all over
police tax and pretty much why they suck

22
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:47,339
so if you're interested in understanding
that sort of going out you can go check

23
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:51,939
this out right so regardless of them
complain about statistics what are we

24
00:01:51,939 --> 00:01:59,789
gonna do so get ready so this is a chart
data from PDB about vulnerabilities

25
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:00,470
overtime

26
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:05,929
so what you want to look at your we're
trying to describe basically is what is

27
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:08,880
going on in terms of the number of all
abilities not trying to say that's the

28
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:13,140
right metric or anything like that but
you can see from this is we are not

29
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:17,100
seeing a slowdown and vulnerabilities
reported discovered so we may be

30
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,290
investing in securities we may be
talking about it all the time and the

31
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:23,900
government and this and that we're still
seeing a whole bunch of crap code coming

32
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:30,250
out right and in fact in 2013 from these
CDs that you're seeing over 13,000

33
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:34,209
vulnerabilities disclosed right if you
look at sort of the breakdown of all

34
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:38,480
received a ton of process group in the
tunnel sequel injection vulnerabilities

35
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,359
that should have been eradicated ten
years ago or still most prevalent out

36
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:46,490
they're both pretty frightening right
now there's a whole lines here that this

37
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:54,020
is even talking about software

38
00:02:54,020 --> 00:03:07,980
ok so there's a lot of all abilities
still coming out ok all right now we're

39
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:11,739
playing war games and he's later
actually brutal so it's really hard to

40
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:19,080
say there but let's play a game how many
vulnerabilities in terms of cash did you

41
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:23,170
think there were an OpenSSL for the
issue known as hard police so the

42
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:31,600
artfully fallibility how many would you
count that one let's not overthink this

43
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,109
right

44
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:41,140
11 vulnerability to agree yes I can
barely see most of you saw me hear you

45
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:44,959
you reach $1 billion answer is yes

46
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:52,180
$1 ability and our our world right so
company that does vulnerability

47
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:56,290
intelligence they put out for its pretty
nice report they counted that there were

48
00:03:56,290 --> 00:04:00,730
over $15,000 abilities so again when you
look at some news reports you need to

49
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:05,810
understand the methodology behind it so
most people would agree are pleased was

50
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:10,160
$1 bility when you look at the
methodology of this report and what you

51
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:18,079
start to see a candidate two hundred and
ten times we still believe it

52
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:23,659
14 durability but yes two hundred and
ten times it was counted in this report

53
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:27,180
we have to look at these reports and
understand how things are being counted

54
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:30,790
what's going on before you sort of run
often as sort of make decisions on

55
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,520
what's going on

56
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:38,659
ok so I wouldn't say that are believed
was 210 times where these scream about

57
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:40,500
it but it was a big deal right

58
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:43,970
harpley was a big deal he got a lot of
attention and people started to

59
00:04:43,970 --> 00:04:45,370
understand what was going on

60
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:50,650
fancy logo can go a long way we all know
that but it really was the point where

61
00:04:50,650 --> 00:04:54,530
it started to get people understand that
one vulnerability can go across multiple

62
00:04:54,530 --> 00:04:57,590
things and when you're seeing

63
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:00,960
reports on news media at all this sort
of stuff it's something they get

64
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:03,859
people's attention so it started to
raise the awareness of this thing called

65
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:10,340
third-party live people get mad at the
slide but in estimates it was around

66
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:17,159
hundred plus vendors + impacted by our
beliefs as well as over 600,000 servers

67
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,230
on the internet that were impacted by
the Heartland village you get mad at us

68
00:05:21,230 --> 00:05:25,490
all you want the point is lots of all
abilities lots of impact all over the

69
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:29,440
place here one vulnerability and packing
lots of vendors and left a code that was

70
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:35,580
unexpected so here's just a small sample
of some products that we're listing up

71
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:40,190
here sixty eight or so before we got
tired of typing and most people say wait

72
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:44,300
a second you know the only people using
opposite OpenSSL and things like that

73
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:49,230
already startups or small companies can
afford is an enterprise stuff right but

74
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:53,730
then when you start to see is a very
large companies are in fact using

75
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:57,770
OpenSSL and other libraries in their
code if I can't tell you the number of

76
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:00,969
times I've had conversations with people
will say we don't use any third party

77
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:05,370
libraries our company and then a list of
all the vendors are using the right so

78
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:09,790
people are still trying to get their
heads wrapped around it hardly we had

79
00:06:09,790 --> 00:06:15,340
the wrong number this is what I got more
attention it was maybe super-three but

80
00:06:15,340 --> 00:06:18,130
the same point we're starting to see
more and more these homes we then have a

81
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:24,790
scary poodle right so scary poodles
gonna come attack network and a log jam

82
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:30,370
right so get your continuing to see sort
of the naming of vulnerabilities logos

83
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:36,650
all those things are likely another game
how many vulnerabilities you think

84
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:40,520
there's been an open a cell center
police and please for the love of god

85
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:44,710
don't use the security counting how many
vulnerabilities do you think we hear you

86
00:06:44,710 --> 00:06:46,310
7

87
00:06:46,310 --> 00:06:59,210
50010 ok well so here's the ugly I
Charleville abilities and OpenSSL heart

88
00:06:59,210 --> 00:07:02,120
believe once the little animation comes
in there all the way to the bottom

89
00:07:02,120 --> 00:07:04,110
you'll see that's always back there

90
00:07:04,110 --> 00:07:10,900
April 2014 when Hartley was there and so
52% fifty you're pretty damn funny for a

91
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:16,270
beverage later but they do have all
abilities if you're a person that like

92
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:23,159
CBS s right there was something there
that had the CBS 410 on average 6.78 and

93
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,190
if you think about it probably itself
was rated as a five right so one could

94
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:31,530
argue that lots of all abilities since
then and a lot that we're so far more

95
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:37,229
critical now if you hate CBS s version 2
and maybe even version 3 that's coming

96
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:42,230
let's look at a different measure here
right so let's look at it we go we look

97
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:50,420
at nine of these 52 and exploit publicly
available or some type of POC so now

98
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:53,570
we're talking about a little bit of a
different way to look at it and if you

99
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:58,849
look further fourteen of those actually
had a private exploit its just a

100
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:02,160
different way to look at it so many
people can look at this and say well we

101
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,590
didn't see all these on the news and
they didn't all have fancy logos and

102
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:06,140
whatnot

103
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:11,210
they could be more impactful than even
the ones we saw it so here's a scary

104
00:08:11,210 --> 00:08:15,710
ghosts and for all the researchers in
the room remember your name and your

105
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:19,030
logo carefully or one like that might
get assigned to you but the point of

106
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:23,090
this is just a show that we're beat up
on OpenSSL for good reason but the same

107
00:08:23,090 --> 00:08:28,450
time this is much more than this right
this is the new library coast so it's

108
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:31,960
not just opened a cell that this sucks
out there and in fact I'm not sure

109
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:36,329
what's going on with these days we need
to go to but if you even go back to 2005

110
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:40,720
it was a naive on out there we called
ghost so let's try not to recycle the

111
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:46,930
same name but getting more creative
right so what this is showing to us is

112
00:08:46,930 --> 00:08:51,739
this whole concept of systemic risk
things are interconnected right and if

113
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,950
you think about it in terms of the
insurance were

114
00:08:53,950 --> 00:08:58,320
this is really well this is one
hurricane event that comes up and calls

115
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,510
massive problems right one of them
calling lots of problems and you start

116
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:07,130
to see this in third-party code library
usage right one of all ability affecting

117
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:12,890
all that and that's why it's such a big
concern in many cases so I'm not here to

118
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:13,430
talk

119
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:17,699
complete trash about third-party library
usage whether it's open or closed source

120
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:21,880
nothing of that nature there are great
things are developers and companies are

121
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,710
under pressure to deliver better faster
cheaper all three and libraries are

122
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:29,920
great they do a lot of great things but
at the same time you need to understand

123
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:33,939
that this deficiency in the goodness
that comes with it comes to potentially

124
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:38,540
at this call at so many cases is not
just the one involving a crossed low

125
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:42,000
into products organizations and the
researcher we're doing we're seeing that

126
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,570
one application can have hundreds and
hundreds of third-party libraries and in

127
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:49,510
many cases organizations are not
treating that that their party Co

128
00:09:49,510 --> 00:09:54,819
Cordingley this coming up black duck out
there that categorizes open source

129
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:58,800
components and looks at it we reached
out to them to say you know how much of

130
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,390
the stuff is out here right we've made a
couple of all abilities kimberly's gonna

131
00:10:02,390 --> 00:10:07,500
go over some vulnerabilities in and
libraries but like typically said

132
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:12,090
they're tracking over a million open
source projects we believe that means it

133
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:18,460
with with versions different versions of
it across six thousand sites in our

134
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:22,290
world we think the numbers probably
around 1,500 to 2,500 libraries that are

135
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:26,670
routinely used but this is still areas
being discovered their party libraries

136
00:10:26,670 --> 00:10:30,449
probable over the place but so get part
of it is really understanding what

137
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:34,130
you're using another metric that they
shared with was interesting is that 30%

138
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:38,220
of the Forbes Global 2000 Enterprise
code is actually open source it's

139
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:44,100
something that's out there is something
that truly alright folks library

140
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:56,180
I would love to start a library date it
to talk so I want to be clear first off

141
00:10:56,180 --> 00:11:01,359
we're not advising is judge said to not
use third-party libraries we're hoping

142
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:04,759
to talk to you about the information you
should have on the libraries that are

143
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:09,980
being used to ensure that you're
planning your resources whether their

144
00:11:09,980 --> 00:11:15,370
technical or personnel resources or time
scheduling for secure development and

145
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:20,750
and not just the post-release incident
response piece of it but even during

146
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:26,399
design and development so all of the
data we're presenting today is from

147
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:32,589
public sources are going to be able to
go back to your office and if you needed

148
00:11:32,589 --> 00:11:36,100
to do it proof of concept to demonstrate
your leadership team why you need

149
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:40,579
funding to implement some tools or
threat intelligence feed you can do that

150
00:11:40,579 --> 00:11:45,550
it's not super steel wool long term but
you could at least get a start and and

151
00:11:45,550 --> 00:11:51,250
show them why this is useful so I pulled
the data from public sources but as you

152
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:55,779
can see on this line as and pig in CT
details as a hundred and ninety-one

153
00:11:55,779 --> 00:12:00,170
vulnerability short if you look at
involved ed which is a paid for

154
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:06,729
intelligence feed there's over a
thousand math is hard but it's a cord

155
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:14,819
and so why are wiser difference will
flat out tell you they silently patch

156
00:12:14,819 --> 00:12:18,870
vulnerabilities they don't sign CD East
here so if you're looking at a public

157
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:23,360
CDE database you're only getting the CD
East when you're considering a threat

158
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:25,649
intelligence library make sure

159
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:29,350
that the vendor you're considering the
money to you is doing a thorough

160
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:35,139
security assessment of that library and
documenting the silent fixes for you

161
00:12:35,139 --> 00:12:39,990
this is all public beta I'm not gonna be
able to tell you that there goes to

162
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:45,199
taxes let's start with OpenOffice out
and i wanna talk a little bit talk about

163
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:49,109
the spread of this but i wanna start
with them because it sets the stage for

164
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:52,860
their libraries we're gonna talk about
who use it

165
00:12:52,860 --> 00:13:05,569
gmail.com LastPass VMware down Dropbox
black right

166
00:13:05,569 --> 00:13:14,579
all these companies I got tired of
playing logos so we've also got Val Red

167
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:22,359
Hat McAfee f5 siskel 14 at every time
there is an OpenSSL vulnerability all of

168
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:25,379
these lenders have to patch and
sometimes I have to catch in multiple

169
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:30,370
products and I've actually seen products
use multiple iterations of the same

170
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:34,379
library where you've got to feature
teams that both you deliver that they

171
00:13:34,379 --> 00:13:37,660
didn't talk to each other so they're not
dynamically linking it and they're both

172
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:38,380
running there

173
00:13:38,380 --> 00:13:42,980
own versions and sometimes running
different versions so this is a whole

174
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:47,270
lot of catching for OpenSSL and we also
that pain during Hartley it is Jake

175
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:54,829
mention if you hurt lead and you didn't
pack again until free or some other

176
00:13:54,830 --> 00:14:01,360
major named event you probably missed
items in the modalities so next up this

177
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:07,360
free time rendering library and super
useful I don't really recommend that you

178
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:11,150
decide to start graduate of murdering
library he's never done it before a

179
00:14:11,150 --> 00:14:13,980
really nice to be able you something
that someone else has been working on

180
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:21,330
for years and years and is used in
Android iOS wrong FreeBSD ghost script

181
00:14:21,330 --> 00:14:26,680
is in printers all over the world so
basically got some things invested in

182
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:33,479
there it is also in OSX WebKit what's
interesting is it is another third-party

183
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,840
libraries you have libraries now sit in
libraries so anything that uses WebKit

184
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:42,260
may be vulnerable when three ty possible
ability

185
00:14:42,260 --> 00:14:48,040
we've got plenty to Oracle blackberry
zadora Playstation or shine again

186
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:53,660
indicating devices operate four-week
multiple video games and I'm not gonna

187
00:14:53,660 --> 00:14:57,800
live was kind of fun like investigative
Lee tracking down these libraries are

188
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:04,040
resistant the American Girl doll game I
didn't see that coming

189
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:09,980
you know those laws are a little creepy
maybe maybe they're not accurate but the

190
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:12,980
bigger issue is very tight

191
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:22,190
libraries and a lot of places so CDE
2011 0226 didn't have a catchy name but

192
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:29,320
RCDs 933 and this vulnerability was used
in jailbreak for the iPhone in 2011 and

193
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:32,750
Israel locally exploitable
vulnerabilities the Joburg will

194
00:15:32,750 --> 00:15:38,180
primarily be Terms of Use violation if
you look violation but it was remotely

195
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:41,939
exploitable so there is a missing
parameter check that allowed a malicious

196
00:15:41,940 --> 00:15:48,230
program to move the stack pointer and
now started if you're using frito to

197
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:54,060
render your email and your browser just
reading email condone your device so

198
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:59,800
this is why libraries really matter
because now you have to wait you can't

199
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:05,880
have free time you have to wait for the
vendor departure for you with PNG which

200
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:09,790
artist over a hundred and thirty
applications including Google Apple

201
00:16:09,790 --> 00:16:15,740
Adobe Microsoft VMware blackberry next
it everywhere and the reason is

202
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:20,420
everywhere its compatibility you want to
be able to view PNG is on everything so

203
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:28,910
we've eaten in things like PowerPoint
Visio and then again it's in WebKit

204
00:16:28,910 --> 00:16:32,110
again you've got to know some libraries
going on

205
00:16:32,110 --> 00:16:41,399
their Solaris VMware Server countless
application now we didn't talk about we

206
00:16:41,399 --> 00:16:44,440
haven't talked about tom cat awful lot
when we get in this presentation in the

207
00:16:44,440 --> 00:16:50,800
past tom cat is used in ASAP VMware
Nokia and seek you're starting to see a

208
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:56,029
very different type of application fees
are much more enterprise applications

209
00:16:56,029 --> 00:17:01,070
you're seeing controls that there that s
AP accounting and payroll that matters a

210
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:06,319
whole so we've got that all over the
place and you're also starting to see

211
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:12,178
the scene fender logos over and over and
over and that's going to be important in

212
00:17:12,179 --> 00:17:19,870
a minute to the next last prayer /
players in Microsoft and Oracle and IE

213
00:17:19,869 --> 00:17:26,928
and Chrome and Firefox and Blackberry
and WordPress and even Apple you you you

214
00:17:26,929 --> 00:17:31,559
can point to the fact that Apple isn't
shipping Flash Player but if you thought

215
00:17:31,559 --> 00:17:38,770
using your enterprise with Max had they
install flash there how are you getting

216
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:44,530
that fixed so at least still issuing
patches for flash player on so that

217
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:50,100
still has to get up to it as well and
then a few other things it it was

218
00:17:50,100 --> 00:17:55,129
actually used in some Samsung smart
televisions as well don't know Samsung's

219
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:55,920
patching

220
00:17:55,920 --> 00:18:03,680
but and then Java Java wins hands down
on the vulnerability spread competition

221
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:10,720
we shifted to mars it is on the Mars
rover it in almost every eniac

222
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:16,160
joking we thought it would be easier to
list of places it wasn't used its not

223
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:23,640
used in towels for example it is in
nearly everything and so let's look at

224
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:28,030
the actual breakdown of numbers from
January 1st 2007 until june thirtieth

225
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:33,850
2015 and win a library wasn't around
that long over due to the data to

226
00:18:33,850 --> 00:18:37,389
OpenSSL across the state and a half
years has had ninety vulnerabilities

227
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:42,170
they're averaging 10 to 11 here that's
what they're releasing three times a

228
00:18:42,170 --> 00:18:46,500
year so far patch management perspective
you're only gonna have to look at the

229
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:50,070
library on average three times a year

230
00:18:50,070 --> 00:18:55,679
their average EDSS scores 5.49 here to
see the US but as jack mentioned earlier

231
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:59,400
Hartley was only a 50 sometimes really
bad stuff comes in small packages

232
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:07,170
freetype at fifty longer to Rudy's
releases a year and you can see their

233
00:19:07,170 --> 00:19:12,700
CBS score is higher at 7.43

234
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:16,730
Eng dropping down even further only 28
vulnerabilities are eight and a half

235
00:19:16,730 --> 00:19:22,620
years 6 165 and CBS two to three days a
year

236
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:31,120
jumping back up 205 days a year on
average four point seven to go and

237
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,649
here's where you get into weird things
with your data

238
00:19:34,650 --> 00:19:37,240
tom cat will see de

239
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:44,310
really low CBS formerly known as you see
de on a two point four and a lot of

240
00:19:44,310 --> 00:19:51,830
vendors will only CBS in the five and
above range so again data isn't perfect

241
00:19:51,830 --> 00:19:55,679
but this is what probably available
you'll see $100 abilities but overall

242
00:19:55,680 --> 00:20:01,230
the impact is much lower lash players
2009 to present

243
00:20:01,230 --> 00:20:05,480
they have five hundred and twenty-two
vulnerabilities in that time but they

244
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:11,190
have a very consistent release schedule
about once a month and their average

245
00:20:11,190 --> 00:20:22,200
CVSS score is 8.9 6 job will be to flash
player with five hundred and thirty-nine

246
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:26,240
daily update quarterly know so when you
get a job

247
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:33,420
day think about you know just rolled out
you do some a compact testing you make

248
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:35,280
sure you're not going to break anything

249
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:39,560
software vendors have to do the same
thing so if they get a Java update that

250
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:43,530
has 52 vulnerabilities in it that's a
lot of testing before they can integrate

251
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:49,860
it but that's a half years worth of data
how bad is it today

252
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:57,929
whatsoever in 80015 just forum for
OpenSSL has 29 out of those ninety just

253
00:20:57,930 --> 00:21:03,270
in the first six months of this year
down to Flash Player of the Year hundred

254
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:08,889
and thirty-five in the first six months
of this year that's 25% of their total

255
00:21:08,890 --> 00:21:15,820
eight and a half year total load of
vulnerabilities Giada 58 so far this

256
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,570
year this

257
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:26,540
is not to say that retail is more secure
than Flash Player Adobe has a robust

258
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:30,230
mature security team that does pen
testing they bring in consultants they

259
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:35,390
run by the county they're actively
looking for vulnerabilities I don't know

260
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:40,310
what I don't know about three types so
again when you're looking at data this

261
00:21:40,310 --> 00:21:44,620
is not telling you what's more secure
tell you how to plan your resources if

262
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:49,560
you're using any of these libraries so
that's the hasty generalization don't

263
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:55,110
assume something is less secure because
it has a lot of vulnerabilities in it so

264
00:21:55,110 --> 00:22:00,199
we'll wait until you just told me how
many vulnerabilities they have I thought

265
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:05,330
it was just like jesus saith insecure
should you be using accountable should

266
00:22:05,330 --> 00:22:08,270
be live you be looking at a frequency of
updates

267
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:12,780
variable annuities maybe the most
important thing is is there a crx way

268
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:20,910
yes there is no one measure to its all
data used to make conscious risk

269
00:22:20,910 --> 00:22:25,120
decisions and and what we're going to
talk to you a little bit more about this

270
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,760
is all laying the groundwork for what
they say about to talk to you that

271
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:33,270
around window of opportunity so how long
has the vulnerability been known for and

272
00:22:33,270 --> 00:22:42,790
is that a factor for you to think about
as well alright so we tried this sort of

273
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:46,620
lay of the land for you what this
third-party libraries stuff is give you

274
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:50,020
a little feel for where it is which
seemed to be everywhere but what's going

275
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:53,960
on but in terms of what you can do it
your organization right now sort of

276
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:55,170
feels like

277
00:22:55,170 --> 00:22:58,660
little helpless it seemed right so wanna
talk to you about this thing called

278
00:22:58,660 --> 00:23:04,070
pitot and it's a number of years of
research finally coming together this is

279
00:23:04,070 --> 00:23:07,179
the first time we're talking about it
publicly and so it stands for

280
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:12,340
vulnerability timeline and exposure
metrics and so basically what it is it

281
00:23:12,340 --> 00:23:16,730
took train more that's trying to define
that provide guidance for vulnerability

282
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:20,860
timeline tracking so if you think about
it or ability there's a lifecycle

283
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:24,919
associated with it right from the time
of all these introduced into a codebase

284
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:27,760
was discover to gets

285
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:31,710
and all this other stuff is all these
dates and time right to this spring

286
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:36,110
we're trying to define what those dates
are and then some calculations and maybe

287
00:23:36,110 --> 00:23:39,770
can give you some metrics write those
metrics can allow you in and doing

288
00:23:39,770 --> 00:23:44,790
better vendor evaluation better product
evaluation and then ultimately at the

289
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:48,879
end understand the exposure that your
organization is really facing to these

290
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:54,990
these issues so we went through this
little bit but you probably sit there

291
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:58,460
and say I really care about this stuff
right so we're hoping that you should

292
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:03,140
care for a few reasons and again the
metric should help you evaluate and

293
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:09,070
select vendors to work with it actually
care about security so we keep you know

294
00:24:09,070 --> 00:24:13,340
tracking data left and right nothing
looks like it's getting better than 10

295
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:17,199
years now we give the same Tacopina say
the same crap you know bones keep coming

296
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,580
reaches keep happening nothing seems to
be sort of moving in the right direction

297
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:27,280
well we actually start to have something
that can better evaluate our vendors may

298
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:32,040
be that enforce vendors that actually
start cursing secure products so instead

299
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:36,750
of working on that next feature they
will start working on actually securing

300
00:24:36,750 --> 00:24:40,010
their products as we know there's going
to be some evaluation against them if

301
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:43,950
you choose to work with vendors and use
your wallet or your pocketbook and put

302
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:47,940
it with vendors I care about security
and start to force things down that path

303
00:24:47,940 --> 00:24:51,340
right market forces prevail maybe
instead of sort of the software

304
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:52,590
liability

305
00:24:52,590 --> 00:24:57,158
arguments they keep coming up and
secondly it's actually a truly help you

306
00:24:57,159 --> 00:25:01,100
understand your organization's exposure
and what vendors and what products are

307
00:25:01,100 --> 00:25:05,928
really sort of the biggest offenders in
your organization what are you doing so

308
00:25:05,929 --> 00:25:10,500
what we want to accomplish with with me
time so we wanted to find the time on an

309
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:15,590
exposure terminology and try to make it
consistent consistent usage right so for

310
00:25:15,590 --> 00:25:19,928
organizations for researchers are
discovering vulnerabilities as well as

311
00:25:19,929 --> 00:25:25,669
software vendors and even more so to
find that patient's for certs the

312
00:25:25,669 --> 00:25:29,610
software vendors and researchers on a
date in the data that we're looking for

313
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:33,719
in their vulnerability research in their
disclosure or coordination processes

314
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:39,350
again it's a framework to assist your
organization with understanding your own

315
00:25:39,350 --> 00:25:42,689
time of exposure identifying those
vendors and products that are

316
00:25:42,690 --> 00:25:47,809
contributing to this exposure allow you
to create a scorecard where you can you

317
00:25:47,809 --> 00:25:52,039
can monitor performance of these vendors
and products and assist you more than

318
00:25:52,039 --> 00:25:56,090
anything goes maybe that upfront select
the right vendors and products to work

319
00:25:56,090 --> 00:26:01,490
with understand that total cost of
ownership of making these decisions so

320
00:26:01,490 --> 00:26:07,510
days so over there are nine days right
now that are part of the v10 framework

321
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:11,220
but there's already another Wang being
argued that needs to be added into it

322
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:15,620
just fine this is meant to be a living
framework but think about it so quickly

323
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:16,309
right

324
00:26:16,309 --> 00:26:20,629
vulnerabilities introduced at some point
I'm availability is discovered at some

325
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:25,380
point I'm a vendor is informed at some
point in time about it and then at some

326
00:26:25,380 --> 00:26:29,620
point later they respond right now
things get great in the role of Billy

327
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:32,639
lifecycle you actually spend the time to
do with these dates are all over the

328
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,559
place they're not sort of linear street
you know things come out before other

329
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:39,879
things happen as it gets a little murky
at time but again

330
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,390
defining the dates that we want to
understand this is what we're doing

331
00:26:42,390 --> 00:26:48,230
first so better informed about it then
directs some point acknowledges this and

332
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:50,960
we're gonna get a vendor solution to the
situation

333
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:57,230
another point in time and then the
disclosure of it now if a vendor doesn't

334
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:01,640
do it we expect in terms of a solution
maybe there's a third-party solution or

335
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:06,240
fix that can help if there's a date for
that exploit publish date again that

336
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:09,200
could come out well before any of those
other ones but there's a date with the

337
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:13,760
export becomes public and then the final
one that helps you with your position is

338
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:18,610
Ben do you actually solve this one is it
the solution implemented at your

339
00:27:18,610 --> 00:27:22,870
organization so these are the court
dates of the framework right now so

340
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:27,649
great just thought about that what does
that actually mean what is it what does

341
00:27:27,649 --> 00:27:29,549
it matter she'll show you the money
right

342
00:27:29,549 --> 00:27:34,600
ok so over the next couple slides I just
pick one going to Billy to sort of give

343
00:27:34,600 --> 00:27:39,270
you a flavour of how this can work so
this is an old school met screen

344
00:27:39,270 --> 00:27:43,629
vulnerability that I personally have
understand you know and know that all

345
00:27:43,630 --> 00:27:47,520
the dates for these calculations existed
there are tons of vendors that could

346
00:27:47,520 --> 00:27:51,590
have been picked and bad examples and
all that sort of stuff of things we can

347
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:56,350
go into that later but this is a net
screen phone from back in 2002 long time

348
00:27:56,350 --> 00:28:01,240
ago and so the first metric that beat em
provides when we called into response

349
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:04,730
time and again the purpose is to
demonstrate the response time from a

350
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:08,990
vendor being informed until they
actually respond to a researcher we're

351
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:12,299
not talking about our automated response
and if you think about the whole full

352
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:16,279
disclosure Apple this and that
coordinated disclosure stuff a lot of it

353
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:20,070
about is about the new response I'm
actually responding so we can do that

354
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:23,700
right that those dates that we talked
about we have that so when was the

355
00:28:23,700 --> 00:28:27,279
vendor informed and how long did it take
to acknowledge so we'll get this ball

356
00:28:27,279 --> 00:28:30,450
here you can see they were informed on

357
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:34,900
October 8th and they acknowledged a
little bit later we have a date right

358
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:39,780
37 days to get a response and my
sympathies to you not in good or bad

359
00:28:39,780 --> 00:28:43,730
that comes later on we start doing more
work but we can see what their response

360
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:48,010
time was on this particular
vulnerability time to bash what we mean

361
00:28:48,010 --> 00:28:51,010
by this one this one means to
demonstrate the response time of the

362
00:28:51,010 --> 00:28:55,210
vendor from when they were informed that
when they provide and publisher working

363
00:28:55,210 --> 00:29:00,770
patch with customers again you can see
here there are formed in October Asian

364
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:06,620
2002 and then the solution comes out
late November right so simple metrics

365
00:29:06,620 --> 00:29:10,709
here that makes a 48 days is what it's
all the time that they were made aware

366
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:11,570
of it

367
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:17,550
21 they provided a patch now here's
we're gonna get a wordsmith in a commit

368
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:21,790
rights we see time to patch there's all
these variations to it so the next one

369
00:29:21,790 --> 00:29:26,330
is total time to bash and what we're
trying to say here here trying to see

370
00:29:26,330 --> 00:29:30,949
what is the total amount of time when
the vulnerability was discovered that

371
00:29:30,950 --> 00:29:35,640
patch then becomes available so you can
see here in this particular case it's

372
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:39,310
not too much difference because when I
was discovered it was only a couple days

373
00:29:39,310 --> 00:29:43,649
later that it went over to the to the
vendor right now there are gaps in this

374
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:47,050
you can understand it researchers are
sitting on vulnerabilities if there's

375
00:29:47,050 --> 00:29:50,090
something else that there are two
different sort of metrics that you can

376
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:52,820
start to look at the making action for
your organization

377
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:58,780
all right now we're going to talk about
a few that are more specific to what

378
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:01,870
your organization could be in this is
the time of exposure metrics that we've

379
00:30:01,870 --> 00:30:05,820
been talking about so let's assume that
all of you work for a company called

380
00:30:05,820 --> 00:30:12,800
evil we agree we're all working for you
and in this particular case were trying

381
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:17,500
to determine when evil corporate able to
solve this this this possibility so this

382
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:21,040
metric time of exposure is to
demonstrate the exposure the

383
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:26,330
organization is vulnerable from 16 is
published today implement the solution

384
00:30:26,330 --> 00:30:30,689
right now so you can see here we go
through the whole deal basically saying

385
00:30:30,690 --> 00:30:33,950
that evil core it only solve this

386
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,940
the next quarterly maintenance window
which happened

387
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:41,159
Valentin today the following year and so
what's their total exposure for exposure

388
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:41,659
here

389
00:30:41,659 --> 00:30:46,090
eighty-one days now we're gonna do again
another slight variation and we're gonna

390
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:51,039
say total time of exposure and this is
the demonstrate the time exposure an

391
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:56,940
organization from when the issue was
discovered until fully right so we can

392
00:30:56,940 --> 00:31:02,220
see here that metrics quite a bit
different now right now 231 days so

393
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:05,769
you're starting to see the differences
on this ok that can help you to make

394
00:31:05,769 --> 00:31:09,289
those decisions about what's going on
with this particular vulnerability now

395
00:31:09,289 --> 00:31:13,370
looking at it as just one of our ability
to get to see all the metrics and it's

396
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:17,330
it's great it may be something that you
say what does that mean to me when you

397
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:21,360
start looking on the whole for lots of
all abilities to a pic of your product

398
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:25,610
in this particular products to vendors
starts to paint a picture of how is that

399
00:31:25,610 --> 00:31:30,219
product being handle house then the
response time being there so it starts

400
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:33,720
to help you understand a larger picture
right and then over time we believe

401
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:38,059
we're gonna start people see what
averages look alright so here's another

402
00:31:38,059 --> 00:31:41,190
one just to show you a little bit of a
different situation than some of the

403
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:46,899
stuff can be a little bit challenging so
this is the Seagate SAS code execution

404
00:31:46,899 --> 00:31:52,779
from late last year and so this one was
tricky with of interest the Ravenna

405
00:31:52,779 --> 00:31:57,149
response time just things got a little
crazy but I think this is a perot polio

406
00:31:57,149 --> 00:32:04,518
or for worse than to respond to a vendor
response is this one right and so when

407
00:32:04,519 --> 00:32:08,320
you say the lamest what are the sort of
qualifications for that we can start

408
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:12,009
using to be temporary work to put in
there some response data and metrics

409
00:32:12,009 --> 00:32:17,279
maybe that also helps right so the
vendor actually responded quickly if you

410
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:21,309
will but it was ridiculously effective
right they created this two and a half

411
00:32:21,309 --> 00:32:25,549
sort of month the leg and you're not be
able to read this but this is OJ on

412
00:32:25,549 --> 00:32:28,029
Twitter who kept sort of going to

413
00:32:28,029 --> 00:32:31,210
their their support on Twitter and they
kept saying so they didn't support

414
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:35,509
technical support it kept saying over
and I'll try to see the whole ability

415
00:32:35,509 --> 00:32:40,769
I'm trying to do it securely and it was
just bad right so then eventually over

416
00:32:40,769 --> 00:32:43,919
LinkedIn he gets the right security
power attack and they were able to

417
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,859
acknowledge it but you begin we're
seeing sort of a problem with that right

418
00:32:47,859 --> 00:32:50,718
so you can see sort of the metrics down
below

419
00:32:50,719 --> 00:32:55,799
again it was October 2014 when it was
discovered a few days later as when he

420
00:32:55,799 --> 00:33:00,059
started trying to make the contact and
then there's a new vendor contact and

421
00:33:00,059 --> 00:33:05,940
then all the knowledge you know that in
the next year in July 23 January so that

422
00:33:05,940 --> 00:33:10,099
point I'm talking about eighty three
days to actually get some sort of

423
00:33:10,099 --> 00:33:16,468
response a response from the vendor and
again just for the sake of it we saw a

424
00:33:16,469 --> 00:33:20,229
Chinese some of the calculations again
assuming you will call you know patching

425
00:33:20,229 --> 00:33:23,359
ninety days later you can see sort of
the amount of time and what you can

426
00:33:23,359 --> 00:33:28,080
start to see is that when communication
through vulnerability disclosure and

427
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:31,239
contacting vendors and those sorts of
things happen to start putting your

428
00:33:31,239 --> 00:33:35,589
organization more at risk for you want
to work with vendors that have to step

429
00:33:35,589 --> 00:33:39,190
down that actually when you contact them
and they have an issue you don't get

430
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:47,489
stuck around for two and a half months
it's putting more exposure for the right

431
00:33:47,489 --> 00:33:49,070
so

432
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:53,009
report came out here recently from
Symantec and it's a did you know it

433
00:33:53,009 --> 00:33:57,730
takes forty nine days on average decree
published patches 40 days does anyone

434
00:33:57,730 --> 00:34:01,639
know that that means if you actually
look at the report a little more what

435
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:07,189
you find is they say the average time
taken between publication and cash and

436
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:12,399
so many would say well is that we're
talking about 10 that right now I don't

437
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:17,129
know who agrees and again I can't see
you all but I feel like zero day term

438
00:34:17,129 --> 00:34:21,368
has been so bastardized that if you sort
of all the time right so if you think

439
00:34:21,369 --> 00:34:26,720
about the old school code area 0 day in
many cases it was used to define some

440
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:30,439
sort of issue that the vendor didn't
know about it wasn't publicly disclosed

441
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:35,500
I was typically 10 days but now you're
here and all sorts of things where maybe

442
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:39,210
something goes out public right but it
doesn't have a fixed with it now will

443
00:34:39,210 --> 00:34:42,599
call in those days so it's getting sort
of confusing know what the heck's going

444
00:34:42,599 --> 00:34:45,669
on but you can see you again these are
just some random things pulled from

445
00:34:45,668 --> 00:34:47,549
Wikipedia the likely to see you again

446
00:34:47,550 --> 00:34:53,220
0 day vulnerability refers to the whole
software vendor unknown to the event so

447
00:34:53,219 --> 00:34:58,618
the whole point here is can we finally
with the v10 framework to find what the

448
00:34:58,619 --> 00:35:03,359
hell of a day is right we do have some
dates now that we can talk about and

449
00:35:03,359 --> 00:35:07,560
maybe what we're trying to describe with
zero day or a day there's a couple of

450
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:11,839
flavors till the pain over getting so
again couple dates that are important

451
00:35:11,839 --> 00:35:15,880
you're right the vendor informed eight
disclosure day again if you're one of

452
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:20,040
those folks that argues it's actually
about pollution day that it's there as

453
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:24,450
well right but again if we want to say
hey 80 days when a vendor doesn't know

454
00:35:24,450 --> 00:35:28,618
about it or it hasn't been publicly
described on this chart here you can see

455
00:35:28,619 --> 00:35:33,630
from those two dates at work all day and
then anything after that not only zero

456
00:35:33,630 --> 00:35:38,349
day right so look we can argue the stuff
to death but it would be really nice to

457
00:35:38,349 --> 00:35:41,119
finally sort of with some dates
described we're talking about so we

458
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:47,060
communicate consistently alright more to
come with the framework right so exploit

459
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:51,410
availability this is a big one is again
the life cycle changes differently and

460
00:35:51,410 --> 00:35:55,069
when you talk about privatization of all
abilities have been some great calls it

461
00:35:55,069 --> 00:35:57,779
can really and some others have done as
well

462
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:01,750
exploit availability in many cases
community helluva lot more than a sort

463
00:36:01,750 --> 00:36:05,850
of CDSs or things of that nature right
time of exploit exposure what are you

464
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:09,710
doing with their and then there's all
these other variations potential to look

465
00:36:09,710 --> 00:36:15,620
at right so even saying total time to
patch but is that really what it was

466
00:36:15,620 --> 00:36:19,460
should be something different should be
when they were introduced to even talk

467
00:36:19,460 --> 00:36:23,270
about some additional metrics enable
call them you know TrueType were true

468
00:36:23,270 --> 00:36:27,370
total time we're talking about when it
was first introduced in the codebase

469
00:36:27,370 --> 00:36:30,870
right we've seen some bugs that have
come out that have been sitting it in

470
00:36:30,870 --> 00:36:34,190
plain sight for twenty years it was
introduced here hasn't been discovered

471
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:37,820
here so that you can give you some more
clarity on who's looking at these things

472
00:36:37,820 --> 00:36:38,630
what's going on

473
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:42,660
third-party solutions are they getting
involved and then a whole bunch about

474
00:36:42,660 --> 00:36:46,629
the role of calculations how can we take
one on the whole doesn't give you a

475
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:49,740
whole lot of information give you a
little bit but when you start to roll up

476
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:53,049
and understand about that product and it
gives you a lot of course we're gonna

477
00:36:53,050 --> 00:36:57,910
argue their names in the calculations on
this stuff get something out there in a

478
00:36:57,910 --> 00:37:03,049
framework that we can start using
alright so what to talk a little bit

479
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:07,370
about more about sort of that exposure
analysis and then in order to do it and

480
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:13,730
I talked about some scattered so stop
electric it's again this particular

481
00:37:13,730 --> 00:37:17,980
honor this is something that near and
dear we know all the dates and so that's

482
00:37:17,980 --> 00:37:21,810
why I was selected a little bit of odd
confusing one but want to share this

483
00:37:21,810 --> 00:37:26,430
with you see how this happens so this
was actually found by Carson I am he's

484
00:37:26,430 --> 00:37:30,149
the chief research officer at my company
so we know all the gory details on this

485
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:32,630
one but he found a row code issue

486
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:36,710
and a serial driver which you could say
is a librarian or component for them

487
00:37:36,710 --> 00:37:42,210
right because this one vulnerability was
across 11 of their products so this was

488
00:37:42,210 --> 00:37:45,690
an early 2013 and January reported to us

489
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:51,070
certain they were the long as it then
start to liaison with the company's time

490
00:37:51,070 --> 00:37:54,680
and again that's one of the dates will
probably gonna add in here is because

491
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:58,680
there could be a delay time from when
intermedia when you as a researcher

492
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:02,460
reported to sort of important issues
vendor a bug bounty vendor there may be

493
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:05,590
a delay we want to make sure we
understand why that is maybe another day

494
00:38:05,590 --> 00:38:10,380
coming here soon so a little bit later
too long twenty days or so

495
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:14,790
cider confirms the vulnerability and
then a little bit after that a month or

496
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:18,660
so after that day then publishes
security notification with no patches

497
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:22,960
they descend something out to their
customers just saying is there's nothing

498
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:28,150
you can do about it right I see a
certain person going back and forth but

499
00:38:28,150 --> 00:38:32,080
didn't really do anything else nothing
else was published from ICS sir at that

500
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:36,370
point in April was found earlier this
year

501
00:38:36,370 --> 00:38:40,640
details were then published in the bundy
be in some other things as well they're

502
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:43,089
already on a daily basis we're picking
it up

503
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:47,580
alright so great we can calculate all
sorts of metrics in there the beach and

504
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:50,750
stuff they're all the dates are there
that we need to do that but we want to

505
00:38:50,750 --> 00:38:57,700
focus on a couple things so it wasn't
until April 1st 2014 that's what I see

506
00:38:57,700 --> 00:39:02,180
as provided a warning until that time
from the time it was discovered it was

507
00:39:02,180 --> 00:39:08,060
no c2c sign anyone relying on NBD was in
the dark right and even when that

508
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:11,549
information then came out last yes sir
it was wrong they were saying was a

509
00:39:11,550 --> 00:39:13,670
local issue which it wasn't right

510
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:19,829
issue and therefore this CBS scores were
wrong etcetera and what was also really

511
00:39:19,829 --> 00:39:24,940
weird was BC no cash until that time
right and what was really strange about

512
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:29,559
it there was one developed cider
actually develop the past they just

513
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:33,240
chose not to release it to customers
they basically said patches there but

514
00:39:33,240 --> 00:39:35,098
we're not include that we do

515
00:39:35,099 --> 00:39:38,520
irrelevant to another version that we're
gonna release so again you start to

516
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,859
think about this there may be a fix for
the issue but your vendors not even let

517
00:39:41,859 --> 00:39:49,410
you get to it so again reminder as well
as Billy was discovered January 5th 2013

518
00:39:49,410 --> 00:39:56,640
ICS April Fools Day imagine that a 2014
release is it that so when we start to

519
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:59,910
look at some of our calculations you're
saying here the total time the patches

520
00:39:59,910 --> 00:40:07,160
451 days ok now why does this matter is
beat him you know gives these these

521
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:11,240
metrics of time to passion total time to
patch so they're not saying hey the

522
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:15,098
products greater it's bad but there
again talking about the vendor

523
00:40:15,099 --> 00:40:19,809
capabilities the response capabilities
to these issues unfortunately right now

524
00:40:19,809 --> 00:40:25,339
not that many information is being
provided we're not sure why right why

525
00:40:25,339 --> 00:40:29,859
does an ICS or provide the stuff we
should be asking that we should be

526
00:40:29,859 --> 00:40:35,799
wanting things as with everything we see
that not all abilities are equal and so

527
00:40:35,799 --> 00:40:38,910
it takes a different amount of time but
in general we're seeing that people

528
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:43,609
believe hundred eighty Days is probably
reasonably many people believed to be 90

529
00:40:43,609 --> 00:40:49,009
or less we did a quick calculation using
about two year period for some scattered

530
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:54,230
vulnerabilities 25 vulnerabilities were
analyzed in 14 different vendors on

531
00:40:54,230 --> 00:40:59,359
average that old-time the patch 155 days
with the worst being the one that that

532
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:03,960
Carson discover 451 why is this
important because when you talk to sort

533
00:41:03,960 --> 00:41:07,630
of any energy or scatter people they
always come up and say things like well

534
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:12,349
loved her sister Kourtney requirement
that we have to do our thirty days so

535
00:41:12,349 --> 00:41:16,799
yeah we're really good at catching stuff
30 days that's all our exposures but the

536
00:41:16,799 --> 00:41:18,750
reality is when you look at these things

537
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:23,530
your time of exposure or total time of
exposure is based heavily on your

538
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:27,579
vendors and they were in their response
is there any so this gives you a

539
00:41:27,579 --> 00:41:33,069
different way to look at things what
you're dealing with a few minutes I'm

540
00:41:33,069 --> 00:41:38,599
gonna go fast believe started having
this talk we had a 25 minute talks a lot

541
00:41:38,599 --> 00:41:46,160
last year at black hat and we had a
bunch of vendors in the audience really

542
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:51,750
interested parties were slides and so
like I said earlier we were trying to

543
00:41:51,750 --> 00:41:56,140
help people use this data and their
business and put it to use without a

544
00:41:56,140 --> 00:42:01,420
data scientist to the vulnerability data
is out there it's public it's free if

545
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:05,440
you have a paid annuity feed source
awesome

546
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:10,150
spreadsheet software you really confuse
with Excel probably around it would be

547
00:42:10,150 --> 00:42:17,829
helpful I that is really all you need to
do all of the vulnerability analysis and

548
00:42:17,829 --> 00:42:23,290
trend analysis that we talked about
earlier so we and where the TOC and

549
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:27,670
they've got a pretty mature Security
Response and really security assessment

550
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:33,390
team across the board and they want a
copy of the slides they invited us to

551
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:38,250
come to their internal security
conference they were talking a lot with

552
00:42:38,250 --> 00:42:43,530
her leadership team about security risk
and they discovered just like I had

553
00:42:43,530 --> 00:42:47,210
discovered when I didn't like her legal
team is your friend

554
00:42:47,210 --> 00:42:50,809
crazy I know your legal team is your
friend because they care a lot about

555
00:42:50,809 --> 00:42:55,200
third-party compliance they want to make
sure they're clean and true with all the

556
00:42:55,200 --> 00:42:59,680
legal agreements so if a developer just
implemented a liar and forgot to

557
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:00,500
document

558
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:06,270
your legal team may be able to help you
get funding for things that you need to

559
00:43:06,270 --> 00:43:09,920
monitor that better because you can't
fix something quickly if you don't know

560
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:15,180
all the places you use it going on I
Easter egg hunt looking for where you've

561
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:20,250
implemented OpenSSL winners are hardly
it happening you need to know exactly

562
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:27,110
where it is and so they like i said im
injuries and response team what they did

563
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:32,450
was they added proactive evaluation and
rating and approval of third-party

564
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:39,169
libraries to now wants to the library
they have a essentially a dictionary or

565
00:43:39,170 --> 00:43:40,330
a playbook

566
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:44,390
hear the things that are approved for
use in these situations here things are

567
00:43:44,390 --> 00:43:48,650
approved for use in other situations
that are not approved for use because

568
00:43:48,650 --> 00:43:53,990
we're not gonna take on the security
risk and as I mentioned legal team gave

569
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:58,359
them funding to implement a source code
scanning tool that would tell them what

570
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:04,810
library news what they're doing loads
came with it they could really quickly

571
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:07,700
when that new advisory team now go
figure out exactly where they had to

572
00:44:07,700 --> 00:44:15,700
patch so you don't get a lot of really
great stuff to move the ball downfield

573
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:20,399
and managing their third party library
risk in terms of partnering with dead

574
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:26,630
teens active testing you know you can't
just has to your native code if you're

575
00:44:26,630 --> 00:44:30,920
taking on a third-party library it's
yours to have and to hold now so you

576
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:32,960
need to start contributing back

577
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:37,270
and actually testing laboratories well
up streaming vulnerabilities to that

578
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:45,160
library vendor make sure that that that
state securities you're using it quick

579
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:50,779
action in response we started giving the
stock last year focused on security

580
00:44:50,780 --> 00:44:54,619
response helping Security Response Teams
talk to their development teams about

581
00:44:54,619 --> 00:45:01,400
catching libraries but the reality is
where he's created nine and

582
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:05,750
implementation of your security
development lifecycle where are they

583
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:11,599
identified verification and usually in
your response be there for you release

584
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:17,650
the product and your external security
research community does your solid help

585
00:45:17,650 --> 00:45:23,010
you find out all those long ago he
didn't know you had a third-party

586
00:45:23,010 --> 00:45:29,580
libraries because Boehner abilities are
being identified all the time and so you

587
00:45:29,580 --> 00:45:33,920
could designer application using library
version one point for point six and

588
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:38,250
designed by the time you get to release
their up to one point four point nine

589
00:45:38,250 --> 00:45:40,560
and he kept up with it

590
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:44,450
have you been updating your library
during development and changing your

591
00:45:44,450 --> 00:45:48,129
design assumption to go with the new
library because you've got an earful

592
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:53,190
their duties taxes so that's the first
call to action don't think of library

593
00:45:53,190 --> 00:45:58,589
management as a response issue it's all
trust ya second thing prioritization

594
00:45:58,589 --> 00:46:04,330
matters if you have a hundred and fifty
vulnerabilities over the CDI 7.5 and

595
00:46:04,330 --> 00:46:08,839
above summer intern we found some are
externally reported from finders or

596
00:46:08,839 --> 00:46:13,880
security researchers is there more
commonly referred to some third-party

597
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:21,450
libraries your abilities but say they're
15 Dec tasks week you even know how many

598
00:46:21,450 --> 00:46:22,460
security

599
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:30,470
tax you fix week what do you think's 1st
highest median score first in first

600
00:46:30,470 --> 00:46:39,810
class in class but externally know if
you need a clear prioritization model

601
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:43,650
because intelligent prioritization
reduces your risk in those libraries and

602
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:48,869
so all of the data with you today the
work we're doing the trikes you create

603
00:46:48,869 --> 00:46:52,940
heat am not just on availability by
vulnerability basis and and he gave his

604
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:58,349
duties specific examples today but
that's when restarting we need more data

605
00:46:58,349 --> 00:47:03,990
we need more dialogue about how to build
this so that we can take it up to the

606
00:47:03,990 --> 00:47:09,009
vendor level is a on the whole looking
at the body of the liabilities that this

607
00:47:09,010 --> 00:47:12,910
vendor was responsible for years with
their time of exposure is here with

608
00:47:12,910 --> 00:47:16,980
their responsiveness is this is a mature
help your organization or they're kind

609
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:25,680
of languishing I just like animals and
if they get actively managed service

610
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:32,290
understand what third party libraries
you're using and where treat those

611
00:47:32,290 --> 00:47:37,849
libraries with as much diligence is your
native code used data go talk to your

612
00:47:37,849 --> 00:47:42,339
leadership team about that larry we just
adopted they had this many

613
00:47:42,339 --> 00:47:46,700
vulnerabilities last year thats X
percent more vulnerabilities and we had

614
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:52,640
last year with our current dev team how
are we going to do that how we gonna fix

615
00:47:52,640 --> 00:47:56,779
that do we need more resources to we
need to plan our schedules differently

616
00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:00,040
had that conversation to make sure
you're spending resources on the most

617
00:48:00,040 --> 00:48:00,970
important thing

618
00:48:00,970 --> 00:48:06,598
thing and then work with vendors who
care about security I guess that it's

619
00:48:06,599 --> 00:48:11,230
not just about all alone about
responsiveness it's about they clearly

620
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:13,260
make security a priority

621
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:17,780
testing through their security
advisories you know what a secure

622
00:48:17,780 --> 00:48:25,480
organization culture of looks like look
for that in your vendors and try to

623
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:31,480
collect more data on the date metrics
and the more data we can get the better

624
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,750
we can measure these things and please
please please get in touch with us if

625
00:48:34,750 --> 00:48:38,830
you would like to work with us on the
town or if you have feedback about this

626
00:48:38,830 --> 00:48:46,119
talk more about B town we would love to
hear it I just got 20 signs I think

627
00:48:46,119 --> 00:48:51,920
we're gonna have any questions timer be
done done done done
