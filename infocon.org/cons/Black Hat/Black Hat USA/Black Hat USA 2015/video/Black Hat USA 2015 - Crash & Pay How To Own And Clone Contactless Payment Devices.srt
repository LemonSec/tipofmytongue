1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,810
during the session court crash in a
morning conan payment devices with Peter

2
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:15,389
will feel more so please give him a warm
round of applause thank you thank you

3
00:00:15,389 --> 00:00:21,490
today I'll be working on contact
contactless card to buy clothes and most

4
00:00:21,490 --> 00:00:28,959
specifically devices were you doing
payments through them so for my gender

5
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,250
for this toll will be going through the
basics of payment transaction

6
00:00:33,250 --> 00:00:40,920
contactless the attacks are out there
what how they buy ski interact quickly

7
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:49,149
how you can clone a mastercard or visa
cod the issues in a payment

8
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:54,850
a little bit on apple pie and try to
cover the tools of using software

9
00:00:54,850 --> 00:01:03,340
developed in how I've learnt the
subjects like a thing in this area is

10
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:11,320
the definitions in payments you get a
lot of acronyms defined in a transaction

11
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:18,250
to kiss became ones the eighties say the
application transaction counter so this

12
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:24,270
is a monotonic counter which is used to
denote the number of transactions that

13
00:01:24,270 --> 00:01:28,979
God has produced so this is a fairly
important number in the payment system

14
00:01:28,979 --> 00:01:34,860
to track roller to track the current use
of the cut and it's used in the

15
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:42,880
calculation of programs and CBA coat the
second definition easy unpredictable

16
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:50,429
number so this is a random number or
account or a combination of a tight

17
00:01:50,430 --> 00:01:57,140
encounter used in transactions to try
and prevent cloning of transactions and

18
00:01:57,140 --> 00:02:05,780
cards and generally introduced security
to advise and final one really to not

19
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:10,628
sure this will be the same a baby or
dynamic CVB coats were all fairly

20
00:02:10,628 --> 00:02:12,799
familiar with save a codes

21
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,330
there what you enter in on when you
doing an online purchase the print on

22
00:02:18,330 --> 00:02:23,880
the back of a car these code I used to
ensure that the track Dada has been

23
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:34,359
changed and used to prevent and detect
any fraud I get now

24
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:40,150
basic payment transaction flow from a
card for this told I'm gonna go home or

25
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:45,820
at a higher level than normal for a
contactless cuts the low level stuff is

26
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:52,850
similar across all ranges of cops you'll
find that type I and type a standard ISO

27
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:57,910
cots at this level with the payment
transaction it doesn't matter what type

28
00:02:57,910 --> 00:03:06,910
of cod at this point it is we're going
high level but in a transaction that the

29
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:12,780
initial transaction is old generated
from temple to the tamil is the is the

30
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:18,800
item that by tree Dr paiement flow it
tells the cob what it needs and what to

31
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:27,470
do and what to return the car responds
back we've filled determining on what

32
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:32,359
the actual command from the terminal was
so this can be for example a list of

33
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:40,430
tags for information for a transaction
or C BB codes or static records

34
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:46,550
delivered from the cod in this case you
see the initial transaction flow this is

35
00:03:46,550 --> 00:03:53,070
the same ol pretty much all NBA payment
cards say he you've got the Select

36
00:03:53,070 --> 00:04:00,060
payment systems environment command this
is standard across all mastercard Visa

37
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:09,160
American Express cards in the NFC
specification this is where the terminal

38
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:14,250
is indicating it wants to use a payment
cod and it wants to use the payment

39
00:04:14,250 --> 00:04:19,820
system on because the console respond
back with its payment directory

40
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:23,270
this is indicating what the cuts
supports

41
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:30,549
so we can support only upon the Catalan
the support one type of account and only

42
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:37,169
a debit or credit account for example
but it is out there in terms of God can

43
00:04:37,169 --> 00:04:43,620
be a debit and credit card integrated
into one in this case this card was on

44
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:47,940
their credit cards so basically
responding back with the MasterCard I

45
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:56,069
think the terminal then select that
application I day and then be sent back

46
00:04:56,069 --> 00:05:04,349
a few tax required by the terminal to
undergo and verify transaction details

47
00:05:04,349 --> 00:05:11,030
so this is the FCI the fall control
control information that the selected

48
00:05:11,030 --> 00:05:16,840
application I day and it paid off which
is a processing data options list as

49
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,810
well as provide a list of Canada listed
Dada that the terminal Nature Center the

50
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:27,479
card to Palma transaction things like
what the cot reports while the

51
00:05:27,479 --> 00:05:35,289
transaction premise i buy on they get
processing options list uses the page

52
00:05:35,289 --> 00:05:41,568
also lists and the terminal will do all
these bills together in the case of a

53
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:48,009
mascot transaction you'll not only find
that 20 blank field so that I D 300 in

54
00:05:48,009 --> 00:05:53,270
the case of the visa cod it's a number
of the field in this generally looking

55
00:05:53,270 --> 00:05:58,190
at what the terminal support in terms of
the transaction currency code

56
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:04,870
unpredictable numbers that kind of thing
they can't respond to it the application

57
00:06:04,870 --> 00:06:14,569
and the application follow the AIP is a
set of bit that indicate what the cup

58
00:06:14,569 --> 00:06:19,900
supports so what made the cut support in
terms of the verification does it

59
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:25,340
support backwards compatibility mode
that kind of thing and after this we

60
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:29,270
generally go and stop Brady static
records from the cod so in this case

61
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:34,729
we're doing the raid record 11 catches
shortfall indicate Awan

62
00:06:34,729 --> 00:06:40,719
track record one and you can see he that
we've got a lot of Dada coming back from

63
00:06:40,719 --> 00:06:42,789
the cod so full

64
00:06:42,789 --> 00:06:47,740
this selected in the NBA standard normal
you'll find this is where you get your

65
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:53,639
track one Dada magnetic stripe equipment
out of that kind of thing from the cops

66
00:06:53,639 --> 00:07:01,889
came and pretty much the same across all
branches

67
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:08,020
mascot mag stripe transaction we perform
a cryptographic checksum ought to this

68
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:14,210
so this is specific for us to cut
operation Muscat mag stripe transaction

69
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:19,979
is a legacy mode that will discuss
further on where we're trying to

70
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:28,110
integrate a all the system into you and
bassist and into older payment networks

71
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:34,699
said he was looking at generating a
cryptographic checksum myself the

72
00:07:34,699 --> 00:07:40,550
unpredictable number which is in the
raid on the terminal the temples and the

73
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:46,349
unpredictable number which is full but
the cop and sent back the say they say

74
00:07:46,349 --> 00:07:52,748
free which is a dynamic CVC code and the
application transaction counter saw this

75
00:07:52,749 --> 00:07:58,879
point the Cinemax Dr Muscat max right
transaction you finish the payment flow

76
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,139
what the temporal databases bundle this
together

77
00:08:02,139 --> 00:08:09,370
place it into track data and send it off
to your payment processor authorized

78
00:08:09,370 --> 00:08:18,550
action now the second type of support
mode in moscow is an end ship to port

79
00:08:18,550 --> 00:08:24,949
and shipping is a cut-down version of
your card you're a MBA or chip card

80
00:08:24,949 --> 00:08:32,010
design safety we have to read a lot more
information to verify the transaction so

81
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:34,130
here we are eating a lot more records

82
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:42,439
records records these generally you can
see here that you're sending public a

83
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:48,770
and certificates and signed out at this
point so I hear the temple is requesting

84
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:56,120
the I face a public case the ice a
public aid is used to encrypt and create

85
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:02,730
a challenge which is then sent in the
transaction as well and verified this

86
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:08,020
ensures that nothing has changed on the
card and is fairly standard EN V process

87
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:16,740
over-all that final thing with a friend
and chip transaction is that you

88
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:23,230
generate the application cryptogram the
application cryptogram he is a signature

89
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:29,980
performed by the ICC private k intent to
the terminal for each transaction

90
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:34,260
the idea behind this is to ensure that
you put a dynamic signature on the data

91
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:41,020
sent from the cod and ensure that the
transaction amount guarantees the

92
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:50,189
application transaction counter or all
side in a transaction so the issue with

93
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:55,940
this is that you need to have too much
in a mascot in this case you had a

94
00:09:55,940 --> 00:10:01,000
legacy mode and the new remote the new
emerged generally is the most safe mode

95
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:08,600
but requires a lot more information to
be sent over a while now

96
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,880
different kind of attacks that are out
there in terms of what is realistic and

97
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:17,300
what is more theoretical

98
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:22,180
K tack is really though one that is the
most used is actually just got out of

99
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:26,939
the mouth the thing with contactless
cards is you don't generally have the

100
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:34,880
authorized authorization but the
authentication on whether or not so you

101
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:39,530
don't have to enter a PIN number for
example to use it you just have to tap

102
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:45,230
and go to use the money and generally
this is the major fall we've been

103
00:10:45,230 --> 00:10:45,800
hearing about

104
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:54,219
in terms of police being worried about
the Scots however you are limited by the

105
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:57,240
transaction amounts with these kind of
hot as well

106
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:03,940
sawyer at twenty pounds in the United
Kingdom I did all those in Australia and

107
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:08,660
in the USI think it's $20 before you
have to insert the cut so you generally

108
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:16,040
have a limit on the amount of losses you
can take out of a cot the second bomb

109
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:22,480
attack is a relay attack in an AMB
system you can't you don't have any

110
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:31,180
bounding properties so someone can read
and write the transaction go across to

111
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:40,069
countenance to another terminal they
talked about and 2007 and 2012 and

112
00:11:40,070 --> 00:11:46,380
there's a new talkin 2015 on how to do
rely attacks they're fairly simple where

113
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:51,410
you're just taking a cod emulating a
temple sending it through the Internet

114
00:11:51,410 --> 00:11:56,130
to another device and then the other
person needs to be at the payment device

115
00:11:56,130 --> 00:12:01,149
to make that payment at the time so you
can't store and forward transactions you

116
00:12:01,149 --> 00:12:06,490
need to actually do them in real time to
actually perform this kind of fraud that

117
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:13,020
kind of difficult in terms of being
worried about it that's really the two

118
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:20,959
major types of fraud you see in systems
solutions to these kind of things you

119
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:26,410
want to use a phone apple pie with a
thumbprint or an example is in Australia

120
00:12:26,410 --> 00:12:32,430
if you do multiple contactless
transactions it'll prompt you for two

121
00:12:32,430 --> 00:12:39,819
ntop during that transaction and other
ways to make the use it instead the cod

122
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:47,480
and use the cheap interface as well you
can also block the car just by using tin

123
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:51,790
foil or alpha oil on the car that blocks
enough to signal really that no one

124
00:12:51,790 --> 00:12:56,349
really can rate it would be appalled at
the key thing with these cottages that

125
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:01,250
you can't turn them off when you're
you've got them in your wallet

126
00:13:01,250 --> 00:13:10,760
shield them simply or cut a hole in the
lining this talk has really inspired by

127
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:18,760
a lot of the information coming out with
people saying you can climb these cuts I

128
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:24,439
wanted basically talked about that in
terms of what can you really can not

129
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:30,820
much was no I thought that there was
enough protections in place and the

130
00:13:30,820 --> 00:13:37,120
cottage ending well night that you
couldn't the reason for this is that the

131
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,300
chip cut into fights in the end it's the
interfaces can be sorted and many high

132
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:48,109
security module they really well tested
they've got a Lowes a small attack

133
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:53,360
surface and they're pretty heavily lab
tested in terms of the card

134
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:59,200
manufacturing showed up semi formal
design side channel attacks analysis and

135
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:04,640
very small amount of API you can access
in terms of buzzing in that kind of area

136
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:12,640
you've also got cryptographic aids
embedded in these cuts and these cases

137
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:20,170
generally you arrived for that cod to
ensure that even if you break up in the

138
00:14:20,170 --> 00:14:24,750
cotton time the case you wanna get the
case for that cod not across the whole

139
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:31,690
range of devices initially but dynamics
and signatures on transactions as well

140
00:14:31,690 --> 00:14:40,240
so I he is the list of different fields
used in the same chip mode or the end

141
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:46,090
the combined data authentication modes
and you can kind of say there's a lot of

142
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:51,050
information provided and signed in the
in the information that seemed to offer

143
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:58,680
the payment system amounts unpredictable
numbers transaction areas and dynamic

144
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:04,769
numbers as well in a signature they do
have issues in terms of

145
00:15:04,769 --> 00:15:09,970
for all the cryptography is out there
with the talks about gardens used

146
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:17,160
because these systems were proposed and
written up fifteen twenty years ago you

147
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:24,189
looking at cryptography and ashes that a
generally not saying it's being ideal

148
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:30,629
for use in a cod you'll be using shower
on hash and normally the private keys

149
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:38,199
will be an RSA 1024 PK and that's fairly
fixed in the industry and probably the

150
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:46,109
greatest thing that can be covered for
another day so i thought well you

151
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:50,549
probably can't do it the way the
standard written when you go through the

152
00:15:50,549 --> 00:15:55,989
process but things fairly well put
together intensive cryptography in the

153
00:15:55,989 --> 00:16:01,999
operations used but then I found a paper
by Michael Rowland and at all which

154
00:16:01,999 --> 00:16:08,189
discussed transaction climbing and more
specifically around how you can store

155
00:16:08,189 --> 00:16:13,849
and repo transactions from cards and
especially contact us cuts the reason

156
00:16:13,850 --> 00:16:17,910
behind this is because you need to have
these legacy marks to support older

157
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:25,029
networks and payment processes and
they're such the MasterCard Visa the

158
00:16:25,029 --> 00:16:30,619
large companies have implemented these
legacy modes to ensure that we can use

159
00:16:30,619 --> 00:16:37,049
our card we're about without too much
hassle an issue with a legacy mode is

160
00:16:37,049 --> 00:16:42,939
that they're very significantly cut down
compared to a full chip p.m. a solution

161
00:16:42,939 --> 00:16:49,189
so they'd like a scene out in moscow
it's called the mag stripe mode of these

162
00:16:49,189 --> 00:16:59,219
are it's a dynamic CVB or more
moderately CBN 17 boat

163
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:06,659
declining transactions how would be
kinda transaction unless you want to

164
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:12,559
generate track data that similar to a
system so in this mode we're basically

165
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:18,359
making a dynamic survey by inserting
that into regular track data and sending

166
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:26,549
that off so traditionally you'll have a
track field as pictured below where

167
00:17:26,549 --> 00:17:32,070
you've got named discussion I dot the
service code in the case of NFC card

168
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:36,928
you'll find that the names normally
blanked out and your discussion exotic

169
00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:43,669
is used to store the values to calculate
the dynamic signature with the code so

170
00:17:43,669 --> 00:17:47,780
you got your application transaction
counter you've got the unpredictable

171
00:17:47,780 --> 00:17:55,629
number and you have a issue
initialisation value you encrypt they's

172
00:17:55,630 --> 00:18:02,210
you dan truncated and you fit into the
discretionary Dada off the track the

173
00:18:02,210 --> 00:18:06,799
issue with this track Datuk is that it's
a limited field would generally the

174
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:11,400
because you're using alt systems and all
equipment they'll have a fixed-length

175
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:17,169
normally I do but also lower than that
depending on how they processed

176
00:18:17,169 --> 00:18:21,380
transactions so you can't throw a whole
heap of information into the track Dada

177
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:27,150
you kind of need two truncated and
processes so it gets performed correctly

178
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:36,110
the issue with the mask max right now it
came about because of these limitations

179
00:18:36,110 --> 00:18:42,000
unpredictable number when I originally
thought was secure I thought that was a

180
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:48,169
pioneering field where we will find
because we've got full body and you

181
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:57,059
looking at 4.2 billion also the fall
this fall by twice-weekly then has to be

182
00:18:57,059 --> 00:18:58,700
binary coded decimal

183
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:04,380
then to the 800 million that's fine
however

184
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:09,660
the issue is you need to also limit the
size of the data in the magnetic stripe

185
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:15,930
what this means is you limited by the
number of fields you can use this case

186
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:21,350
you've got a UN length of two in that
case that tend to the two values which

187
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:29,250
means there are 0 to 99 numbers for the
unpredictable number and this is the

188
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:33,390
issue on the car so the issue is set
these fields on the card when they

189
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:40,100
actually generate the area so in this
case it the K track 10 said the total

190
00:19:40,100 --> 00:19:45,040
size of the bit modest the T track which
is the number of between the panes set

191
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:49,930
and that gives you how much room you
have for the UN field in the

192
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:57,640
discretionary Dada so this is why the
issue comes around because of the fact

193
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:02,240
you're taking what is seen as being a
random number and you're reducing the

194
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:06,250
length of it to fit in these all the
systems it actually introduces the

195
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:16,240
ability to the client transactions

196
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:24,670
transaction records you can then
generated dictionary based on the

197
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:29,830
computer cryptographic checksum said
this is where you basically send a whole

198
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:36,240
heap of these commands to the cot when
it's in the rate of field such that you

199
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,040
can then generate a dictionary to look
up the appropriate field in the future

200
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:48,649
this will increment application
transaction counts but as I've tested in

201
00:20:48,650 --> 00:20:56,110
the actual field you it doesn't actually
matter inside said payment processes you

202
00:20:56,110 --> 00:21:01,379
then flipped the same chip support bit
this is tagged I D two on the card that

203
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:06,390
indicated the car only support a legacy
mode in this case so on the Android

204
00:21:06,390 --> 00:21:10,420
application I made to do this I just
flip that bit and now it will be

205
00:21:10,420 --> 00:21:16,510
defaulting to that area at least I can
go home and replayed the store records

206
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:19,670
so I initiate the transaction

207
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:25,780
help my phone up the application that
looks up the unpredictable number in the

208
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:30,110
dictionary and replace it back for the
transaction and then you click the

209
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:35,240
picture of how long does it normally
take to actually clone a lot of these

210
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:40,670
people in this case I made application
here to actually give you the amount of

211
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:45,750
time it normally takes to do this to
calculate the amount of transactions so

212
00:21:45,750 --> 00:21:50,770
few hundred compute cryptographic
checksum takes around about 25 seconds

213
00:21:50,770 --> 00:22:00,059
twenty seconds in the case of 10,000
transactions you looking 25 minutes so

214
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:06,800
this is H time you added extra decimal
place you're adding back to a large

215
00:22:06,800 --> 00:22:12,760
factor of time on to actually climb the
car so hopefully the so I record

216
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:16,610
pre-recorded the demo for this because I
didn't wanna bring the whole time with

217
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:20,709
her this can show you

218
00:22:20,710 --> 00:22:29,020
quickly as I have said this is my
payment card at home and the application

219
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:36,960
on here so I this is just a stock
Android phone he and a program that to

220
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,080
do this dictionary sell them is
generally the dictionary and starting on

221
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:48,418
the data base once it's done and this is
the radar that I bought off ebay so this

222
00:22:48,419 --> 00:22:54,140
is a radical only do mag stripe mode
this is send their random number so I

223
00:22:54,140 --> 00:23:02,659
select the cop believed

224
00:23:02,659 --> 00:23:09,749
the card each that the transaction
simply put that's how quickly you can

225
00:23:09,749 --> 00:23:14,629
actually perform these kind of cloning
and the good thing about it that this

226
00:23:14,629 --> 00:23:19,889
kind of attack is that you get multiple
times to use those records as well

227
00:23:19,889 --> 00:23:25,830
because as long as the fifty terminal
sends out a low random number then

228
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:29,228
you're sending the lower application
transaction counter

229
00:23:29,229 --> 00:23:36,739
found on average I get my be 3 goes out
before it above the application

230
00:23:36,739 --> 00:23:43,639
transaction counter the current cod and
silicon tuner item additionally you can

231
00:23:43,639 --> 00:23:47,949
stop the transaction for example enforce
it and just keep doing transactions over

232
00:23:47,950 --> 00:23:53,739
and over till you hit the random number
you want for the correct generated CVC

233
00:23:53,739 --> 00:24:02,690
code and the issue with this is that
actually built into the mascot system so

234
00:24:02,690 --> 00:24:09,340
this is our p.m. chip requirements and
which was published in 2013 and they

235
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:14,738
required that the unpredictable number
is only must be at least two digits

236
00:24:14,739 --> 00:24:21,489
generally the issue with a condom
requirement is that you can say to get

237
00:24:21,489 --> 00:24:28,389
it but most of the time the issuer will
probably set at two digits cause I read

238
00:24:28,389 --> 00:24:37,269
two digits of saying two three and four
normally for is on a better card you

239
00:24:37,269 --> 00:24:42,509
want afforded to cut for example the
basis for these kind of attacks is that

240
00:24:42,509 --> 00:24:49,389
the ATC the application transaction
counter will jump in the field this

241
00:24:49,389 --> 00:24:55,260
means that you can detect it on the
processing side the issuer

242
00:24:55,260 --> 00:24:58,740
should proper second factor
authentication if that jumps so if

243
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:02,650
you've got a few guys often tries and do
the packet does it tries to do the

244
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:05,790
payment it should go back to the
terminal basically asked for the

245
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:14,930
customer to authorize it using some
other method and generally the payment

246
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:18,710
processes should basically to reject
anything that isn't an inch of

247
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:24,140
transaction at this stage it shouldn't
be that we have to support things like a

248
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:35,180
team of its so the issue of laser that
there are a number of different modes

249
00:25:35,180 --> 00:25:40,830
that I have implemented by the time the
original legacy mode with the dynamics

250
00:25:40,830 --> 00:25:48,120
EV mode and this was updated for the
cryptogram CVN 70 mode it was recognized

251
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:57,090
that that was terribly broken form of
generating a code needed by the PTQ

252
00:25:57,090 --> 00:26:02,209
which is a temple transaction qualified
and this iced tea sets these different

253
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:06,730
mode according to FB terminal support so
he we have a terminal telling you what

254
00:26:06,730 --> 00:26:12,080
it supports area in the case of a day
CVV mode it's a really simple

255
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:17,260
transaction all we do is the
initialisation the selection and we then

256
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:24,120
do the trade record and that will return
tracked with a CVV code embedded in a

257
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:31,760
that should be done at the issue of the
day a day CVV algorithm which was

258
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:37,280
painted is that you can see here there
isn't any random number being input into

259
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:42,190
the algorithm so he will get an
application transaction counter the

260
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:47,550
primary account number of random number
or any randomness to it what this

261
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:51,000
allowed to do his client very easily

262
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:56,530
all you have to do is copy there a trick
up the records set the max right beyond

263
00:26:56,530 --> 00:27:02,170
the terminal terminal to max dried mud
and then you just have to replay the

264
00:27:02,170 --> 00:27:06,530
wrinkles you don't have to generate a
hundred different transactions or have a

265
00:27:06,530 --> 00:27:07,399
jump

266
00:27:07,399 --> 00:27:15,518
application transaction count as a lot
quicker than the other day my say he

267
00:27:15,519 --> 00:27:25,409
said Mr using a common basic up bought
this prepaid cod to test with and

268
00:27:25,409 --> 00:27:30,989
actually doesn't rate very well we want
to actually get does connected to the

269
00:27:30,989 --> 00:27:37,950
radar it just looks like it's a lot
quicker and the thing with this card is

270
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:41,919
that it's a static CD pays well they're
not even dynamically doing the same a

271
00:27:41,919 --> 00:27:48,190
bay they are they are basically sending
it to aesthetic value and in vases

272
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:49,690
documentation that was fine

273
00:27:49,690 --> 00:27:58,070
fortunately they're facing out these
modes on base inside this was written i

274
00:27:58,070 --> 00:28:04,229
think is 2000 and I have phasing out the
cryptogram vision forward your numbers

275
00:28:04,229 --> 00:28:11,809
keeping is the issue of the card can
disable these modes so they are disabled

276
00:28:11,809 --> 00:28:16,749
generally in a Visa Debit Card Visa
debit card I have one actually support

277
00:28:16,749 --> 00:28:25,089
max tribal legacy not initially they
made new mode called CBN 17 so this is

278
00:28:25,089 --> 00:28:31,418
where we actually generating a
cryptogram separate which is an embedded

279
00:28:31,419 --> 00:28:38,540
in the track Dada so we have to send
this separate from the command

280
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:44,570
in these issues generally you have a
huge amount of problem with the

281
00:28:44,570 --> 00:28:48,840
terminals the issue with a Seminoles
generally opt for contactless terminals

282
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:54,629
for this stand alone and beat ship
terminals is that there's a lack of

283
00:28:54,630 --> 00:28:59,130
physical security protections in them is
like a software security protections in

284
00:28:59,130 --> 00:28:59,780
them

285
00:28:59,780 --> 00:29:07,139
the device I got off a bye in this case
it had exposed JTAG port the

286
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:13,940
manufacturers not enough to send me the
firmware which was unencrypted not

287
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:19,280
signed and so I can change anything on
that VMware and uploaded to the device

288
00:29:19,280 --> 00:29:23,960
and have it do what I want simply put
and this is common across most of the

289
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:30,720
contactless readers you'll say they are
off the shelf processes with inbuilt

290
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:36,160
debugging facilities that are easy to
access there's nothing really to stop

291
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:43,420
you from changing the code on them
without any effort initially

292
00:29:43,420 --> 00:29:48,650
unpredictable numbers are real issues
with the leader in technical fall in

293
00:29:48,650 --> 00:29:54,950
peace security however they're not
defined to be from a cartographic random

294
00:29:54,950 --> 00:30:00,040
numbers source this is only bought up
think it was two years ago where a note

295
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:06,600
was added due to these issues from DMV
car moved to the standard for MBA

296
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:11,790
transactions in that it was suggested
maybe you should be taking this from a

297
00:30:11,790 --> 00:30:16,280
random number source but even to this
day they don't taste the source of

298
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:21,000
numbers and is no requirement when you
are certifying a chemical that it is

299
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:30,540
using a proper cryptographic random
numbers source now cover apple pie

300
00:30:30,540 --> 00:30:38,040
generally as we all know around the last
year or so is the dominant form in the

301
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:46,000
USW contactless transactions the hard
way used fairly nice system

302
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:53,660
compared to a lot of others are saying
keeping is this NXP 6518 ship this has a

303
00:30:53,660 --> 00:30:59,410
process on there to perform the
contactless transactions and separately

304
00:30:59,410 --> 00:31:04,180
it also has a secure element chip in the
package for the secure element ship

305
00:31:04,180 --> 00:31:07,760
holds all your sensitive data so this is
a way of putting on a cryptographic keys

306
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:13,530
and information that is read by the
contactless processed and sent to the

307
00:31:13,530 --> 00:31:21,139
terminal and these are all controlled
through the subway on the device so the

308
00:31:21,140 --> 00:31:27,570
case of apple pie you going through past
get to the frameworks to the demons to

309
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:39,120
the hardware drivers which interact over
the bus to the chip on the device key

310
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:43,889
thing is really that the device he is
separate in terms of how it does

311
00:31:43,890 --> 00:31:51,900
transaction he operates on a time as in
the transaction all occurs in the chip

312
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:57,800
once the once the iOS tells it to a
transaction it'll do it by itself and

313
00:31:57,800 --> 00:32:03,190
send back the results and as such we
find that it is susceptible to these

314
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:09,150
kind of attacks as well because the
device the API said it looked at

315
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:14,440
don't actually indicate any protections
in the it's all left up to the code that

316
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:17,960
is not written by Apple that it's
actually written by an Expedia on the

317
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:24,830
chips and that code was developed in
2010 off the top of my head by staff the

318
00:32:24,830 --> 00:32:34,320
sources on the Android area so they're
fairly similar to pick a payment taken

319
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,040
as well

320
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:41,200
interesting thing about this is it's a
AC cryptid token

321
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:48,340
and you've got and a daughter in here so
this is what is returned from the Secure

322
00:32:48,340 --> 00:32:54,149
Element after a transaction the
encrypted payment data is where you got

323
00:32:54,149 --> 00:32:59,178
your token expiry date and you're in big
data that can be sent over the internet

324
00:32:59,179 --> 00:33:05,320
and verified by the issuer as well as a
separate verification code area they

325
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:12,250
find that the one city trip that payment
Dada it's actually just gotta invade tax

326
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:18,860
that was responded back from the devise
those playing around our fans demand we

327
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:24,049
can dump the approved I days later the
cod being loaded into a secure element

328
00:33:24,049 --> 00:33:29,408
in this case this is the test cards that
were loaded onto the device when I

329
00:33:29,409 --> 00:33:40,920
bought it from the shop

330
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:48,750
replace attacks it is depend on the
carpet flooded pretty sure visa debit

331
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:53,220
cards but other credit cards will be
because you need to have things like a

332
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:57,560
scene modes but the key thing is with
the apple pie system is that it's really

333
00:33:57,560 --> 00:34:00,710
hot you need to full someone to do the
transaction

334
00:34:00,710 --> 00:34:04,950
you need to enable the cod to do the
transaction and scan it to performance

335
00:34:04,950 --> 00:34:13,340
just i jailbreak your device if you want
your payments kind of thing

336
00:34:13,340 --> 00:34:18,240
additionally if you're either contact us
limit they offer this consumer device

337
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:24,529
Carvalho verification method which
basically gives you a separate method

338
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:30,140
over the internet which is in
conjunction with your traditional TV

339
00:34:30,139 --> 00:34:36,969
because it's so that made him extra mode
can also use this CD CBM to ensure that

340
00:34:36,969 --> 00:34:41,389
they know that transactions going
through generally apple pie stuff I find

341
00:34:41,389 --> 00:34:47,339
it a lot more secure than your cards
that have been sent out to you

342
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:55,020
due to the fact the cards are always on
so quickly I will go through tools I

343
00:34:55,020 --> 00:35:01,450
used this is common to all the way back
a great little radar and I've written a

344
00:35:01,450 --> 00:35:08,350
lot of software for it to end any like
card transactions are used to sniff

345
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:13,520
transactions in like a low level stuff
but generally want Assad to the

346
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:17,230
transaction area it's a lot more fiddly
and

347
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:23,490
code for the coast of these and they and
it's a payment stuff isn't really there

348
00:35:23,490 --> 00:35:31,990
at the moment the best option is an
Android phone with integrated NSA this

349
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:37,450
was really good in terms of development
of this stuff because it offers the

350
00:35:37,450 --> 00:35:42,270
cadre data and an emulator and
additionally you get a lot of the

351
00:35:42,270 --> 00:35:48,970
support for not having to integrate the
initial transaction the cod so what this

352
00:35:48,970 --> 00:35:55,290
gives you is the ability just the same
packet Lajpat of Dada throw it at the at

353
00:35:55,290 --> 00:36:01,200
the chip in the Android system and that
was just emulate it out for you in that

354
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:08,799
area so software developed over this
area e editions for our affiliate

355
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:14,609
largest all these give you the ability
to transactions and test them for

356
00:36:14,609 --> 00:36:20,359
yourself so this will do a transaction
for a magnetic stripe reader and chip

357
00:36:20,359 --> 00:36:24,650
they say they vary and I'll spit out all
the values and you can start to check

358
00:36:24,650 --> 00:36:29,369
and say that the transaction counter
incremental something static gives you

359
00:36:29,369 --> 00:36:34,730
all the information that you might not
get from a commercial operator at the

360
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:41,720
box other ones of funding program have
made for the Android as well

361
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:47,379
uploaded it yet but it works pretty well
got a buzzing and going over and over

362
00:36:47,380 --> 00:36:53,960
again and crashing pretty well this
means that kind of working on it still

363
00:36:53,960 --> 00:37:03,320
is I'm really happy with at the moment
how it's coming out

364
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:14,010
farley looking through these areas takes
into account the legacy mode need to be

365
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:18,480
removed from literally systems I was
able to call my own cod use it in

366
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:24,440
Australia and that was a bit shocking to
me considering how much smaller the

367
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:29,370
number of banks and payment processes we
have and the end how long we've had and

368
00:37:29,370 --> 00:37:34,220
they were closed in a payment system
that's why I think in the USA it's

369
00:37:34,220 --> 00:37:40,339
concerning for me in that I have a gut
feeling that it's a lot more of the

370
00:37:40,340 --> 00:37:46,550
issue in the us- due to existing
technology and the love of Mac stripes

371
00:37:46,550 --> 00:37:55,340
in in the payment systems here

372
00:37:55,340 --> 00:38:01,100
things that you can't clone cuts
economically but you can climb

373
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:03,440
transactions

374
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:10,370
support reduces your security in terms
of transactions random numbers in these

375
00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:16,589
things are really very random
unfortunately and the current stance do

376
00:38:16,590 --> 00:38:24,210
not attack sufficiently my major wise
really around the terminal stuff as well

377
00:38:24,210 --> 00:38:32,900
and how they implement in that area and
social I really wanna kick after apple

378
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:37,580
pie but I can't it's one of the best
method I've seen in terms of

379
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:43,790
implementing these kind of transactions
in that it's very widely supported and

380
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:47,850
works excellently in terms of bomb

381
00:38:47,850 --> 00:39:00,069
easy to use and general that's what you
need that area so I think that's all I

382
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:04,280
can say thank you and the same any
questions
