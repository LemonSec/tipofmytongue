1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,020
Thank You Black Hat for having me it is
excellent to be here among all you

2
00:00:05,020 --> 00:00:12,750
wonderful people again I apologize my
voice is a little rough today but it's a

3
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:18,000
good thing that I have a voice at all I
did training here black after four days

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:29,470
and it turns out I get really excited
when I talk to people about math and so

5
00:00:29,470 --> 00:00:34,829
it anyway I talk to people big room full
of people that matter four days straight

6
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:38,390
and I'm completely lost my voice but
it's it's coming back to his way back

7
00:00:38,390 --> 00:00:45,600
it's a little intimidating having myself
like $50 there but at least that means

8
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:53,160
that you guys can all see myself and
it's a place that t-shirt

9
00:00:53,160 --> 00:01:01,879
the USA plays started

10
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:09,970
about a year and a half ago and in our
heads and before I get going too much I

11
00:01:09,970 --> 00:01:16,600
want to give you a little a little
caution but a lot less of a caution live

12
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,960
at in so my previous talks about the
project this presentation includes no

13
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,720
content from leaked classified documents
so those of you who were hanging out in

14
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:35,420
the back of the room what are your
biggest day maybe you can sometimes some

15
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:38,840
of the jobs that we've given myself and
others in the end it's a place that

16
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:44,270
project some of these talks have had to
have included lead classified content

17
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:50,570
because this project was inspired in
great part by leaked classified content

18
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:57,460
but today I want to talk about what
we've created in the project and not so

19
00:01:57,460 --> 00:02:04,770
much about what inspired us or anything
that might be troublesome for some

20
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:10,210
people here and it's kind of interesting
actually I think especially if folks in

21
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:15,480
foreign countries I find are quite
intrigued by this whole phenomenon that

22
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:23,049
we get information leaked from the
Government classified information that

23
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:31,780
is and other folks within the government
who have a security clearance are most

24
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:32,410
of the time

25
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:39,890
asked to avoid it to not read it to not
have copies of that leaked content on

26
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:45,880
their computers it creates a
bureaucratic hassles for them and is a

27
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:48,859
violation of rules to

28
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:54,340
to actually have classified content of
their not explicitly authorized for and

29
00:02:54,340 --> 00:03:01,860
so sometimes we have we've seen leaks of
information that is useful to us in the

30
00:03:01,860 --> 00:03:08,060
security community that informs us about
threats that maybe we didn't consider

31
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:14,230
before and we as the security community
as a whole have the benefit to learn

32
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:20,239
something from these leaks and not
talking about learning what our

33
00:03:20,240 --> 00:03:25,400
government is up to I'm talking about
technical learning learning about how

34
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,360
threats that maybe we should be aware of
it maybe we should take into

35
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:34,400
consideration when we're developing
defenses for our own systems and of

36
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,190
course there are many many fine people
working for the government doing good

37
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:38,840
work

38
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:44,370
who are who have their own systems to
defend and tiny tiny fraction of them

39
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:49,120
are able to learn about those threats in
the same way that the rest of us are

40
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:56,620
it's it's a strange thing that in many
cases folks who have a security

41
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:59,209
clearance and being in the dark

42
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:07,280
more than some other folks so sometimes
I set out to tell people about these

43
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,320
leaks or the content of things I've
learned from the leaks rather and

44
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:18,120
sometimes I tried to avoid talking about
those leaks so that I can give

45
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,630
information in general or about the
types of threats that I've learned about

46
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:29,310
from the leaks may be in part but in a
form that can be consumed by folks who

47
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:35,820
are otherwise able to consume the leak
information directly so this

48
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:41,400
presentation includes no leak no content
from leaked classified documents I don't

49
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,810
talk about any details or show any
screenshots from the classified

50
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:48,670
documents but I will mention

51
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:55,650
the leak I'll just talk about it in
general terms a little bit but I'm not

52
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,640
gonna give you any content from that
league so in other words it's only

53
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:15,950
metadata right at the end of 2013 we saw
the league and catalog and this is not a

54
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:19,310
page from the hand catalog this is a
page I did for fun

55
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:25,160
inspired by the end catalog made to look
like a page me and catalog so there's

56
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:31,260
nothing here that actual content from
the and catalog but it looks and a fair

57
00:05:31,260 --> 00:05:37,780
bit like something from the catalog and
it was a leak that contain a bunch of

58
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:47,280
these pages of information the AMT
catalog from the NSA and so this was

59
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:53,229
about a year and a half ago and folks in
the security community had a lot of fun

60
00:05:53,230 --> 00:05:59,000
with going through the the tools in that
catalog which included all kinds of

61
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,360
hardware and software tools that are of
interest to the information security

62
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:13,510
community and and there was it was
interesting I think to see people's

63
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:20,800
reactions to it sometimes folks who were
I think a lot of folks were unsurprised

64
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,600
by a lot of the tools in the catalog
there were a lot of things in there that

65
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:29,950
work capabilities that that the
information security the public

66
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:31,620
information security community

67
00:06:31,620 --> 00:06:36,470
research community the hacker community
we already had a lot of these tools are

68
00:06:36,470 --> 00:06:42,500
things that were somewhat similar to
those tools and we didn't see for the

69
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:46,250
most part a whole lot of her shattering
things in there but it was still pretty

70
00:06:46,250 --> 00:06:53,389
neat to see the stuff that the spooks
use the month my first impression as I

71
00:06:53,389 --> 00:06:57,979
was reading it my very first impression
was that we can do all this stuff

72
00:06:57,979 --> 00:07:03,219
everything in here where we already know
how to do or isn't much of a stretch

73
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:10,570
isn't much of a leap and then my second
impression was kind of like for the few

74
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:16,260
things that were in there that that were
new to me I thought why haven't I seen

75
00:07:16,260 --> 00:07:22,810
these things before this is kind of a
gap may be in the research that there's

76
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:28,030
there and in the the public information
that we have a hacker community in some

77
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:33,130
cases some of the stuff that was in the
air catalog was kind of like well you

78
00:07:33,130 --> 00:07:37,349
look at it and say you have you have any
kind of technical background you look at

79
00:07:37,349 --> 00:07:42,370
it and say yeah that's kind of obvious
that should be possible to do but you

80
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:46,090
know what has anyone actually done it
has anyone showed this stuff at Icahn

81
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:50,669
has anyone written a research paper on
this is particularly techniques and and

82
00:07:50,669 --> 00:07:56,159
in some of the some cases the answer was
no there were things in there that while

83
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:03,870
being unsurprising in some ways or also
knew and then talk about publicly and

84
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:08,970
that was one of the things that inspired
me to start thinking about the NSA

85
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:14,330
playset project and in particular I
wanted to give a talk about how we can

86
00:08:14,330 --> 00:08:23,630
build these tools the same tools like
the nation states use and we can build

87
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:27,770
them ourselves in the open research
community in the hacker community and we

88
00:08:27,770 --> 00:08:31,539
can build them out of open source
hardware we can build them out of open

89
00:08:31,539 --> 00:08:35,830
source software we can build them out of
off the shelf hardware and software

90
00:08:35,830 --> 00:08:42,730
and have easily accessible tools that
people can use at least to serve as a

91
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:49,860
demonstration of threats that folks
might not have considered before and I

92
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:56,700
thought of this and and I did it I ended
up doing a talk last may may have 2014

93
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:04,080
was the first talk on the NSA place and
I K I gave this talk I and it was about

94
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:09,750
here are my ideas I went through the
whole catalog entire catalog and focus

95
00:09:09,750 --> 00:09:16,650
on the hardware tools and I said here's
what we hear what they have and here are

96
00:09:16,650 --> 00:09:20,890
some ideas for how we can build these
things and it was sort of a reprieve

97
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:25,939
project talk it was it was just sharing
my ideas for how these things can be

98
00:09:25,940 --> 00:09:30,790
built but originally I didn't conceive
of the idea that we would actually go

99
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:34,709
and build them necessarily I just wanted
people to be aware that they could be

100
00:09:34,710 --> 00:09:39,440
built so when I was preparing for that
talk with the first thing I did was a

101
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:48,970
female dean peers as the picture I found
on Twitter of him it's the reason I

102
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:54,870
chose this picture is because he's
wearing a park or gtfo t-shirt PRC or

103
00:09:54,870 --> 00:10:00,610
gtfo and and many of you I hope are
familiar with the International Journal

104
00:10:00,610 --> 00:10:02,590
of POC or gtfo

105
00:10:02,590 --> 00:10:12,820
and that this picture was taken years
before the International Journal of beer

106
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:19,560
seizure or gtfo by which I mean to point
out that team is a man ahead of his time

107
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:29,569
and he he had actually coined the term
yet it's a place that also years before

108
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:34,720
and so when I had this idea for this
talk last year I wrote to Dean

109
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:39,920
immediately and I said hey D can I used
the name is a place for this stock and

110
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,800
he said sure

111
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:46,670
and let's start a wiki and let's get
other people involved in this actually

112
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:52,019
build these things and let's just make a
whole lot of fun stuff so it's in great

113
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:57,709
part thanks to deal that many of us have
had joined the project and contributed

114
00:10:57,709 --> 00:11:03,719
in various ways and we've gone way
beyond just thinking about how we can

115
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,600
build tools like the spooks use but
actually building them and so what I'm

116
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,980
here today to do about a year later
after the first and it's a place that

117
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:20,180
talk is to tell you about the things
that we have in fact built this is one

118
00:11:20,180 --> 00:11:25,180
of my favorite ones and this was
presented at DEFCON last year actually I

119
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:34,120
have it in this box up here but it's a
tool called slot screamer that Joe and

120
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:41,339
Miles talked about and it is a PCI PCI
Express attack tool and there are a

121
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:48,959
number of ways it could be used one idea
is that it can be implanted into into a

122
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:59,890
computer and this device allows you to
implement a PCI Express and device that

123
00:11:59,890 --> 00:12:05,610
then has the ability to to for example
access the memory bus on the computer

124
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:12,370
and one of the great things about this
particular implementation is actually

125
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:21,730
the the device that you see on screen
here is a PCI Express to USB 3.0 bridge

126
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:27,820
and it's fascinating it's built on this
interesting chip and you can buy the

127
00:12:27,820 --> 00:12:34,380
board online very easily and it's based
on their chip that serves as a USB

128
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:42,550
device and also as a PCI Express device
which is a little bit funny because it

129
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:49,380
means you can let me be taken attacked
laptop and connect through your

130
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:57,170
attackers USB port to this guy and
control or emulate a PCI Express device

131
00:12:57,170 --> 00:13:01,589
actually in software on your laptop if
you want you don't think I also work the

132
00:13:01,589 --> 00:13:06,130
other way around if you plug this into
the attackers PCI Express slot you can

133
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:11,310
use it as a USB device to attack the USB
host but in the particular

134
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:18,939
implementation Joanne miles showed they
also they did things like put this

135
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:26,270
device into a chassis a thunderbolt PCI
Express chassis and then they were able

136
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:34,220
to from their attack laptop connected
via USB to slot screamer they were then

137
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:43,329
able to implement an attack against
wonderful on a on a system and so they

138
00:13:43,329 --> 00:13:49,989
can just plug into the Thunderbolt port
on a laptop and like reading right its

139
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:57,560
memory which is an extremely powerful
attack and in many cases there are well

140
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,029
it in a growing number of cases there
are actually countermeasures to this

141
00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:06,470
sort of attack on thunderbolt and PCI
Express but there are definitely cases

142
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:13,709
where their devices that are entirely
vulnerable to that kind of thing to all

143
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:18,099
were using at least 44 part of their
attacks inception which has been around

144
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:24,300
for a long time I think originally just
for firewire but and you could do direct

145
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:29,979
memory attacks over a firewire port and
now inception has support for this

146
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:36,930
device Joe just got his chassis and off
the shelf the other day and I downloaded

147
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:40,870
the latest version of Inception and plug
all and it worked perfectly for his demo

148
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:44,250
chuck wagon is a

149
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:50,190
isn't another kind of hardware implant
and the idea here and again this was

150
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:57,530
presented at DEFCON last year by Josh
and Teddy the idea here is to take

151
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:03,480
advantage of a bus on your computer that
a lot of people don't even realize is

152
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:10,840
there it's called i squared senior i2c
and folks who do electronic design he's

153
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:16,440
I do see all the time I've used it on a
corrupt designed for example if you have

154
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:20,290
a couple of different integrated circuit
design aboard and they need to talk to

155
00:15:20,290 --> 00:15:26,969
each other as gracie is one of the
common ways to do that so of course

156
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:34,620
there are i squared C buses on PC
motherboards of all sorts and it's a bus

157
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:39,370
that is generally exposed to the
operating system so like in the Linux

158
00:15:39,370 --> 00:15:44,260
kernel you can you can look at rockwell
system or so I'll system or your deb

159
00:15:44,260 --> 00:15:51,280
file system and you you can find their
faces through the through your kernel to

160
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:56,329
talk to ice cream see devices that are
connected one way or another to your

161
00:15:56,330 --> 00:16:01,020
computer now one thing that a lot of
people don't realize is that some nice

162
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:06,140
greasy buses are exposed on the outside
of your computer including in the form

163
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:13,740
of a couple of games on your VGA cable
if you have a VGA port and there's also

164
00:16:13,740 --> 00:16:19,390
a nicegreat Seabus that's part of the
HDMI standard so if you have an HDMI

165
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:25,720
port on your computer you have external
access physical access to this bus and

166
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:32,820
the idea with chuck wagon was that
that's a convenient interface for if you

167
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:36,410
wanted to build an implant that you
would install and somebody's computer

168
00:16:36,410 --> 00:16:43,140
surreptitiously and you could then
create an interface like a computer

169
00:16:43,140 --> 00:16:49,339
communications interface for malware
that's running on that computer so it's

170
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:51,480
a piece of hardware a little game plan

171
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:59,250
that the Mallorcan talked to over i
squared C and chuck wagon is just got a

172
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:04,939
prototype thing and they decided to
build it using that VGA ports they could

173
00:17:04,939 --> 00:17:12,130
just the tax it externally to any
computer that has a VGA port the end

174
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:17,699
what they added to have the capability
that they were giving to the system was

175
00:17:17,699 --> 00:17:21,839
at communication so they have a for
example they they showed how they could

176
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:29,520
put a GSM GSM modem and their data
connection cellular data connection and

177
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:35,629
a lot of malware to have this back
channel covert channel over a cellular

178
00:17:35,630 --> 00:17:42,010
network and as long as you have one time
the ability to install something like

179
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:46,629
this and somebody's computer attached to
somebody's computer man you have a

180
00:17:46,630 --> 00:17:55,299
covert network into that computer or out
of that computer school was one that I

181
00:17:55,299 --> 00:17:59,340
didn't think it was going to be possible
at first when dominic and I first

182
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:09,559
started talking about it it's a USB
cable that we installed a

183
00:18:09,559 --> 00:18:15,780
I convert our interface into some kind
of the same concept as chuck wagon kind

184
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:21,059
of the same concept that there might be
malware on the computer but how do we

185
00:18:21,059 --> 00:18:25,809
how do we control that matter where or
how do we export trade data from where

186
00:18:25,809 --> 00:18:31,290
what channel do we have especially if
there's an air gap and this is kind of

187
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:40,059
cool idea that we could we can take a
low-cost did you call radio transceiver

188
00:18:40,059 --> 00:18:49,080
chip like the one that's in popular I am
me and actually implanted inside USB

189
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:53,330
cable cited inside a USB cable so that

190
00:18:53,330 --> 00:19:00,560
we create over the USB port a covert
channel kolbert radio channel now this

191
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:07,409
also has the possibility of being used
to implement USB attacks if there isn't

192
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:16,420
mylar running on the host computer you
could actually radio control this device

193
00:19:16,420 --> 00:19:21,350
that is plugged into a USB port and
implementing UN attacks against the USB

194
00:19:21,350 --> 00:19:27,370
host and that might be a way like some
of these other tools could be a way to

195
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:32,179
gain malware persistence on a host its a
very powerful thing when you have the

196
00:19:32,180 --> 00:19:38,730
hardware in plant into a PC and it has
the capability to tack to attack the

197
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:43,460
operating system in some way cause that
means you can have now we're running on

198
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:48,970
the system and even if it's detected
even if it's cleaned up and totally

199
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:56,890
removed from the operating system you
can always the attacker can just read

200
00:19:56,890 --> 00:20:01,650
implant that malware from the heart
transplant so as one of the potential

201
00:20:01,650 --> 00:20:06,870
purpose purposes or use cases for
training school now turn up school ended

202
00:20:06,870 --> 00:20:13,010
up totally working and we it's based on
the yardstick one design yardstick one

203
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:16,370
is an open source hardware project that
I'm talking about later today at Arsenal

204
00:20:16,370 --> 00:20:22,030
and what we did was we we took the chip
from yardstick one which is in the same

205
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:27,960
family apart from the Miami my favorite
pink toy and we put it on a tiny little

206
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:38,500
circuit board that fits inside the mail
a conectar a plug USB a plug so there's

207
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:43,250
that one little chip that's that's a
combination microcontroller a USB device

208
00:20:43,250 --> 00:20:49,080
and radio and then there's a second chip
on the other side of the board that is a

209
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:55,820
USB hub and the USB hub allows this
cable to appear at first glance to work

210
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:58,750
like a regular USB cable because you
plug

211
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:04,500
you plug it in and through the hub the
device plugged into the other end of the

212
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:09,590
cable working normally now you if you
look closely you might notice that there

213
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:14,370
are a couple of USB devices that you
weren't expecting but how many people

214
00:21:14,370 --> 00:21:20,739
actually list out all their USB devices
every time I plug in the cable so this

215
00:21:20,740 --> 00:21:27,400
picture was taken just before I in case
the thing in with an over mobutu that

216
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:39,400
was made out of my hand for mobile and
formal black silicon and Dominic when he

217
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:44,130
finally convinced me that we could do
this project he's he said yeah you know

218
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:50,400
i i think we can do it I think we can
fit all that stuff into a USB plug and

219
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,040
he said no I might I might even take a
crack at that he doesn't do a lot of

220
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:59,490
electronics design but he give a shot my
said you would dominate tribute to the

221
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:04,250
schematic I'll do the PCB layout and I
really got the wrong end of that deal

222
00:22:04,250 --> 00:22:12,880
because this was tough but Tony Alamo
was something that Mike Ryan talked

223
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:19,030
about last year the the debt card
wireless village and this is really more

224
00:22:19,030 --> 00:22:24,149
of a software attack he used to achieve
as part of the as part of the project

225
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:28,310
and he also used an off the shelf
bluetooth dongle he was able to do some

226
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:33,610
reconnaissance with over two and and
implement an attack using just a regular

227
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:39,649
old Bluetooth interface Bluetooth dongle
or maybe even one built into a laptop

228
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:47,810
and what he was targeting was keyboards
and mice and it turns out that there are

229
00:22:47,810 --> 00:22:52,379
some Bluetooth keyboards and mice course
you've probably seen those before they

230
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:57,760
they're a lot more popular since the
advent of tablets and there are also

231
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:02,430
fairly recently some Bluetooth Low
Energy keyboards and mice starting to

232
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:07,179
show up there a little rare compared to
classic Bluetooth input devices but

233
00:23:07,179 --> 00:23:09,549
they're starting to show up especially

234
00:23:09,549 --> 00:23:16,149
especially nice and what he discovered
and I highly recommend checking out any

235
00:23:16,149 --> 00:23:23,199
of his talks on those whose low energy
security which is given several and what

236
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:27,230
he discovered in the case of this
particular device is that the mouse he

237
00:23:27,230 --> 00:23:33,200
was looking at really had no security
features whatsoever and so he can just

238
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:39,980
move the mouse and inject inject input
events into a computer and here's an

239
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:44,690
interesting point about this type of
attack when you're able to spoof for

240
00:23:44,690 --> 00:23:53,289
wireless mouse in most cases you can
actually inject keystrokes because the

241
00:23:53,289 --> 00:23:58,340
driver on the host doesn't really care
what kind of device you are you can

242
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:05,709
inject any kind of device any kind of
input using the HIV USB HID protocol

243
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:12,299
human input device protocol and so in
this case he was able to take a device

244
00:24:12,299 --> 00:24:16,850
that was just a mouse and you know if
you're using a mouse or if you

245
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:21,649
manufacture and a mouse you might think
well miles isn't too terribly security

246
00:24:21,649 --> 00:24:29,369
sensitive you know there's some exposure
there but like you can sniff keystrokes

247
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:36,129
from a mouse for example very easily so
you might you might kinda punt on the

248
00:24:36,129 --> 00:24:42,799
security measures and Mike showed that
using the tiny Alamo project he showed

249
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:48,340
that you can actually take that
vulnerable mouse and do something much

250
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:52,309
more powerful with it you can speak and
and start injecting keystrokes not just

251
00:24:52,309 --> 00:24:55,369
my also bans

252
00:24:55,369 --> 00:24:56,389
sweeper

253
00:24:56,390 --> 00:25:05,320
internet favorite and Sammy did this
wonderful device that looks just like a

254
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:12,639
USB charger plug into the wall and in
fact is USB charger but he put some

255
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,590
other stuff inside of it he took an
attack that was originally implemented

256
00:25:17,590 --> 00:25:23,580
some years ago by Travis Goodspeed an
attack that allowed the monitoring the

257
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:30,449
snipping keystrokes from wireless
keyboards again we're looking at

258
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:35,610
keyboards this with this tool you can
snap wireless key strokes from a number

259
00:25:35,610 --> 00:25:43,010
of microsoft wireless keyboards quite
easily and again this is a case where

260
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:50,070
there are input devices that don't have
really did security so Sammy took this

261
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:56,139
attack and shrunken down and stuck it
into a tiny little package in this

262
00:25:56,140 --> 00:26:04,870
package is a sniper the wireless network
that sniffs the keystrokes and there's

263
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:11,020
also a GSM module that allows him to
send those key strokes over a cellular

264
00:26:11,020 --> 00:26:17,090
network to wherever you want and it also
still functions and the USB charger

265
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:23,990
this into a little while a somewhat
bulky off the shelf USB charger and

266
00:26:23,990 --> 00:26:27,680
which means of course it's easy to plug
in somewhere which is where it gets its

267
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:34,870
power and people are unlikely to notice
that anything is amiss this is an

268
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:37,280
example of one

269
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:43,560
project within the NSE place at that
wasn't even originally conceived to be a

270
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:48,370
part of the NSA place at Sammy kind of
did this on his own and publish any

271
00:26:48,370 --> 00:26:53,989
information about it and some folks from
USA plays a project contacted him and

272
00:26:53,990 --> 00:27:02,110
said hey Sammy this is great for the
assay place it can we do that so sammy

273
00:27:02,110 --> 00:27:07,270
is giving a talk on some really cool
stuff that he's going to a more recently

274
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:12,580
coming up this weekend also I should
give some other talks and I go back a

275
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:19,909
little bit here joe is giving the talk
this weekend that I'll talk about a

276
00:27:19,910 --> 00:27:23,760
little bit later and let's see who else
would give your talking like where I am

277
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:30,629
and which 0 are doing a wonderful talk
on skateboards coming out more and more

278
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:35,310
Bluetooth madness from from him and
sammy is doing a talk this weekend on

279
00:27:35,310 --> 00:27:45,290
some some interesting automotive related
research that he's been doing

280
00:27:45,290 --> 00:27:52,280
is a handheld spectrum analyzer and
here's an example of something that

281
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:59,000
existed before we can seem to be in a
safe place at and we just thought it fit

282
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:02,660
so nicely into our project we're going
to give it a silly name and put it into

283
00:28:02,660 --> 00:28:12,000
our project but this is an older mobile
phone using the calypso chips and the

284
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:19,910
various hackers who have learned to
write code for that chipset over the

285
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:26,180
years released some interesting little
tools and there's a lot of folks aren't

286
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:31,450
aware of I don't think that some of that
there's a tool to measure the RSSI the

287
00:28:31,450 --> 00:28:37,930
received signal strength indicator from
the baseband and you can tune your radio

288
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:42,390
to a frequency measure they are since I
move on to the next frequency measuring

289
00:28:42,390 --> 00:28:47,910
our society and so forth and do a live
spectrum analyzer application with

290
00:28:47,910 --> 00:28:53,860
limited radioman with embedded in a
mobile phone and I think it's really

291
00:28:53,860 --> 00:29:01,429
cool that you can take off the shelf
mobile phone and do such a thing this

292
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:06,570
requires no hardware modifications
whatsoever it's only software using

293
00:29:06,570 --> 00:29:12,480
off-the-shelf hardware also mobile
spectrum analyzer handheld spectrum

294
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:18,590
analyzer applications which are super
handy for implementing all sorts of

295
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:26,399
radio shenanigans I wrote this one for
the IME my favorite pink toy as I

296
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,770
mentioned before I wrote this spectrum
analyzer applications some years ago

297
00:29:30,770 --> 00:29:37,340
shortly after Travis Goodspeed
introduced me to the device and at the

298
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:44,830
time I was able to find one on ebay for
$16 but since a couple months ago Sammy

299
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:49,060
published his brute force garage door
opener attack on the IME know they're

300
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,440
going for like 300

301
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:57,929
so so I have a few on my shelf and I'm
thinking by next year and may be able to

302
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:04,129
retire with them at the rate this is
going to play this was a children's toy

303
00:30:04,129 --> 00:30:08,350
that you could buy on eBay at least
until recently for pretty affordable

304
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,480
prices

305
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:18,570
most of mine for like 20 to $30 and
similar to the leviticus it's a handheld

306
00:30:18,570 --> 00:30:23,350
spectrum analyzer and also similar to
limited guess there's no hardware

307
00:30:23,350 --> 00:30:27,969
modification required this is an off the
shelf children's toy with a highly

308
00:30:27,970 --> 00:30:33,240
capable radio in it that can tune into
quite a range of frequencies in the sub

309
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:40,009
1 gigahertz bands including all the
popular bands like the 900 megahertz I

310
00:30:40,009 --> 00:30:48,120
say I'm 433 megahertz and the bands that
are used by remote keyless entry systems

311
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:53,289
including garage door openers and
cellular bands all kinds of fun stuff

312
00:30:53,289 --> 00:31:00,480
can be done with this little radio chip
that is inside the AME and it's it's the

313
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:05,679
same family of chip that we use in yards
they go on hand in turn up school so

314
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:11,629
this this is this chip from chip kahn is
the gift that keeps on giving for sub

315
00:31:11,629 --> 00:31:18,740
gigahertz radio hikers and so i i throw
this in here because I was like I was

316
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:24,350
thinking oh I put leviticus in there
really should put the miamis began in

317
00:31:24,350 --> 00:31:31,120
the case of a place that catalog do but
I just through this in my slides like 45

318
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,658
minutes ago and we don't have a silly
name for it yet so we need a silly name

319
00:31:35,659 --> 00:31:41,039
for this one has any suggestions I'd
love to hear from you and will get a

320
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:46,039
silly name and put it into me and it's a
place a quickie its online and it's a

321
00:31:46,039 --> 00:31:51,990
place a dork Twilight vegetable

322
00:31:51,990 --> 00:32:00,130
that's why my favorite names to Twilight
vegetable is a tool

323
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:07,929
Dean and Loki talked about last year and
it is really basic in terms of hardware

324
00:32:07,929 --> 00:32:14,440
it's off the shelf it's just an off the
shelf USB stick that comes with a

325
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:20,360
special purpose Linux distribution that
has all the software you need to do

326
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:30,800
GSM snipping and you can use Twilight
vegetable with $20 Realtek TV tuner

327
00:32:30,800 --> 00:32:37,629
dongle all you need is just the USB
stick with the code and the USB stick

328
00:32:37,630 --> 00:32:44,550
for your TV tuner TV tuner and you plug
them into laptop booed off the USB stick

329
00:32:44,550 --> 00:32:48,379
of Twilight vegetable and it gives you
all the software you need to start

330
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:52,950
sniffing mobile phone traffic and what
do you do with that mobile phone traffic

331
00:32:52,950 --> 00:33:03,020
while you use your drizzle chair which
is i think thats a play on rainbow table

332
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:09,870
chair again is just off the shelf
hardware it's a it's a large hard drive

333
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:17,340
that includes GSM rainbow tables for
decrypting GSM communication and I'm not

334
00:33:17,340 --> 00:33:24,230
sure that people realize how easy it is
to capture and encrypt traffic all you

335
00:33:24,230 --> 00:33:27,960
need is to highlight measurable and
drizzle chair the

336
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:33,590
and so in this case they weren't talking
about any attack that hadn't been

337
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:39,000
published before they were doing what
they were trying to accomplish as part

338
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:43,880
of the NSA place at project was making
the tools more accessible and showing

339
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:51,140
people how easy it is to accomplish some
of these things yes people have been

340
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:55,910
sniffing GSM four years yes people been
cracking just four years but did you

341
00:33:55,910 --> 00:34:00,300
know that you could you could do this on
your your laptop that you carry around

342
00:34:00,300 --> 00:34:05,490
with you just by having the right
software and the right one terabyte hard

343
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:13,330
drive and a $20 TV tuner dongle it's
pretty pretty cool and it's pretty cool

344
00:34:13,330 --> 00:34:18,270
that they're able to help people see
that that this type of thing is is

345
00:34:18,270 --> 00:34:24,759
possible in a very accessible attack and
that's a big big reason a big motivator

346
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:28,590
that we wanted to do that and it's a
place that project was because we wanted

347
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:34,450
to show people the stuff that the nation
state actors the tools that they use the

348
00:34:34,449 --> 00:34:39,169
gadgets they have their nifty but we can
do that too

349
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:46,080
we can do all of those things where you
buy a masquerade I never actually soft

350
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:51,420
liner on DEFCON last year but I think it
was was at one point but dared appear

351
00:34:51,420 --> 00:34:56,950
posted this hunt on our mailing list one
day like right before Dec on it said in

352
00:34:56,949 --> 00:35:02,730
part by masquerade and it's just
basically just a flying high 5 pie apple

353
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:12,000
it would you know it's just obvious what
kind of silly thing but you know what we

354
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:18,550
have some wonderful tools to wifi in the
security community we have kids for

355
00:35:18,550 --> 00:35:24,100
example open source software is a
fantastic tool for monitoring wifi

356
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:28,779
communications we have readily
accessible tools

357
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:36,320
like the wifi pineapple and all kinds of
of special purpose tools for wifi

358
00:35:36,320 --> 00:35:41,090
hacking but also general purpose
hardware like and software

359
00:35:41,090 --> 00:35:48,180
wifi cards and chips that we have in our
everyday devices in many cases are

360
00:35:48,180 --> 00:35:54,970
perfectly capable of implementing all
sorts of shenanigans and where we're

361
00:35:54,970 --> 00:36:01,040
kind of lucky in some sense that wifi
works out that way a lot of other radio

362
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,670
protocols and this is what I spend a lot
of time talking about doing research and

363
00:36:04,670 --> 00:36:09,660
teaching people about a lot of other
radio systems are a little less

364
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:15,990
accessible little harder to some cases a
lot harder to have tools for develop

365
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:20,790
tools for but in the case of WiFi we
have amazing tools and just off the

366
00:36:20,790 --> 00:36:26,270
shelf hardware and this is an example of
using off-the-shelf hardware which is a

367
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:32,530
little bit customized and being able to
fly around and you could do something

368
00:36:32,530 --> 00:36:34,020
like this thing

369
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:38,980
automatically follow a person who has a
particular market dress or you know use

370
00:36:38,980 --> 00:36:46,580
your imagination congo block was the
first RFI retro reflectors that I built

371
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:53,529
and this is an area of research that i
think is very important for the security

372
00:36:53,530 --> 00:37:00,270
community going forward at least in my
opinion and I talked about this last

373
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:07,170
year I started talking about it and i'd
give it a couple of talks here and there

374
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:16,020
are two reflectors the interesting thing
here is that this is a device that is

375
00:37:16,020 --> 00:37:20,530
what is that about a half a centimeter
wide and that's really much bigger than

376
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:25,660
it needs to be the only reason it's a
big is because it was the minimum size

377
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:32,790
PCB I could get me and I wanted it on a
printed circuit board for convenience

378
00:37:32,790 --> 00:37:36,990
and experimenting with it but really
this device consists of only one

379
00:37:36,990 --> 00:37:37,640
component

380
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:44,089
one transistor transistor and two pieces
of wire to serve as an antenna and what

381
00:37:44,089 --> 00:37:50,450
you do with Congo fog is implanted in
some hardware you for example a cable

382
00:37:50,450 --> 00:37:56,509
you implanted into a cable or you
implanted into a monitor or you

383
00:37:56,510 --> 00:38:01,910
implanted into a keyboard or into a PC
any kind of electronic device that has

384
00:38:01,910 --> 00:38:08,368
any sort of signaled that goes over
aware if there's a wire or trace on a

385
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:13,720
circuit board that you want to tap the
monitor is connected to conquer flock

386
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:21,209
and what it does is it creates an
opportunity for an attacker to eavesdrop

387
00:38:21,210 --> 00:38:28,990
on the signal on that wire using radar
so this device requires no power supply

388
00:38:28,990 --> 00:38:36,939
it makes no radio transmission on its
own but it modulates the activity its

389
00:38:36,940 --> 00:38:42,589
radio reflectivity according to the
signal on the on the wire that connects

390
00:38:42,589 --> 00:38:48,000
to end so what you do as an attacker is
you have one of these implanted

391
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:53,240
somewhere like imagine that this is
implanted in a keyboard cable ok so you

392
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:59,160
just have to swap somebody's keyboard
cable and then it just sits quietly and

393
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:04,990
does nothing until the attacker from
somewhere nearby maybe within a hundred

394
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:13,640
metres ish directs a radio signal at the
device and then measures the reflected

395
00:39:13,640 --> 00:39:20,210
radio signal using very traditional
radar equipment with this technique the

396
00:39:20,210 --> 00:39:25,230
attacker can observe the signal on the
wire and do things like sniffing

397
00:39:25,230 --> 00:39:30,089
keystrokes video screens if you put this
on a video cable etc

398
00:39:30,089 --> 00:39:34,340
this is the first retro reflector I
built and and I think it

399
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:40,160
I intentionally set out to make it the
simplest possible device from which we

400
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:45,069
can experiment a starting point from
which we can grow and try other types of

401
00:39:45,070 --> 00:39:50,990
red reflectors there's been a fair
amount of research published research on

402
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:57,729
the subject of unintentional emissions
from from electronic systems electronic

403
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:00,370
devices digital electronics primarily

404
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:06,779
and and video screens and if you're
interested in this sort of thing I I

405
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:14,170
recommend starting with papers by Markus
Kuhn on the subject but while we had had

406
00:40:14,170 --> 00:40:19,030
research on the subject of
unintentionally missions we haven't had

407
00:40:19,030 --> 00:40:28,640
published research on the subject of a
mission security based on reflected

408
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:34,319
radio signals and this is just a
stepping stone i think because here we

409
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:39,280
have an intentional implant something
that is put into a device or put into a

410
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:44,220
cable that is an intentional our efforts
are reflector that reveals information

411
00:40:44,220 --> 00:40:53,060
about the system that is attached to buy
by means of radar but it's entirely

412
00:40:53,060 --> 00:40:59,620
probable that there are caissons there
are situations where our everyday

413
00:40:59,620 --> 00:41:08,120
electronic devices have unintentional
Aref rector reflectors in them without

414
00:41:08,120 --> 00:41:15,120
even knowing the designer of a product
of an electronic device might have

415
00:41:15,120 --> 00:41:21,060
created a system that can be
eavesdropped on through radar without

416
00:41:21,060 --> 00:41:25,850
having to modify the hardware in any way
I haven't found any of those yet but I

417
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:30,650
speculate that they exist and if people
start poking around that we will

418
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:36,400
actually find them and so a good place
to start experimenting is with these

419
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:40,840
custom made our efforts reflectors that
are designed specifically to

420
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:45,960
intentionally service record reflectors
so-called uplog I've used to sniff ps2

421
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:47,330
keyboards for example

422
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:54,049
and USB a little bit then I started
building some slightly larger worms and

423
00:41:54,050 --> 00:41:58,180
the only region reason they're larger is
because I wanted to have connectors on

424
00:41:58,180 --> 00:42:01,950
them which makes it easy to experiment
with plug them into different types of

425
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:09,689
cables and this is one tangle flock is
used to monitor USB connections as only

426
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:16,630
works at low speed and full speed USB
not hire SuperSpeed USB but this

427
00:42:16,630 --> 00:42:24,650
includes for example all USB keyboards
and mice flamingo clock I've had a lot

428
00:42:24,650 --> 00:42:31,040
of success with and I demoed publicly a
few times and its ps2 same exact circuit

429
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:37,200
one transistor just on a comedian form
factor to plug into ps2 cables and and

430
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:44,850
demonstrate sniffing ps2 keyboard
keystrokes this way also block is a

431
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:49,770
little bit more complicated I wanted to
sniff VGA signals and I wanted to show

432
00:42:49,770 --> 00:42:54,080
that it's possible to use an RAF retro
reflector to allow an attacker to

433
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:59,180
recover the image on a screen with radar
gonna give you a little demo here this

434
00:42:59,180 --> 00:43:03,950
is a live demo I set up my radar and
everything but I want to show you the

435
00:43:03,950 --> 00:43:12,180
data that I get out of this attack by
fire radar at salsa flock which is

436
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:18,790
implanted in a target VGA system and
then I measure the return signal I'm

437
00:43:18,790 --> 00:43:23,330
using software defined radio I'm using a
car a platform to implement this but it

438
00:43:23,330 --> 00:43:29,770
can be used you get it could be
implemented with virtually any radio and

439
00:43:29,770 --> 00:43:35,290
radar type of system that has the
ability to digitize enough radio

440
00:43:35,290 --> 00:43:42,870
bandwidth so they show you what I get
out of it I get this nonsense and I have

441
00:43:42,870 --> 00:43:48,080
a very simple digital signal processing
implementation where I take the received

442
00:43:48,080 --> 00:43:54,520
data from my car and I simply measure
its amplitude I do amplitude

443
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:57,019
demodulation

444
00:43:57,019 --> 00:44:04,698
and then I jump lady modulated output
into a file and then I reopen the file

445
00:44:04,699 --> 00:44:11,679
was something like giving and jim has
this is open source software that lets

446
00:44:11,679 --> 00:44:23,589
me that lets me simply open the file and
then give a different parameters for

447
00:44:23,589 --> 00:44:31,009
like what how wide and high I expect the
image to be and lets me do some things

448
00:44:31,009 --> 00:44:37,890
like oops I just say while is there an
image there well I'll just try to rest

449
00:44:37,890 --> 00:44:41,979
her eyes it with a bunch of different
widths see what happens

450
00:44:41,979 --> 00:44:46,928
and so I go through and I try a bunch of
different ways and you can see there's

451
00:44:46,929 --> 00:44:53,329
definitely some structure there is an
actual image that I got in my lab from

452
00:44:53,329 --> 00:45:00,819
doing it pretty close range reflects a
reflector test with salsa flock so as I

453
00:45:00,819 --> 00:45:05,929
get closer to the proper resolution

454
00:45:05,929 --> 00:45:14,769
pops out at me you can see I was I was
targeting a Gentoo Linux screening and

455
00:45:14,769 --> 00:45:18,538
you can see I was running backs are in
our to change my screen resolution

456
00:45:18,539 --> 00:45:24,049
before I ran those tests and as I scroll
through here you can see actually there

457
00:45:24,049 --> 00:45:29,130
are thousands of images of the screen or
then like something broke I moved

458
00:45:29,130 --> 00:45:33,489
something an antenna or something and
then he came back there are thousands of

459
00:45:33,489 --> 00:45:38,419
copies of the same screening here so
even though it isn't particularly easy

460
00:45:38,419 --> 00:45:45,109
to read you can see that there's so much
redundant information because my screen

461
00:45:45,109 --> 00:45:49,869
refresh rate is something like in the
target is something like sixty refresh

462
00:45:49,869 --> 00:45:50,719
as best I can

463
00:45:50,719 --> 00:45:54,669
well if you're trying to read texts
often somebody's screen you know how

464
00:45:54,669 --> 00:45:59,499
often does that text change it's not
changing sixty times per second so you

465
00:45:59,499 --> 00:46:01,328
get a lot as an attacker

466
00:46:01,329 --> 00:46:06,299
a lot of redundant information over and
over and over again I get these kind of

467
00:46:06,299 --> 00:46:07,950
porn images even though

468
00:46:07,950 --> 00:46:14,868
in many cases their readable I get these
kind of marginal images a target system

469
00:46:14,869 --> 00:46:20,109
screen and I could combine those
multiple frames of information together

470
00:46:20,109 --> 00:46:27,589
after the fact if I wanted to do in the
future

471
00:46:27,589 --> 00:46:36,210
not entirely sure what's going to happen
with the NSA place at project but I hope

472
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:42,039
that that people learn from it and maybe
we'll have more place at tools

473
00:46:42,039 --> 00:46:50,940
certainly we're having more this week in
particular just the other day at bsides

474
00:46:50,940 --> 00:46:57,479
presented lingering cough which is a
covert channel implemented through

475
00:46:57,479 --> 00:47:05,210
optical data transmission built into a
BGA cable and so he built this custom

476
00:47:05,210 --> 00:47:11,440
the circuit board it's a little funny
but has that long photodiode there are

477
00:47:11,440 --> 00:47:17,380
phototransistor taken out but that can
be made smaller and he actually talked

478
00:47:17,380 --> 00:47:22,779
about how you can create networks of
these things like a mesh network covert

479
00:47:22,779 --> 00:47:29,319
channel among leave da cables that have
all been replaced and installation so

480
00:47:29,319 --> 00:47:32,769
this is just one example of something
like that happening just this week that

481
00:47:32,769 --> 00:47:39,660
I didn't get into my talk until this
morning but it's it's a part of the NSA

482
00:47:39,660 --> 00:47:46,069
place a project that is part of ongoing
work to help people see the kinds of

483
00:47:46,069 --> 00:47:51,009
tools that could be used another another
one is coming up this weekend Joe Pitts

484
00:47:51,009 --> 00:47:59,229
is giving a talk on his JTAG implant
that goes in PCs cold solder peak and I

485
00:47:59,229 --> 00:48:04,960
have some solder be PCBs with me up here
that I will try to give remember to give

486
00:48:04,960 --> 00:48:12,539
back to him before his talk so we have
some things going on still in the NSA

487
00:48:12,539 --> 00:48:17,259
place a project but I thought that the
one year mark was kind of a good time to

488
00:48:17,259 --> 00:48:22,180
take a step back and look at all the
things we've built it's a it's a group

489
00:48:22,180 --> 00:48:29,440
of people that is loosely organized
anybody can join us

490
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:34,369
anybody can go to and it's a place at da
toward contributor on project join our

491
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:38,470
mailing list I would like to see going
forward

492
00:48:38,470 --> 00:48:43,330
more retro reflect your research done by
myself or done by other folks I think

493
00:48:43,330 --> 00:48:48,720
it's an important area that I hope liane
it's a place that can inspire people to

494
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:55,549
to get into as a research area and one
last thought is that one thing we should

495
00:48:55,550 --> 00:48:59,480
consider is that the things we're
creating the things we've created

496
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:05,550
already mine actually be used by nation
state actors instead of using tools that

497
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:10,880
they develop their own on their own
lives interesting to consider that they

498
00:49:10,880 --> 00:49:15,380
might end up using the very ones that we
use which could give them the benefit of

499
00:49:15,380 --> 00:49:21,340
plausible deniability in some cases
that's an interesting implication of

500
00:49:21,340 --> 00:49:26,000
this project that I don't know people
have thought about necessarily before

501
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:31,930
but I find intriguing so thank you to
deem peers for coming up with the name

502
00:49:31,930 --> 00:49:37,029
and it's a place and make for drawing
some really cool pictures that i've

503
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:41,490
using some of my presentations and root
killer for making these awesome t-shirts

504
00:49:41,490 --> 00:49:45,290
and everyone in the end it's a place
that crew in particular everyone that I

505
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:50,730
mentioned that was listed on slides
today who've contributed something to be

506
00:49:50,730 --> 00:49:56,310
part of the NSA place at it is a group
effort and it's a lot of people having

507
00:49:56,310 --> 00:50:03,700
fun and also trying to trying to find a
fun way to educate the community so

508
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:11,390
check out sa place it or hear some of
Nick's drawings and I hope that I hope

509
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:15,440
you'll enjoy some of the tools that
we've done already and I hope that some

510
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,560
of you are inspired to contribute in the
future thank you
