1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,020
hello everyone and welcome back to the
Jasmine ballroom at blackhat 2015 couple

2
00:00:06,020 --> 00:00:09,200
quick announcements there is reception
tonight at Business Hall which is also

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,950
known as the shoreline a room that
reception begins at 5:30 p.m. then the

4
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:21,430
tony awards began in the Mandalay Bay BC
team room at 6:30 p.m. I know we've been

5
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:24,400
saying six o'clock for a long time
somebody came and told us about an hour

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,419
ago notes actually 630 so if you're
gonna be there at six

7
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:33,239
your again in the Jasmine room and
you're here to see hopefully the little

8
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,410
gas little pumpkins that could tax on
gas company operating systems

9
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:43,269
speakers are being Calvo Holt and
Stephen hilt and thank you very much and

10
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:46,899
hopefully you can also if you have cell
phones that aren't on vibrate change

11
00:00:46,899 --> 00:01:08,229
that please thank you I will also see
the threat researcher so I realize we're

12
00:01:08,229 --> 00:01:11,620
standing in a bracket

13
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:15,890
and might be a fire hazard I realize
we're standing in front of everybody

14
00:01:15,890 --> 00:01:20,670
getting beer so we're gonna get through
this altogether if anybody feel like

15
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,040
bringing europe the stage with more than
happy to accept that gratefully and we

16
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:29,170
will also return the favor after talks
keep that in mind again so today we're

17
00:01:29,170 --> 00:01:34,250
going to be talking about is primarily
focusing on attacks around pub

18
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:38,110
monitoring systems and the poem honoring
systems are going to be discussing is

19
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:44,010
gasoline pump monetary systems prior to
really kind of getting into the actual

20
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:48,450
systems themselves and kind of looking
at the profiles and the vulnerabilities

21
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,470
behind the system's what we're really
gonna be looking at first that's kind of

22
00:01:51,470 --> 00:01:56,050
where the industry is an industry I'm
using quotations because I hate when

23
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:00,340
that term is used to hate when everyone
says well where the industry and that's

24
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:05,440
all crap so what we're gonna be
discussing is kind of where ICS ICS

25
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:09,690
environment is kind of where we see the
progress over the past four years

26
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:14,560
realistically just to give you some
context about why the research that

27
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,770
we've performed over the past six months

28
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:23,770
kind of came about so first threats
around SCADA and ICS environment started

29
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:28,410
to adapt and change we started to see
targeted attackers and by target

30
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:32,290
attackers I'm referring to the ever
hated term apt and state-sponsored

31
00:02:32,290 --> 00:02:35,489
attackers primarily looking at these
devices and looking at these

32
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:38,989
environments right there trying to look
at these devices for multiple reasons

33
00:02:38,989 --> 00:02:43,239
that will kind of go into here shortly

34
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:47,870
these projects started to be looked a
little bit more in depth for multiple

35
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:52,140
reasons and a larger scale and we start
to realize that starting in about twenty

36
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:56,829
ten and it's slowly started to ramp up
after more research has come about

37
00:02:56,830 --> 00:03:00,320
more data has come about regarding some
of these threats and some of these

38
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:07,459
vulnerabilities that exists scattered
data and information around state

39
00:03:07,459 --> 00:03:12,350
environment also started to trade in
underground forums this was an

40
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:16,019
interesting scenario that we started to
watch occur because traditionally

41
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:19,530
whenever we're on underground forums and
we're looking for new banking Trojans

42
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,450
were looking for new rats these types of
things we start to see skate

43
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:27,649
information and interest in skating
information start popping up in for

44
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:31,170
instance this particular individuals
looking specifically for a skater rad

45
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:36,660
pretty generic and pretty he just tells
me kind of the knowledge level of the

46
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:40,140
specific individual at this point but
nonetheless that interest level is there

47
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:47,099
and it's only continuing to get further
and deep vulnerabilities also continued

48
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:52,649
to to arise and continue to call about
the more abilities not only existed in

49
00:03:52,650 --> 00:03:57,580
ICS and skated devices themselves but
also in the communications protocols

50
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:01,829
that are between these devices as well
as the way in which these services and

51
00:04:01,829 --> 00:04:05,739
technologies are utilized we started to
watch this obviously gained prominence

52
00:04:05,739 --> 00:04:11,510
in 2009 2010 and again as is the trend
with all of these types of environments

53
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:20,289
the trend is going upward this slide is
taken from I see a certain kind of

54
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:24,020
responsible body in the United States
for handling critical infrastructure

55
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:29,370
incidents and and other things related
to skate environments this light is

56
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:34,039
intended for one thing and that's to
show that incidents are happening right

57
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:39,419
I'm not going to get into great detail
as to what these particular details are

58
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:42,680
what classifies as an incident because
that's something that has been up for

59
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,950
great debate specifically about these
charges that are generated so I'm not

60
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:50,389
going to get into that nonetheless we
can see that in essence recurring and

61
00:04:50,389 --> 00:04:55,190
primarily due to specific sectors being
critical manufacturing and energy which

62
00:04:55,190 --> 00:05:00,110
accounted for over 50% of the incident
counts that's somewhat staggering right

63
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:04,030
and it starts to stagger out from there
from communications all the way down to

64
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:08,919
government facilities etc

65
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:13,490
abilities and incidents per year
starting to increase at a fairly high

66
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:18,620
rate so you can see we chartered it out
from 2011 all the way to 2014 were not

67
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:21,250
included 2015 statistical information
yet

68
00:05:21,250 --> 00:05:23,610
primarily because all of that
information has been brought to

69
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:29,000
attention yet it hasn't been fully
released yet so we started in 2011

70
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:34,020
with a hundred and thirty-eight
vulnerabilities that's a rough count but

71
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:37,479
nonetheless there was a hundred and
thirty eight and it started to go up and

72
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:42,020
started it back down but the incidents
are also starting in an upward trend so

73
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:45,320
again there's more attention being paid
to these devices more attention being

74
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:49,500
paid to exposing vulnerabilities in
these environments and devices as well

75
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:57,190
as looking at those particular protocols
so the question that we're often asked

76
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:01,590
what you were discussing skate
environments is why are these

77
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:06,960
environments attacked what is the
benefit who does the attacking the first

78
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:15,469
is the government by the government I'm
not referring to the USA government I'm

79
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:19,460
not referring to a specific government
in general what I'm referring to his

80
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:22,400
government entities oftentimes would
like to look at these environments for

81
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,789
obvious reasons they liked obviously
assess critical infrastructure of a

82
00:06:26,790 --> 00:06:31,610
specific nation state not only to
possibly pre target future engagements

83
00:06:31,610 --> 00:06:35,030
that may occur but also in some cases
they're looking they're looking for

84
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:40,340
statistical information about an
environment for competitive advantage

85
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,919
I'm not going to mention a nation states
here but I think there's probably a few

86
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:46,820
that come up in most of our minds so the
government is one of the primary

87
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:50,400
offenders of looking at Skate
environments and actively targeting an

88
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,159
attacking them also criminals we're
starting to see criminals take a big

89
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:02,280
notice in the specific environments in
question with that is why write one of

90
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:06,530
the big reasons as to why criminals are
looking at this is because it gives them

91
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:11,599
an opportunity to build up their lack of
a better term their credentials they can

92
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:16,180
go out an underground forums get repped
for attacking a bring down devices prove

93
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:19,340
it was logs prove it with additional
information and that builds up their

94
00:07:19,340 --> 00:07:22,869
reputation to then be able to get access
to other closed forums to get access to

95
00:07:22,870 --> 00:07:27,690
other information that they may not have
elsewhere in addition we've watched a

96
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:32,410
lot of specific Windows environments
primarily that are functioning is HMI

97
00:07:32,410 --> 00:07:37,250
human machine interfaces that criminals
are actually compromising too then added

98
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:41,200
to the botnet and in this case these
particular individuals don't even give a

99
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:41,599
shit

100
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:47,140
that they're on an HMO they couldn't
care any less often times they're out

101
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:51,440
there literally just to add one more box
to their environment to the lateral move

102
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,210
inside that network and the reason that
they're going out and compromising it is

103
00:07:55,210 --> 00:07:59,440
because it's easy and whenever I say
that I mean these devices are almost

104
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,570
always not patched they're almost always
using antiquated software antiquated

105
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:08,340
hardware and these are all things that
we've always heard about right I mean

106
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:12,419
we're talking this is not uncommon were
talking Windows XP machines Windows

107
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:16,820
Server 2008 instances that have been
past four years so those are some of the

108
00:08:16,820 --> 00:08:20,560
reasons that state is being attacked
still to this day and it's still

109
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,920
continuing to go forward so now we've
got a wrapped up kind of an industry

110
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:30,700
overview we're gonna now start to look
at the actual research that we performed

111
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:36,330
regarding the actual Guardian St pops
out what your thinking is what if

112
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:41,330
anything I'll just have to say have to
do with the title of the site of this

113
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:45,130
presentation so we're going to talk
about specifically the Guardian atheist

114
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:50,950
he's very nasty as a device that
deployed for tank monitoring the tanks

115
00:08:50,950 --> 00:08:54,220
themselves tend to be the underground
tanks that you find a gas stations and

116
00:08:54,220 --> 00:09:00,510
this will help you determine the volume
temperature water content other things

117
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:01,780
about the tank as well

118
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:06,390
delivery report shift reports the things
as well are built into it to these

119
00:09:06,390 --> 00:09:10,699
usually gas stations next time you look
like some gas station will likely

120
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:15,200
probably see one of these at the gas
station look behind the counter behind

121
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:23,620
the counters so what happens here is
kind of a diagram of how the system

122
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:30,750
works the Guardian St devices sit at the
gas stations themselves and then you

123
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:38,200
have your supplier who is usually a
terminal station that deploys and the

124
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:43,370
product to the individual gas station so
when somebody is running low

125
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:46,560
this system they're going to create it
and I'll tell him that the tank is

126
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:47,500
getting low and

127
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:55,990
and then they will deploy the gas
product gasoline diesel fuels or

128
00:09:55,990 --> 00:10:02,280
whatever to the place that needs a lot
of times this is done more in a manual

129
00:10:02,280 --> 00:10:06,280
approach where there's behind the
counter somebody's looking at it and

130
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:10,400
determining it making that call but a
lot of cases this is also becoming more

131
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,150
and more prevalent that this is an
automated where somebody's doing

132
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:22,420
automated queries of these systems which
is why you're finding these online fact

133
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:34,140
that it's in this mode so you can see
these are actually on line in there is

134
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:41,180
insured and now as well so here's one of
one that we found online look at some

135
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:48,959
information the port that DNA tests he
uses is put 2001 switch over and connect

136
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,480
to it real quick just to show you that
it's active and it runs the simple

137
00:10:53,480 --> 00:11:00,230
command the list into inventory command
very much sums tell you what the tank is

138
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:06,570
Volume I do the tank water content of
the product and the temperature of the

139
00:11:06,570 --> 00:11:15,070
tank and also ran a second command which
was the end of took the shift report

140
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:16,380
comment

141
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:22,980
we did that one thing to consider when
we were looking at all these systems

142
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:26,810
online was that not all tanks are
created equal

143
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:34,500
as an example here you can see in the
savage this one is actually has three

144
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:39,190
biodiesel tanks and then the next slide
you'll see that it's not just an

145
00:11:39,190 --> 00:11:43,770
underground tank this one is actually a
terminal station with large above-ground

146
00:11:43,770 --> 00:11:49,220
tanks that they distribute this one to
the individual tanker the stations that

147
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:55,420
need it so other ones that we found also
includes transfer backup generators

148
00:11:55,420 --> 00:12:00,390
online for data centers and hospitals
and the tanks that they have for the G

149
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:06,180
generators as well as gas stations as we
talked there could be other tanks that

150
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:11,550
you can use this for I believe if they
cost wasn't restricted are so high on

151
00:12:11,550 --> 00:12:14,490
these things you could probably get home
for the people in the Northeast during

152
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:18,360
the winter who have heating fuels and
stuff like that

153
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:22,740
help you maintain your inventory let
these things are really expensive for

154
00:12:22,740 --> 00:12:29,280
consumers in my opinion and I can spend
$5,000 or something at my house so based

155
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:32,560
on Google Maps the one that I just
showed in the town I would just

156
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:38,140
Chattanooga Tennessee here's one as you
can see there's a love-struck station

157
00:12:38,140 --> 00:12:46,340
getting filled up from this company to
take that looks so when we originally

158
00:12:46,340 --> 00:12:52,890
started looking at the these we're
looking at the critical vs non critical

159
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:58,650
infrastructure to me this falls under
non-critical because it doesn't really

160
00:12:58,650 --> 00:13:04,090
control the pipelines it doesn't do
anything it's at the gas stations and

161
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:12,630
were at the terminal stations which is
at the very end of that supply so we

162
00:13:12,630 --> 00:13:18,090
wanted to specifically look versus when
Kyle did his original ICS honey pot and

163
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:23,490
2013 which only focused on ICS we were
interested in looking at the

164
00:13:23,490 --> 00:13:30,980
non-critical ICS and we wanted to see
what happens

165
00:13:30,980 --> 00:13:38,400
and see if there was a tax towards the
non critical infrastructure as well so

166
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:46,870
more and January published his report
and findings around the Guardian ST's

167
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:55,440
Kyle and I sat down and debate and
talked about deploying and writing a

168
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:01,740
custom honey pot to look like these
devices and this one we wrote a specific

169
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:08,390
honeypot based off of the gate in
Gardena St which there was really nice

170
00:14:08,390 --> 00:14:10,760
and publishes their manual so that's how
we've

171
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:17,150
broke most of the code for the honeypot
itself was based off of the the manuals

172
00:14:17,150 --> 00:14:20,540
and how they actually tell you what the
response should look like in the manual

173
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:27,959
was really nice and we wanted to create
a better understand he actually attacks

174
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:37,520
against the gas stations and gas tanks
and we really spun this off and if you

175
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:43,930
are painted in February was a kind and
we released a blog about these devices

176
00:14:43,930 --> 00:14:48,870
and we are monitoring showed and in the
original we're going through it we

177
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:55,650
noticed people were altering the tank
names of some of the devices and we

178
00:14:55,650 --> 00:15:01,030
published a blog about how we saw some
one of them getting changed to we are

179
00:15:01,030 --> 00:15:09,199
legion which one could assume or
construe that maybe with a be anonymous

180
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,260
or not gonna

181
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:18,910
regional thing that spawned us off to
see ok we saw them being altered in the

182
00:15:18,910 --> 00:15:25,069
wild on real ones what if we deployed
and try to figure out who they were and

183
00:15:25,070 --> 00:15:28,450
see if they were trying to do other
things than just the one thing the one

184
00:15:28,450 --> 00:15:35,490
command that showdown indexes so we
wrote a single python script that runs

185
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:41,070
on any system so it doesn't actually
require any feeder roots Guardian is

186
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:48,150
teased or anything like that is just a
script I'm currently accepts input and

187
00:15:48,150 --> 00:15:54,550
output 46 commands simple architecture
behind it

188
00:15:54,550 --> 00:16:01,810
we tried to make it as minimalistic is
possible to where there's few ports open

189
00:16:01,810 --> 00:16:08,229
very little communication to it other
than just if you're connecting to it as

190
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:12,670
it would be a true device so what
happens is if you're an attacker you

191
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:19,620
would connect to our script that we
called a spot that gas pod then log your

192
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:22,520
connection and any commands or anything
you do to it

193
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:32,780
just logs it and then we retrieved those
logs manually

194
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:40,130
we ended up deploying them 67 countries
worldwide

195
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:45,170
trying to get gained some very
interesting attention couple countries

196
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,459
were not included

197
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:53,410
that we included this time that child in
doing his regional ICS honey pots and

198
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:59,920
that was Jordan mostly and you a
descriptive and that was cuz we're

199
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:04,170
trying to see what is really looked into
the middle east to see if anything is

200
00:17:04,170 --> 00:17:07,270
going on in the Middle Eastern these
things as well so we specifically

201
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:13,420
deployed those out in those regions to
gain interest to see if anybody is doing

202
00:17:13,420 --> 00:17:21,150
anything with us

203
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:29,970
behind gas part itself can give you an
idea we did a few interesting things and

204
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:32,500
that makes it look different

205
00:17:32,500 --> 00:17:37,190
doesn't make it look like a a typical
honey bother you see out there right now

206
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:49,410
especially for ICS so in this case is a
good idea hundred 200 100 command itself

207
00:17:49,410 --> 00:17:53,980
which is the list i'd the list tank
inventory command that we showed earlier

208
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:59,770
and what happens with that as you can
see it as another example is I'm writing

209
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:03,740
out when somebody's connecting to it
that's all in GMT so we can cross

210
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:11,350
correlate the logs to see if somebody is
doing multiples across the region in the

211
00:18:11,350 --> 00:18:17,100
world or whatever and then I send the
information once upon it

212
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:23,510
of the inventory so so what we did in
this case that shows the tank the

213
00:18:23,510 --> 00:18:26,520
temperatures what we did was we
randomized as much as possible every

214
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:30,690
time you run it you don't have to go in
there and alter a bunch of stuff to make

215
00:18:30,690 --> 00:18:37,410
it look unique so the which is where a
lot of honey pots fail out there right

216
00:18:37,410 --> 00:18:41,800
now is they statically use the same
values over and over and over and over

217
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:45,300
again and now that showed and becoming
more and more prevalent and people are

218
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:50,649
looking at it in my opinion as a
first-level blind of what to be

219
00:18:50,650 --> 00:18:54,660
interested in you can start easily
gauging honey parts because they all

220
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:59,300
look exactly the same so we tried that
randomized as much as possible and then

221
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:04,639
when we didn't have the ability to
randomize it we tried to add in when we

222
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:10,290
deployed on individual specific
information for the region in which we

223
00:19:10,290 --> 00:19:15,260
are deploying it when sometimes we
didn't and still got some interesting

224
00:19:15,260 --> 00:19:21,710
results so insured and his here is one
that showed up in showdown in as one of

225
00:19:21,710 --> 00:19:29,280
our guest spots and was deployed
literally said your company

226
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:36,490
but there is no other ones that would
save fuel companies haven't made that

227
00:19:36,490 --> 00:19:41,610
happen but we tried to gauge some of
them to see if you know kind of dumb

228
00:19:41,610 --> 00:19:52,139
down make them look fairly simplistic as
well when we're cutting it you can also

229
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:55,700
go in with just a simple change and
change your product names we actually

230
00:19:55,700 --> 00:20:00,880
recommend you doing I just love for this
one but four other honey pots changes

231
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:05,250
much as possible so with one change we
can change super to say we're going to

232
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,460
deploy it and England we call it

233
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:12,430
petrol instead of super something else

234
00:20:12,430 --> 00:20:15,860
Pacific to the region in which you're
deploying the temperatures are in

235
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:20,840
Fahrenheit what you can alter those as
well to be in Celsius do you want to

236
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:27,990
change things based off a location which
are deployed not all of our instances

237
00:20:27,990 --> 00:20:35,760
wherein showdown that we deployed and we
did this mainly to see if people are

238
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,879
going to show it in and paying attention
to and from there or if they were

239
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:45,420
discovering them through other means
whether I mean in map is present in map

240
00:20:45,420 --> 00:20:51,730
script that you can identify these no
more projects sonar is still scanning

241
00:20:51,730 --> 00:20:56,560
forum showdown scans for mothers other
scanners out there they're looking for

242
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:04,870
him I think you'll see scan out of
China's looking at him too and so as an

243
00:21:04,870 --> 00:21:09,270
example I mentioned earlier we deployed
some in jordan as you see there are no

244
00:21:09,270 --> 00:21:18,600
gas pods are buried in St is found in
jordan one of the reasons why we did

245
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:24,879
this as well as to see kind of the
growth behind how people were

246
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,310
discovering what they would do to him if
they weren't listed to see if there was

247
00:21:29,310 --> 00:21:34,450
actually people out there actively
looking for these that are just

248
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:44,130
your normal curious person so when we
were starting to look at the actual

249
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:49,870
results of the gas pipe itself there's a
couple things we were considering when

250
00:21:49,870 --> 00:21:55,050
we were trying to classify the attacks
we did not have a port scan so if we saw

251
00:21:55,050 --> 00:22:00,090
ports can we didn't classify that when
his attack we did in classifying attack

252
00:22:00,090 --> 00:22:06,610
as somebody connecting to the dough ice
but never doing anything server

253
00:22:06,610 --> 00:22:11,729
fingerprinting banner grabbing we
actually do consider do later have some

254
00:22:11,730 --> 00:22:17,610
information on some of this the
statistics of what we saw towards the do

255
00:22:17,610 --> 00:22:23,129
nothing and the gets as well as we did
see get and people not doing anything as

256
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:28,390
well as fat fingering we didn't consider
every thing somebody typed as a unique

257
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:38,090
special attack but we did consider scans
were successful commands resulting in a

258
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:44,340
possible failure targeted malware deal
done and done I'll service are

259
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:48,100
distributed denial-of-service those are
things we did considered as attacks

260
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:51,270
before you actually start looking at the
result we kind of classified what we

261
00:22:51,270 --> 00:22:57,370
want to see and what we are going to
immediately exclude from the from the

262
00:22:57,370 --> 00:23:03,989
results so it's kind of a base of what
we did see how they can actually talk

263
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:10,390
about what we did see so to Stevens
Point a lot of what we're doing here was

264
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:16,390
not only creating these honey pots is
kind of an edition from the 2013

265
00:23:16,390 --> 00:23:20,720
research that we were doing but also
because we were trying to understand who

266
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,740
these attackers are in what the possible
motivations behind these attacks 29

267
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:29,730
critical infrastructure we've done a lot
of researches as to who is attacking

268
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:33,660
critical infrastructure what we deem as
critical infrastructure and what their

269
00:23:33,660 --> 00:23:37,740
possible motivations are impossible
attribution and before I start to talk

270
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:41,670
about some of these attacks and the
attack statistics and insomnia test

271
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:45,720
statistics behind banner grabbing extra
keep in mind that I'm referring to a

272
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,060
true

273
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:50,649
fusion and I'm not saying we attributed
base right P address we attributed based

274
00:23:50,650 --> 00:23:54,710
on code identifiers keep in mind that
this is attribution based on the data

275
00:23:54,710 --> 00:23:59,180
that we have so I'm not saying it's 100%
this group of this actor so don't go out

276
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:04,730
and quote me and say hello said its
North Korea not the case

277
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:09,440
what are some possible attack scenarios
a common question that we continually

278
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:14,910
kept asking ourself was what exactly
would an attacker do and what's the

279
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:18,640
motivation behind an attacker looking at
these we really kind of came up with

280
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:23,700
four broad classifications of what
attack scenarios would look like first

281
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:28,040
would be denial of service or a
distributed denial of service to the

282
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:33,590
actual systems themselves causing supply
chain disruptions so for instance if an

283
00:24:33,590 --> 00:24:38,459
attack on a reported $2 service against
one of these public gathering systems it

284
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:43,870
could then cause gasoline not to be
deployed to that specific gasoline pump

285
00:24:43,870 --> 00:24:48,969
while that may not be that big of a
problem with one pump think about that

286
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:52,090
in a region right thing about these
attackers were going in targeting a

287
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:55,290
specific region in the United States or
wherever for that matter and they're

288
00:24:55,290 --> 00:24:59,580
deciding to stop supply chain within
that region regarding gasoline that

289
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:04,470
could be a pretty big problem also the
changing of pump names and whatever I

290
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:07,550
say that I'm referring to if you
remember back to the other screenshots

291
00:25:07,550 --> 00:25:13,110
of gas pot and had unleaded diesel
premium etcetera changing those pumps

292
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:17,030
and changing the values of what those
pop names are can also cause some supply

293
00:25:17,030 --> 00:25:23,220
chain disruptions right it can cause
incorrect unleaded fuel for instance to

294
00:25:23,220 --> 00:25:28,020
be dropped into premium unleaded for
instance so that can really Jackson

295
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:35,480
things are also changing the pumping
volume so in essence saying that the gas

296
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:37,220
pumps themselves are full

297
00:25:37,220 --> 00:25:43,010
whatever in actuality there right which
means there's no pump there's no fuel

298
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:48,030
within that system whatsoever and on the
end system they're saying ok we're

299
00:25:48,030 --> 00:25:52,410
showing its full that could be a supply
chain issues as well and then finally

300
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:56,760
some sort of state-sponsored attack we
didn't really have anything found in

301
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:58,480
this and there really wasn't any

302
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:04,559
type of real data statistic to be had
behind this but realistically from from

303
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:08,879
a state sponsored aspect individuals can
be addressed in this just from pure data

304
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,850
statistical standpoint right just trying
to understand what type of volume of

305
00:26:12,850 --> 00:26:17,790
gasoline is being produced and being
output in a specific region right and

306
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:21,570
again that could be used for further
targeting further information analysis

307
00:26:21,570 --> 00:26:27,428
so what did we see from attack breakdown
standpoint

308
00:26:27,429 --> 00:26:33,299
again we have seven total deployed
instances we did that's been changed

309
00:26:33,299 --> 00:26:37,990
obviously now because we're going live
at this presentation and a majority of

310
00:26:37,990 --> 00:26:44,830
those attacks as me fairly expected
we're in the United States against that

311
00:26:44,830 --> 00:26:48,580
were specifically in the United States
one of the more interesting ones however

312
00:26:48,580 --> 00:26:54,040
is within jordan and will go into that
and kind of the setup about those

313
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:57,918
specific body parts and Jordan coming up
all in all there were four attempted

314
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:03,809
pump modifications there were 12
identified pump identifications meaning

315
00:27:03,809 --> 00:27:07,200
that attackers had gone out and
purposely look to see what was on that

316
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,620
pump what type of output was being
generated what type of names are being

317
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:15,139
generated what type of volume was there
etcetera and then there were two

318
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:19,490
ultimate denial of service attacks and
I'll get into some of the context in

319
00:27:19,490 --> 00:27:23,669
some of the details about that because
again there is some ambiguity behind

320
00:27:23,669 --> 00:27:33,210
that attack breakdown standpoint this is
kind of what we were seeing so on the

321
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:37,610
left hand side we have the country of
origin meaning where r honey pots are

322
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:41,699
actually deployed to where they were and
along the top is the originator of the

323
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:46,500
specific attacks I'm not going to go
into great detail other than one very

324
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:53,750
interesting data point and that's if you
look at the Iranian column and go down

325
00:27:53,750 --> 00:27:59,299
to the jordanian honeypot there were two
attempted attacks and I'm gonna go into

326
00:27:59,299 --> 00:28:02,820
detail on that specific case study
towards the end of the presentation to

327
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:07,000
at least provide some context there but
that's an interesting one and that draw

328
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,870
attention for multiple reasons

329
00:28:08,870 --> 00:28:12,399
is but one of the main ones is primarily
because we were starting to wonder what

330
00:28:12,400 --> 00:28:17,390
about geopolitical and what type of
political implications were involved

331
00:28:17,390 --> 00:28:21,360
there right there's obviously some
tension within that region so what was

332
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:22,889
involved behind that

333
00:28:22,890 --> 00:28:26,410
to have this type of thing happen and
again keeping in mind that this isn't

334
00:28:26,410 --> 00:28:30,020
necessarily critical infrastructure so
there's some complexities there as well

335
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:35,139
it's not like they were attempting to
bring down a nuclear plant from a

336
00:28:35,140 --> 00:28:40,190
connection attempt standpoint this is
just purely statistical this again is

337
00:28:40,190 --> 00:28:45,090
not what we're classifying as an attack
so this these are not being DDoS attacks

338
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:48,449
so for instance on the intercom and
that's literally someone telnet to port

339
00:28:48,450 --> 00:28:54,250
10000 180 enter expecting to get
something back and their connection dies

340
00:28:54,250 --> 00:29:00,150
what this would traditionally be what we
were seeing is what this tradition be

341
00:29:00,150 --> 00:29:05,190
attributed to is someone going out doing
a mass port scan across the entire / 24

342
00:29:05,190 --> 00:29:10,210
network Singapore 10001 open not knowing
what it is attempting to tell about it

343
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:15,929
and then have nothing else to go on so
they're really kind of very just kind of

344
00:29:15,929 --> 00:29:19,630
drive by scanning attempting to connect
and then popping out after that that's

345
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:23,500
it and the same goes with helping get
right there tempting to run the get

346
00:29:23,500 --> 00:29:27,210
command attention on the help command to
which killed the connection and there's

347
00:29:27,210 --> 00:29:31,320
really no data statistics provided back
so again very likely individuals that

348
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,790
haven't really done much as far as
looking into these products really

349
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:37,720
understanding anything about these
products are literally port scanning

350
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:40,110
connecting and then dropping out that's
it

351
00:29:40,110 --> 00:29:44,229
in Wiltshire including this just to give
you an idea of how much interest at

352
00:29:44,230 --> 00:29:49,660
least that poor 10001 regardless of what
these individuals knew how much interest

353
00:29:49,660 --> 00:29:56,550
there was a net specific port from a
valid command statistic standpoint this

354
00:29:56,550 --> 00:30:01,059
is the rough break down the commands
listed on the bottom are actual command

355
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:07,120
that gas pipe will actually except keep
in mind that these commands are 100%

356
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:13,149
accurate in regards to what the viewer
route manual says we literally took me

357
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:16,650
to read manual went through the actual

358
00:30:16,650 --> 00:30:22,420
the actual command sets implemented that
into our script that way if individuals

359
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:25,670
were going out and attempting to
interact then they were able to at least

360
00:30:25,670 --> 00:30:29,930
be presented back with dynamic
information is Steven Hauschka said one

361
00:30:29,930 --> 00:30:34,150
thing about this was there is the six
commands that are implemented they said

362
00:30:34,150 --> 00:30:39,480
they have a lot more implemented we took
the subset of commands that we thought

363
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:44,440
would be most interesting and most
likely be able to rein to run as you can

364
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:53,820
see we saw most of them and some of the
design design around gaspar itself was

365
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:58,770
you get a valid air back if you do not
enter one of these commands it is a

366
00:30:58,770 --> 00:31:04,620
valid air from the manual as well so if
you entered another command thats not

367
00:31:04,620 --> 00:31:09,169
supported you'd get an error message as
if it was an actual voters just didn't

368
00:31:09,170 --> 00:31:16,830
have that command yeah exactly and so
for instance the I 20100 command is a

369
00:31:16,830 --> 00:31:21,520
query for gas pump names that's all it
is literally an individual telling in

370
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:26,980
committing this command and getting back
the gas pump names what this is telling

371
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:30,860
us at this point the reason that we were
gathering this data statistic is because

372
00:31:30,860 --> 00:31:34,540
that tells us how much information these
individuals at least understood about

373
00:31:34,540 --> 00:31:38,180
these systems because let's face it if I
were to go out and tell that to a device

374
00:31:38,180 --> 00:31:43,830
on a non standard port that I didn't
know I wouldn't attempt to run I 20100

375
00:31:43,830 --> 00:31:49,639
means nothing to me so these specific
individual attempts to connect were

376
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:53,180
truly attempting to connect based on
these devices because they knew they

377
00:31:53,180 --> 00:31:59,120
fingerprinted them as 2001 and the issue
that command

378
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:02,500
so from an attack statistic standpoint
we thought it would be interesting to

379
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:06,710
compare the critical infrastructure
honey pots that I spoke about twenty

380
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:10,380
thirty black hat and non critical
infrastructure honey pots which is

381
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:17,390
considering this research over the time
in 2013 I deployed those in eight

382
00:32:17,390 --> 00:32:21,480
different countries and twelve different
deployment locations throughout those

383
00:32:21,480 --> 00:32:27,960
countries and there were 74 total
attacks and an entire year with this

384
00:32:27,960 --> 00:32:32,480
specific instance with gas pot and
looking in on critical infrastructure we

385
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:36,260
deployed in seven countries with a total
of 10 different employment some

386
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:40,850
countries having additional deployments
tus being one of those allegations with

387
00:32:40,850 --> 00:32:46,939
18 total attacks over six months so you
can see the attack statistic is not as

388
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:51,940
high as what you would maybe consider we
have some series behind that but those

389
00:32:51,940 --> 00:32:55,800
are just the areas we really we don't
have anything concrete me I haven't gone

390
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:59,080
down interviewed somebody that connected
to these and said why are you not going

391
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,550
after all why are you attacking these
electrical infrastructure something I'd

392
00:33:02,550 --> 00:33:05,090
like to do that so many of you have
connected to any of these devices over

393
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:10,720
the past six months please come talk to
me so we can get some more context so

394
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:20,920
right now all I'm showing on this
specific slide if I just give away my

395
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:31,330
Eddie Murphy slide that's a shame that's
the videos now being friendly what that

396
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:35,570
video was is us literally just
connecting with Kali into a gas pipe

397
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:40,800
instance locally and that's all we were
doing and issuing the I 20 20100 command

398
00:33:40,800 --> 00:33:42,919
that's all we were doing

399
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:48,650
Murphy slide is the best slide in the
entire deck just because it's it's good

400
00:33:48,650 --> 00:33:54,910
and what realistically I'm gonna jump
into now is intelligence behind who the

401
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:59,880
attackers possibly could have been again
with the caveat that attribution is only

402
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:04,720
as good as the data we have right we we
are not going to sit here and make

403
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:09,730
claims as to who they certainly are I'm
going to present the data and based on

404
00:34:09,730 --> 00:34:10,199
the data

405
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:17,939
we have say who it possibly could be so
please keep in mind before I really get

406
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:20,960
into that I want to kind of profile one
specific group and i dont lot of us have

407
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:26,270
heard about them and I know a lot of us
have heard specifics about the specific

408
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:32,179
group searc an electronic army that
particular group that started in 2010 or

409
00:34:32,179 --> 00:34:39,639
early 2011 they support at that time the
president of syria and this specific

410
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:44,530
actors are kind of what you consider for
lack of a better term script kiddies

411
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:48,879
they performed denial Services website
defacement malware distribution

412
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:56,549
information sharing underground forums
and just general mischief in general

413
00:34:56,550 --> 00:35:01,339
they've been fairly well known as far as
defacing fairly well-known media site

414
00:35:01,339 --> 00:35:06,799
NPR CBS Associated Press al-jazeera
etcetera and their tradition going after

415
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,720
those types of environments to make a
political statement of some sort

416
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:17,680
whatever we were going out and we were
looking at a specific attack against one

417
00:35:17,680 --> 00:35:22,319
of our honey pots in washingtonDC we
realize that there was a tremendous

418
00:35:22,319 --> 00:35:25,940
amount of traffic in my tremendous I'm
saying on these devices it was a

419
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:31,329
surprising amount for us for what we had
been seeing in the past in total there

420
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:35,089
was no service and distributed denial of
service based on multiple IP's which

421
00:35:35,089 --> 00:35:40,119
will provide you in the next slide it
was provided it was performed over two

422
00:35:40,119 --> 00:35:45,440
days and it was again provided and
performed on a gas-powered instance

423
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,930
deployed within washingtonDC in the last
statement here where i'm saying it

424
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:58,230
appears to be utilizing low orbit ion
cannon which is a very well-known script

425
00:35:58,230 --> 00:36:02,710
kiddie friendly tool that is
extraordinarily lame but very effective

426
00:36:02,710 --> 00:36:10,040
in a way that we had kind of come
possibly to the attribution of that was

427
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:16,040
simply by the message after two Get
Command which is SCA can go

428
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:21,730
that we ventured to correlate based on
multiple IP's with three of the primary

429
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:29,890
offenders being listed here those
specific nike's have had activity tied

430
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:34,140
to the Syrian electronic army over the
past three years in the past year has

431
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:38,920
been really fairly active the
interesting thing about this however is

432
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:42,970
the Syrian electronic army always makes
a point to publicly disclose their

433
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:46,359
operations and to publicly disclose and
say look what we're doing we're defacing

434
00:36:46,360 --> 00:36:52,070
ABC we're going after and PR etcetera
nothing has been disclosed of any sort

435
00:36:52,070 --> 00:36:58,030
by this group about any of this
reasoning behind that we don't know and

436
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:01,330
again this is just our best attempted
attribution it may not be these guys we

437
00:37:01,330 --> 00:37:04,450
don't know it could just be a false like
effort right they could just be piping

438
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:08,480
compromise boxes and putting traffic is
compromised boxes and Syria and then

439
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:13,380
move on with life we don't know where
only provided but the information so

440
00:37:13,380 --> 00:37:16,770
that's the first attack that we kind of
case studies out and kind of looked at

441
00:37:16,770 --> 00:37:23,720
from intelligence standpoint this second
if you remember in the slideshow in the

442
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:30,720
attack breakdown is an attack against
our jordanian honey pots keep in mind as

443
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,930
well that with these honey pots we
didn't just go out and buy Amazon ec2

444
00:37:34,930 --> 00:37:38,680
instances in those countries and employs
gaspar instances because any attack or

445
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:42,279
anybody for that matter will be able to
very quickly see it on Amazon instance

446
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:47,130
that's obvious at that point that it's
someone to point something on a virtual

447
00:37:47,130 --> 00:37:52,050
IP on an Amazon instance so we purchased
IP space locally for the country to

448
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:58,430
deploy them to give it at least the idea
that those ip spaces and that specific

449
00:37:58,430 --> 00:38:04,899
IP was owned by the organization running
these pops the Iranian dark odors is a

450
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:08,270
group primarily operating a group of
attackers primarily operating outside of

451
00:38:08,270 --> 00:38:15,880
Iran their pro-iranian so they're
pro-government Tehran and similar to the

452
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:21,440
SCA they primarily work on website
defacement denial of service attacks

453
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:25,050
information sharing and they're fairly
active in malware distribution as well

454
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:29,140
and they're also known to be doing quite
a bit

455
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:36,009
activism space these specific group of
the group that we think is performing

456
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:41,650
one of these attacks was a specific
attempt to modify the pumps themselves

457
00:38:41,650 --> 00:38:48,079
the attacks came from four primary IP is
listed here and they modified pump names

458
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:53,359
again with the caveat that from an
attribution standpoint we don't know

459
00:38:53,359 --> 00:38:57,410
necessarily if it could be a false flag
again they could be actress from outside

460
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:58,279
of that area

461
00:38:58,279 --> 00:39:04,910
piping through compromise boxes and
interesting point and the next question

462
00:39:04,910 --> 00:39:08,868
most of you probably a school where did
you come up with that idea and that it

463
00:39:08,869 --> 00:39:15,309
IDC it's very apparent they modified
part number 12 say hacked by IDC teen

464
00:39:15,309 --> 00:39:20,630
okay at that point I'd been following
the IDC team for a little bit so i

465
00:39:20,630 --> 00:39:25,510
really recognize that to some degree to
go refresh myself and I said ok well

466
00:39:25,510 --> 00:39:30,619
that's interesting we check the number
one within jordan the second deployed

467
00:39:30,619 --> 00:39:35,029
instance within jordan and you can see
that number one on that specific pump

468
00:39:35,029 --> 00:39:41,029
our gas pot instance was deleted and pop
my number three was modified with a hot

469
00:39:41,029 --> 00:39:45,539
was here and at that point I said ok I
don't recognize that I don't know what a

470
00:39:45,539 --> 00:39:51,700
hot is here is about so I went out and
did a little Google search for a HOD was

471
00:39:51,700 --> 00:39:56,669
here and I was presented with that which
if you look at the bottom it says a hot

472
00:39:56,670 --> 00:40:02,130
was here and this was on the compromised
web page web page to pick the defacement

473
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:05,829
and then we started to correlate those
lines and say ok this is fairly

474
00:40:05,829 --> 00:40:10,970
interesting because we now know that at
least IDC hot is a member of IDC

475
00:40:10,970 --> 00:40:14,649
probably working in tandem to some
regard

476
00:40:14,650 --> 00:40:20,289
you know we can then start to say that
might be an attribution case some other

477
00:40:20,289 --> 00:40:27,880
interesting note about this odd listen
that he hacks he hack hacks we've

478
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:31,740
hacking hacking I don't know what that
means but he's involved in hacking in

479
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:36,390
some regard any kind of this out and
busy with his profile within IDC's forum

480
00:40:36,390 --> 00:40:39,578
another interesting point is that

481
00:40:39,579 --> 00:40:47,229
at IDC has started over the past over
the past year realistically become very

482
00:40:47,229 --> 00:40:52,578
interested in state environments reports
SCADA infrastructure how protocols work

483
00:40:52,579 --> 00:40:59,390
and all of those kind of rare
information chunks right stuff that a

484
00:40:59,390 --> 00:41:04,420
generic individual wouldn't necessarily
know and this is just a screenshot of a

485
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:07,749
specific individual this is not a hot
this was another individual on the IDC

486
00:41:07,749 --> 00:41:13,749
board that trading skate information if
you go out to their actual forum you can

487
00:41:13,749 --> 00:41:18,209
start to see they're becoming very
active and get a malware interest as

488
00:41:18,209 --> 00:41:26,219
well as just generic skate information
so again those are the only two case

489
00:41:26,219 --> 00:41:29,969
studies were gonna really cover and the
talk primarily again because we're still

490
00:41:29,969 --> 00:41:34,420
digesting that information and we've
expanded the actual gas pipe project and

491
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:42,900
the gas spot instances a little bit
further out worldwide so what we're

492
00:41:42,900 --> 00:41:49,519
gonna do as of today as I'm releasing
her we're releasing actual code for gas

493
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:54,640
pot provided here's the ghetto blink you
can get to it as well as a Google URL

494
00:41:54,640 --> 00:41:59,769
shortened version of it for the two long
dinner each person personnel here so

495
00:41:59,769 --> 00:42:05,439
what you can do with this is go through
the code you can review the code you can

496
00:42:05,440 --> 00:42:10,539
run the code on your own and have your
own gas pot instance running out there

497
00:42:10,539 --> 00:42:15,059
analog it locally and you can see if
some interesting if anyone's out there

498
00:42:15,059 --> 00:42:22,420
looking for stuff in your region there's
coding caveat stand I would recommend

499
00:42:22,420 --> 00:42:27,119
changing as I mentioned before some of
the things specific regions or even run

500
00:42:27,119 --> 00:42:35,049
it to fall as a randomized values but
there's only about 10 and station names

501
00:42:35,049 --> 00:42:40,529
you can add 200 medley from it every
time you run it will like a randomized

502
00:42:40,529 --> 00:42:42,450
'as even that station name

503
00:42:42,450 --> 00:42:47,770
chooses it out of the race so if you
want to be one specific one remove it

504
00:42:47,770 --> 00:42:54,160
and there's ones that have multiple
lines as an example I kind of dumb down

505
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:58,520
the ones that we were using specifically
and didn't put them in their minds the

506
00:42:58,520 --> 00:43:05,050
fuel companies some of the ones we were
running aren't included as I say we kind

507
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:08,800
of altered some of them to be
region-specific to see if they got any

508
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:12,400
attention as well so those are then
there's again look at my code and go

509
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:18,520
find ours on on jordan also keep in mind
that if anybody is actively wanting

510
00:43:18,520 --> 00:43:23,390
anybody makes active changes to the code
etc let us know because it would be

511
00:43:23,390 --> 00:43:26,980
interesting to see what people change
and see what people find valuable out of

512
00:43:26,980 --> 00:43:31,940
the code that would also be beneficial
for us so a lot of blood at designed we

513
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:39,099
went into to make it look like no honey
pot is out there that I know of right

514
00:43:39,099 --> 00:43:47,960
now it looks very much like a guardian
AST the only thing I would do is add

515
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:52,650
more commands but I know it didn't see
anyone's of interest but maybe something

516
00:43:52,650 --> 00:43:54,460
will add in the future

517
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:57,359
continue the growth of it to make it
look more and more and more and more

518
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:03,869
like a garden St and their hopes is that
with releasing honey pots like this

519
00:44:03,869 --> 00:44:07,579
people should know that they're out
there and questioned if you're

520
00:44:07,579 --> 00:44:08,940
connecting to a real one

521
00:44:08,940 --> 00:44:15,710
honey pot with that we left enough
information enough time at the end for

522
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:29,250
any questions you may have

523
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:37,130
the question was what was the period of
time and where any of the militias time

524
00:44:37,130 --> 00:44:41,290
from which we are running this was
primarily mostly in 2015 realistically

525
00:44:41,290 --> 00:44:48,509
started when we start this early
February roughly up until we started to

526
00:44:48,510 --> 00:44:58,130
change about two weeks ago from a
militia standpoint I think it depends on

527
00:44:58,130 --> 00:45:02,190
what your term or what your defining as
malicious

528
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:07,190
you can't overfill attacked the only
thing yeah the only thing you can do is

529
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:13,420
change the tank diameters to make it
look like it's always form we did not

530
00:45:13,420 --> 00:45:18,280
see any of those types of commands now
when they're changing the tank named as

531
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:23,420
we showed in that one example that's not
publicly known that the commander it's

532
00:45:23,420 --> 00:45:27,880
not well known it's not the one tht more
has released or anything like that about

533
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:32,540
the command itself so somebody it read
the manual to figure out how to change

534
00:45:32,540 --> 00:45:38,040
the tank I mean based off of some basic
understanding of those you would try cuz

535
00:45:38,040 --> 00:45:44,850
we listed showed you the 20100 command
that command lists all tanks now she

536
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:56,360
tried to set a tank name with us or just
said 608 262 hundred command that will

537
00:45:56,360 --> 00:46:03,120
change all of the tanks 21 so you have
to iterate through them so they knew

538
00:46:03,120 --> 00:46:08,990
enough to change the first tank and the
third tank also keep in mind that this

539
00:46:08,990 --> 00:46:12,979
can be a precursor right oftentimes will
see with these types of things and in

540
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:17,170
this was also relevant in the 2013
research that I was doing regarding

541
00:46:17,170 --> 00:46:21,130
critical infrastructure this could be a
precursor for further attacks at a later

542
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:26,530
date so they might have been profile in
these environments to then go back at a

543
00:46:26,530 --> 00:46:29,910
later date he start to affect except
they might have just been querying these

544
00:46:29,910 --> 00:46:34,060
as a first kind of reconnaissance
attempt and then going later on to do

545
00:46:34,060 --> 00:46:49,080
additional tax or or additional
malicious activities that make sense

546
00:46:49,080 --> 00:47:01,520
yeah that's a good question not a lot so
certain bitterroot I'm sorry I'm sorry

547
00:47:01,520 --> 00:47:07,750
yeah the question was what is being done
on these devices to prevent these types

548
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:12,360
of attacks outside of lack of knowledge
about the commands the answer is

549
00:47:12,360 --> 00:47:17,940
unfortunately not much there are certain
Peter Ruhe products that allow a four

550
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:22,840
digit PIN to be entered in keeping in
mind that pen is numeric only values

551
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:31,180
13900 contracts are big difference and
it's actually a physical style they have

552
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:31,899
to change it on

553
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:40,340
yeah yeah it's a physical dial and that
and keep in mind that by default that is

554
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:45,960
not enabled so we're often we've been
getting asked have we notified via root

555
00:47:45,960 --> 00:47:51,850
of this issue and it's it's a catch 22
because it's kind of like that's the way

556
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:59,040
it's designed they're aware of it that
it's in my opinion a design flow and you

557
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:03,980
know there are limited aspects of again
like pin accelerator available but

558
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:06,330
they're not enabled by default and
they're not enabled on every single

559
00:48:06,330 --> 00:48:11,569
product that they offer much like most
of your industrial control systems out

560
00:48:11,570 --> 00:48:16,510
there is no authentication and
encryption the original design behind

561
00:48:16,510 --> 00:48:24,630
these wasn't go hang them up on the
internet so that's why you see to me a

562
00:48:24,630 --> 00:48:28,760
pregnancy of these in the us- and
because we really like to just sit on

563
00:48:28,760 --> 00:48:33,070
the internet make it is an automated as
possible so the tanks don't get it do

564
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:38,820
you have to call somebody and so on and
so forth but it it this device itself

565
00:48:38,820 --> 00:48:43,930
speaks a lot to the same issues that all
your other does your control system

566
00:48:43,930 --> 00:49:01,140
devices have as well

567
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:17,509
just in the broad industrial control
system security realm anyway which is

568
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:23,750
these devices need to have some security
built into them and authentication more

569
00:49:23,750 --> 00:49:30,059
than a four digit PIN user privileges
and even to the point where these should

570
00:49:30,059 --> 00:49:35,910
be not allowed on the internet you
should have to VPN to it to connect to

571
00:49:35,910 --> 00:49:40,720
it so you can limit the number of people
who can actually get to the device as

572
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,788
well and in my opinion I mean it really
comes down to the fact that this is a

573
00:49:43,789 --> 00:49:48,069
implementation fail on a lot of regard
because they should be playing this on

574
00:49:48,069 --> 00:49:52,670
the internet right place a simple like
take it off the internet that least

575
00:49:52,670 --> 00:50:11,060
lowers the risk profile by some degree

576
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:18,250
so the question was are in the logging
scheme of gas pot does it also log other

577
00:50:18,250 --> 00:50:22,750
commands that are issued yes it will

578
00:50:22,750 --> 00:50:27,230
anything you type in an hour after your
initial connection a law gets so we did

579
00:50:27,230 --> 00:50:31,790
look through the logs to see if there
was any other valid attempts that I was

580
00:50:31,790 --> 00:50:37,430
not accepting and I said earlier it
would produce an error to the end user

581
00:50:37,430 --> 00:50:43,609
but we did not see anything outside of
the six command was implemented but as

582
00:50:43,610 --> 00:50:45,620
more people great gain aware of this

583
00:50:45,620 --> 00:50:49,560
realize the manuals are out there can
read through can find other interesting

584
00:50:49,560 --> 00:51:05,560
commands it's possible

585
00:51:05,560 --> 00:51:14,410
ground tanks are in there so the
question is why between 50 and 60

586
00:51:14,410 --> 00:51:18,940
degrees and the reason rationale behind
that was your tanks are on the ground

587
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:25,150
and that's the range in which you can
depending on soil how far down it is and

588
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:36,630
where it's the point yeah I mean maybe a
little warmer but honestly my life how

589
00:51:36,630 --> 00:51:54,850
many people really like temperatures
just a little too warm for that region

590
00:51:54,850 --> 00:52:03,120
the question was denial of service that
was performed did it appear targeted or

591
00:52:03,120 --> 00:52:08,799
did it appear to be just happenstance
there's a few things to that in my

592
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:12,670
opinion we don't have any indicators
show was targeted whatsoever

593
00:52:12,670 --> 00:52:18,050
Eyed Peas were sequential for the most
part which makes it seem as those boxes

594
00:52:18,050 --> 00:52:22,010
were working in tandem unfortunately we
didn't have any other boxes deployed in

595
00:52:22,010 --> 00:52:26,740
the same subnet that we could watch a
concurrence DeLoss across the entire /

596
00:52:26,740 --> 00:52:31,020
24 percent since so we don't know
necessarily fit with target or not we

597
00:52:31,020 --> 00:52:36,600
just know that the end result was the
system going offline which on the scale

598
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:41,700
of ICS kato and World Environment
unfortunately a majority of the time

599
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:45,230
these attacks don't have to be targeted
to have a massive outage or massive

600
00:52:45,230 --> 00:52:49,340
issue so the end result is what is a
concern in my opinion versus is a target

601
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:53,440
but that's a very valid question and I
wish looking back that's something that

602
00:52:53,440 --> 00:52:57,460
we're starting to modify the research on
is deploying concurrent boxes in the

603
00:52:57,460 --> 00:53:02,880
same subnet to be able to watch if
there's you know entire / 24 for

604
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:12,670
instance being attacked but

605
00:53:12,670 --> 00:53:18,160
so I don't have that number on hand to
be honest we started to see a

606
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:23,509
degradation of service at right at about
one but the minimum amount I don't know

607
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:30,569
unfortunately I can I can't say sorry
thanks a lot of everybody we're gonna be

608
00:53:30,569 --> 00:53:31,410
around two weeks of you
