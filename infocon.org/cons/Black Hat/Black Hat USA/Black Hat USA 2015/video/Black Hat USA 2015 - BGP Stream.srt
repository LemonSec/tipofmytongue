1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:19,120
everybody here than ever

2
00:00:19,120 --> 00:01:07,760
today announced that a little bit
because previous year ago

3
00:01:07,760 --> 00:02:19,579
you know company which program

4
00:02:19,580 --> 00:03:41,380
chopping up almost

5
00:03:41,380 --> 00:05:27,659
should rather it's about each just then
so should the 60

6
00:05:27,660 --> 00:06:32,980
up here all the first option so
dedicated

7
00:06:32,980 --> 00:07:55,350
a pretty good hitter there so this is
very well but this is why there's so few

8
00:07:55,350 --> 00:09:05,420
so this is where they say you know so
they also share this view / just so why

9
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:58,930
is that so

10
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:23,719
this is something that had also lost
their last century old habits and

11
00:10:23,720 --> 00:11:51,889
occasional users or the other as they
decide to do so many others

12
00:11:51,889 --> 00:13:36,970
think about what would happen if I like
very scary out there so they set out to

13
00:13:36,970 --> 00:13:40,930
do

14
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:54,160
so

15
00:13:54,160 --> 00:14:50,140
but it shows so this is particularly so
this happen for our whole second there

16
00:14:50,140 --> 00:15:05,480
so it's not usually there are our 84 the
sort

17
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:51,290
others also publish only just

18
00:15:51,290 --> 00:16:44,250
this is creepy but hopes all this place

19
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:48,190
play it

20
00:16:48,190 --> 00:17:00,070
which requires

21
00:17:00,070 --> 00:17:44,770
that's dollars so that's an example of
this is all I still out

22
00:17:44,770 --> 00:18:10,279
see also show you

23
00:18:10,279 --> 00:19:04,540
website there right now these are all
right now

24
00:19:04,540 --> 00:19:56,409
work so we started out so that's what we
expect our station is a very harsh

25
00:19:56,410 --> 00:20:30,119
people tell us what is expected to set
up all their shows how so

26
00:20:30,119 --> 00:20:42,539
about your

27
00:20:42,539 --> 00:21:17,240
usually look at it

28
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:28,150
well

29
00:21:28,150 --> 00:21:45,670
harsh but they also

30
00:21:45,670 --> 00:22:12,470
very interesting and all the different
prefix

31
00:22:12,470 --> 00:23:00,390
ask but it's so there's all sorts pretty
happy

32
00:23:00,390 --> 00:23:19,610
alright so this project action on a
regular job

33
00:23:19,610 --> 00:23:37,669
so once the creative arts part of how we
can see the sights on her own and

34
00:23:37,670 --> 00:24:00,760
whatever is there another way to be
dramatic or so we created a wave the

35
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:18,360
data is limited to find all the
connected all day with an AAS start off

36
00:24:18,360 --> 00:24:42,479
with that number where there in those
days shall prevail with it you know you

37
00:24:42,480 --> 00:25:04,440
do that sucks we also better way to
build

38
00:25:04,440 --> 00:25:28,520
so that for you so so much that ate up
to 5 30 seconds but I kind of sped up

39
00:25:28,520 --> 00:26:02,560
the relationships of the graph file into
this too so this whole relationship

40
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:21,840
starting up in the air like a different
note lets see all the verses domain

41
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:46,620
whois information so that once we are
solely on it

42
00:26:46,620 --> 00:27:06,250
this is so then better one which is
actually Go Daddy go to ships within the

43
00:27:06,250 --> 00:27:22,940
middle is building up all the right way
to use to grab the relationships are

44
00:27:22,940 --> 00:27:41,059
their number for more information so a
plan to utilize

45
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:53,700
so you know what one of those the
largest Internet

46
00:27:53,700 --> 00:28:16,250
obviously very well known as I said it
and we service so we can cause a lot of

47
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:19,160
problems DNS

48
00:28:19,160 --> 00:28:22,610
so we all right

49
00:28:22,610 --> 00:28:25,850
and are you the Internet today

50
00:28:25,850 --> 00:28:39,178
84 connection that is on our website at
the number of service personnel got the

51
00:28:39,179 --> 00:28:48,040
user service used basically every single
day six different countries but

52
00:28:48,040 --> 00:29:15,580
sixty-five million older goes down their
website you go to person

53
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:46,639
attacks to folks this is so over the
Registrar don't know but essentially

54
00:29:46,640 --> 00:30:20,300
they actually all properties for their
teachers to have relationships outside

55
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:34,020
of this was that Webster City there and
the new york times so because they were

56
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:42,760
all this in a while we had a lot of time
in Australia

57
00:30:42,760 --> 00:30:49,639
number

58
00:30:49,639 --> 00:31:06,279
example problem but he's not deface
website what they did was to expire

59
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:17,119
which had the logo on their site to see
what happened was we saw the address

60
00:31:17,119 --> 00:31:44,238
it's actually going there but January
they changed their minds

61
00:31:44,239 --> 00:32:06,299
what's going to Knotts example other
government we're going through and and

62
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:20,259
website online voting for the hotline
and she's like an hour later than one

63
00:32:20,259 --> 00:32:34,790
out so there's a massive gas range

64
00:32:34,790 --> 00:33:03,309
so we are all which is on twitter
twitter is to share data but also it

65
00:33:03,309 --> 00:33:19,928
closed closed while they're all now I'm
not tried it so you only need to really

66
00:33:19,929 --> 00:33:38,369
focus because there is a nice out there
so the first one is changing so that we

67
00:33:38,369 --> 00:33:53,709
hope that these examples here is not
always necessarily bad but it does

68
00:33:53,710 --> 00:34:03,769
happen but there are 12 lol it's a huge
Google chief just outside of that she

69
00:34:03,769 --> 00:34:16,310
here and we can now with the location
that regional location will announce

70
00:34:16,310 --> 00:34:43,679
us so we see a lot of us or we did to us
and we can take 202 million and we will

71
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:55,719
do all that walking traffic going to
that that block course we also let's see

72
00:34:55,719 --> 00:35:00,740
these are all happening we also tell you

73
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:16,020
top here who also tell you where major
major a tractor

74
00:35:16,020 --> 00:35:41,790
polishes twitter.com her you seem like a
bad previous so cool

75
00:35:41,790 --> 00:35:48,960
nation now

76
00:35:48,960 --> 00:36:15,950
cannot do all this project we are first
priority really is around and just

77
00:36:15,950 --> 00:36:27,240
trying to figure out the ballots is
pretty bad and that it had stopped where

78
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:33,009
do we go

79
00:36:33,010 --> 00:37:14,980
part 22 just that the only time that
integration so you will be able to build

80
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:48,260
so all also announced that we hear a lot
about a year or more are back now is

81
00:37:48,260 --> 00:38:34,190
that yes or no questions we know that
contracting to do so this is that it's

82
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:55,410
you by our services are you gonna be
ready to the data we didn't get the CD

83
00:38:55,410 --> 00:38:59,899
it would be so

84
00:38:59,900 --> 00:39:16,140
but we are gonna work out how to get
that balance ok can you elaborate area

85
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:22,598
talking about the originating if
somebody is announcing a farting yes

86
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:28,150
basis i'm saying is he really use it is
indeed just faking a link to the Rio s

87
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:33,579
added announcing it so it still makes
fake from the right and but from the

88
00:39:33,579 --> 00:39:34,820
wrong pops

89
00:39:34,820 --> 00:39:45,029
you could tell you if you look so I also

90
00:39:45,029 --> 00:40:40,559
it'll take a link to the latest if they
usually happening there so you look at

91
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:45,690
it here ok

92
00:40:45,690 --> 00:41:59,160
Anderson Q 41 yes I not connected or is
that

93
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:16,940
like you might just as well

94
00:42:16,940 --> 00:42:41,109
recover hijacked BGP route I'm wondering
if your hope is that this will make it

95
00:42:41,109 --> 00:42:46,020
easier with greater transparency greater
visibility and community and all helped

96
00:42:46,020 --> 00:43:00,099
recover and if so how does this bill but
the first thing you do is reached out

97
00:43:00,099 --> 00:43:33,070
the successful you'll have to reach out
to their wife works great thanks

98
00:43:33,070 --> 00:43:38,370
for your cup

99
00:43:38,370 --> 00:43:45,880
who suffer an accent jackie because you
don't pay the bill and ice people by

100
00:43:45,880 --> 00:44:00,290
their do everything they can to so do
your counter new BB stream are focused

101
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:06,200
on this unintentional hijacking too so
we cannot

102
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:23,270
back to come out alright prone because
when we call days

103
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:36,670
attack you haven't paid take away the
GLD distrust and once they were empty

104
00:44:36,670 --> 00:45:00,839
without internet in South American
country and then you need me I don't

105
00:45:00,839 --> 00:45:08,480
understand the importance of layers or
network administrator nothing to do with

106
00:45:08,480 --> 00:45:18,150
the a national thing starts

107
00:45:18,150 --> 00:45:53,200
record that somewhere else

108
00:45:53,200 --> 00:46:09,370
also your script are you those details
secure each trip is actually not like

109
00:46:09,370 --> 00:46:48,868
wait what medicaid medicaid is a lot of
people that are out there it's also

110
00:46:48,869 --> 00:47:05,039
larger prefix announcing / 16 and the
other 20 like a size 24 hour that a

111
00:47:05,039 --> 00:47:11,680
higher priority would it be possible on
hijacked like let's say someone it I get

112
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:14,390
your address space did you announce you
be more specific

113
00:47:14,390 --> 00:47:20,269
prefix hijacking that way yeah that's
why I should be sure to purchase tix to

114
00:47:20,269 --> 00:47:51,578
that sort of 35 basic question is let's
say you don't have your own Hansen how

115
00:47:51,579 --> 00:47:54,810
hard would it be for someone militias

116
00:47:54,810 --> 00:48:30,000
probably does is it like you mentioned
seems like a drop in DNS for a

117
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:38,360
particular tax no posts EGP attack other
ways you found used in Estacada

118
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:44,880
a story of what happened grounding of
the examples that come out that is

119
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:59,780
relieved now

120
00:48:59,780 --> 00:49:10,750
now they're like old ship belleau top
two in some of its riders

121
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:32,300
other ones do the actual es

122
00:49:32,300 --> 00:50:06,220
also see you there

123
00:50:06,220 --> 00:50:26,480
if you see your things happen and
certainly not be able to place explodes

124
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:41,530
everyone in the end up seems to like
doesn't gases and other CDs is used

125
00:50:41,530 --> 00:50:59,050
because it's not so no worries it but
it's really understand that it doesn't

126
00:50:59,050 --> 00:51:08,080
solve the problem complete in the sense

127
00:51:08,080 --> 00:51:34,270
when they're not even at its worst since
it will take care of what's the

128
00:51:34,270 --> 00:51:40,640
controversy and then to did you play
into your rule logic terms determining

129
00:51:40,640 --> 00:52:19,890
whether something good about so yeah
everybody out her she doesn't fall their

130
00:52:19,890 --> 00:52:28,109
way out
