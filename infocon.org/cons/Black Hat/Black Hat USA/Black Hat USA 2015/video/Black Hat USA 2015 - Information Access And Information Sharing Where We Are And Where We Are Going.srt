1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,920
good afternoon so I mentioned dude James
who just introduced me as so elegantly

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:14,950
that if you have questions or comments
don't wait until I finish sharing my

3
00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:22,198
thoughts with you ask them or make them
whenever you so so fields hard for me to

4
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:27,599
actually see very well with the with the
lights but so feel free to the shower

5
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,430
and won't be the first time I heard
shouts when I share my thoughts with

6
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:37,590
folks because we're recording we would
ask to use the mics are located in each

7
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,309
one of the aisles when I see you I will
point to let you know that time to ask

8
00:00:42,309 --> 00:00:49,320
question so so let me share with you in
the in the broadest sense what homeland

9
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,690
security means it means really
fundamentally the security of our

10
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:00,800
institutions the security of our way of
life and I think very importantly the

11
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:07,310
security of our values and the Internet
and the ethics of communication and

12
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:16,540
engagement via that network is very much
a part of what we do and it is clear

13
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:23,009
that the challenges to network security
are immense and quite frankly are

14
00:01:23,009 --> 00:01:30,350
escalating teaching everyday and we as a
government or making advancements in our

15
00:01:30,350 --> 00:01:35,130
work in this area but I think everyone
understands and we most certainly do

16
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:42,539
that we are not where we need to gate
and so that is why I come here quite

17
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:48,950
frankly 22 black had to share some
thoughts with you about our vision and

18
00:01:48,950 --> 00:01:56,729
to really hopefully elicit your thoughts
and then but because it is quite frankly

19
00:01:56,729 --> 00:02:01,439
breathtaking the talent and expertise
that exists in this room and throughout

20
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,600
this conference and we need

21
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:11,440
and ask for your assistance in the work
that we are doing you know the secretary

22
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,290
and I every morning get an intelligence
and information

23
00:02:15,290 --> 00:02:21,900
briefing about that the rats in the
events that are occurring or have

24
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,900
recently occurred not only domestically
but throughout the world and

25
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:34,260
increasingly the cyber security and
network security events are becoming

26
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:40,230
more and more prominent in those
briefings on a daily on a daily basis

27
00:02:40,230 --> 00:02:50,429
and it speaks to the challenges that we
face and it is clear as i travel around

28
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:58,310
the country and speak with companies and
experts in this arena that the state of

29
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:04,709
affairs is rather turbulence and and
that reality i think is echoed when I

30
00:03:04,709 --> 00:03:08,280
engage internationally as well

31
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:14,720
whether it's with companies that are
domiciled in other nations or speaking

32
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,600
with my government counterparts around
the world network security and the

33
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:25,799
challenges to that security are
increasing prioritisation and quite

34
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:34,500
frankly of increasing concern and so
it's clear that the current state of

35
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:40,660
affairs and individualized or solo
response to those challenges in those

36
00:03:40,660 --> 00:03:47,140
threats is not working as a bleak as we
would want to ensure that the Internet

37
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:54,809
is duly protected arena of free
expression free communication and we in

38
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:59,329
the Department of Homeland Security
consider ourselves uniquely situated

39
00:03:59,329 --> 00:04:04,700
within the federal government construct
two addressed that challenges and to

40
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:08,339
address those threats as a facilitator

41
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:15,569
an enabler of the private sector and i
want to i get if i can explain for a

42
00:04:15,569 --> 00:04:20,870
moment why that is so the Department of
Homeland Security is a civilian agency

43
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:27,290
and we stand at the intersection of four
critical stakeholders the private sector

44
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:33,240
the enforcement community the
intelligence community and then our own

45
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:40,250
our own departmental responsibilities in
protecting the dot gov space and it is

46
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:48,940
in recognition of our unique place at
the intersection of the work of those

47
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:56,110
four key stakeholders that we created
our critical response protocols and are

48
00:04:56,110 --> 00:05:01,500
critical response organization in the
end cake an organization that I think

49
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:08,979
that I hope all of you are familiar with
the the National cybersecurity and

50
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:17,360
communications integration center and
critically it is not a body that seeks

51
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:25,360
to determine and find accountability but
rather to facilitate the response and

52
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:33,000
remediation of incidents and the
protection of networks for the future

53
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:40,750
the NK is staffed with remarkable talent
that is dedicated to the sharing of

54
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:48,820
information that we obtain through our
channels the ability to utilize that

55
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:54,240
information and disseminated we do that
every day the private sector and

56
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,940
government partners are represented on
the floor of the incorrect the end kick

57
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:05,430
and two assists in the response and
remediation and we have actually teams

58
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:12,180
that travel to the locations where
incidents have occurred to assist in the

59
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:17,250
response protocols we have as I
mentioned as a result of our unique

60
00:06:17,250 --> 00:06:19,380
position the ability

61
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:24,680
take for example classified information
and with our government partners

62
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:27,850
declassified and disseminated

63
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:33,010
more broadly we share now

64
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:38,599
information through bulletins through
alerts through person to person or

65
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:48,350
entity to entity channels we do it in a
in a form that is not automated and I'll

66
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:56,840
speak in a moment about that we also in
recognition I think the the president

67
00:06:56,840 --> 00:07:03,349
and recognition of our unique place in
the federal government in his last

68
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:08,740
executive order I placed us in a
position of responsibility to lead the

69
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:14,110
effort in the formation of information
sharing and Analysis organizations

70
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:19,160
the organizations that will hopefully
flourish in the private sector so that

71
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:24,870
the private sector can communicate a
critical information amongst themselves

72
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:30,060
so that you can share information and
hopefully shirt with us for wider

73
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:35,040
dissemination in this month we are
designating the institution after a

74
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:40,160
request for proposal a solicitation for
designating the institution that will

75
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,760
establish the best practices for a high
salary information sharing and Analysis

76
00:07:44,760 --> 00:07:55,880
organizations what is our vision for the
future it is an automated and in near

77
00:07:55,880 --> 00:08:02,480
real-time capacity to share information
that we received so that we can

78
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:07,720
disseminate broadly and strengthen the
ecosystem at least

79
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:14,370
raised the bar and level set the
capacity of the private sector to

80
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:22,510
protect itself and for our government
partners to protect themselves up so

81
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:31,570
when a cyberthreat indicator is shared
with us when a particular organization

82
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:38,030
suffers an attack we can receive that
information and automated form and in

83
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:44,339
near real-time disseminated more broadly
so that the replication of that threat

84
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:51,710
does not occur and I think it's very
important to identify another critical

85
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:56,140
element of our uniqueness and the
Department of Homeland Security and that

86
00:08:56,140 --> 00:09:01,810
is that we are the only department that
has a statutorily created office of

87
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:05,930
privacy and office of civil rights and
civil liberties and so we are very

88
00:09:05,930 --> 00:09:11,569
mindful and quite frankly in the
development of legislation we have

89
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:17,160
articulated the importance of this we
are very mindful of privacy interests as

90
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:24,990
well as civil liberty interests and
those important equities are brought to

91
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:29,590
bear in the development of our framework
and in the execution of our

92
00:09:29,590 --> 00:09:36,440
responsibilities and so when we received
a saber a cyberthreat indicator we would

93
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:40,970
we would ensure that the privacy
interest in the civil liberty interests

94
00:09:40,970 --> 00:09:47,170
are protected as we receive that and as
we push out the information that would

95
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:53,349
equip others those necklace hear my
colleague from the Department of

96
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:59,380
Homeland Security it is this is her
vision and what she is I think named it

97
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:05,850
as a weather map so when one institution
suffers a threat

98
00:10:05,850 --> 00:10:12,220
the question is can we avoid the
replication of that threat by another

99
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:18,960
institution and and therefore really a
level set the playing field to better

100
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:26,830
protect the ecosystem as a whole there
is one important element that we

101
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:32,940
recognize that is a challenge in
achieving I think the full potential of

102
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,610
our vision

103
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:41,880
and that is the issue of trust and that
that issue of trust I think emanates

104
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:48,380
from a number of different sources
whether it is the government's

105
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:54,640
collection and analysis of information
practices whether it is confidence in

106
00:10:54,640 --> 00:11:01,160
the government's ability to secure the
information it receives or whether it is

107
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:08,779
any other factor we understand the trust
deficit that exists in the community and

108
00:11:08,779 --> 00:11:17,329
our view is as follows the best way to
tackle a trust deficit is to build trust

109
00:11:17,329 --> 00:11:25,189
and that is not an overnight process it
may very well be an incremental process

110
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:33,200
but it has to start somewhere and so
what I would ask is that we be given the

111
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:40,600
opportunity to reach whatever trust
deficit exists in your in your minds and

112
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:48,160
he knew practices and let's start
somewhere and so as we develop now the

113
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:55,469
automated capacity to receive and Julie
and to disseminate cyberthreat

114
00:11:55,470 --> 00:12:01,660
indicators and we will do so in a
formulaic were standardized way who

115
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:08,029
sticks in taxi system we ask that you
give us a chance that you share some

116
00:12:08,029 --> 00:12:13,730
information with us and allow us to
prove our capabilities and approved the

117
00:12:13,730 --> 00:12:19,300
results sir thank you

118
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:27,719
everyone's so they can take my question
if your time this morning or afternoon

119
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,730
as the case may be

120
00:12:28,730 --> 00:12:33,600
first you talk can you give us a little
an insider's view into the department's

121
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:40,050
activities in the wake and the
occurrence of both Sony and OPM of

122
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:43,269
course spending the proverbial can tell
you pending investigation right whatever

123
00:12:43,269 --> 00:12:45,940
you can share but they would be very
interesting and enlightening as you

124
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:50,810
talked about DHS be at the next between
Intel law enforcement etcetera can you

125
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:53,279
give us a little bit an insider's view
about what happened when the phone rang

126
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,950
at first day the department's activities
with the coordination happen in things

127
00:12:56,950 --> 00:13:00,750
that we may not have been aware that you
were all doing to facilitate that so

128
00:13:00,750 --> 00:13:05,910
that everybody here that that question
so that's an all those incidents are

129
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:13,269
required to call and response because of
their magnitude and and the consequences

130
00:13:13,269 --> 00:13:19,000
that follow what we have done in a
number of incidents whether it's in

131
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,050
those orange others quite frankly is of
course we we gather the information but

132
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:30,859
our search teams are computer emergency
readiness teams respond to locations and

133
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:40,800
assist victims other tax identification
of the actor and the explosion of the

134
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:44,199
actor and critically in the remediation

135
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:53,490
that that must must follow so we in the
OPM breach that are our search team was

136
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:57,680
very engaged in in those
responsibilities and those actions and I

137
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:04,689
think it's very public train known that
as an administration has a government

138
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:10,860
with large we through the leadership of
the white house I developed a thirty-day

139
00:14:10,860 --> 00:14:16,120
sprint regime to ensure that other
government agencies in the wake of the

140
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:16,760
old p.m.

141
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:24,740
reach other government agencies and
their network security defenses to the

142
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:29,360
extent possible within a short sprint
and then are engaging in the longer-term

143
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:38,130
effort to ensure their security
mechanisms with that the senate wasn't

144
00:14:38,130 --> 00:14:41,890
able to get to see before they left on
break but many have said that they do

145
00:14:41,890 --> 00:14:46,470
plan on taking it up this before the
budget can you talk a little bit about

146
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:54,220
as you said these dangers WI sells
houses and other legislation will affect

147
00:14:54,220 --> 00:15:00,510
the creation of those so I'm not that's
an interesting question of how the

148
00:15:00,510 --> 00:15:06,790
legislation will impact the ice house
and the creation of those I think what's

149
00:15:06,790 --> 00:15:13,069
important for us with respect to assist
in the legislation is how it impacts the

150
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:16,060
provision of information to the
government and the government's ability

151
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:21,640
to disseminated in autumn is in near
real time as possible I think that has

152
00:15:21,640 --> 00:15:23,580
been our focus with respected

153
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:30,250
primarily number one identifying the
Department of Homeland Security

154
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:34,930
hopefully in the legislation as the
primary order to receive information

155
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:39,229
from the private sector for the various
reasons that I have identified because

156
00:15:39,230 --> 00:15:44,300
of our unique position in the federal
government as well as our unique

157
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:48,839
responsibilities from a privacy and
civil rights civil liberties perspective

158
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:55,580
and of course it significantly impacts
the ability of private entities to share

159
00:15:55,580 --> 00:16:00,510
information and hopefully removes an
obstacle and that obstacle is concerned

160
00:16:00,510 --> 00:16:04,760
about liability exposure out I'll give
further thought if I made to the

161
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:12,560
question of how it impacts the ice else
sort of the center here thank you for

162
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:16,089
being here have a question about the
equipment for sure sectors and

163
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:18,560
specifically the defense

164
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:27,209
industrial base what do you see as far
as I apologize with the defense

165
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:35,150
industrial base critical infrastructure
sector what's your analysis on the

166
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:39,890
private industries participation with
reporting incidents from the private

167
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:45,550
industry all the more critical when it
involves critical infrastructure how's

168
00:16:45,550 --> 00:16:50,500
that for the used the same German twice
in one sense that is a pivotal

169
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:52,600
information I will tell you

170
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:58,160
certain sectors of the critical
infrastructure landscape are far more

171
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,100
advanced than others in working with the
federal government to protect their

172
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:09,410
industrial control systems it's a vital
importance and are the Department of

173
00:17:09,410 --> 00:17:14,740
Homeland Security is very very engaged
in that effort as a matter of fact when

174
00:17:14,740 --> 00:17:19,660
I referred to the word search teams and
we have ICS search industrial control

175
00:17:19,660 --> 00:17:27,140
systems specifically dedicated to those
efforts thank you let me make an

176
00:17:27,140 --> 00:17:37,090
important point that I underlies our
vision for the the receipt that the

177
00:17:37,090 --> 00:17:44,600
sharing of information and specifically
the sharing cyberthreat indicators there

178
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:53,169
are many now on the current landscape
that treat cyberthreat indicators as

179
00:17:53,170 --> 00:18:02,340
having proprietary value and we
understand dad in the effort to protect

180
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:09,409
network security but we in the
government have to have a view by

181
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:15,100
necessity given our responsibilities to
protect the public good and the public

182
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:17,520
safety to have a more and more macro

183
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:24,940
and cannot necessarily have a
proprietary you have something that is

184
00:18:24,940 --> 00:18:32,390
that can be of such a value to the
ecosystem as a whole and what we hope

185
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:40,230
will we hope is that the proprietary
value the sound and other aspects of

186
00:18:40,230 --> 00:18:46,970
building and establishing network
security but not in the cyber threat in

187
00:18:46,970 --> 00:18:53,320
declare itself at the site where the red
indicator and sharing that will have a

188
00:18:53,320 --> 00:19:02,000
public dimension that is unprecedented
because it is it is absolutely vital to

189
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,870
the ability to protect the ecosystem
that those cyberthreat indicators are

190
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:14,080
disseminated and share for more publicly
than they are now and we hope that that

191
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:21,000
paradigm becomes the paradigm of the
future in the service of our of our

192
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:27,140
mission of our homeland security mission
which includes the security of the

193
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:36,340
network we are very invested in research
and development and perhaps some of you

194
00:19:36,340 --> 00:19:42,909
heard our representative from our office
of science and technology very engaged

195
00:19:42,910 --> 00:19:47,390
in the research and development in
achieving network security and that is

196
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:54,320
an investment that we are making in the
private as well as the public sector and

197
00:19:54,320 --> 00:20:00,939
on the point of the cyberthreat
indicators as a as a as public property

198
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:07,779
his you will the internet is often

199
00:20:07,779 --> 00:20:14,340
forward to is a global commons and in
the government we think of the common

200
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:23,119
good and we think that in order to
really protect the identity of the

201
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:30,499
institution as a global commons would
besiege others to think of the common

202
00:20:30,499 --> 00:20:36,309
good as well and we look forward to
partnering in that respect

203
00:20:36,309 --> 00:20:45,399
tackling the trust deficit and really
being a prime position to enable and

204
00:20:45,399 --> 00:20:50,879
facilitate your efforts to secure the
network so thank you very much and I'm

205
00:20:50,879 --> 00:20:56,369
happy to take any other questions or
comments you might have to step up to

206
00:20:56,369 --> 00:21:07,619
the microphone so I have to take I'm
just a little a little bothered just

207
00:21:07,619 --> 00:21:11,619
trust us just trust us with your data
just a little bit of time when breaches

208
00:21:11,619 --> 00:21:17,360
take can take a long time to be
disclosed and

209
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:23,199
so the data that we were providing you
could be viewed could be seen and you

210
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,780
don't know about it you don't realize it
for years and years and years the

211
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:32,928
government can't maintain security and
he's in the military the White House the

212
00:21:32,929 --> 00:21:36,760
Department of Homeland Security has
issues with this employees groping

213
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:44,790
others disclosing data and this even
released document publicly that shows a

214
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:49,540
congressional IDs military ID's and
things like that so when you when you

215
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:55,389
say you know just trust us with your
data it's hard for me to to to to let go

216
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:59,730
and I understand where you're coming
from I'm not trying to be adversarial

217
00:21:59,730 --> 00:22:02,910
about just being

218
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:09,900
I just haven't had the comfort level
would you be opposed to having someone

219
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:15,960
more from the hacker community in
testing it and say you know and and

220
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:19,230
certifying it saying here's a letter
we've gone through this and checking it

221
00:22:19,230 --> 00:22:26,210
because you know the PSO breach and the
other things have been going on to get

222
00:22:26,210 --> 00:22:33,650
this more in my opinion Justice ok so
let me let me and I appreciate the

223
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:39,030
candor very much and that's why I raised
the issue of trust and I don't think and

224
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:45,030
I hope I didn't create the impression
sir or everyone that I come here and I i

225
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:49,080
say you know what just trust gives
everybody God and we're going to take

226
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:53,168
care of it from the government I'm here
to help I I don't think that's what I

227
00:22:53,169 --> 00:23:00,900
said I think what I what I said was I
recognize the trust deficit I understand

228
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:08,580
that it is born a number of factors you
might have mentioned one or two with

229
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:13,790
which I would take issue but but that's
perhaps a separate sidebar discussion

230
00:23:13,790 --> 00:23:23,139
but the question is this where can we
start the build to build it to preparing

231
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:27,440
to go get back however you might claim

232
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:36,000
and what will it take and what I what I
asked or yes let's start somewhere

233
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:43,429
start small and let's build from there
if you need a third party

234
00:23:43,429 --> 00:23:50,299
validator remember one of the key
principles of information sharing is

235
00:23:50,299 --> 00:23:59,389
equality of access and I don't know how
that principle into place with the the

236
00:23:59,389 --> 00:24:08,399
notion of a hacker that is a third-party
validator and remember one third-party

237
00:24:08,399 --> 00:24:15,000
validator may not be another's
third-party validator so I appreciate

238
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:19,840
the suggestion and what I would ask is
for other suggestions on how we can

239
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:24,500
build the trust I understand the deficit
that exists and you might be in a

240
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:30,379
position to say if you suffer an attack
you may be in a position to say you know

241
00:24:30,379 --> 00:24:31,480
what

242
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:34,980
given the dimensions of this stack with
the particular qualities so that I don't

243
00:24:34,980 --> 00:24:39,590
quite feel comfortable sharing
cyberthreat indicator with with the

244
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:45,009
government and that is your prerogative
in that is your liberty but perhaps

245
00:24:45,009 --> 00:24:52,759
there is an attack the indicator of
which you would feel comfortable because

246
00:24:52,759 --> 00:24:57,549
of its particular qualities and perhaps
you willing to give that a try and

247
00:24:57,549 --> 00:25:02,809
perhaps our response protocols and
perhaps our response in total will

248
00:25:02,809 --> 00:25:08,009
actually build a little confidence in
you there perhaps revisit the next one

249
00:25:08,009 --> 00:25:13,460
that comes along that you previously
were unwilling to share so let's my

250
00:25:13,460 --> 00:25:18,259
thought is trying to spot where you feel
comfortable starting and let's build

251
00:25:18,259 --> 00:25:21,470
from there and if we earn your trust

252
00:25:21,470 --> 00:25:26,009
grave and if we don't we're gonna have
to tackle the recent 100 next questions

253
00:25:26,009 --> 00:25:31,330
coming from the far side effects other
questions about my sexual urges iced out

254
00:25:31,330 --> 00:25:36,850
what is there in the ice our process now
that will rectify some of the problems

255
00:25:36,850 --> 00:25:43,740
that we create confidence in the ice axe
over all those years so the organization

256
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:49,419
that we are going to select this month
to develop the best practices will be an

257
00:25:49,419 --> 00:25:56,860
organization that is routinely engage
the public discourse with respect to the

258
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:04,729
challenges that have plagued to some
extent the ice axe certainly we've heard

259
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:10,440
great praise with respect to some ice
axe and some criticisms in some

260
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:16,110
challenges and so the institution that
we select to develop best practices for

261
00:26:16,110 --> 00:26:22,360
the high sows which are not sector
necessarily sector-specific that public

262
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:26,918
engagement will hopefully prove the
solution to tackling the challenges that

263
00:26:26,919 --> 00:26:32,129
you have experienced or no lo and public
engagement and openness and transparency

264
00:26:32,129 --> 00:26:37,779
in the development of this new system of
this new architecture I said say it is

265
00:26:37,779 --> 00:26:46,129
vital that question in central sir you
mentioned about our automated real-time

266
00:26:46,129 --> 00:26:50,149
sharing of information and

267
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:56,000
that's good and also you mentioned about
protection privacy and confidentiality

268
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:02,800
and that kind of thing I think that
these kind of two things that needs to

269
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:13,760
be by real-time sharing then so you need
to look into that information so that if

270
00:27:13,760 --> 00:27:26,290
it's OK to share so what is your plan to
deal with those two things so we are so

271
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:31,060
let me let me share with you why did the
word near

272
00:27:31,060 --> 00:27:37,000
preceding real-time is so important he
goes up precisely I think to the point

273
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:42,270
that you are making our goal is to
sharing nearly all time the information

274
00:27:42,270 --> 00:27:47,190
we receive because the difference
between real time in near real-time is

275
00:27:47,190 --> 00:27:55,660
creating the space for the privacy and
civil liberties equities to be properly

276
00:27:55,660 --> 00:28:02,580
addressed and what we are doing is now
in our goal is to roll it out more

277
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:08,820
fulsome Lee in October of this year is
to build the automated capability and

278
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:13,710
developed to develop broker protocols
and those protocols will be the subject

279
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:19,790
of great discourse that's a taxi and
sticks yes

280
00:28:19,790 --> 00:28:22,920
tax question either side

281
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:27,810
hi thanks so how do you think that the
OPM breach and tax information sharing

282
00:28:27,810 --> 00:28:31,950
debate in your considerations what would
you say to people who say now that the

283
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:36,770
federal government should not be trusted
with more forthright indicators of

284
00:28:36,770 --> 00:28:42,110
personal data potentially showed that
federal agencies are not able to protect

285
00:28:42,110 --> 00:28:43,149
the personal data

286
00:28:43,150 --> 00:28:49,800
well i think quite frankly debt
different parts of the government are

287
00:28:49,800 --> 00:28:55,950
more advanced in their network security
systems than others and the OPM

288
00:28:55,950 --> 00:29:02,440
reach was obviously a significant
challenge but one has to in the

289
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:07,289
government with the responsibilities we
have one must address it as an

290
00:29:07,289 --> 00:29:13,559
opportunity it's an identification of a
challenge and an opportunity to address

291
00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:19,789
it not only with OPM specifically and
the information it warehouses but across

292
00:29:19,789 --> 00:29:25,950
the government and the thirty-day sprint
that was led by the white house was not

293
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:31,299
an OPM specific 30 days spent it was a
cross of the government the government

294
00:29:31,299 --> 00:29:38,210
departments and agencies so I heard as
recently as this morning in speaking

295
00:29:38,210 --> 00:29:44,159
with some of the attendees hear about
the OPM breached and its impact on the

296
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,580
confidence in sharing information with
the government and as I think I

297
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:54,820
addressed the rattled confidence is born

298
00:29:54,820 --> 00:30:00,439
not exclusively because of the OPM
breach for some that might have impacted

299
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:04,820
the confidence level for others it's
born of other things and we've got to

300
00:30:04,820 --> 00:30:08,658
rebuild and strengthen the trust
relationship and we're dedicated to

301
00:30:08,659 --> 00:30:15,289
doing so and so we've responded to the
open OPM reach with vigilance and we're

302
00:30:15,289 --> 00:30:22,350
going to be a stronger network security
system in the government that we were

303
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:30,389
previously but did not sorry if I made
sorry but did not share the information

304
00:30:30,389 --> 00:30:39,428
or at least to not start in some way to
share the information and give it a try

305
00:30:39,429 --> 00:30:46,990
i think is surrendering the ability to
exploit a capability that may in fact

306
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:52,920
and I and my colleagues will in fact
work in strengthening

307
00:30:52,920 --> 00:30:59,870
the network security hole sorry I think
there's a consensus that sharing is very

308
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:04,139
important to talk to a trust as being
one of the barriers for that if you have

309
00:31:04,140 --> 00:31:09,440
some thoughts on a roll anonymity to
play and ensuring that your vision for

310
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:13,700
sharing I think I can actually help
reach our bridge that trust gap e

311
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:20,540
there's a difference between brick a
breach in bridge by the way so that's a

312
00:31:20,540 --> 00:31:25,389
that's a very important point that
anonymity is going to be a a cornerstone

313
00:31:25,390 --> 00:31:33,280
of Laura information sharing protocols
that's a very important point I didn't

314
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:38,790
realize the shuttle was standing already
your next sir yes so you in discussing

315
00:31:38,790 --> 00:31:42,670
our immediate delivery of cyber threat
indicators is your organization at this

316
00:31:42,670 --> 00:31:48,300
time considering the automated
collection of the sort of indicators for

317
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:55,649
so are what we are building is the
ability in automated form to receive and

318
00:31:55,650 --> 00:32:01,310
then the automated ability to share to
disseminate guess what I'm trying to

319
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:05,760
describing said his one could envision
seance a monitoring that kind of thing

320
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:10,590
is you are you considering branching out
into the direction we considering

321
00:32:10,590 --> 00:32:17,439
branching out potentially into on-site
monitoring of that sort of thing I don't

322
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:19,170
know the answer to that question

323
00:32:19,170 --> 00:32:24,070
ok I'm sorry I i

324
00:32:24,070 --> 00:32:30,280
the monitoring of of the data that that
is beyond the purview of what we are

325
00:32:30,280 --> 00:32:41,230
building next question of center here so
I'm assuming the USA government is going

326
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:45,210
to be participating in releasing
information that the individual agencies

327
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:49,470
see but in light of the emails from
hacking team in the room releases from

328
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:51,160
Edward snowed in

329
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:57,520
will there be releases regarding 0 days
that the USS button is using or is

330
00:32:57,520 --> 00:33:02,030
receiving three contractors will that
information be shared through this

331
00:33:02,030 --> 00:33:09,700
channel is well I don't know the answer
to that question you know in the

332
00:33:09,700 --> 00:33:16,930
interest of as much openness and
transparency I'm gonna ask my golly well

333
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:25,000
as you know the answer to that question
we're going to declassify and release

334
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:29,800
everything we can thank you sir

335
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:37,690
some from me we've talked a bit about
the anonymization of sources and how do

336
00:33:37,690 --> 00:33:43,140
you intend to bid recipients of
indicators such as your adversaries are

337
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:48,410
monitoring those channels to know when
those indicators are basically burned so

338
00:33:48,410 --> 00:33:54,210
weird so somebody asked the question
before we are building the Cape

339
00:33:54,210 --> 00:34:02,110
capabilities to ensure the Providence if
you will of the information we receive

340
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:08,870
and I think we'll be able to speak to
that more technically at a future date

341
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:15,940
but we are very well aware of that
concern centers are so there's a couple

342
00:34:15,940 --> 00:34:20,668
things when you when you look at the
government as a whole it is their

343
00:34:20,668 --> 00:34:24,359
computer and network security is held
together by bailing wire chewing gum and

344
00:34:24,359 --> 00:34:29,940
duct tape they've got Windows 98
operating military bases you got some of

345
00:34:29,940 --> 00:34:35,030
this thing you got its and everybody's
trying to do that in your contracting

346
00:34:35,030 --> 00:34:39,379
processes driving a lot and you aren't
government so how are you going to dress

347
00:34:39,379 --> 00:34:45,399
this because by the time you catch up
with the technology it's already past

348
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:51,509
year so are you changing how you having
a culture change with regards to how

349
00:34:51,510 --> 00:34:57,510
your building this new information
security automation are you changing

350
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:01,680
also how your recruiting because by the
time somebody gets through a clarence

351
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:06,450
again they're not interested anymore and
most people who really do good work and

352
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:12,379
that couldn't get clearance so

353
00:35:12,380 --> 00:35:17,920
so given how you described our system I
i dont think im going to invite you to

354
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:25,150
my office late game of pong anytime
anytime soon so like yeah exactly

355
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:34,400
your your question is spot on and let me
let me share with hear from personal

356
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:45,900
experience we were used to be at an
agency an agency that the that

357
00:35:45,900 --> 00:35:51,220
administer the legal immigration system
of our nation and it was a paper-based

358
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:58,819
system and that means that we will see
paper we move paper from office to

359
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:04,170
office around the country and we send
out a paper and one could walk into a

360
00:36:04,170 --> 00:36:11,310
warehouse and see thousands and
thousands and thousands of vials of

361
00:36:11,310 --> 00:36:16,640
paper separated by you text cards
identifying the alphabetical order of

362
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:22,609
the files and we were embarked upon
remaining board upon an effort to

363
00:36:22,610 --> 00:36:30,650
autonomy and 22 bring online that system
and we had a multi-year contract was

364
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:35,080
developing an architecture that I'd be
keen and my colleagues became concerned

365
00:36:35,080 --> 00:36:43,880
will be outdated by the time we get out
and so we moved to more off the shelf

366
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:49,230
products we move to a natural
development cycle we brought in

367
00:36:49,230 --> 00:36:56,190
expertise from the private sector and we
changed our acquisition model entirely

368
00:36:56,190 --> 00:37:01,780
and that is not something specific to
that agency that is something that we

369
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:07,170
across the department are very focused
on you identify the recruitment of

370
00:37:07,170 --> 00:37:08,310
talent

371
00:37:08,310 --> 00:37:13,490
we're very focused on that we're very
pleased that we had legislative support

372
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:16,520
for the for our ability to recruit

373
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,620
the top talent in changing the page

374
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:24,779
scale we brought into administration
this administration has really invented

375
00:37:24,780 --> 00:37:28,880
a model that is extraordinary the
digital services that draws from the

376
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:35,160
private sector on a full-time but
short-term basis of the top talent we

377
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:41,000
are working through our human capital
processes to make sure clearances are

378
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:45,860
far more facile and more nimble than
they have been because we lose people in

379
00:37:45,860 --> 00:37:50,610
the clearance process because they have
other opportunities when they're as

380
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:56,890
talented as as this pool of individuals
is so on the route kudi on the clearance

381
00:37:56,890 --> 00:38:02,690
on the acquisition side those are all
areas of intense focus in activity in

382
00:38:02,690 --> 00:38:08,940
the department and the first I hear ya
you had mentioned that lady their

383
00:38:08,940 --> 00:38:12,620
forehead mention about a a banana bread
and systems and so forth

384
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:15,880
how do you maintain as you go forward

385
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:21,660
accountability for ensuring you execute
on replacing or upgrading systems are

386
00:38:21,660 --> 00:38:27,430
patching systems are you have an audit
or results about it said you want us to

387
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:32,069
trust you can you show us your improving
your YouTube are you gonna have a

388
00:38:32,070 --> 00:38:39,130
scorecard that we can see the public can
see in order to pass some of that trust

389
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:43,610
that you are improving that you are able
to secure the information we provide you

390
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:48,560
so we have quite a number of
accountability mechanisms both within

391
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:52,910
the department and outside the
department whether it's our own

392
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:54,420
inspector general

393
00:38:54,420 --> 00:39:03,530
Gao and of course quite frankly we have
oversight committees in the legislature

394
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:06,010
but I think your your idea

395
00:39:06,010 --> 00:39:15,170
self-initiated oversight and publication
of the results is very good in our

396
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:19,600
people work very well maybe already
focus on that but I will certainly know

397
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,700
that you need to get its importance

398
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:24,640
it's a very important thing to
underscore the end and then the

399
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:30,270
gentleman also had mentioned about
having hackers do your testing of the

400
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:34,750
earth systems may be having into
independent private sectors perform some

401
00:39:34,750 --> 00:39:42,080
of that testing for you so that you have
that activity so so so we have in our

402
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:48,610
own organization we have a red t
methodology if you will so we pressure

403
00:39:48,610 --> 00:39:56,520
test internally but but the publication
of information and the transparency and

404
00:39:56,520 --> 00:40:01,330
openness are critical parts and it goes
to the issue of trust I think that is on

405
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:06,020
everyone's mind as well so very good
point we have about nine minutes left if

406
00:40:06,020 --> 00:40:11,380
you have questions you need to be
standing question here with the

407
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:14,510
government's latest economic crisis
we've kind of move to a model of

408
00:40:14,510 --> 00:40:19,380
lowest-cost technically acceptable and
that's really stunned a lot of Honor

409
00:40:19,380 --> 00:40:28,590
abilities with information that are on
the horizon so what is your vision

410
00:40:28,590 --> 00:40:32,670
moving forward and having something a
little more than technically acceptable

411
00:40:32,670 --> 00:40:42,590
tell us to be able to combat that are on
the horizon I don't think our approaches

412
00:40:42,590 --> 00:40:48,750
a penny wise pound foolish approach I
think we're looking at building the best

413
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:56,120
capability and a while costs there's
always a factor given the fact that we

414
00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:01,940
are stewards of public funds it's always
a material factor but it is not

415
00:41:01,940 --> 00:41:06,290
determinative I don't I don't know I
don't think we take a penny wise pound

416
00:41:06,290 --> 00:41:12,470
foolish approach to the especially given
the criticality of the endeavor I don't

417
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:17,040
know if I tackled your your your issue
head-on

418
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:21,900
said that the breaches are merely
stemming from a lot of contract work

419
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:26,680
that may not be up to par due to again
just acquisition process being that you

420
00:41:26,680 --> 00:41:33,549
can employ or technically acceptable
which isn't really doing much for us i

421
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:39,330
mean we just need to be on top of things
and way ahead of the curb to be able to

422
00:41:39,330 --> 00:41:45,020
combat what we see on the horizon and i
was just wondering going forward I can

423
00:41:45,020 --> 00:41:51,060
continue to be the case and a real gonna
change our model too and I know a lot of

424
00:41:51,060 --> 00:41:56,270
this is within congress and funding and
everything else but what are we doing to

425
00:41:56,270 --> 00:42:02,140
be able to employ more technical folks
that can be in position that we can

426
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:07,279
trust and make sure that our systems are
the security needs to be when you say we

427
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:14,140
are awesome the government so we have a
very concerted effort to recruit the

428
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:20,609
best and the brightest I should say one
of the things that we are doing and

429
00:42:20,610 --> 00:42:24,450
we're trying to move as quickly as
possible is open an office in Silicon

430
00:42:24,450 --> 00:42:30,299
Valley to really for a number of reasons

431
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:34,990
break down barriers given the amount of
activity and the amount of cutting edge

432
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:41,529
work there to be able to capitalize and
capture that cutting-edge work and and

433
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:46,000
critically do I think the point that you
make to assist in our recruiting

434
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:52,700
of the talent that is there so that we
are active on both both of us you know

435
00:42:52,700 --> 00:43:02,850
there's also there's also something
fundamental in joining the government

436
00:43:02,850 --> 00:43:09,460
and the efforts that we undertake that
is independent of an economic calculus

437
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:13,500
and I think many of you appreciated

438
00:43:13,500 --> 00:43:20,980
given the work that that you do and that
is the fulfillment motion of actually

439
00:43:20,980 --> 00:43:27,140
working on something that is
extraordinarily important to the

440
00:43:27,140 --> 00:43:29,150
well-being of many

441
00:43:29,150 --> 00:43:33,680
hearkens back to my opening statement
about the security of our institutions

442
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:39,029
the security of our way of life the
security of our values and be able to

443
00:43:39,030 --> 00:43:41,930
bring one's views

444
00:43:41,930 --> 00:43:47,790
and one's talents and one's capabilities
to bear in the service of that of that

445
00:43:47,790 --> 00:43:54,000
effort so many of you do that in your
own way through the work that you do and

446
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:59,480
we feel equally proud in the work that
we do in the government towards that she

447
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:03,730
added I would like to shamefully take
advantage my position on station

448
00:44:03,730 --> 00:44:11,990
questions sir please as probably one of
the only holders on i-94 in this room I

449
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:17,750
would ask you how can the department
take advantage of individuals like

450
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:24,670
myself who have strong ties United
States I married an American yet are not

451
00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:29,660
yet citizens and therefore considered
entrust really alien types how can I

452
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:34,558
help you more and how can we take more
advantage of those who have strong

453
00:44:34,559 --> 00:44:43,980
allegiance to America yet not yet
citizenship so I will not just because

454
00:44:43,980 --> 00:44:49,400
I'm not addressing it doesn't mean I
accept the description that you gave of

455
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:56,460
individuals who come to this country as
immigrants I will tell you James that I

456
00:44:56,460 --> 00:45:06,240
myself an immigrant I was born in Cuba
que here as a political refugee I think

457
00:45:06,240 --> 00:45:13,160
one of the cornerstones of the
president's effort to pass comprehensive

458
00:45:13,160 --> 00:45:19,779
immigration reform is to ensure that the
talent that resides here in the United

459
00:45:19,780 --> 00:45:27,280
States but was not born here but that
has been educated here is actually able

460
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:33,520
to stay here and clean and devote their
talents to the strengthening and

461
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:40,250
betterment of our nation it is a gaping
hole in our immigration system and one

462
00:45:40,250 --> 00:45:43,339
that he and all of us in the
administration of very dedicated to

463
00:45:43,339 --> 00:45:45,560
close

464
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:51,460
more questions where one from the site
and just this one last question

465
00:45:51,460 --> 00:45:57,830
talking about the point you're making
that trust a couple of I think one of

466
00:45:57,830 --> 00:46:02,069
the things that's been kind of stated in
a couple of different ways here is that

467
00:46:02,070 --> 00:46:08,850
really independent third-party
assessment is is an important way for

468
00:46:08,850 --> 00:46:14,130
the government to establish trust and
and i really realize you have the red

469
00:46:14,130 --> 00:46:19,290
team's all this kind of thing but I
think an external validation party is is

470
00:46:19,290 --> 00:46:21,840
an important part of the process

471
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:26,340
the other thing I would ask about in
terms of trust is I heard the director

472
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:34,950
at RSA asked for access to encryption
keys and in terms of trust and privacy i

473
00:46:34,950 --> 00:46:42,520
I think asking for exceptional access
without a workable solution doesn't help

474
00:46:42,520 --> 00:46:51,410
establish trust and and that point is
made I think throughout my visit here

475
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:59,160
and I appreciate that I appreciate the
challenges that represents and it is

476
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:04,770
clear from the questions or comments I
received from a number that third-party

477
00:47:04,770 --> 00:47:14,890
validation will be certainly helpful in
advancing the trust that underlies a

478
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:20,560
partnership and I will take that back in
and put on that and I appreciate very

479
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:25,720
much the opportunity to be here to share
my thoughts on behalf of the Department

480
00:47:25,720 --> 00:47:28,649
and I look forward to

481
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:37,260
quite frankly with confidence I look
forward to strengthening and perhaps

482
00:47:37,260 --> 00:47:41,610
we are earning the trust of many of you
thanks so very much for the opportunity
