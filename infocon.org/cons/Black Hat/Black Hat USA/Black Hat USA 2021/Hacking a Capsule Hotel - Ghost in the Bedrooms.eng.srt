00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,759
hi everyone

3
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:17,680
i am kia zupa

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,119
i work as a security consultant at lexvo

5
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:23,119
and today i'm going to present you how

6
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:26,000
to hack a capsule hotel

7
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,199
everything you're going to see in that

8
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:29,119
presentation happened when i was

9
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:30,800
traveling in a foreign country for

10
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:32,399
holidays

11
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,559
i booked a few nights in what we call a

12
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,680
capsule hotel and i noticed that they

13
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,040
were using several different

14
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,640
technologies which was pretty cool

15
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,000
for those who don't know where capsule

16
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,719
hotel is it's a hotel with really small

17
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:49,680
rooms that are stacked side by side

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,079
you just have a bed and nothing else

19
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,039
there is no more space

20
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,480
the bathroom and the living room are

21
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,960
parts of the common area and you usually

22
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,079
close your room with a curtain

23
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,440
people in that country are really

24
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,519
respectful it's a big part of their

25
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,080
culture and this kind of hotel helps

26
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,640
them in different ways

27
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,200
for example if a man is too drunk to

28
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,880
return home safely

29
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:17,360
if he is embarrassed to face his wife

30
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,320
then he can sleep in a place like this

31
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,759
and in general it's pretty cheap

32
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,240
compared to robotics

33
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:29,200
so let's see this what this is what the

34
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,040
hotel looked like

35
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,360
in this photo you have three bedrooms

36
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,920
in your room you have an adjustable bed

37
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:40,000
a light a ventilation fan and that's it

38
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
you put your suitcase under the beds and

39
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,000
you can close your room by pulling down

40
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,840
the curtain and locking it with a key

41
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:53,439
this capsule hotel was using the

42
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,840
following technologies

43
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,159
the entrance of each floor is protected

44
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:00,399
by an nfc page

45
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,640
in some rooms you can mirror your device

46
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,200
on the curtain with video projector

47
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,200
you need a special adapter and an iphone

48
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,119
for that

49
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,280
and finally you can control your own

50
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:13,280
bedroom with an ipod touch given a

51
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,280
check-in

52
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,680
on the photo you can see the ipod touch

53
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,080
the nfc bench and the k used to lock the

54
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,080
curtain

55
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:27,040
the ipod touch comes with an application

56
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,440
that allows to control your bedroom

57
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,120
you can change the position of the

58
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,200
adjustable pad and transform it to a

59
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:34,400
sofa

60
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,319
you can control the power of the lights

61
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,319
and you can also turn on or off the

62
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,239
ventilation fan

63
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:41,840
now what about the security of all of

64
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,120
this

65
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,599
well the ipod touch is connected ever

66
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,400
using bluetooth or wifi

67
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,800
so there must be a way to communicate

68
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,160
with whatever is controlling the bedroom

69
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:57,200
and when i saw all these features i feel

70
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,480
was pretty cool because it means that

71
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,000
if i hack them

72
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,159
i could potentially control all the

73
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:07,120
hotel bathrooms

74
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,000
and this would be awesome right

75
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,560
but i'm traveling i don't have a lot of

76
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:15,120
equipment with me and i just have a few

77
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,400
weeks left to enjoy this country i don't

78
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:20,400
know if i would succeed if i tried to

79
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,879
hack them or if i would just fail and

80
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,599
waste my time trying to do that

81
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:28,000
so i like the idea but i'm still

82
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,000
hesitating

83
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,040
and then i met my friend bob

84
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,599
let me present you bob

85
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,159
a neighbor woke me up two times during

86
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,519
my stay

87
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,760
he woke me up because he was making

88
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:46,159
phone calls at 2am in the morning and he

89
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,319
was speaking really loudly

90
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,640
so the second night i went to see him

91
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:52,560
and i asked him politely to speak more

92
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,920
correctly

93
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,360
and he told me yeah sure no problem man

94
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,439
then i came back to my bedroom and he

95
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,319
started to speak just like before

96
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:03,360
there was

97
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,080
no change yeah some people just don't

98
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:08,080
care man

99
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:10,319
and i take my sleep seriously especially

100
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,920
on holidays

101
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,560
so i thought it would be nice if i could

102
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,560
take control of his room and making have

103
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,440
a lovely night

104
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:22,719
and this is how everything started

105
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:26,240
the first thing i did was to explore my

106
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,120
bedroom and search for the objects that

107
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:31,840
were being used

108
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,320
this is the first object iphone in my

109
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,280
room

110
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,600
when i first looked at it i had no idea

111
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,120
of what it was

112
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:40,639
it turns out that

113
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,360
it's just light really

114
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,360
this is a pioma ugl2 wild mounted light

115
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:51,040
and this is used in case of emergency

116
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,440
if there is an earthquake of magnitude 4

117
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,320
or greater red light will indicate it

118
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,560
it's just here for safety reasons

119
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:00,800
this is not interesting for us we don't

120
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,000
really care about that

121
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,320
the next object was i found was a nas

122
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:09,840
nos remote

123
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,320
nastnos is a company specialized in home

124
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:14,000
automation

125
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,320
this remote allows to control up to five

126
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,400
niceness devices

127
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,720
it can be used in case the ipod touch is

128
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:23,039
lost or if the application doesn't work

129
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,800
for example

130
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,199
it uses radio waves with a specific

131
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,479
frequency

132
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,320
and you can use it

133
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,880
up to 15 meters

134
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,880
by searching on the internet you can see

135
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:37,360
this remote is customizable you can put

136
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,039
your own stickers on it depending on

137
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:40,960
what type of device you will interact

138
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:42,479
with

139
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:44,080
a distributor can be used to control

140
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,479
products from nest notes such as editor

141
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,199
curtains light dimmers ventilation fans

142
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:52,600
and other devices

143
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,080
a delta drive ds2 motor is present

144
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,400
it is an electric motor used to make the

145
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,240
bed adjusted

146
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,600
on the top of the photo you can see

147
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,680
remote connected with a cable that can

148
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,000
be used to control it

149
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
it was difficult to see what was under

150
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,639
the beds and i could not go fully under

151
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,440
it

152
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:16,160
so i didn't see what this motor was

153
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,080
connected to

154
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,600
but because we previously saw that the

155
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:24,400
remote can be used to control it

156
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,720
we can guess the wireless connectivity

157
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:29,120
is made possible with another national

158
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:32,120
device

159
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,639
national ces

160
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:39,280
8700 router is present in each room

161
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,280
it allows to control national devices

162
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,080
from a wi-fi environment

163
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,720
it does that simply by converting

164
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:49,599
actions he receives through wi-fi to

165
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:52,400
ride aways on the frequency used by

166
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,360
remote with privacy so

167
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,520
this means you can control any national

168
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,000
device from an android smartphone or an

169
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,960
ios device for example

170
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:04,880
i could not see that device because it

171
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,440
was either between the walls but i knew

172
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,160
it was here because i identified it

173
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,800
after performing a wi-fi scan

174
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,960
iphone several societies starting with

175
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,039
the name nationals ces 8700

176
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:21,919
and by the way the photo you see was

177
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,319
taken from the internet yeah

178
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,960
i didn't tear down the wall i'm not that

179
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,960
savage

180
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:33,919
this router can be used with two types

181
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,919
of architecture

182
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:38,479
the first architecture is using only the

183
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,080
wifi router

184
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:41,919
you connect to the nasnos router using

185
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,599
your smartphone and then you can

186
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,759
interact with our national devices

187
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,280
electric curtains lights etc

188
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:50,879
it is this type of architecture that was

189
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,000
being used by the hotel

190
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,160
the second possible architecture allows

191
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:58,319
you to control national devices directly

192
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:00,080
from the internet

193
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,720
it is basically the same setup but you

194
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:05,680
would have to configure your isp router

195
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,280
so that it allows you to communicate

196
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,800
with the national access point from the

197
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,479
internet

198
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,440
yeah i mean what could go wrong with an

199
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:17,120
architecture like this i wonder what

200
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,720
okay so now we know the different

201
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,039
devices present in our bedroom and we

202
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,720
are going to start the exploitation

203
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,720
phase

204
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,520
so this is what the application instead

205
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,000
on the ipod touch looks like

206
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,080
the application allows you to change the

207
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,799
position of the adjustable bit you can

208
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,799
control the power of the room light and

209
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,640
you can also turn on or off the

210
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,598
ventilation fan

211
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,399
when i first tried to exit the

212
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:50,640
application i saw that it wasn't

213
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,760
possible

214
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,839
i could not exit the application or turn

215
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:55,839
off the ipod touch

216
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,399
but when a triple tapped on the on

217
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,880
button i noticed that a passcode was

218
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:02,480
asked

219
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,480
by searching on the internet i found

220
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,200
that this behavior was due to an ios

221
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:10,480
feature called git access

222
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,959
as you can see in the ios documentation

223
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:14,720
it says that

224
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,800
git access limits your device to a

225
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,040
single app and lets you control which

226
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,880
features are available

227
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:23,200
to end the gated access session triple

228
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:25,120
click the unbutton until you get it

229
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,920
access passcode then tap end

230
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:30,080
this material is used when you want to

231
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:32,800
let the child use device for example so

232
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:34,959
that you can only use the application

233
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,000
you want and not the other ones

234
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:39,839
after reading the documentation i knew

235
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:41,839
that protection was being used because

236
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,519
of the device behavior

237
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,160
the first the thing is that

238
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,959
this protection is only configured at

239
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:52,640
runtime

240
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,399
this means the protection is no longer

241
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:57,440
present if we reboot the device

242
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,560
yes we cannot turn off the ipad the ipod

243
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,399
by pressing the button

244
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,920
but we can still drain its battery then

245
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,519
connect it to the power and reboot the

246
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,040
device

247
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:10,720
once you do that the protection is

248
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,040
normal here and we can access everything

249
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,680
we want over applications and the ipod

250
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,000
touch settings

251
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,640
on site bypass the protection i started

252
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,440
to look at the device settings

253
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:27,360
the device is enrolled in a mobile

254
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,360
device management solution

255
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,880
and two wi-fi networks are saved on it

256
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:34,800
there is an enterprise network using

257
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,320
wpa2

258
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:41,120
and a network name nationals cs 8700

259
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:44,079
that is using web

260
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:46,160
during the information gathering parts

261
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,720
we privacy so that the national router

262
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:50,079
allows us to control over national

263
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:53,680
devices from a wi-fi environment

264
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,440
and our goal is to take control of all

265
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:56,640
bedrooms

266
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:01,319
so we are going to target this network

267
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:04,399
there are different solutions we can use

268
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,320
to obtain the key of the national

269
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,160
network

270
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:11,040
we could jyp the ipod touch once we are

271
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:12,800
rooting the device we can access the

272
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,519
keychain and obtain the key of the saved

273
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,279
wi-fi networks

274
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,600
but this solution is quite aggressive

275
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:21,200
and we don't want to answer the phone

276
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,360
too much because it's not a property

277
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,120
the next solution is to use what is

278
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,600
called icloud keychain

279
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,600
if we unlock this feature this would

280
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,079
synchronize the keychain over all lipo

281
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,600
devices that share the same accuracy

282
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,240
using a mac we can then see the save

283
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,360
wi-fi keys by opening the keychain

284
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:46,640
but we don't have a mac with us

285
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,880
another solution would be to attack the

286
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,720
wbs feature if it's present on the

287
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:52,160
router

288
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:55,360
availability was found in wps

289
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,399
in 2011 which helps to retry the wi-fi

290
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:00,959
key with a brute force attack

291
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:03,120
unfortunately the nas nose router

292
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,240
doesn't support this feature

293
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:08,399
the last solution is to target the web

294
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,760
protocol

295
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,680
the web protocol is well known for being

296
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,480
insecure since 2001.

297
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,720
you can retrieve webkey by capturing

298
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:20,480
around 80 000 packets using aircrack

299
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,720
it's crazy that web is still used in

300
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,200
2021.

301
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,440
this seems the best solution for us so

302
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,160
this is what we're going to do

303
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:33,240
after performing a wi-fi scan a total of

304
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:37,440
119 nas-nose access points were detected

305
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,839
the ssid name is based on the two last

306
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:42,399
bytes of the bssid and the

307
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,160
authentication mode is open

308
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,320
here you can see a screenshot of all the

309
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,959
detected national access points

310
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:54,800
each access point corresponds to a

311
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,079
bedroom

312
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,800
this means we could potentially access

313
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,040
and control

314
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:02,560
119 bedrooms

315
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,920
it just depends on the power of the

316
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,839
wi-fi adapter we have

317
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:12,959
okay so i want to grab the web key but

318
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,959
we are traveling and i don't have a lot

319
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,360
of equipment with me

320
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:20,480
i only have two wifi cards that do not

321
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,440
support injection properly

322
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,160
but do we really need to inject packets

323
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:28,800
if we control the ipod touch

324
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,639
we can still use the monitor mode to

325
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:32,880
capture packets

326
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,800
we just have to find a way to make the

327
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:38,880
ipod device generate a lot of data

328
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,680
to do so i came up with a sample

329
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,600
javascript code

330
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:46,240
it just loads images on the same network

331
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,560
so that it forces the device to generate

332
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,880
iep requests

333
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,440
we serve that code to the ipod touch by

334
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,440
connecting it to an access point we

335
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:56,720
create

336
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,120
we then connect it back to the national

337
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,639
access point

338
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,839
and we execute it

339
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:07,199
after a while we were able to retry the

340
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:12,720
wi-fi key it was ces 8700 something

341
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,480
we connected to the lesnar's access

342
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:16,959
point using that key and we noticed a

343
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,880
few things

344
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,279
first the router webintfs is accessible

345
00:14:21,279 --> 00:14:22,959
with default credentials

346
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,360
the password starts with one two three

347
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:26,959
and i will let you guess what comes

348
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:28,560
after

349
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,959
it is also powered by a urity module

350
00:14:30,959 --> 00:14:35,199
from a company based in beijing in china

351
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,480
okay so now we are connected to the wifi

352
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,560
and we want to know the ipod touch what

353
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:43,440
the api touch application does

354
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,360
to do so we are going to set up a mine

355
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,360
in the middle architecture in order to

356
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,360
inspect the traffic

357
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,120
for the equipment we only have an

358
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,760
android smartphone and a laptop with two

359
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,079
wire discounts

360
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,000
so here is the money in the middle

361
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,160
architecture i set up

362
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,079
i created an access point with my

363
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:05,680
android smartphone

364
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,639
and then i connected to the ipod touch

365
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,440
and my laptop to it

366
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,399
on the ipod i configured it so that it

367
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:16,560
uses my laptop as the getaway

368
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:19,120
and i could observe traffic

369
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,839
i enabled epf warning on my laptop so

370
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:24,480
that it acts as a router

371
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,800
and i connected my second laptop wi-fi

372
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,320
card to the nicenose access point

373
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,920
so every packet the ipod sends will pass

374
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:35,839
through my laptop and then arrive to the

375
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,320
national router

376
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:42,880
once the mind in the middle architecture

377
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:45,279
was set up i just pressed on every

378
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,120
button of the apple touch application

379
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:50,079
iron and i observed the traffic

380
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,240
i saw that packets were sent to the

381
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,759
national scooter on tcp port 8000

382
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,920
in the table you can see the content of

383
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:02,160
the ccp packets sent for each action

384
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:04,399
when you use a feature with a long press

385
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,639
the packets are sent continuously until

386
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:09,120
you release the button

387
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,920
as you can see there is notification and

388
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,880
no encryption that is good for us

389
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,040
after that i just developed a program

390
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,040
that sends the same packets depending on

391
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,800
the action

392
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,440
this means we are now able to control

393
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,560
bedroom from a laptop

394
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:31,120
so here's a script i made

395
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:33,040
all actions available on the ipod

396
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,440
applications are implemented

397
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,920
you can turn on or off the lines same

398
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,000
with the fan and you can play with the

399
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,759
bed position

400
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,279
on the second command you can see the

401
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,600
packets being sent when we transform the

402
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,600
bed into a sofa

403
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,440
the packets are sent continuously in

404
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,839
that case

405
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,839
okay it's cool

406
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,680
we cannot take control of our own

407
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,680
bedroom but can we control all bedrooms

408
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:02,560
this is why we're doing all of this

409
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:04,480
the first thing the thing is that we

410
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:07,119
don't know if the wi-fi key is

411
00:17:07,119 --> 00:17:09,839
generated or set manually

412
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:11,679
when we look at the value of the private

413
00:17:11,679 --> 00:17:13,359
key there might be a chance that it was

414
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,919
generated automatically because there is

415
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:17,599
the name of the

416
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,319
8007 router in it

417
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,839
i looked for more information about the

418
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,520
national router and i found an

419
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,919
application from nasa's available on

420
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,640
google play store

421
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,080
you have several features in that

422
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,039
application but there is only one that

423
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,120
interests us

424
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:37,280
from this app you can set up the wi-fi

425
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,480
configuration of the nas nose router

426
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,480
so i decided to reverse engineer the

427
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,880
application in order to see if there was

428
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,039
an algorithm that was being used to

429
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:50,240
generate the wi-fi key

430
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:53,120
unfortunately the analysis of the

431
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,440
application does not show that the key

432
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,440
is generated

433
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,039
and when you look in the documentation

434
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:01,280
of the national router it's the same

435
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:02,960
there is nothing mentioning where to

436
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,480
find a wi-fi key

437
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,880
doesn't seem to be wrote on a sticker

438
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:10,000
behind the router or anything

439
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,840
so there is no information that tends to

440
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:14,000
say that the router is pre-configured

441
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,840
and that the key is automatically

442
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:18,399
generated

443
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,080
however i found another vulnerability

444
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,080
packets are sent to the national router

445
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,840
on udp port

446
00:18:26,840 --> 00:18:29,760
988 this is a remote configuration

447
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,640
service from the sample wi-fi reality

448
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:35,919
that waits for 80 instructions

449
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:37,760
the remedy is that you can access the

450
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:39,600
wi-fi configuration of the router with

451
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:40,960
authentication

452
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,880
and you can also reconfigure it

453
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,160
here is a screenshot of the exploit the

454
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,240
wi-fi configuration is done without

455
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,760
authentication

456
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,200
you can see we retrieve the network

457
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,039
configuration at the top

458
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,640
jssid

459
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,120
and at the bottom right we get the wi-fi

460
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,360
i'm on holidays and i'm here to travel

461
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:10,160
so i decided to leave the hotel and

462
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,880
visit another city for a few days

463
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,039
i then came back to the same hotel and

464
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,440
got assigned another bedroom

465
00:19:17,440 --> 00:19:19,520
i used the same technique as before with

466
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,679
the javascript payload to generate data

467
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:25,200
and to crack the wifi key once i got it

468
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:27,280
i noticed the similarity with the wi-fi

469
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:30,480
key of my old bedroom

470
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,840
as you can see only the four last x

471
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,480
characters seem to change

472
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,480
if this is the case this will mean there

473
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,600
are only

474
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:41,320
65

475
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,679
536 possibilities which is nothing

476
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,840
after opening a new ivy we can launch an

477
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:49,520
offline dictionary attack with a file

478
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,160
containing all the possible keys in

479
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:54,080
order to grab a web key you need at

480
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,559
least four ivs

481
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:59,200
so to get your ivs from bedrooms the

482
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:01,840
best thing to do is to let your laptop

483
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,280
run all night

484
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:05,360
with monitor mode

485
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,880
then let you sleep wake up and see if we

486
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,559
know we have another surprise

487
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,400
and we have a good surprise

488
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,760
we were right

489
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,320
only the four last x characters of the

490
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,760
keys change

491
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,600
you can see that we found the wi-fi key

492
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,120
of each ssid on the right of the table

493
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,440
as long as we have at least four ivy we

494
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:34,159
cannot control all bedrooms we want

495
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:36,559
let's just do it

496
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:39,440
time for the demo

497
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,120
you can see we have three bedrooms in

498
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,840
front of us

499
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,000
at the top right there is my laptop

500
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,840
screen

501
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:55,679
and first i'm going to take control of

502
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:59,039
the bedrooms on the right

503
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,239
so i connect to it

504
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,720
i dump its wi-fi configuration

505
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:09,919
and now

506
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,720
check what's going to happen

507
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,440
okay we play with the light

508
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:33,360
now let's take control of the bedroom in

509
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,439
the middle

510
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:58,280
check what's going to happen

511
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:07,320
this is my favorite part

512
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:12,339
[Music]

513
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,960
we transform the bed into the sofa into

514
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,880
a bed and now

515
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:34,120
we put the back the bed to the sofa

516
00:22:35,210 --> 00:22:38,420
[Music]

517
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:49,710
[Music]

518
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,039
and finally we are going to take control

519
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:59,799
of the bedroom on the left

520
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,520
laughs

521
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,000
we play with the light

522
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,400
and we're not gonna turn on the fan

523
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,559
it's difficult to notice

524
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,960
but if you listen closely you can hear

525
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,960
it

526
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:09,360
what i didn't tell you is that when i

527
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,520
came back to the hotel bob was still

528
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:12,880
here

529
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,279
and uh now that we can control every

530
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:18,559
bedroom let's not forget about him

531
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,640
in order to take control of his room we

532
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:23,039
first have to identify the ssid linked

533
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:24,480
it to it

534
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,080
people who are staying in that hotel are

535
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,320
travelers so they are not here to

536
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:30,840
retreat daytime they are outside

537
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,559
visiting

538
00:24:32,559 --> 00:24:35,039
so what i did is that i listed the ssid

539
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:37,600
with the most power around this room

540
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,840
i then used my laptop to turn on the

541
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,919
light of each ssid

542
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,320
and when i noticed a change in his room

543
00:24:44,320 --> 00:24:46,159
i knew that it was the access point i

544
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:48,880
was looking for

545
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,799
i even tried to imagine the best

546
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,039
scenario i could for him

547
00:24:53,039 --> 00:24:56,400
and a good one for a memorable night is

548
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,880
to create a script that every towers

549
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,240
will transform the body to a sofa and

550
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,480
put it back in place

551
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,679
turn on and off the light

552
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:11,840
i lose that script at midnight and i'm

553
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:15,840
sure he had a wonderful night

554
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,240
conclusion

555
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:25,520
we were able to take control of all the

556
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,200
bedrooms we want

557
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,000
a total of six variabilities were found

558
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:33,039
first guilded access mods was bypassed

559
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:34,559
on the ipod

560
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:36,799
the wi-fi key was even cracked quite

561
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:38,559
easily because the web protocol was

562
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,480
being used

563
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,960
the sample wi-fi urity web anti-fast use

564
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:45,520
default credentials

565
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,600
a national service allowed us to send

566
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,480
actions with authentication

567
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,480
and availability allows to read and

568
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,679
write the wi-fi configuration

569
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,400
and finally we noticed that non-random

570
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,200
keys were being used

571
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,440
of course all sensitive elements were

572
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:05,440
modified for this presentation

573
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,080
and after all of that i contacted both

574
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,200
nationals and the hotel

575
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,520
the hotel was really cool and took these

576
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:15,200
issues seriously

577
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,279
we are not using a new architecture so

578
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:19,279
it is not possible to export

579
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:22,320
visibilities in that hotel anymore

580
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,799
i was so curious about the wi-fi keys we

581
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:25,600
found

582
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,880
because at the end we don't know if the

583
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:31,760
key is generated by nasa's or set up by

584
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,080
the hotel

585
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,039
so i simply asked the hotel about it

586
00:26:37,039 --> 00:26:39,919
and they told me that the ssid and the

587
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:42,080
key are generated by nas notes by

588
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,520
default

589
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:46,240
so if this is true this means that by

590
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:50,799
default all nas notes ces 8700 routers

591
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,960
are using non-random keys and are

592
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,720
vulnerable

593
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,640
we tried to contact nationals to report

594
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:59,440
all the remedies we found but

595
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:02,960
unfortunately we never had any answer

596
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:04,880
and concerning bob

597
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,799
i hope you will be more respectful to

598
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:09,360
this verse in the future and that he is

599
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,719
not too scared about ghosts now

600
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:16,400
i hope you enjoyed this talk and thanks

601
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:19,679
for your attention
