2
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,839
greetings everyone the work we're

3
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:17,600
presenting today is a summary of the

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:20,160
last three to four years uh researching

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,119
industrial robots my name is victor and

6
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:24,640
i come from india's robotics a robot

7
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,800
cyber security startup together with me

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:29,199
today is federico machi from trent micro

9
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:31,279
research the fun part about today's

10
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:33,120
presentation is that it's being given by

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:35,520
two researchers we went out of their way

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,600
i myself am a roboticist with about a

13
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:39,840
decade of experience building robots who

14
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,440
has for the last few years been

15
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:43,920
researching robot cyber security

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,800
federico is a cyber security guy who has

17
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,760
been exploring robotics in the same way

18
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,079
we'll be presenting on behalf of all of

19
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:54,079
our co-authors our work on reverse

20
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,160
engineering industrial robots

21
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:57,920
and the findings we encountered in the

22
00:00:57,920 --> 00:00:59,520
process

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,879
let's dive into small wonder

24
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,119
so robots

25
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:06,880
ep

26
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,560
robotics is the art of system

27
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:09,680
integration

28
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,360
building a robot requires one to

29
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,880
carefully select components that

30
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:14,640
exchange information across networks

31
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,040
while meeting timing deadlines security

32
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,799
in robotics is really nothing new if

33
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:19,840
you've done

34
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:22,240
stuff in it and ot it's a combination of

35
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,640
both a weird combination let's say

36
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,400
there are a few aspects to consider

37
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,040
though uh one relevant when compared to

38
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,439
security is the fact that we in robotics

39
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,360
make a strong distinction between real

40
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,320
time and real fast we use real time as

41
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,720
in traditional control theory that is

42
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,000
real time means deterministic on time

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,079
opposed to this we have real fast which

44
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:46,960
means fast accelerated or simply just

45
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,960
low latency we often found that real

46
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,680
time in some security domains refers to

47
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:55,920
real fast so mixing them up which is

48
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,119
confusing

49
00:01:57,119 --> 00:01:59,040
and this is important because in a way a

50
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,360
robot is a network of networks one that

51
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,920
comprises sensors to perceive the word

52
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,240
actuators to produce a physical change

53
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:08,318
on it and then computational resources

54
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:10,720
to process it all and coherently

55
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:13,920
responds in time on real time

56
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,120
of course and according to its

57
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,319
application

58
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,680
in the slide on the right side of the

59
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,319
slide you can see a thread model for a

60
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,080
robot manipulator the one you can see

61
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,879
also uh in the screen now this robot you

62
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:27,280
can see has multiple sensors multiple

63
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,280
actuators and they are all exchanging

64
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,440
information through different networks

65
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,760
each one of these networks needs to be

66
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,760
deterministic so that the overall

67
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,920
control of the robot makes sense and the

68
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,120
robot what does what we expect

69
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,760
this control concept and determinism are

70
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,920
critical and lead us to realize that

71
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,120
security and safety are very very

72
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,160
connected in robotics safety cares about

73
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,480
a robot not harming the environment or

74
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,040
humans whereas security deals with the

75
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,519
opposite deals with ensuring that the

76
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,599
environment does not conflict with the

77
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,560
robot's pre-programmed behavior i think

78
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:06,640
i speak on behalf of both to say that

79
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,560
federico and i are very very pleased

80
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,400
today to be presenting to an audience

81
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,080
that understands the difference but this

82
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,920
is not what we've been finding over the

83
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:16,800
last few years in the automation world

84
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,040
robots have their own networks they have

85
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:20,480
their own technologies safety

86
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,400
requirements and business priorities and

87
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:24,959
all of these must be uniquely addressed

88
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:27,599
simply put we can secure robots the same

89
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:30,480
way we secure it or ot environments

90
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,400
because existing industrial solutions

91
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,799
for monitoring networking traffic often

92
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:37,519
do not include robotics protocols they

93
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:39,760
do not include the specific technologies

94
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,760
and robots are typically left beyond the

95
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,400
area of protection assumed as air gap

96
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,239
and even in some cases as some new

97
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:47,840
solutions in cyber security are

98
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,239
advertising the so-called lockdown

99
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,680
approach this is

100
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:53,439
far from the security we need in

101
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:54,560
robotics

102
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,599
from a very technical angle we demand

103
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,920
robots demand their own specialized

104
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:01,200
measures

105
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,959
that take into account these safety

106
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:05,439
characteristics these safety aspects so

107
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:07,760
that robots can behave

108
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,840
safely only if they are secure and this

109
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,599
is the exact topic

110
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:14,000
we bring up in this slide as well it's

111
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,639
not just ourselves claiming this or many

112
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,560
others out there probably many of you as

113
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,839
well

114
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:22,240
norms themselves are saying so if we

115
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:24,000
take a look at the meta standard for

116
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,120
functional safety iec 61508

117
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:29,360
will observe will appreciate how there

118
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,440
are several paragraphs that literally

119
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:33,840
account for this and mention that if as

120
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,639
part of the risks that should be

121
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,680
assessed one identifies that security

122
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:42,560
hazards could lead to safety ones then

123
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,240
one needs to conduct the proper

124
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,639
assessments pen testing thread modeling

125
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:47,840
things we've been doing in alias

126
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,560
robotics for many years now in robotics

127
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,160
now something very interesting is that

128
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,360
this leads to the fact that safety

129
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:57,840
requirements spawn from security

130
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:00,000
research and this is huge for all of us

131
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,240
this is very important this means that

132
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:05,039
the cbe ids you may get today in those

133
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,600
robots in your kitchen in your streets

134
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,240
in airports wherever they are those cv

135
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,360
ids will need to be accounted for in the

136
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:18,160
safety subsystems of all of those robots

137
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,360
now we started looking at the industrial

138
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,280
robot as i said about four years ago

139
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,479
approximately

140
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,240
and and we put our target on these

141
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,880
robots which typically range from tens

142
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,960
of thousands of us dollars up to a few

143
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,120
hundreds of thousands so sometimes very

144
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,240
expensive

145
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,199
uh we cooperated with multiple vendors

146
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,039
some of the biggest ones we can say as

147
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,680
of today and one sub-cathetery that

148
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,520
caught our attention are the so-called

149
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,759
collaborative robots these robots are

150
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,919
claimed to be designed to augment human

151
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,639
capabilities by closely and that means

152
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,639
physically cooperating without causing

153
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,479
any harm now

154
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,639
the reality though is that past security

155
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:57,840
research showed that there are

156
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,520
vulnerabilities affecting this robot

157
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,039
that even as of now 2021 still remain

158
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:05,840
unpatched we refer to the work of

159
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,840
ioactiv with cesar ferrulo and a few

160
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,800
other folks back in 2017 where they

161
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,039
reported few vulnerabilities affecting

162
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,360
these robots and even as of today they

163
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,000
haven't been passed so this definitely

164
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,600
caught our attention and we'd highlight

165
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,000
that one of the biggest groups uh

166
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,919
particularly it seems following the

167
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,759
strength of not caring as much as they

168
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,560
should about security is teradyne

169
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,600
trading is a big u.s company who has

170
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,520
purchased acquired different robotic

171
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,360
companies including universal robots and

172
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,199
mobile industrial robots we'll be

173
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:38,479
speaking about this because these are

174
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,319
collaborative robots

175
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:42,160
that need to be essentially improved

176
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,000
from a security angle

177
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,840
now besides cobots besides collaborative

178
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,400
robots we also uh paid lots of attention

179
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,919
to uh what seemed to be the first uh

180
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,319
instances of obsolescence we observed in

181
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,880
robotics and and the reality

182
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,880
is that uh it's not uncommon for a robot

183
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,360
to fail or to break down

184
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,080
because again a robot is is built out of

185
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,160
many systems and system of systems and

186
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:09,280
that means that one of these subsystems

187
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,440
may fail over time often leading to the

188
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:14,160
complete system malfunction given its

189
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,319
interconnection with the rest of of the

190
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,120
overall behavior right so um

191
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,280
we we got scared at the point where we

192
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,759
realized that uh these very expensive

193
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,800
industrial robots um were not easily

194
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,880
repairable and this is what i guess most

195
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:30,880
of you as well as i did

196
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,880
would expect because uh repairing these

197
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,560
machines often is just about just

198
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,520
replacing one component or even a part

199
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,960
of the robot i just want to grab the

200
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,639
mechanics and just bring them up to

201
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,160
speed with a new controller and that

202
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,919
saved me hundreds of thousands for

203
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:46,319
example well contrary to to my

204
00:07:46,319 --> 00:07:48,160
expectations and probably to some of

205
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,199
yours uh the reality is not this one and

206
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,840
similar to ford in the 1920s with cars

207
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,639
most robot manufacturers oppose to this

208
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,440
they employ plant obsolescence practices

209
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:00,800
organizing dealers and system

210
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,960
integrators into private networks

211
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,319
providing repair parts only to certified

212
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,879
companies and discouraging repairs

213
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:11,520
reversal as well as evading competition

214
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,400
we fought this actively we interfaced

215
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,240
with some of these vendors and we've

216
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,879
reported uh responsively vulnerabilities

217
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,800
and after being ignored repeatedly we

218
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,240
decided we had to take a different

219
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,400
approach so we decided to empower the

220
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,479
end users with the knowledge to protect

221
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:27,759
themselves

222
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,720
and for that we launched two weeks of

223
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,760
robot packs we launched these exercises

224
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,360
in cooperation with other universities

225
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,919
who contributed as well and in total we

226
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:40,159
managed to publish more than 100

227
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:42,719
vulnerabilities altogether

228
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,640
it was a pretty successful exercise

229
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,800
where we learned a lot particularly we

230
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,640
learned a lot about how to interface

231
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,080
with some of these

232
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,320
manufacturers

233
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,640
we'd like to share three main uh

234
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,480
conclusions the first one out of these

235
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,800
exercises was that we definitely

236
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:00,959
encourage security researchers to adopt

237
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,440
disclosure deadlines of some form we

238
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,360
reckon that vulnerability disclosure is

239
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,680
a two-way street where both vendors and

240
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,920
researchers must act responsively but

241
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:12,160
the reality in robotics is that the

242
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,640
safety hazards as are such when

243
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,279
connected to security that we definitely

244
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,240
must pressure vendors to reduce

245
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:22,320
the windows of opportunities that they

246
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:24,399
give attackers by not mitigating all

247
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,959
these flaws a security first approaching

248
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,240
robotics is a must if we want to ensure

249
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,880
safe robotic operations

250
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,360
the second bit or the second lesson we

251
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:37,120
learned uh the hard way was that

252
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,760
communication is extremely important and

253
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,000
hard with robot manufacturers many of

254
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,600
these manufacturers are entrained in

255
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,800
security and don't have uh yet the right

256
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,320
uh i guess groups and and qualifications

257
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,480
and as my old boss at open robotics used

258
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,640
to say morgan quickly human apis are the

259
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,600
hardest we experience this uh first

260
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,240
um so that's the second bit be aware and

261
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,839
careful when you interface with robot

262
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,440
manufacturers and the third one which

263
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,880
helps with the second one at least it

264
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:07,200
helped us with with other manufacturers

265
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,800
is that uh essentially mediators help uh

266
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,880
early in the conversations uh they

267
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,880
helped us very much down the road with

268
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,880
the interfacing with more and more

269
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,279
manufacturers and they definitely uh

270
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,720
will help you as well now

271
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:25,040
so uh let me share with you uh some of

272
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,120
the actual experiences we've had over

273
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,440
this uh last few years real quick uh the

274
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:31,360
first one the first quote comes from ole

275
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,000
storm ole is a very funny guy from

276
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,079
mobile industrial robots uh it was he

277
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:38,880
was the r d manager at the time and only

278
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,279
essentially to our concerns and reports

279
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,920
said that well their business model was

280
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,600
uh just selling these robots to

281
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,920
distributors and and literally they

282
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,519
didn't have control of these robots and

283
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,200
we had to go to distributors if we

284
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,519
wanted these robots to be mitigated and

285
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,079
more secure we were shocked by this

286
00:10:56,079 --> 00:10:57,600
because he was literally telling us that

287
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,079
these robots were not under control and

288
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,360
worse than that they were shifting

289
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,360
responsibility to their supply chains to

290
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,920
their distributors uh so what we did

291
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,920
obviously was we went ahead and we spoke

292
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:10,240
with the distributors and and again we

293
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,839
got shocked because uh these groups have

294
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,839
had no idea about essentially the

295
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:17,839
liabilities they were assuming about the

296
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,000
fact that they were in church of

297
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,680
essentially applying mitigations

298
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:24,079
actually even worse many of these groups

299
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,760
didn't even have the right training or

300
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:28,720
security know-how to do so so very

301
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:30,320
concerning as and as you can see these

302
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,200
robots are not especially uh cheap uh we

303
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,959
kept digging kept digging and eventually

304
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:37,200
uh we spoke with fernando fandinho the

305
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:40,240
sales director of mir and fernando

306
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,320
finally told us after asking many

307
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,640
uncomfortable questions that essentially

308
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,040
we were not entitled to have access to

309
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,279
the release notes so even if we were to

310
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:50,240
receive

311
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:52,720
updates and or upgrades which we never

312
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:53,920
did

313
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,160
we essentially were not entitled to

314
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,240
receive the release notes which means

315
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,800
literally uh we didn't know what updates

316
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,800
were being applied uh which says a lot

317
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,360
about the transparency of this company

318
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,440
now take a look at the white robot

319
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,120
because that's the one that's being used

320
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,399
here to build

321
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,079
other robots that the so-called

322
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,160
downstream manufacturers or robots and

323
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,320
this robot is the most popular robot

324
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,639
used to fight copyrights these last few

325
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,600
years from uvb uh robots

326
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,639
we spoke with uvd quite a few uh months

327
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,959
ago more than a year ago certainly and

328
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,040
we told them about our concerns we told

329
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,480
them and showed them how we could

330
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:32,320
remotely take control of one of these

331
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,160
robots we could navigate it around the

332
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,399
hospital and we could even activate the

333
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,360
ultraviolet lights essentially causing

334
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,720
potential

335
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,920
concerns

336
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,240
uh to these concerns to these thoughts

337
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,639
simon told us that well the robot wasn't

338
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,079
connected to the internet so so he

339
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,000
didn't see how it could be externally

340
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:50,959
hacked

341
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,959
something unfortunately we are hearing

342
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,360
more and more um last but not least is

343
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,839
lars lars is the founder and ceo of

344
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,480
enable robotics and lars just told us he

345
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,720
was aware of the security issues but

346
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:04,560
that's about it

347
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:08,160
so obviously we had to uh dive deeper we

348
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:10,639
had to take a step farther and we did it

349
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,079
by uh taking a step into teardown

350
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,079
in robotics our motivations were

351
00:13:16,079 --> 00:13:18,000
threefold first we wanted to dissect and

352
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,040
analyze

353
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,040
these products to understand better the

354
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,760
safety and security issues they were

355
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:26,560
facing second we wanted to have a way to

356
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,720
do competitive benchmarking in robotics

357
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,200
this is really hard even as of today in

358
00:13:31,200 --> 00:13:33,279
robotics teardown gives you that

359
00:13:33,279 --> 00:13:35,440
capability and third we wanted to give

360
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,040
to to gain sorry the engineering

361
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,519
experience that is required to serve

362
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:40,959
customers and help them improve their

363
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,040
robot architectures better federico is

364
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:44,560
going to tell you more about the whys

365
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:46,000
and how

366
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,680
thank you very much victor

367
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,760
um the reason that while we're here at

368
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:52,240
blackit is because we want to give you a

369
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,880
loud message to both roboticists and

370
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,120
cybersecurity folks we would like you to

371
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,320
start

372
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,160
applying these techniques these tear

373
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,399
down systematic teardown approaches

374
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,639
to targets with the same passion and i'm

375
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,399
talking to the security community here

376
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,399
with the same passion that we put for

377
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,480
example to reverse engineer a pure

378
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:12,800
software artifact because there are so

379
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,839
many targets so many vendors so many

380
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:17,920
models and different variants that we

381
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,160
really need uh systematic reverse

382
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,800
engineering jobs to be uh published and

383
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,320
documented

384
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,199
um but you know we're fully aware

385
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:28,000
and

386
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,160
that these targets might not be super

387
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,480
easy to tackle i still remember the way

388
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,120
i felt when i first looked at and this

389
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,880
is only one component of a robot i was

390
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,360
like okay this is full of interesting

391
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,440
things but where do i get started there

392
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,760
are safety relays there's a real-time os

393
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:45,600
in there with a computer with a

394
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:48,480
dedicated cpu there are uh there's a

395
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,560
teach pendant out there so it's really

396
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,760
difficult to

397
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,959
for a pure software security person to

398
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,279
even get started

399
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,720
because at the end of the day what you

400
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:01,360
really want is to get more and more cds

401
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,279
and hopefully inspire

402
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:05,760
more fixes and have the blue teams

403
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,639
develop good detection signatures

404
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:10,079
um but

405
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,760
yeah if you're used to

406
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,839
software reverse engineering this is

407
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:16,079
completely different i think that the

408
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,560
most striking difference is that

409
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,000
well

410
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,079
here you don't have any control z right

411
00:15:22,079 --> 00:15:23,920
so if you look at this machine and you

412
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:26,240
develop an exploit then you really have

413
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,880
to think for a long long time before you

414
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,959
actually deploy it because you know one

415
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:34,720
missing check one wrong um

416
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,680
sign in an integer can really change the

417
00:15:37,680 --> 00:15:39,600
the direction of the arm and could

418
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,199
really happen that

419
00:15:41,199 --> 00:15:43,440
for example the hot the arm

420
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,759
hits the the the container and then you

421
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,920
have to i don't know uh send the robot

422
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:49,360
to maintenance for a few weeks and

423
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,519
that's a lot of time to wait for a

424
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:54,720
security assessment

425
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,560
let's now dig a little bit into the

426
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,399
methodology

427
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,160
at the beginning i think the good thing

428
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,040
is that the scope of the

429
00:16:03,040 --> 00:16:05,759
teardown exercise is well contained into

430
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,160
these cases which are the robot

431
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,160
controllers you can see two examples on

432
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,000
the left hand side and in the middle

433
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,079
from universal robots which are pretty

434
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,160
much the size of a suitcase

435
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,079
and on the right hand side you see an

436
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,800
older generation of controllers for

437
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:23,920
larger robots by abb those which work

438
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:26,880
inside a cage

439
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,800
about tooling i don't want to spend too

440
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,800
much time i just want to make you aware

441
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:35,759
that well the manufacturers will not

442
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,360
like probably what you're doing so

443
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,800
they're going to make your job a little

444
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,360
harder make sure that you have all the

445
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,759
all the tools that you need including

446
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:46,720
very exotic screwdrivers for all sorts

447
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,800
of screw heads and of course yes you're

448
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,240
going to break the warranty um make sure

449
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,000
very importantly that you have enough

450
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:57,040
space but just not just enough space for

451
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:00,000
a single you know one shot

452
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,160
engagement make sure that you have space

453
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:04,160
that you can leave all the parts there

454
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,959
for days or weeks depends on how long

455
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,000
you're going to take to find

456
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,959
vulnerability so make sure that you have

457
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,359
a clean space for all the parts to be

458
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:15,039
laid down

459
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:16,640
and then we go into the supply chain

460
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:19,119
mapping step which from my experience is

461
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:21,359
the most fun part because i mean you get

462
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,679
to learn all the parts used by different

463
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,599
manufacturers for example here we learn

464
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,319
that universal robot like to use power

465
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:30,799
supply units from artisan and on the

466
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,640
right hand side we learned that well

467
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:35,280
understandably uh abb likes to use their

468
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,440
own relays for the safety system because

469
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,520
they of course they produce also relays

470
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,760
and so on so it takes lots of pictures

471
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,760
to identify all the parts

472
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,400
and finally if the engagement authorizes

473
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,799
it or if you are the owner of the robot

474
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:50,720
you can actually do the disassembling

475
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,559
and here one note

476
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,160
you would like to

477
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,360
take lots of pictures as well as

478
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,960
short video clips because you would like

479
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,600
to bring the robot back into

480
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,520
the same you know assemble state because

481
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,360
you want to check your exploits if they

482
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,120
work fine unless of course you have a

483
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,679
mirror unit

484
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:12,320
about info gathering you need three main

485
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,200
things

486
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,120
manuals which are i mean i'm talking

487
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:17,840
about technical manuals uh which are

488
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,440
relatively easy to find even if you

489
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,000
don't own a robot you might also start

490
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:24,720
now right now to uh use your you know

491
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,120
favorite google doors or have a look at

492
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:29,760
that list of forums that i posted posted

493
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:31,360
on the right hand side of the slide to

494
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,280
start finding technical documentation

495
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,600
even if you i mean normally vendors do

496
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:38,080
not make it easy to find but

497
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:40,960
there are plenty of material around

498
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:42,559
uh second part you're gonna need

499
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:46,000
so-called olp or simulation software um

500
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:47,840
and that's your control z because of

501
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,840
course here it's all simulated so you

502
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,160
have uh all the you know peace of mind

503
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,880
to try all your exploits and then test

504
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:56,400
the robot get familiar with the

505
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,840
programming language and if you're

506
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,840
curious you can check my la my blanket

507
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,840
talk from last year where we guide you

508
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,360
through all the ecosystems of the main

509
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,039
manufacturers

510
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:06,720
and finally of course you want the

511
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:09,600
operating system image but i work i warn

512
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:11,440
you sorry this is not going to be easy

513
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:12,720
to find

514
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,320
unless you have a target at hand

515
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:18,880
right now now let's take a look at the

516
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,600
three main case studies that have been

517
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:24,480
performed on three different targets um

518
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:27,120
here you see uh in a larger image the

519
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,440
controller of a universal robot and on

520
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,880
the left hand side the teach pendant

521
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:32,640
which is also another interesting target

522
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:36,000
it's usually a tablet a rug tablet so to

523
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,559
speak with its own operating system

524
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,080
the fact that

525
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,919
we don't find the key i mean in this

526
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:43,760
case there is the key right there but if

527
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,440
we don't find the key to open the cage i

528
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,200
think it's a good sign because it means

529
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,840
that uh whoever deployed that robot has

530
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,840
given some thoughts about physical

531
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,080
attacks which are as victor will show

532
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:56,480
you later a very easy but also very

533
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,840
effective way to target these machines

534
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,360
then we open the cage and we find out

535
00:20:01,360 --> 00:20:03,600
about the safety system and if we look

536
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:07,200
carefully we can identify the mcu

537
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,200
so it means that the safety system here

538
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,240
is running in software so engaging and

539
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:14,159
disengaging the safety relays is a

540
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:16,159
software decision it's not something

541
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:19,760
that is only electrically driven

542
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:21,919
and then we can identify the mcu and we

543
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:23,679
can take a look at the documentation

544
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,440
from the from the manufacturer of the

545
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,919
cpu sorry of the mcu and we find out

546
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,000
that well at the first glance it looks

547
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
like it's a good choice because it's

548
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,480
usable it's useful and

549
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,799
meant for industrial automation but if

550
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:39,600
we dig carefully in in the

551
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:41,200
data sheet we find out that the

552
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,960
manufacturer of the chip and xp

553
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,320
semiconductors

554
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:47,440
warrants against the use of this in

555
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,080
safety or life critical conditions life

556
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,360
critical systems but unfortunately this

557
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,440
is the safety system not just the you

558
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,000
know the the led driver or anything else

559
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,080
of a robot is a safety system of a robot

560
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,720
which decides whether or not um

561
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:05,120
a collaborative robot in this case uh

562
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:07,600
must stop or must stop the motors or not

563
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:09,120
because there is an endangering

564
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,640
condition

565
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,240
in the second generation of the same

566
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:15,440
series uh we have uh found out that the

567
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,600
manufacturer have made a step forward in

568
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,280
the right direction we believe because

569
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,039
instead of using

570
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,760
an mcu with a firmware they have used a

571
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:26,559
an fpga which gives you near hardware

572
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,720
performance in terms of

573
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,120
you know engaging and disengaging relays

574
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,799
when it's needed so we think it's a step

575
00:21:32,799 --> 00:21:33,760
forward

576
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,600
uh what we think it's actually a step

577
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,600
backward is the fact that as viktor

578
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,159
anticipated even though the two

579
00:21:40,159 --> 00:21:41,840
the two components the controller and

580
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,600
the robot of the two different

581
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:45,840
generations are completely compatible

582
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,360
from an electrical and mechanical point

583
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:49,360
of view and you can see that they're

584
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,840
almost overlapping they have changed the

585
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,559
shape of the connector so if you own an

586
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,320
older generation controller and a newer

587
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,720
generation arm and you want to use them

588
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:00,480
together you cannot unless you build a

589
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,480
proper adapter so we think it's a step

590
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,039
backward into you know somehow trying to

591
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,600
break the macro compatibility

592
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,640
um

593
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:10,080
a third case i would just want to

594
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:11,919
highlight very briefly another

595
00:22:11,919 --> 00:22:14,080
interesting target for

596
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:17,280
security researchers which you might not

597
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:18,720
think of that

598
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,480
a simple component such as a motor

599
00:22:20,480 --> 00:22:23,280
driver contains a firmware itself

600
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:25,280
and if we if we look at once again at

601
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,360
the safety disclaimer put there by the

602
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:29,679
vendor we learned that dangerous

603
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,360
uncontrolled model runaway conditions

604
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,440
can occur for a number of reasons of

605
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:35,919
course including faulty firmware and if

606
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:37,280
you're curious you can download the

607
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,880
firmware from the vendor's website which

608
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,120
i think it's an interesting thing to

609
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,480
put your hands on

610
00:22:42,480 --> 00:22:44,480
and now i want to hand it back to victor

611
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,799
which will show you how

612
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,120
this works in in concrete and what is

613
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,200
the outcome of

614
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,200
see this approach applies systematically

615
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:55,120
over several years victor the floor is

616
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,439
yours

617
00:22:58,400 --> 00:23:00,159
thank you very good that was that was

618
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,640
awesome so um

619
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,799
as he pointed out let's now take a look

620
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:08,799
at the results we obtained

621
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,640
the previous case studies federico

622
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,760
highlighted essentially show how robot

623
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,000
teardown is is relevant for quality and

624
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,840
safety inspection as well as cyber

625
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,280
security

626
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,880
research overall

627
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,480
throughout these four years we found

628
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:25,760
more than 100 security flaws

629
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:28,799
and 17 out of these were assigned new

630
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,400
cbe ids

631
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:31,840
unfortunately

632
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:35,679
those 17 still remain on zero days today

633
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,559
all this data is actually uh publicly

634
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,200
available and disclosed we pushed it to

635
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:43,679
uh the robot vulnerability database rvd

636
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:45,039
which is a project that's partially

637
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:47,120
funded by the european union you've got

638
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:48,640
a link over there and we encourage you

639
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:50,960
to check it out to support to help to

640
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,320
help maintain it

641
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:54,559
and to use it as a resource to also do

642
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:56,400
your own research

643
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:58,799
now let us dive now into some of the

644
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,919
examples that uh we poc

645
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:04,159
for illustrating this findings we had

646
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:05,679
the first one on the left side of the

647
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,440
slide shows how

648
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:09,919
essentially we managed to by exploiting

649
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:12,000
one of these vulnerabilities compromise

650
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,080
the robot and particularly compromise

651
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:17,360
its safety subsystem by disabling it we

652
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,760
can see how the robot instead of

653
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,679
stopping when it detects an obstacle it

654
00:24:21,679 --> 00:24:24,480
collides directly against it now imagine

655
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,799
this same reality the same situation in

656
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,799
a hospital with a robot carrying

657
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,279
relevant pillows such as blood or

658
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,760
utensils for surgery whatever this is

659
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:36,320
happening and unfortunately these robots

660
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,240
are vulnerable

661
00:24:38,240 --> 00:24:39,840
the one on the right side shows a bit of

662
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:41,679
a more complicated

663
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,720
attack in here we are using different

664
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,559
vulnerabilities and

665
00:24:46,559 --> 00:24:48,320
the attacker

666
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,640
would need to have certain

667
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:52,880
knowledge of the robotic system because

668
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:57,039
it requires the attacker to essentially

669
00:24:57,039 --> 00:24:59,600
mess up with the computational graph the

670
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,440
computational graph in the robot is the

671
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,080
brain in simple terms and and this graph

672
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,159
essentially uh is in charge of the

673
00:25:06,159 --> 00:25:09,120
behavior overall of the robot um messing

674
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:11,520
up with the graph means you can really

675
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:13,600
make the robot do whatever you want this

676
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,600
of course includes also extract or

677
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,840
exfiltrate the information you want

678
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,440
that's exactly what we are showing in

679
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,039
here after pivoting through different

680
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,120
subsystems we reach the main computer we

681
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,200
access the computational graph and

682
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:27,039
particularly we extract the information

683
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,919
that comes out of the localization

684
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:31,840
modules we extract the map that's being

685
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,799
constructed and we can see that

686
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,480
realistically of course we could also

687
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,640
access camera images and other

688
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,799
information that's being perceived by

689
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:42,640
the robot

690
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:45,760
this third example shows you an instance

691
00:25:45,760 --> 00:25:48,240
of uh ransomware in a collaborative

692
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,240
robot the robots from universal robots

693
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,880
also owned by tedei in this case we're

694
00:25:52,880 --> 00:25:54,480
using a physical attack vector to

695
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,840
illustrate how easy it is to compromise

696
00:25:57,840 --> 00:26:00,480
such a robot uh literally encrypting the

697
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,559
file system disabling the safety

698
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:04,000
mechanisms

699
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,960
and of course asking uh for a ransom now

700
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,320
we are demonstrating it here with a

701
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:10,080
physical attack vector but the same

702
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:12,880
exact thing can be done via network

703
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:14,320
attacks we can do it through local

704
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,320
networks or even adjacent networks and

705
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:18,080
many of these robots are unfortunately

706
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:21,279
connected directly to the internet uh so

707
00:26:21,279 --> 00:26:23,039
definitely concerning and definitely

708
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,720
something we need to work

709
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,679
against which led us to share with you

710
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:30,240
um our thoughts on this uh which point

711
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,919
towards the direction that we should

712
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:33,840
really be very careful about which

713
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,320
robots we place our trust and and we

714
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,880
should take security uh very very

715
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,360
seriously immediately

716
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:44,400
as federico pointed out we uh appreciate

717
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:47,279
uh appreciated sorry certain uh changes

718
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:48,640
in the electronics of these

719
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:51,039
collaborative robots across different

720
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:52,960
versions across older and nowhere

721
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:54,880
versions but we found no real reason why

722
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,760
backwards compatibility uh

723
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:00,159
should be an issue between these robotic

724
00:27:00,159 --> 00:27:01,279
arms

725
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,559
this would mean essentially that

726
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,320
customers with another version of the

727
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:07,520
robotic arm could repair or reuse the

728
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:09,440
mechanics and bring it up to speed with

729
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,279
the new controller which may or may not

730
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,200
add new capabilities without being

731
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,279
forced to pay a premium price and we are

732
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:17,520
speaking about tens of thousands of us

733
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,679
dollars and so in some cases much much

734
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:20,960
more than that

735
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,960
unsurprisingly uh we observed that the

736
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:25,279
manufacturer introduced subtle changes

737
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,200
meant to make this particular intent

738
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,679
harder which we can only justify as what

739
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:31,840
appears to be attempts to exercise

740
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,600
obsolescence practices

741
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,279
a number of such actions includes the

742
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,279
obscurity we observed around the changes

743
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,039
introduced with newer versions of the

744
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,679
robots particularly these changes can be

745
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:43,840
summarized as adding

746
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,320
an extra sensor a six axis four start

747
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:48,000
sensor at the tip of the robot to gain

748
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:50,240
additional sensing capabilities

749
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,559
uh for smaller behaviors and new uh

750
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,480
behaviors overall now the exact same

751
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:56,159
thing can be done in the uh older

752
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,399
version of the robot and the lack of

753
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,760
transparency once again uh will impact

754
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:04,399
end users and and will make them uh or

755
00:28:04,399 --> 00:28:06,399
force many of them to buy complete new

756
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:08,880
sets against spending many many many

757
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:11,840
resources in a very uh much unneeded

758
00:28:11,840 --> 00:28:14,158
manner

759
00:28:14,559 --> 00:28:17,919
so of course we uh we dived deeper we

760
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,360
wanted to uh at least poc ah a way to

761
00:28:21,360 --> 00:28:23,279
bypass these obsolescence practices and

762
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,120
we developed two prototypes the first

763
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:27,600
one which we named controller adapter

764
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,159
allowed us to electrically interoperate

765
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:32,399
older and newer versions exchanging

766
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:35,840
controllers with mechanics and so on the

767
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,600
other way around as well

768
00:28:37,600 --> 00:28:39,200
this took us

769
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:40,799
essentially just

770
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:43,360
just some crafty mechanical component

771
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:46,720
with electrical matching uh connectors

772
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,880
for a total bill of materials of under

773
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:52,080
20 us dollars so pretty pretty simple

774
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,799
fix uh and pretty useful we believe the

775
00:28:54,799 --> 00:28:57,600
second prototype we made was called arm

776
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,840
adapter and we used a raspberry pi to

777
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,760
interface to interface with the

778
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,559
communication signals at the tip of the

779
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,880
robot giving us the capability to drive

780
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,399
the robot around without the need of an

781
00:29:08,399 --> 00:29:10,399
actual controller of course we

782
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:12,320
discouraged the use of such an approach

783
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,919
in production because we removed

784
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,679
completely many of the safety uh

785
00:29:15,679 --> 00:29:17,520
considerations however with this we

786
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:19,360
demonstrated how teardown empowered

787
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:20,799
research to extend the robot

788
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:22,159
capabilities

789
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,080
and bypass some of the obsolescence

790
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,760
practices and limitations we have

791
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,159
observed

792
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:31,279
now we don't have time to uh go through

793
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:33,039
uh all of these quotes unfortunately

794
00:29:33,039 --> 00:29:35,440
which we observed while cooperating with

795
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,960
many manufacturers these last few years

796
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:39,279
but i'd like to at least stress the last

797
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:42,080
one which really kind of like got into

798
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:45,200
our hearts because we once heard uh from

799
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:48,159
a pretty big manufacturer that they they

800
00:29:48,159 --> 00:29:49,600
literally thought that robot cyber

801
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,600
security was up to the end user of

802
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,000
course we opposed to this statement but

803
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,159
the reality is even worse it's not just

804
00:29:56,159 --> 00:29:58,720
that this is not true it is that cyber

805
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:01,120
security today is up to the hacker

806
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:04,080
robots are so insecure that it's really

807
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,480
up to any attacker

808
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,880
uh to to come up with the right exploit

809
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,799
which is very very easy most of the

810
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,440
times and disrupt industrial operations

811
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,159
so

812
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,480
three last sound bites to try to

813
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:18,480
encourage more proactive research and

814
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,360
mitigations the first one please

815
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:25,120
note that robots are only safe if secure

816
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:27,360
second one tear downs are very much

817
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,320
needed for security research in robotics

818
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:32,559
and we should all together put pressure

819
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,200
on manufacturers to reduce how much time

820
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,559
they take to provide mitigations

821
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:40,880
third and last but not least we

822
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,200
definitely need a right for repair in

823
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,559
robotics

824
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:46,880
one that allows us to fight actively

825
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:48,799
this plant obsolescence practices and

826
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,799
one that allows us to design and come up

827
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:54,559
with better robotic architectures

828
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,279
we hope you enjoyed our small wonder

829
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:00,320
journey we certainly did

830
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:01,919
we'd like to thank

831
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:04,000

832
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,679
awesome to work with you and thank you

833

those of you who want to learn more

836
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:15,360
there is a white paper we are publishing

837
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,840
which you can go ahead and read if you'd

838
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,279
like to learn more

839
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,880
and other than that we're open for

840
