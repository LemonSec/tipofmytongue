[Music]

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:15,679
welcome to our talk the ripple effect

3
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,920
building a diverse security research

4
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:18,720
team

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,560
the catalyst for this talk started with

6
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,680
this

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:23,680
when symantec acquired our startup

8
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:25,119
javelin networks

9
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,519
actually to be more precise it started

10
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,760
with the articles about the acquisition

11
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,719
and more specifically this article

12
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,280
and even to be more specific it was the

13
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,280
caption of this photo down below that

14
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,760
translates into hebrew and asks what is

15
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,920
missing here can you see what is missing

16
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,480
uh in this photo

17
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,440
well there were no misogynist no sexist

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:50,719
or any

19
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,039
bad culture on our core team yet

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,199
initially it consisted entirely of men

21
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:57,039
and no women

22
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:58,559
we understood that there is an

23
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,160
unconscious bias

24
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,440
on our team and we committed to

25
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:06,640
change it and tackle it

26
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,159
so we reached from zero women to

27
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,680
this kind of team so let me introduce

28
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,320
you to our team

29
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,000
jana

30
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,320
omel

31
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,240
shani

32
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,200
i'm um

33
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,960
i manage the endpoint team i have more

34
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,280
than 20 years of experience in the field

35
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,920
i also have a photography bfa

36
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:28,799
and

37
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,360
i strive to make the world a better

38
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,600
place or at least more tolerable for the

39
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:35,119
people around me

40
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:37,200
and let me introduce you to the other

41
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,280
part of this talk who also has a huge

42
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,200
part in making

43
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,000
this thing happen

44
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,240
so hello i'm moyan de paz

45
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,159
i started my way as an automation

46
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,520
developer

47
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,320
but i also love i really love windows

48
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,520
internals and reverse engineering so

49
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:59,439
when i realized that i want a job who

50
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:01,200
requires my constant learning and

51
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,640
stepping out of my comfort zone

52
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,479
i realized that low level and security

53
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,038
security research would probably fit

54
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,038
and

55
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:12,800
i didn't wanted to

56
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,560
give up the development

57
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,959
completely so a combination of both was

58
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,360
perfect and actually this is how i got

59
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,160
to javelin three years ago to omar's

60
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,400
team

61
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,120
during

62
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,840
on my free time i'm also an active

63
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,680
member in women and tech communities

64
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,720
such as

65
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,319
a ba an israeli community and also

66
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:38,239
attended to

67
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,000
black hoodie events

68
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,080
and it's really important for me to be

69
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,720
part of a diverse team not because not

70
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:47,440
only because it improves me personally

71
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,080
but also because

72
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,360
i really

73
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,440
hope to make a difference even the

74
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,360
tiniest of on how we accept others in

75
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,760
our communities and

76
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:01,360
i hope to help

77
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,840
others to start the way in our field

78
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:06,959
so

79
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:09,680
today we're going to present how

80
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,560
we reach how we started with zero women

81
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,640
in javelin networks and

82
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:19,040
eventually reached 50 representation

83
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,120
and it's important to say that our

84
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:23,920
vision was to increase the women women

85
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,879
representation but our strategy was

86
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:32,120
to make the environment that enables it

87
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:35,440
according to the global gender gap

88
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,560
report of 2020 it will take

89
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,159
on average more than 100 years for women

90
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:45,599
to reach gender equality

91
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,480
more than 100 years

92
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,840
i'll let it sink for a moment

93
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,400
and eventually we're going to show you

94
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,480
our own repel effect of

95
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,400
how the employing technique that meant

96
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,799
to improve the diversity and inclusion

97
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,200
on our team

98
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,480
ended up

99
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,080
and improved other aspects as well

100
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,040
we

101
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,280
reach faster deliveries

102
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:16,238
better collaboration and eventually a

103
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:19,279
better place to work it

104
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:21,839
during our talk we're going to show you

105
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,680
we're hoping to give you some tools the

106
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,160
tools that helped us to

107
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,800
achieve our goal and

108
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:31,120
we have tools for everyone whether if

109
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,360
you're a team member

110
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,840
team leader or leader

111
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:36,800
and

112
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,639
there will appear in the upper right

113
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,320
corner of the screen of the screen

114
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:44,479
so

115
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:45,919
our story begins

116
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:48,880
uh with the roy guyana mog

117
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:52,000
who founded javelin networks in tel aviv

118
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,800
and they started with a goal to protect

119
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,720
the active directory

120
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,479
from active direct to protect the

121
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,960
enterprise from active directory threats

122
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:02,960
and they wanted to do it from the

123
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:04,320
endpoint

124
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,880
and i joined the

125
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,600
java networks team as a core member

126
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,360
and as you might imagine

127
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,800
the endpoint team for a product that

128
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,720
runs from the endpoint

129
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:15,600
is

130
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,039
one of the core

131
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,080
foundations of this

132
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,639
of the product

133
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,639
the endpoint team is a little bit

134
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:27,600
different from other things because it

135
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,840
neither the usual research team and nor

136
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,400
the usual development team it is a

137
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,240
full-blown research team

138
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:36,479
that does low-level research manual

139
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,039
analysis and also

140
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:41,600
devising novel detection and protection

141
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,560
technique prevention techniques

142
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,320
and on the other hand

143
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:48,320
we don't stop there we're also

144
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,120
a

145
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:51,360
development team the developer develops

146
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,600
both user mode and kernel mode

147
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,639
code that runs on millions of endpoints

148
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:58,720
and we must excel both so you can

149
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:00,240
imagine that finding engineers with

150
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,720
experience in both areas

151
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,600
is very rare let alone finding

152
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:06,720
women

153
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,919
with those

154
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:10,479
kind of expertise

155
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,400
so as i said in the beginning when

156
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:14,639
symantec acquired us and later broadcom

157
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:17,039
acquired the symantec it was a

158
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,840
an opportunity for us to scale the team

159
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,520
and that meant for us it was an

160
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:24,880
opportunity for a change

161
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,720
so let's start with the first step

162
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,560
for the change that we took and that

163
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,479
started with recruitment

164
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,440
so before we start diving into equipment

165
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,000
it's important to say this i know a lot

166
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,240
of people are saying it but we mean to

167
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,319
recruit for the long run and we are not

168
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:43,680
just saying it

169
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,960
out loud

170
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,680
because the average yield of service of

171
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:49,840
the people in javelin and

172
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,120
it includes

173
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,680
the new members and all the old members

174
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,520
and even members that left is

175
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,680
approaching five years and when you have

176
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,639
this time frame to employ a person

177
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,720
you can think on anal orthodox this you

178
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,120
can take unorthodox decisions uh in the

179
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,800
recruitment process

180
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,199
uh one example that i can give you

181
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,960
is that uh when

182
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,360
we interviewed cheney for the team

183
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,120
we thought she would be a great fit for

184
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:17,280
us and could very

185
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,919
could help the team succeed

186
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,680
and we decided to recruit her even

187
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:24,240
though she was in maternity leave so we

188
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,240
recorded her and waited a helpful to

189
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,560
finish her maternity leave

190
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,639
and it was totally forward for us

191
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,680
so

192
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,360
the first thing you need to do

193
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:38,800
is to measure everything and i mean by

194
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,120
everything so you start measuring in the

195
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,599
recruitment process how many resume you

196
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,400
got of women how many resumes you got of

197
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,199
men

198
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,199
and every step along the way you measure

199
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,520
again to see that you are

200
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,759
that you remain with the exact

201
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:55,120
number

202
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,960
or percentage of resume

203
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:57,680
so

204
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,840
you count how many past the technical

205
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,039
screening

206
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:02,560
how many pass the phone screening how

207
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,240
many passed

208
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:06,400
each test along the way and if you find

209
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:08,720
any deviation from the original numbers

210
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,560
then it means you have unconscious bias

211
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,840
and you need to tackle it

212
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:16,400
so the first type

213
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,160
you need to do is to reformat a job

214
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,280
description

215
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:21,039
and before we did this

216
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,639
we took this step

217
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,080
we only got 2.5 percent of women resume

218
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:27,840
on our pipeline

219
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,840
and there is a great article by moran

220
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:31,360
weber you have the link over there we

221
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,519
will also post it on our

222
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:35,440
instagram instagram on our twitter

223
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,799
account sorry

224
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:37,760
and

225
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,880
you can

226
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:41,279
go over there i will not recite the

227
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,039
the things she says because there's a

228
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,080
lot of it more than just recruitment

229
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,120
but just

230
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,480
know that you have this resource

231
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,120
available for you

232
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,440
the first step i took

233
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:54,560
to

234
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,920
grow the team

235
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,519
and the recruitment is to actually

236
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:59,040
contact

237
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,360
women in tech communities like boat and

238
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,770
leading cyber ladies and every

239
00:09:05,770 --> 00:09:07,279
[Music]

240
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,040
community i could find

241
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,200
and actually by being genuine and

242
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:13,600
listening to their tips like they

243
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:16,480
pointed me to moan weber's article

244
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,880
and listening and applying those

245
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,640
changes they required

246
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,080
it allowed me to post my job listing on

247
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,240
their phones which no other recruiter

248
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:29,040
could get to get to and this was

249
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,720
reaching exactly the audience we were

250
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,959
looking for

251
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,839
another venue

252
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,240
to tackle is to contact mentors of a

253
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,320
women coding organization like shecodes

254
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,399
in israel and ask them to recommend on

255
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,720
graduates from their programs

256
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:48,160
and lastly contacting the

257
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,480
candidates directly via linkedin if they

258
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,279
fit the job requirements

259
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:55,200
and

260
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,959
when we took all of those steps we

261
00:09:56,959 --> 00:09:59,120
actually managed to increase

262
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,519
the female the women resume that we got

263
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,680
from 2.5 to 50

264
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:06,240
so we already started the process uh

265
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,440
with and even gone

266
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:11,120
there is another

267
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,000
term that was coined by a ktk and claire

268
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,560
shipman called the confidence gap

269
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,920
and i'll read you a

270
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,120
quote by them

271
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,880
evidence show that women are less

272
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,800
self-assured than men

273
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,519
and to succeed confidence matters

274
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,600
as much as competence

275
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,000
and the confidence the confidence gap

276
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,360
actually describes a phenomenon

277
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,480
where mostly women are less confident

278
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,440
than men so the most permanent example

279
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,240
of this is when men apply to a job they

280
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,720
only look if their fit 50 percent of the

281
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:50,240
requirements for the job while women

282
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,120
need to fit at least 100 if not more

283
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:55,200
when they apply for the job so when you

284
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,360
list the same job listing you get a

285
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,320
completely different resume from women

286
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,720
and went to the same job listing

287
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:04,240
and on that regard we actually had a

288
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,600
happy accident

289
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,200
and this is a tip i will share with you

290
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,760
how you can increase your

291
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,760
resume that you get from

292
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,680
women and other less confident audience

293
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,440
we posted a

294
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,040
job listing for both

295
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,120
women and men

296
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,160
sorry

297
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:24,000
we posted a job listing for senior and

298
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:24,630
junior

299
00:11:24,630 --> 00:11:26,880
[Music]

300
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,480
candidate for uh

301
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,920
cinderella and junior

302
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,519
and we got about

303
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:34,320
uh 40 cvs and i will let you guess which

304
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,480
gender applied to which all and when we

305
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,560
looked at the cvs themselves we actually

306
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:41,199
found out that

307
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:43,680
the years of experience in those series

308
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:44,480
were

309
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,240
almost the same

310
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,279
so

311
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,440
instead of trying to find a middle

312
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,680
ground and post a job one job listing

313
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:53,120
that

314
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:55,360
tries to address both success

315
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,720
you can actually

316
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:58,959
post two job listing for the same world

317
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,360
and filter it out by the

318
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:03,360
years of experience and the requirements

319
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,480
for your job

320
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,800
and this actually creates a level

321
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,040
ground for both the more confident and

322
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,560
less confident

323
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,319
audience that you are trying to reach

324
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:16,560
the other part of the recruitment

325
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:19,200
process is the technical screening and

326
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,639
the thing we do different is that the

327
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,480
technical scanning is simply a past no

328
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,839
pass there is no score and we are not

329
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:28,800
basing who scored better on the

330
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,399
candidates

331
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,079
we simply

332
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:33,360
check if they pass the minimum

333
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,920
requirements to feed the role

334
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,959
and

335
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,120
what we do in our case is we give the

336
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,120
candidates a home assignment

337
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,120
we make sure that the test actually

338
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,120
checks something we do on the team so we

339
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,200
chose a task that the team does we

340
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,760
dumped it down to a two to four hours

341
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,720
test and we give it to the candidates

342
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,240
to

343
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,120
do this exercise at home

344
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,639
one thing we do differently with the

345
00:12:58,639 --> 00:12:59,760
home assignment is we call the

346
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,519
candidates right at the beginning to see

347
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,360
they understood the questions they know

348
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,720
what they need to do

349
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:07,519
and we call every hour or sometimes even

350
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:08,800
less

351
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,040
to monitor the progress of the

352
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,360
candidates and also to

353
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:15,680
make sure they are staying on track not

354
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:16,880
deviating

355
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,200
to any other place they shouldn't go

356
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,200
but what we also

357
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,680
find out during these calls is that

358
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:24,639
we can

359
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:27,279
learn if the candidate is under stress

360
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,279
we understood that when you give someone

361
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,839
a test that is limited by time

362
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:34,160
it creates stress and can dramatically

363
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,959
change the performance so during these

364
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,959
calls we also try to monitor for stress

365
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:40,000
and

366
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,600
understand if the candidate knows what

367
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,959
they need to do and if they do

368
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,440
we know how to adjust

369
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,199
on this case

370
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:50,399
so

371
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:52,800
how was your

372
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,160
home assignment

373
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:56,800
so uh that's actually a really great

374
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,199
question because

375
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:01,519
actually mine didn't went so well and

376
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:03,440
that's why i was so surprised when omar

377
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:05,680
called me because i was so stressed and

378
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,639
he told me that um

379
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,120
he could tell from our phone calls that

380
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,360
i knew what's needed to be done

381
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:15,519
but um

382
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,000
my final result didn't reflecting it

383
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,560
wasn't reflecting it and just revealed

384
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:22,959
my stress so

385
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:25,279
he suggested me doing it over the

386
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:28,399
weekend again i without the four hours

387
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,680
limitation and this time i felt so much

388
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:33,519
better and my performance

389
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:37,120
er when it were even better

390
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,440
so this one is really important because

391
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,839
actually without these phone calls omar

392
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,760
couldn't tell

393
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,240
that i'm stressed and

394
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:48,399
we if he couldn't tell that i'm stressed

395
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,560
and he wouldn't know that i know what's

396
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,480
needed to be done it wouldn't give me

397
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,320
the second chance and

398
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,920
without the second chance i would

399
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,680
probably won't be here today

400
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:02,079
thank you everyone for sharing this

401
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,160
another important thing when you give

402
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:06,240
when you do the technical screening is

403
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,160
to make sure you don't give any riddles

404
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:10,639
or whiteboard tests to the

405
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,800
candidates because researchers have

406
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,040
shown that when you test when you use

407
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,800
those kind of tests you're actually

408
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,240
testing whether the candidate is

409
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,079
confident or not and you're not testing

410
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:22,240
if the candidate is competent

411
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,519
for the job

412
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:25,519
so eliminate those as much as you can

413
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,279
from your

414
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:29,279
technical screening process

415
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:30,720
and

416
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:31,920
lastly

417
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:34,240
if you want to evaluate the candidate

418
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,560
the actual evaluation is by character

419
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:38,160
because this

420
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,399
affects much greater how the candidate

421
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:43,759
will fit uh and perform on the job

422
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:44,480
and

423
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,000
that's the personality of the person

424
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,240
that they will

425
00:15:48,240 --> 00:15:49,759
tell you

426
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:52,079
we will predict how well the candidate

427
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:53,680
will perform on your job

428
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:55,600
so every time

429
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:57,920
you post a job listing also try to make

430
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,320
a list of what are the personality

431
00:16:00,320 --> 00:16:01,600
traits that you're looking on your

432
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,480
candidates for example on our team we

433
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,639
were looking for passion

434
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,399
because you need to have someone with a

435
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,560
drive to do what we do if they don't

436
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,079
have passion they will

437
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:14,000
quit very fast you need to have

438
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,000
perseverance because when you do

439
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,680
research

440
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,360
research involves a lot of failing and

441
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,199
if the person can't

442
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,440
stand up on the feet again and try to do

443
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,720
it again and again

444
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,720
again they will quit and we want people

445
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,399
to continue

446
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:30,480
the research as much as they can

447
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,759
next thing we were looking is the

448
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:34,320
ability and willingness to learn

449
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,199
and

450
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:36,800
because we want our

451
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,800
employees to grow over time so we want

452
00:16:38,800 --> 00:16:41,839
them to be able to learn and lastly

453
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,360
we are looking to diversify their

454
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,199
thought process because again this is

455
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,040
important not only for the team but for

456
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,480
research it's

457
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:51,040
it gives you a great advantage when you

458
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,199
have a lot of different perspective

459
00:16:53,199 --> 00:16:55,279
so for example from our team

460
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,800
we have

461
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,320
team members with the experience in

462
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,600
reverse engineering in software

463
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:02,000
engineering in embedded development game

464
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,679
development devops automation

465
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,319
we also have

466
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,720
team members with who are humanities

467
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,640
graduates some who are computer science

468
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:14,559
graduates and some who are

469
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:15,439
the

470
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,240
university of life graduates

471
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,480
yeah

472
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,720
so one thing that i want to share

473
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:25,760
regarding the recruitment forces is

474
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:28,640
that being the first prospective woman

475
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:30,240
on the group might be a little bit

476
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:32,960
intimidating and i admit that i add some

477
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,440
concerns

478
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:38,480
this could be fixed really easily

479
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:40,240
just if i would just meet the team

480
00:17:40,240 --> 00:17:41,679
before i joined

481
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:47,320
and this of course was fixed later on

482
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,919
okay so now after we discuss the

483
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,760
equipment process let's talk about the

484
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:54,320
onboarding

485
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,480
and first point we are talking about

486
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,840
onboarding where um

487
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:00,960
i trying to

488
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,559
uh we are we want to talk about the

489
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:04,960
on-job training right but before i'll

490
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,120
talk about it on job training i want us

491
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,000
to

492
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,120
uh all of us will realize a

493
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,559
few uh

494
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,559
principles on our team

495
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,120
the first one is that knowledge gaps are

496
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,559
assumed

497
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,000
and

498
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,080
we understand that researchers who knows

499
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,640
everything exists you know in our own

500
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:26,960
project zero or in our imagination and

501
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,840
i'm not even sure about the format

502
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,960
so

503
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:33,120
new hires should know that it is okay

504
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,760
not to know something because

505
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,320
they can free to feel anything and no

506
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,200
one will judge them

507
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,760
a

508
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,039
and

509
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:47,520
it's eventually the team

510
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:50,880
the team is mendel's uh responsibility

511
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:53,600
to create a safe and supporting learning

512
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,880
environment

513
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:58,480
and this one is extremely important and

514
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:00,880
in my opinion because managers can do

515
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,960
their best we can make the best training

516
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,160
they can

517
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,480
but without the team's collaboration it

518
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,240
won't be 100

519
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,679
percent successful and so

520
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:13,679
every team member counts

521
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,799
in this place and in this case

522
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:18,240
and

523
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,880
we need to be patient

524
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:24,400
we need to be available for question and

525
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,720
of course we should share our knowledge

526
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:27,919
with others

527
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:30,160
and i truly believe that what you give

528
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:31,520
is what you get

529
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:33,200
because

530
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,720
if you'll be patient

531
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,280
you'll get patient responses right and

532
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,280
if you help others

533
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:41,600
they will help you the same

534
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,240
and it's important to understand that in

535
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:45,360
a diverse

536
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,280
a team

537
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,918
with all these responsibilities

538
00:19:51,679 --> 00:19:54,080
it is more than likely for team members

539
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:58,720
to help uh that i will help someone

540
00:19:58,720 --> 00:19:59,679
a

541
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:02,000
one day and the other day i'm gonna need

542
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:03,679
their help so

543
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,200
keep that in mind

544
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:08,960
also a

545
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,400
by doing this

546
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,520
on job training it helps to um

547
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,559
meet a to it helps the new wires to meet

548
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:18,320
each other each

549
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,640
team members and their area of expertise

550
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,640
right at the start of their employee

551
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:25,280
employment

552
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,600
so okay now we can talk about the

553
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,960
training and jana joined the team like

554
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:33,760
few weeks after me and

555
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:35,039
on our first

556
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:37,280
few months we had no requirement to

557
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,039
complete any task

558
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:41,679
it means that we were 100

559
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,760
focused on our training

560
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,960
learning

561
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,039
only learning we

562
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:49,679
read from books articles sessions with

563
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:52,320
omar and central

564
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,679
and

565
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:54,559
even

566
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:56,159
more than that

567
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:57,919
on the first year

568
00:20:57,919 --> 00:21:00,960
new wires are not part of the a velocity

569
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,960
calculation of the team

570
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:07,919
so anything that they deliver is a bonus

571
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:09,360
and

572
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,000
we know that stress to deliver leads to

573
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,720
overworking leads to burnout leads to

574
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:18,320
the dark side so

575
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,000
we need to allow

576
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,720
new hires we should allow new hires to

577
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,880
prove themselves over time and not in a

578
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,440
very short window of time and this will

579
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,320
reduce their stress

580
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,080
so it's also very important because it

581
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,240
creates an atmosphere of trust with the

582
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,799
two with the new team members

583
00:21:38,799 --> 00:21:40,960
to deliver the best they can in a

584
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:43,039
healthy manner while

585
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:45,679
preserving their work-life work life

586
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,360
balance they wish to preserve

587
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,720
and what we could have done better

588
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,480
on this process was

589
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:56,720
uh to have a better uh platform to

590
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:59,120
socialize with the team members and we

591
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,679
could fix it easily with

592
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:05,919
um mutual lunch breaks a coffee breaks

593
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,480
a happy hours non-alcoholic one but with

594
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,360
board games or whatever and

595
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,480
uh

596
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:15,440
yeah it's pretty easy

597
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:17,679
so

598
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,919
now after we talk about about the

599
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,400
onboarding we can discuss about the

600
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,720
day-to-day right

601
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,520
and

602
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:26,960
it's the team

603
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,400
leader's responsibility to

604
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,320
split a task equally

605
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,720
between the team members

606
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:36,960
so

607
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,919
the team members can set their ego aside

608
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,919
and there will be no competition within

609
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:43,120
the team

610
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:44,080
and

611
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:45,679
i know you're going to think for

612
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:47,280
yourself like

613
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:49,679
uh no it's it's not going to work for me

614
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:51,360
i'm too competitive i'm a very

615
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,120
competitive person and trust me i know i

616
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,440
am a very competitive person

617
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,240
but

618
00:22:58,240 --> 00:23:00,880
the moment i learned to trust omer to

619
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,200
give me and the team the right task for

620
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,400
us

621
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,880
i could say this i could let this go

622
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:10,000
and i felt so much better and i think

623
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,799
that the the team also i could tell the

624
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:13,840
difference

625
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,559
and so this one is

626
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:21,720
ah you should do it too it's okay

627
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:23,679
and

628
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:26,960
regarding our knowledge sharing culture

629
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,520
actually this one is everyone's

630
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,440
responsibility and everyone takes part

631
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:32,400
of it

632
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,200
like

633
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,080
the leader's responsibility is to create

634
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,720
the uh platforms the standard platforms

635
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,720
for knowledge sharing that we know right

636
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:44,559
like uh wikis like sprint demos internal

637
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:47,120
team demos etc and

638
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:50,480
it's the team leaders responsibility to

639
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,720
reward knowledge sharing on the team

640
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:54,559
instead of knowledge hiding

641
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:55,440
and

642
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,200
all that's left to do for the team is

643
00:23:57,200 --> 00:23:59,520
just share them knowledge not only work

644
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,360
related by the way and

645
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,120
just be friendly kind supportive

646
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:06,000
and

647
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,080
actually we have a really great example

648
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:10,159
here when america one of the team

649
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:12,880
members uh worked on a really really

650
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,240
huge project

651
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,880
uh he shared with us his knowledge doing

652
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,520
a along the task

653
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,400
and

654
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:24,799
this was allowed him to um

655
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:27,679
disallow the team to help him

656
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,840
in no time when the time was tight

657
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,080
and if he wouldn't share with his

658
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:33,600
knowledge with us

659
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,360
along the way

660
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:38,879
it would take much longer

661
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:42,960
and on top of sharing knowledge

662
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:44,480
there is another

663
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,039
really great effect for uh the teams

664
00:24:47,039 --> 00:24:49,200
sharing knowledge with each other and

665
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:51,520
this is where we got to our first ripple

666
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,279
effect for today and it's that

667
00:24:55,279 --> 00:24:56,159
the

668
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,159
this known sharing culture is really

669
00:24:58,159 --> 00:24:59,600
improved the

670
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:01,840
self-confidence and the communication

671
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,000
skills of the team

672
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,880
and again i can personally share that i

673
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,720
wouldn't be here today

674
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:10,400
standing here

675
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,760
without all these

676
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,760
tools

677
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:16,480
so

678
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,640
next we have a pair of programming and

679
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:21,120
whenever it's possible

680
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:21,840
we

681
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:24,480
work on tax tasks in pairs

682
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:25,679
and

683
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,440
i know you're gonna think for yourself

684
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,679
like oh it's too expensive i have two

685
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,520
engineers working on the same desk

686
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:34,159
instead of one and this would probably

687
00:25:34,159 --> 00:25:36,880
ended up in a really uh

688
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,600
really uh longer time and i can tell you

689
00:25:39,600 --> 00:25:42,480
that the exact opposite it's uh is right

690
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,360
because

691
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:46,159
the exact a very similar task that took

692
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:48,799
six months from one engineer to kiana

693
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,200
and i uh when we paired together

694
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,520
um

695
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,360
something like one month okay and

696
00:25:57,360 --> 00:25:59,440
not only that the result

697
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:01,360
was much faster

698
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,279
it also um

699
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:05,120
was much more stable

700
00:26:05,120 --> 00:26:05,840
and

701
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:07,840
we even worked on it remotely like we

702
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,720
just shared the screen and

703
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:13,760
like classic programming every one of us

704
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:16,080
um

705
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:19,919
jana a a coded and i advise or the

706
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:22,400
opposite and we switched and it was it

707
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,840
went really great

708
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,360
next

709
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,000
we have weekly learning hours which are

710
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,320
actually weekly two hours

711
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,640
and i really like this one because

712
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,440
every team member gets to choose a topic

713
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,279
that's anything that you find

714
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:40,400
interesting

715
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:44,320
and then we watch a talk within our team

716
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:46,799
and we discuss about it or we can do

717
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,360
cutters or we can do ctfs and this one

718
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:52,159
is really cool and not that just that

719
00:26:52,159 --> 00:26:54,960
it's cool it's also by making it part of

720
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:55,919
the

721
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,360
working hours

722
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,559
uh we allow the team members uh who can

723
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,799
invest their time outside

724
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:05,440
the work hours like parents or team

725
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:07,279
members with a

726
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:10,080
different interests or liabilities

727
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,480
uh to focus their career and knowledge

728
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:14,559
during the work hours

729
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,840
so this one is really cool

730
00:27:18,159 --> 00:27:20,960
and of course whenever we can uh we

731
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:24,399
choose um not whatever we can always we

732
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:25,360
keep

733
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,080
the

734
00:27:26,080 --> 00:27:30,080
speaker list diverse as well

735
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,880
thank you

736
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,559
another thing that we take

737
00:27:34,559 --> 00:27:36,240
very seriously

738
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:38,399
is a long level of absence and usually

739
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:39,679
when you think about a long leg of

740
00:27:39,679 --> 00:27:41,760
absence you think about maternity or

741
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:45,200
paternity but for us it's not just that

742
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:46,240
also

743
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:48,880
bereavement and long vacation for us our

744
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,480
longer

745
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,360
leave of absence and for us

746
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,799
we

747
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,559
make it viable

748
00:27:56,559 --> 00:27:59,120
for the team members to take this kind

749
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,080
of

750
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,760
long live of absence

751
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,520
we understand that as we said before the

752
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,360
employees are here for the long journey

753
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,600
not just for two years

754
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,559
and ago

755
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:10,000
and

756
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,320
we build the environment

757
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:14,840
so the team can take

758
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:16,159
whatever uh

759
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:17,679
long level of actions they need for

760
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,039
whatever ranges because sometimes you

761
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:21,120
can't even predict what the

762
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,799
reason will be

763
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:25,840
so we make sure there is no uh one

764
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,360
person on the team that the whole team

765
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,880
relies on

766
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:31,200
for example if someone

767
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:33,520
has an area of expertise we make sure

768
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:35,760
that other team members will learn this

769
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,640
area and can cover that person

770
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,640
when and if that person needs to take

771
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:42,240
the longer

772
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:43,760
leave of absence

773
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,399
so

774
00:28:44,399 --> 00:28:46,880
when we make it a viable option

775
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,200
we allow the employees to take it and

776
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,960
use it whenever they need and because we

777
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:54,000
already created an environment of trust

778
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,440
with employees we know that they will

779
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:59,440
use it and will not abuse this option

780
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,120
and if you think about it in a more

781
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,559
holistic way this is the actual

782
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,159
work-life balance because work-life

783
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,520
balance is not just

784
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:08,960
the eighth work hours you go to you walk

785
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:09,919
and then

786
00:29:09,919 --> 00:29:12,159
go home but it's actually the whole

787
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,240
work-life balance of the whole life of

788
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,480
the employee that we want to maintain

789
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,039
and we're getting back to the same thing

790
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,880
we did with our equipment

791
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,320
even on the day-to-day we need to

792
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:27,120
measure everything and orion already

793
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,080
mentioned

794
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:29,760
when we distribute the task between the

795
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:32,000
team we measure the importance and the

796
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,159
complexity of each tasks and if you

797
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,320
think about it when you assign a complex

798
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,399
task or an important task to a team

799
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:39,520
member

800
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:41,120
it can greatly affect

801
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,320
their promotion and their progress so we

802
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,159
make it transparent to the team what are

803
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,480
the tasks that the team will work on and

804
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,399
we assign them equally between the team

805
00:29:50,399 --> 00:29:52,240
members and that creates a sense of

806
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,480
fairness for the team which is sometimes

807
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,640
very important for people to to have a

808
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,480
sense that people need to have on their

809
00:29:58,480 --> 00:29:59,760
workplace

810
00:29:59,760 --> 00:30:00,880
and

811
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,640
eventually it creates a leveled ground

812
00:30:02,640 --> 00:30:04,000
for everyone

813
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:04,799
to

814
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,320
progress their career

815
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,799
and there is a

816
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:12,720
ripple effect that we didn't

817
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,480
think about before because on a

818
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,320
non-diverse team there is there will

819
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,600
always be some kind of tasks that create

820
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,039
a churn or burnout for the team and the

821
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:25,200
team members really hate to do them or

822
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,960
when they do them sometimes they even

823
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,080
quit

824
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,919
after doing them too much but when you

825
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,080
have a diverse team you will always find

826
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,320
at least one team member that actually

827
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:36,080
can completely tolerate those jobs and

828
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:38,640
doesn't mind doing that so by assigning

829
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,120
those uh painful tasks that might be

830
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:42,960
painful for others to

831
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,320
some team members that it won't be

832
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:46,240
painful for them we can actually

833
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,039
dramatically reduce the burnout on the

834
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:51,200
on the team

835
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:52,799
another thing we measure is the pace of

836
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:55,039
progress and here it's important not to

837
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:57,039
measure the working hours

838
00:30:57,039 --> 00:31:00,240
we just measure the pace

839
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:01,440
and

840
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:03,039
when you measure everything

841
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,720
now you can actually measure and make

842
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,159
sure that the compensation you give to

843
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:07,279
the employees

844
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,600
is equal you can make sure that the the

845
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,840
salary the bonuses and the promotions

846
00:31:11,840 --> 00:31:13,760
that the employees get

847
00:31:13,760 --> 00:31:17,039
are fair and are based on the actually

848
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:18,960
actual performance and not something

849
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,600
arbitrary or like sometimes even because

850
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:24,080
they participated in project that was a

851
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:25,120
success

852
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,239
because it was a complex one

853
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,480
uh one more thing that we measure which

854
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,240
is not trivial is the external

855
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,600
connection the team members get to work

856
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:34,640
with

857
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:36,159
we realize that the high profile

858
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:38,320
projects are usually involved working

859
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:40,000
with teams from external

860
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:41,279
with external

861
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:42,399
teams

862
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:43,679
and

863
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:46,000
one thing to understand in this is that

864
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:48,240
if you if you already know the people it

865
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,840
will greatly

866
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:51,840
improve your chances of succeeding the

867
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,679
task and making it

868
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:55,440
work even faster

869
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,480
and

870
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,640
what we found out is that the

871
00:31:58,640 --> 00:32:00,880
work environment prefers the

872
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:03,360
stereotypical man and it doesn't have to

873
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,440
be men also

874
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,080
it doesn't have to

875
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,840
affect only women who don't possibly

876
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,399
participate in those activities also men

877
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:16,960
some men don't like those activities

878
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:19,120
so activities like ping pong going to

879
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,240
the beach

880
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:23,279
alcoholic appeals or alcoholic going out

881
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:24,480
for the

882
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,679
company

883
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,159
activities that not all team members

884
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:30,320
like and want to participate but if you

885
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,919
think about it when you participate in

886
00:32:31,919 --> 00:32:33,760
those activities you get to create

887
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,360
external connections with team members

888
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:38,080
from all over the company and when time

889
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,679
comes that you need to work with them

890
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,600
you will have a great advantage over

891
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:42,640
people that

892
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,799
didn't participate in those

893
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,000
activities

894
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,320
so we don't want to penalize the people

895
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,679
who are doing it we want to create an

896
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,159
even ground and we actually do this by

897
00:32:52,159 --> 00:32:54,559
extending the opportunity for everyone

898
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,480
so when we assign tasks to the team

899
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,240
members we also measure uh how much

900
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,559
connections this task will create with

901
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:05,039
external teams so we make sure when we

902
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:07,200
assign those tasks we also assign them

903
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:08,399
equally

904
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:10,960
to all team members to create a level

905
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:13,519
ground even if they don't want or

906
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:16,559
like to participate in those activities

907
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:17,919
so for example

908
00:33:17,919 --> 00:33:20,320
uh when roy and jana were pairing

909
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,200
they

910
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,760
actually got to work with another team

911
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,640
on their

912
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:26,799
task and later when jana

913
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:29,279
had a really important task that was

914
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:32,080
that involved the same team to work with

915
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,399
she performed really well and managed to

916
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:39,158
complete the task extremely fast

917
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:42,080
the last thing that we focus on the team

918
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,440
is golf

919
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,159
and

920
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:46,320
we do this when we assign the task so

921
00:33:46,320 --> 00:33:48,000
unless time is an issue

922
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,720
we also try to look if

923
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:53,200
the team member not which temper team

924
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,120
member is best fit for the task but who

925
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:57,279
can grow the most by performing those

926
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:59,600
tasks and it allows the team members to

927
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,519
break out of their comfort zone and to

928
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:03,279
work on stuff that they wouldn't get the

929
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:05,600
chance otherwise

930
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,840
it means that on the background we have

931
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:10,000
the team ready to assist those

932
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,440
team members that are stepping out of

933
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,800
their comfort zone and when we do this

934
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,879
we create another ripple effect because

935
00:34:16,879 --> 00:34:18,800
we improve the self-efficacy of the team

936
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,159
members we increase the self-confidence

937
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:24,000
and the professional

938
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:26,399
progress

939
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:29,199
lastly i want to touch briefly on

940
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,000
working remotely as we head on the

941
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,440
corona

942
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:35,280
time

943
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,119
so the first thing we did was to start

944
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,199
to conduct a daily stand-up

945
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,520
on the team and now we switch to every

946
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:43,839
other day stand up and we try to do it a

947
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:47,119
little bit longer than the usual

948
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:48,320
stand up

949
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,239
we talk about the task about the

950
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:52,800
setbacks that each person had and

951
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:54,159
a lot of the times

952
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,918
another team member can actually assist

953
00:34:55,918 --> 00:34:56,960
and tell the

954
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,440
the other team member give them advice

955
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,599
how to fix or how to overcome the

956
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,720
problem

957
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,760
just by sharing the issues that we have

958
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:08,720
uh one thing that we gained from those

959
00:35:08,720 --> 00:35:11,520
remote work is dia so as i said javelin

960
00:35:11,520 --> 00:35:14,560
network was a startup in tel aviv diane

961
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,240
joined javelin networks even before me

962
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,240
but dion was always a remote worker from

963
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,520
slovenia

964
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,560
and when we started doing the remote

965
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,800
the remote daily stand-up

966
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,119
we actually got to know diane and

967
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:29,520
got to work with him on a daily basis

968
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,200
and before

969
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,000
the corona we just gave diane a task

970
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,720
and he would complete it in about a

971
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:38,960
few weeks we'll get the

972
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,640
result give him another task and that

973
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:42,960
was like a sun and forget a relationship

974
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:45,599
but switching to the daily stand up we

975
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,359
actually got to know to know diane and

976
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:49,920
by knowing them knowing him and working

977
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:50,880
with him

978
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,599
closely we gained a tremendous amount of

979
00:35:53,599 --> 00:35:55,440
knowledge from diane and

980
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,400
it made the whole team progress

981
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:01,359
in huge big huge steps

982
00:36:01,359 --> 00:36:03,280
so that was a win for us

983
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,200
another thing we did during the corona

984
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:08,240
is to create an availability timeline so

985
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:10,720
whenever someone on the team has any

986
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,400
schedule restrictions like parents who

987
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:14,320
needs to take care of their children

988
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,200
specific hours or students or any other

989
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:19,760
aesthetic section you can think about

990
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,560
we

991
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:22,800
post it on our timeline and we never set

992
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,040
up meetings that conflict with those

993
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,960
hours so we always set meetings when the

994
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:28,320
whole team

995
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:30,960
can participate

996
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:32,880
and the ripple effect we got from

997
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:35,599
employing all of those things is that

998
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,440
the employees are actually more

999
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:38,800
productive

1000
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,400
they work on flexible working hours

1001
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:41,680
whenever

1002
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,920
they feel they can

1003
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:45,599
they are much more productive during the

1004
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:46,960
work hours because they don't need to

1005
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,520
commute to work every day and so they

1006
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,839
are much more effective on that

1007
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:55,440
regard uh what we are still trying to do

1008
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:58,400
better during the corona is uh to

1009
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,960
social socialize more we are trying to

1010
00:37:00,960 --> 00:37:02,640
we try to do their about coffee breaks

1011
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:05,280
and still not so much successful so if

1012
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,119
you have any suggestions our dm's are

1013
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:10,480
open for your ideas

1014
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,200
so

1015
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,880
i want to continue to conclude all the

1016
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:13,760
tools

1017
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,880
you got from this talk with a quote by

1018
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,400
joseph jacob

1019
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:21,359
equality is neither given nor claimed it

1020
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:23,760
is practiced it is verified

1021
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,079
so as you understood having unconscious

1022
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:28,560
bias is not something you can change you

1023
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,400
need to constantly

1024
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,240
practice constantly

1025
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:34,079
measure it and make sure

1026
00:37:34,079 --> 00:37:36,000
that you remove it from the all the

1027
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:38,400
processes on your

1028
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:39,680
uh

1029
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:41,119
your team

1030
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:43,119
and i want to conclude with the ripple

1031
00:37:43,119 --> 00:37:45,359
effects that we got and the first one we

1032
00:37:45,359 --> 00:37:47,280
actually have happy engineers they love

1033
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,280
to come to job they enjoy it they grow

1034
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,720
on the job they stay longer they are

1035
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:52,400
more productive

1036
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:54,560
and everyone wins when you have happy

1037
00:37:54,560 --> 00:37:56,160
engineers

1038
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,160
another thing we have and i'm not sure

1039
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,240
how much you've seen it in the wild is

1040
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:02,560
happy senior engineers engineers because

1041
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:05,040
true senior engineers

1042
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:08,640
also enjoy teaching others and

1043
00:38:08,640 --> 00:38:10,880
making that the team progress and grow

1044
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,400
even more and when they have the chance

1045
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,599
to do this

1046
00:38:13,599 --> 00:38:15,280
they will be more happy and more

1047
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:17,280
productive and senior engineers

1048
00:38:17,280 --> 00:38:19,839
produce a lot when they are happy

1049
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:21,200
and lastly

1050
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,359
we have faster deliveries and when we

1051
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:24,320
measure

1052
00:38:24,320 --> 00:38:26,480
the results we're actually about two to

1053
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:30,240
three times faster than before

1054
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:31,440
so

1055
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:34,320
final awards we set up on journey to

1056
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:36,160
increase diversity and that was our

1057
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:39,040
vision and our strategy was to increase

1058
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:39,839
the

1059
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:42,320
quality and inclusion on our workplace

1060
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,079
and that created a better atmosphere for

1061
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:46,079
us which allowed us to increase the

1062
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,839
diversity and when you have a more

1063
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:50,640
diverse team workforce you can more

1064
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:51,839
easily

1065
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:53,040
create more equal and inclusive

1066
00:38:53,040 --> 00:38:54,560
environment that create better

1067
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:57,280
atmosphere and the circle contingencies

1068
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,119
so

1069
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:01,599
uh i will end with a quote that we

1070
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,839
started with from the general uh

1071
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,040
uh

1072
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,960
from the global general gag report

1073
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:09,040
it will take on average more than 100

1074
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:11,920
years for women to reach gender equality

1075
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:15,200
and we hope that now you have tools to

1076
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:17,200
make it even

1077
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,400
shorter

1078
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,280
because we can tolerate this

1079
00:39:21,280 --> 00:39:23,680
so i we want to thank
