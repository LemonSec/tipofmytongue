so

3
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:21,039

00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,240
founder of black hat and defcon jeff

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,240
moss

7
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,280
awesome

8
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,760
it's fantastic to see everybody here

9
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,200
it's been a

10
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,559
really stressful couple of years right

11
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,120
yeah so i've got um i've got a couple of

12
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,719
serious thoughts i want to talk to you

13
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:54,320
guys about and then and then we're going

14
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,120
to kick off our main main program

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,440
um first off thank you for being here

16
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,039
for this adventure

17
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,600
it's uh not exactly the way that we

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,000
would have hoped but it's what we've got

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,200
and i think

20
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,360
you're going to be really impressed and

21
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:11,360
have a really good time just

22
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,119
reconnecting with people seeing old

23
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:15,759
friends and learning something new

24
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:16,799
so

25
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,119
um so thank you for being here

26
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,320
i'm still

27
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,000
i haven't stood on the stage in like two

28
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,520
years i hadn't flown on an airplane

29
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:25,280
until a week ago

30
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:27,600
since like february year and a half ago

31
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,960
so it's all new to me it's pretty

32
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,360
exciting

33
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,079
so it has been a challenging

34
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,280
two years

35
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,040
and like everybody else i've had a lot

36
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,560
of time to think

37
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,479
and it's pretty clear

38
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:42,799
i'm not going to live forever

39
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:44,640
no one's going to live forever

40
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:45,759
and

41
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:47,040
and i think it's really important as a

42
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,560
community

43
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,560
that we think through how we want to

44
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:52,840
acknowledge those who have come before

45
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:55,840
us so for example we're all here but our

46
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,240
work is really based on on that of

47
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,640
others and we're really standing on the

48
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,719
shoulders of giants and our industry is

49
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,640
unique i mean it's new enough it's not

50
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,520
like

51
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,639
engineering where you go back thousands

52
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,000
of years

53
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,840
it's a pretty recent phenomenon we can

54
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:14,000
identify a lot of the people who are the

55
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,920
innovators who the giants are in our

56
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,360
industry so i think it's important we

57
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,879
acknowledge them

58
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,599
our work is sort of through their work

59
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,840
but i also think it's really important

60
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,280
that we acknowledge

61
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,080
those who have recently passed away

62
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,800
uh no longer here to continue with us

63
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,560
and so just if you could take a moment

64
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,239
join me in a moment of silence i just

65
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,280
want us to just think about our friends

66
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:40,000
and colleagues who are no longer here

67
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,239
and just you know conjure up a happy

68
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:43,519
thought about them

69
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:44,959
so if you please join me that would be

70
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:47,959
appreciated

71
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:57,680
thank you yeah i hope i hope their work

72
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,159
lives on through us and and through our

73
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,360
memories

74
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,680
and so in the last year we've lost two

75
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,560
really notable people who were formative

76
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,959
in the early days of black hat

77
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:11,360
philippe courteau from qualis and dan

78
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,640
kaminsky

79
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,840
and so i'm just going to say a couple of

80
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,519
words about them

81
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:16,800
and

82
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,440
you know dan first spoke at defcon

83
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,959
9

84
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:23,680
in 2001 20 years ago

85
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,519
and uh you can tell he hadn't mastered

86
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,319
the art of a title for his talk yet

87
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,879
it was a gateway cryptography hacking

88
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:32,720
impossible tunnels through improbable

89
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:35,040
networks with open ssh and the gnu

90
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,680
privacy guard

91
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,840
what a mouthful right

92
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:41,120
and then he went on to speak at his

93
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,879
first black hat 16 years ago in 2005 and

94
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,200
he was a regular fixture at many

95
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,000
conferences uh since

96
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,319
and felipe actually predates dan

97
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,480
philippe and qualis first started

98
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:56,480
supporting black hat

99
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,840
18 years ago in 2003 and it's it's

100
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,439
really strange for me to be on stage and

101
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,319
not

102
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:04,799
introduce felipe i have his bio like

103
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,360
programmed in my brain because every

104
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,519
single black hat essentially for the

105
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:11,840
last 15 years

106
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:14,799
i've been introducing philippe

107
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,120
that's how big of a supporter he was of

108
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,880
the community

109
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:20,399
so both have

110
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:22,160
left behind

111
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,639
something in their honor so

112
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,840
as an artist and technologist philippe

113
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,400
was a believer in arts power to inspire

114
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,720
and stimulate creativity

115
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,800
and so there is an eduarte corteau

116
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,639
foundation that is building an arts

117
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,759
pavilion

118
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,240
in samir the philippines

119
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,440
and they're going to mingle art

120
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,320
technology in a tinkering space

121
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,720
and promote creative problem solving

122
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:50,160
for children of low income

123
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,840
and so if you'd like more information

124
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,520
about philippe's

125
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,919
foundation visit the eduarte

126
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:57,680
foundation

127
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,199
and on the other end of the spectrum dan

128
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,720
kaminsky the company he co-founded human

129
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,080
has started a dan kaminsky

130
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:07,440
fellowship

131
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:08,639
and if you get selected for the

132
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,240
fellowship you essentially get a one

133
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,639
year full paid salary

134
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,160
to work on your project

135
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,520
the idea is they want to dedicate deep

136
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,000
work on an open source project and it's

137
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
going to be awarded to a human or humans

138
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,160
who epitomize the spirit of

139
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,560
internet innovation

140
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,080
recipients project will touch on a

141
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,400
problem that if solved

142
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,000
will improve people's lives for the

143
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,680
entire internet

144
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:37,600
it's a selfless open source project

145
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,280
aiming to help with the expectation with

146
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,000
no

147
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,080
expectation of a thank you

148
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,919
you just want to have the you have the

149
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,280
skills and the knowledge to answer the

150
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,280
call like dan did

151
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:48,400
and we know they're good hackers out

152
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,639
there doing things that protect all of

153
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:51,360
us

154
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,720
for free

155
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,160
and the fellowship is essentially a

156
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:55,759
thank you to them

157
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,360
so that's really cool

158
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,600
and i'm hoping that

159
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:02,080
as we're learning how this all works

160
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,600
maybe we'll start imitating that and

161
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,000
we'll start leaving some things behind

162
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,240
for those that come after us

163
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:10,319
so

164
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,160
those are my heavy thoughts and now

165
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,520
we're going to

166
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:16,318
get started

167
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,479
normally i go through a list of all the

168
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,479
countries that people are represented

169
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,759
uh here but since this is our first ever

170
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:26,160
hybrid event in the history of black hat

171
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:28,479
both in person and virtual i'm it's

172
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:29,919
going to be a little different

173
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:32,639
so i want to tell you the numbers of

174
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:36,479
people that are here and online 140

175
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:39,280
different countries represented

176
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,280
and there's 27 countries with only a

177
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,639
single representative and so i'm going

178
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,360
to zoom through those

179
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,759
the andorra

slovenia and zambia

191
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,759
so thank you you are the sole

192
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,280
representative from your country

193
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,479
and something we started in uh boy now

194
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,800
more than eight years ago we've started

195
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:35,280
scholarship programs and

196
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,639
this is sort of an acknowledgement the

197
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,280
black hat we're a pretty high-end event

198
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,039
and sometimes it's hard to get your foot

199
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:42,080
in the door

200
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,639
and so to ease the burden we've created

201
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,960
scholarships of different kinds

202
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:48,240
and you'll notice that we've added some

203
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:50,479
additional scholarships and the idea is

204
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:52,800
to get those who are just coming up a

205
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,879
chance to come in and network and to

206
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,879
participate at black hat

207
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:58,400
so the first one

208
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,000
program is the speaker scholarship

209
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,520
program

210
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,360
and this is if you're a speaker at black

211
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,720
hat you also get awarded two free passes

212
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,240
and it's up to you to decide how you

213
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,680
want to use those

214
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,360
so a lot of speakers give them the way

215
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,960
to the people they know people at the

216
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,240
university

217
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,879
and try to bring in fresh blood

218
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:19,520
so that's the first way we try to

219
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,440
get new people the second way is we have

220
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,840
an annual scholarship program

221
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,680
and this is where

222
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,919
students write white papers they

223
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:30,400
apply for the scholarship program

224
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,719
and if you pass

225
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:35,599
muster you're awarded admission

226
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,320
so for this year we have 149

227
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,640
students that were awarded this so if

228
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:42,320
any of you are in the in the audience

229
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:43,679
can you raise your hand give them a

230
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:46,000
round of applause for making it here

231
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,640
anybody here

232
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:52,839
yeah

233
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,760
so so they're excited just as excited to

234
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:57,360
be here as i am so

235
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,040
go say hello to them i'm sure they'd be

236
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,240
excited to learn uh meet new people

237
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,560
and in 2017 we started a military

238
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:06,480
veteran scholarship

239
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,440
to help those who are maybe

240
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,279
transitioning from service in the

241
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,600
private sector

242
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,120
and so this year

243
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:16,240
15 people were awarded scholarships for

244
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,600
military

245
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,440
veterans

246
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,200
the executive women's forum is a

247
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,959
community partner with black hat that's

248
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,640
hosting a session this year on the

249
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,640
importance of building communities

250
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,360
and they have 50 scholarships that

251
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,760
they've awarded and given out

252
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,640
to their community

253
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,399
the women in security and privacy are

254
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:37,440
wisp

255
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,120
is also a black hat community partner

256
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:40,560
and they're hosting a session called

257
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,519
recruiting diversity for infosec

258
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,680
and privacy teams

259
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,240
they're awarded 25 full scholarships and

260
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,360
they've given them out to their

261
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,959
community

262
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:53,120
and finally the women's society of cyber

263
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,720
jitsu

264
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:57,519
black hat community partner is hosting a

265
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:59,279
community meetup

266
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:00,880
and they have 25

267
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,399
scholarships

268
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:04,000
so we're really trying to think through

269
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,480
how we can involve other communities and

270
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,519
so a total of 274 uh complementary

271
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,680
passes were awarded which is i believe a

272
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:14,399
record for us this year so thank you all

273
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,160
for taking the time to apply and we hope

274
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:19,360
you get something out of it

275
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,600
now before i introduce the keynote i

276
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,839
have a a couple of thoughts my normal

277
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:24,959
comments

278
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:26,160
and

279
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,000
like a lot of you i'm sure

280
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,399
i've been thinking a lot about medical

281
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:32,800
analogies i've been thinking a lot about

282
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:36,640
community immunity or herd immunity and

283
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,480
like in 2014 i gave a talk at code blue

284
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,399
in tokyo

285
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,560
and i used a lot of medical analogies

286
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,160
and i was really thinking is there a

287
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:48,959
scenario where sort of the firewall

288
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,760
is sort of like a vaccine is there a way

289
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,240
to sort of confer an immunity on a

290
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,120
network if you

291
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,480
take care of your own equipment

292
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,279
and this medical analogy i like

293
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:05,200
because if you think about how doctors

294
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,040
approach problems nobody gets up in the

295
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,399
morning and says i'm going to cure

296
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:10,800
cancer today right you're not going to

297
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,480
wake up in the morning and cure memory

298
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,600
corruption

299
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,880
are off by one right

300
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,399
and so it's probably unhealthy for you

301
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,320
to tell yourself you're going to be the

302
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,399
person that cures cancer but it's

303
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,320
totally healthy for you to say i'm going

304
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,760
to be part of a team and we're going to

305
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,440
research cancer and we're going to

306
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:29,200
minimize the effects of cancer and we're

307
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,120
going to help people with cancer you

308
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,880
could probably have a very long career

309
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,360
and make changes in everybody's lives

310
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:36,720
with that kind of a

311
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,160
of an attitude

312
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,240
i think that's really healthy for us and

313
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,440
if you also think about some of the

314
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,720
other um medical analogies like first do

315
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,240
no harm

316
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:48,000
right there's there's ideas here that

317
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,399
work well in our world right first don't

318
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:52,720
harm users first don't give away their

319
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,040
privacy there's probably analogies that

320
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,760
we can work with

321
00:11:57,760 --> 00:11:58,880
so

322
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,560
i've kind of put together a little cheat

323
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:02,720
sheet here on on the way i'm thinking

324
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,399
about this and basically there's three

325
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:07,200
modes of immunity in the real world and

326
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,560
i've sort of applied that to the digital

327
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,360
first there's the mode where no one is

328
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,959
immunized

329
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:15,920
right

330
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,600
there's a disease rampant in the

331
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,600
community but nobody's immunized the

332
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,279
contagious disease spreads through the

333
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:22,800
population

334
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,800
nothing's there to prevent it

335
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:26,399
and in the network world it would be

336
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,000
sort of like

337
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,079
no systems are maintained nothing's

338
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,240
patched nothing's updated there's nobody

339
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,880
watching the logs so the malware spreads

340
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,360
unchecked through the network

341
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:39,519
in the second mode of immunity some of

342
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,680
the population is immunized the

343
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,480
contagious disease spreads through some

344
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,560
of the population

345
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:48,160
and some networks

346
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,800
and some systems are not maintained

347
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,720
so malware is sometimes noticed and

348
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:54,639
sometimes removed

349
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:55,839
and it spreads through some of the

350
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:58,000
population and this is basically where

351
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,680
we are now we're sort of in the second

352
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,120
mode

353
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,800
and the third mode is a lot more

354
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,639
optimistic this is most of the

355
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:06,959
population is immunized

356
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,399
spread of contagious disease is

357
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,079
contained right that's what we're

358
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:13,360
working towards 70 80 immunization

359
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,880
and in the in the digital world that

360
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,800
might be most networks and systems are

361
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,519
maintained malware is noticed most of

362
00:13:19,519 --> 00:13:22,000
the time and is removed most of the time

363
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,079
and actions are taken to protect other

364
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:27,360
systems besides your own system

365
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,600
in this third step you are concerned

366
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:31,600
about the networks around you not just

367
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,839
your own

368
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:35,680
stuff that's the difference you're

369
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,399
thinking about the others around you

370
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,240
and there is no fourth mode where all

371
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,920
systems are patched

372
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:44,000
there is no system where 100 of the

373
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,519
people are immunized that just doesn't

374
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:46,959
work

375
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,800
um it's just not realistic there's just

376
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,519
too many edge cases

377
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:53,680
so in the in the do nothing or not

378
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,120
immunize stage

379
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,000
um

380
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,560
you just it's the cheapest right there's

381
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,959
no cost to it

382
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:02,720
the smallest companies can do this

383
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,399
they're totally vulnerable

384
00:14:04,399 --> 00:14:06,480
but they it requires no additional skill

385
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,920
or training and it requires no

386
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,719
additional cost

387
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,720
in the middle option the partially

388
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:17,199
immunized option where we most most of

389
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:18,880
us live

390
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,160
you're protecting your systems and

391
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:23,760
applications but not those of others

392
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,440
so you secure your system by patching

393
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,399
and updating you select good software

394
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,199
you filter maybe spoofed inbound traffic

395
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,480
but you're not filtering outbound

396
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,079
traffic

397
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,240
right you're you're validating dns set

398
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:37,360
queries

399
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,760
but you're not signing your own zones so

400
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:41,440
nobody else can rely on your records

401
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,199
because you're not signing

402
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,199
your mail servers maybe you check spf

403
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,360
records but you don't publish your own

404
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,160
spf record or dkim record so you're

405
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,079
getting the benefits

406
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:53,920
but you're not providing any benefits to

407
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:55,279
anybody else

408
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:58,079
you're not helping them make decisions

409
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:00,000
about the quality of traffic or

410
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,199
services on your network

411
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,160
and this is lower cost than fully

412
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:07,519
immunized

413
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,399
you get sort of almost the full benefit

414
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,560
for yourself

415
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:13,839
um

416
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:15,600
but you're only really helping yourself

417
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,120
it's pretty selfish and if we know

418
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,240
anything that the internet's so

419
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,279
connected

420
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,839
that our problems are connected

421
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:23,920
and there is also higher configuration

422
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,600
and management overhead because you do

423
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,959
actually have to

424
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:29,839
validate spf records in dns sec and so

425
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:31,759
on and so forth

426
00:15:31,759 --> 00:15:34,160
and finally in this sort of end state

427
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:36,320
the fully immunized this is where you're

428
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,800
actually conferring sort of an immunity

429
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:41,759
to those around you

430
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,480
and it's the most beneficial to the all

431
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:46,240
the users of the internet

432
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,160
and it's the best security stance you

433
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,360
can take so

434
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:50,959
you probably have the least liability

435
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,880
too because you can show you're taking

436
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:54,800
these proactive steps

437
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,000
it's the most expensive to maintain

438
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,920
and you need better trained staff and so

439
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,360
when i think about this you'll see like

440
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,839
large cloud providers probably in this

441
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:05,600
third category because they can maintain

442
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,880
the staff um and so i just want you to

443
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,680
think about what are you doing to try to

444
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,040
confer an immunity to those around you

445
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,720
are you sort of part of the problem are

446
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,120
you a user you know you're just getting

447
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,480
the benefit of those around you or are

448
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,000
you contributing you know are you route

449
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,560
filtering your bgp routes

450
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,040
right you're doing things to help

451
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:30,560
uh those around us in the community

452
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:32,160
and so if you think about that from a

453
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,480
network standpoint now think about it

454
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,600
from a software supply chain standpoint

455
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,079
right we all rely on the software supply

456
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:43,120
chain we're building tools

457
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,279
and systems based on this we're trusting

458
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,720
it we're hoping that the people in the

459
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:49,360
supply chain are in that third state

460
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,120
they're doing things to help everybody

461
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,120
else in the supply chain because if they

462
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:54,399
don't

463
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:55,839
everything we do is potentially

464
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,360
vulnerable

465
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,199
right they are facing a lot of the same

466
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,199
problems

467
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,240
that you face in the network world

468
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,079
we all depend on the supply chain being

469
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:08,400
fully immune immunized and it's not

470
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:10,480
there yet

471
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,319
so i'm really looking forward to the

472
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:15,599
thoughts of our keynote speaker

473
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,760
matt tate who's going to talk about

474
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,679
supply chain and where we are now matt

475
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:21,839
tate is the chief operating officer of

476
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,039
corellium

477
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,359
but really he's kind of done everything

478
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:27,599
a little bit of everything so he was

479
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,679
previously the ceo of capital alpha

480
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,760
security in the uk

481
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:34,640
he worked at google project zero

482
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,240
he was the principal security consultant

483
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,400
for isec partners in ngs software

484
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,160
he also worked as an information

485
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:45,440
security specialist at gchq

486
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,360
so matt is going to talk about where we

487
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,440
are in supply chain integrity what are

488
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,280
the key risks the core dilemmas

489
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,840
and why they aren't fixed yet

490
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:57,440
can we get to a place where we can have

491
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,440
confidence on our software

492
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,799
that it doesn't come bundled with

493
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,200
unpleasant surprises so

494
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,400
it's my uh honor to introduce matt

495
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:08,240
and i'll talk to you later after his

496
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,640
session we're going to do a live q a so

497
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:11,919
thank you very much

498
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:15,200
take it away matt

499
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:17,840
welcome to blackhat 2021

500
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:20,000
uh my name is matt tate i'm the chief

501
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,160
operating officer at curium and it's my

502
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:24,240
honor and pleasure to be delivering this

503
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,960
year's keynote at this conference

504
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,960
i wanted to talk today about the topic

505
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:31,039
of supply chain infections and the

506
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,400
future of contactless deliveries

507
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,480
but first who am i

508
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:38,480
well most people know me from twitter as

509
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,960
pawn all the things from my various

510
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,000
tweets but i have done real work as well

511
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,799
uh i started my career at gchq that's

512
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,840
the british version of nsa in offensive

513
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:52,160
cyber security doing exploit development

514
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,919
and then i moved into the private sector

515
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:57,520
doing defensive platform security at ncc

516
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:59,679
group and isec partners as well as at

517
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:02,000
google project zero more recently i've

518
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:04,080
done teaching in formal classroom

519
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,840
settings at the straus center for

520
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:07,679
international security of law at the

521
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,919
university of texas at austin and have

522
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,559
done mobile and iot security research at

523
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:15,039
azeria labs my current role takes me

524
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,760
into platform virtualization at curium

525
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:19,520
where i'm honored to be their chief

526
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,760
operating officer

527
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,000
i wanted to start today's talk with two

528
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,679
motivating graphs

529
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,760
we all know that you know the past year

530
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,360
has been pretty

531
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:31,440
difficult in a lot of physical world

532
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,840
senses but we also think you know if we

533
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,160
look around the cyber security industry

534
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,640
it feels like the world is getting more

535
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,520
chaotic that uh more intrusions are

536
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:43,039
happening so i wanted to start with

537
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,840
these two graphs this first one is from

538
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,760
crowdstrike in their global threat

539
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:49,039
report

540
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,799
the number of intrusions as you can see

541
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:54,640
here has really skyrocketed this year

542
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:56,720
here's a second graph this is from

543
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,480
google project zero this is the number

544
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,720
of zero-day vulnerabilities that have

545
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,679
been detected exploited in the wild

546
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:04,640
now

547
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:06,880
the important thing here is that the

548
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,960
final bar although it's already

549
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:10,720
dramatically higher than all of the

550
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:11,760
other bars

551
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,120
is actually only the months up until now

552
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:18,320
if we extrapolate that out into the end

553
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:21,200
of the year that bar looks dramatically

554
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:23,520
dramatically higher the number of zero

555
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,760
days being exploited in the wild is

556
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:28,799
completely off the charts

557
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,320
why

558
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,440
well offense seems to be taking the

559
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:35,760
gloves off and this is both in the

560
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,520
government sector you know doing

561
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,080
espionage and in the financially

562
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,600
motivated crimeware industry ransomware

563
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,600
and it's getting to the point now where

564
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,320
it's beginning to overwhelm our our

565
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:51,520
ability to respond in the defensive

566
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,360
sector

567
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,679
why what's changed what changed in the

568
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,679
past year

569
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:58,960
well

570
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,640
i think to answer this question we need

571
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:02,400
to step back first of all

572
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,880
have a look at the threats these threats

573
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,360
have not really changed in a long time

574
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,440
governments are still around what they

575
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:11,200
want is they want to gain access to

576
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:13,440
secret data but they're not doing this

577
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:15,440
just for any old reason they want to

578
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,840
take that secret data and read it and

579
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:19,840
process it and turn it into actionable

580
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:21,440
intelligence

581
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,840
ransomware groups as well they're not

582
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:26,000
after your data for no reason what they

583
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
want is they want to be able to gain

584
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:30,320
access to your data in order to be able

585
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:32,480
to monetize it to turn it into local

586
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,280
currency that they can use to buy stuff

587
00:21:35,280 --> 00:21:36,799
locally

588
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,120
both of these actors are very interested

589
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:41,440
in being able to do this at the maximum

590
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,960
scale that they can

591
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:46,400
but at the minimum cost

592
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,200
these costs are real

593
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:52,480
right attackers have real bills to pay

594
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,880
and real risks to look at

595
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,080
this in the traditional model means they

596
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:00,080
need to think about what happens in

597
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,400
order to gain access to that data that

598
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,760
means that they need to do things like

599
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,840
target selection that you know is a bit

600
00:22:05,840 --> 00:22:08,159
of work they need to find some suitable

601
00:22:08,159 --> 00:22:10,880
attack surface in order to work out how

602
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,080
to get in they need to use some

603
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,640
mechanism in order to be able to gain an

604
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,799
initial foothold using that attack

605
00:22:18,799 --> 00:22:21,120
surface and once they're in they're

606
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:23,039
probably not close to the data that they

607
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:25,280
need so they might need to use privilege

608
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:27,919
escalation tools and techniques

609
00:22:27,919 --> 00:22:30,400
and perhaps lateral movement mechanisms

610
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,559
in order to be able to get to the data

611
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,559
that they actually want all of this is

612
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,159
cost to them

613
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,240
once they've done this they've got

614
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,400
access to the data they're still not

615
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,600
done right for the ransomware

616
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,600
industry they then need to notify the

617
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,840
victim they need to negotiate payments

618
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:49,679
they need to do the money laundering

619
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,080
this is all cost to them as well

620
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,640
and in the espionage sector they need to

621
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,600
exfiltrate this data across their uh

622
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,000
operational networks they need to uh

623
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,840
process it they need to do analytics

624
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:03,760
they need to provide actionable

625
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,919
intelligence and if this intelligence is

626
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:07,120
to do anything useful for that

627
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,440
government they also need to act on it

628
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:12,320
this is all cost

629
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:15,120
weirdly mass exploitation

630
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:16,480
with zero day

631
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:17,200
is

632
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:18,720
pretty rare

633
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,960
and i want to go into why that's the

634
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:22,400
case

635
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:24,960
first of all zero-day vulnerabilities

636
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:29,200
have become much harder against hardened

637
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,919
platform security systems platform

638
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:34,480
security has made it necessary that if

639
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,400
you want to attack a system and gain

640
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,400
entry you're probably not just going to

641
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,240
need to have one vulnerability in that

642
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:42,320
system but a chain of vulnerabilities

643
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,159
you're going to need to build a full

644
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:46,559
zero day chain what some people call a

645
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:47,600
full chain

646
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:49,360
and these things are very expensive

647
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:53,360
thanks to platform security investments

648
00:23:53,440 --> 00:23:54,880
every time

649
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,799
an actor that has one of these zero day

650
00:23:56,799 --> 00:23:57,760
chains

651
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,679
wants to use it

652
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:02,640
on an observable platform this runs a

653
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,120
risk for that threat actor the

654
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,159
possibility that that zero day chain or

655
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:09,919
some aspect of that intrusion gets

656
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:11,279
detected

657
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:12,880
and in the event that that does get

658
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,120
detected this can be a very expensive

659
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:17,279
cost for the attacker

660
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,080
often various parts of the zero day

661
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,840
chain are going to get compromised all

662
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,840
at once and these need to be replaced

663
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,120
they're not cheap

664
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:27,440
they're difficult to build their

665
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,240
supply of these in the marketplace is

666
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,799
relatively limited this is cost

667
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:35,120
and for governments that you know care

668
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,200
about operational security they might

669
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,440
also need to now do retooling they might

670
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:41,679
need to replace burned infrastructure

671
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,080
and you know they might need to

672
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,080
deal with potential embarrassments this

673
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,679
is all cost to them and this cost

674
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:51,520
means that they're thinking at the point

675
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:53,440
where they're targeting

676
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,919
is it worth the trade-off

677
00:24:55,919 --> 00:24:57,840
this means that for government

678
00:24:57,840 --> 00:24:59,360
even when they have the tools and

679
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,679
techniques to exploit very widely they

680
00:25:01,679 --> 00:25:03,760
often don't want to there's strong

681
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,320
incentives for them to limit the number

682
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,799
of attacks that they're actually doing

683
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,720
to only the targets that really matter

684
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,400
for them

685
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,480
in the ransomware context

686
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:16,159
things are a little bit different

687
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,039
ransomware is definitionally noisy

688
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,039
and a consequence of this is that they

689
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:23,120
basically don't use zero-day chains

690
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,640
because using zero-day chains and

691
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,559
getting burned is just going to be way

692
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,159
too expensive for the value that they

693
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,320
can extract from most of their victims

694
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:31,760
the economics just don't work out for

695
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:32,720
them

696
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,440
so instead ransomware

697
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:38,559
operators tend to rely on quote-unquote

698
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:40,400
sustainable techniques techniques that

699
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:43,120
are going to survive from era to era

700
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,559
things like phishing things like

701
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:47,919
credential stuffing things like sending

702
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:50,799
macro laden office documents

703
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,640
these types of techniques

704
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,360
don't scale particularly well if they're

705
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,760
not targeted and in the event they are

706
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:00,000
targeted things like spearfishing well

707
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,480
then you know this is additional linear

708
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,440
cost for every single attack that the

709
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:08,400
attacker is doing a consequence of this

710
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,279
is that ransomware operators very rarely

711
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:14,559
manage to achieve this kind of scale in

712
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:16,799
their operations that would be necessary

713
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,880
to you know compromise large numbers of

714
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:21,520
industries or multiple sectors entirely

715
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:22,960
at once

716
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:24,799
in other words ransomware operators

717
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:27,440
generally do want to exploit very widely

718
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:30,880
but they're just not able to

719
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:33,440
i wanted to have a look at some of the

720
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:35,840
big stories of the year and see if we

721
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,960
can find any sort of commonalities some

722
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,520
of the stories that have become so big

723
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:42,960
that they've sort of breached through

724
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,640
into the mainstream

725
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,240
the first one of course is the colonial

726
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,080
pipeline hack everybody knows this this

727
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:48,960
caused

728
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,919
gas shortages in large parts of america

729
00:26:51,919 --> 00:26:54,000
the cassaya hack just a couple of weeks

730
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:56,080
ago this was a uh

731
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,279
led to

732
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,080
very serious physical world shortages uh

733
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,559
caused supermarkets and so on to close

734
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,559
the nobelium exchange incidents at the

735
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:06,320
beginning of this year widely attributed

736
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:10,080
to uh actors working outside of china

737
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:11,279
uh

738
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,520
the solarwinds breach everybody knows

739
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:15,520
the solarwinds breach from early last

740
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,679
year which ended up with nine federal

741
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,679
agencies and over a hundred private

742
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:22,159
sector firms compromised

743
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:24,880
very recently the nso pegasus project

744
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:27,760
and the uh list of targets which we

745
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,440
don't exactly know where this list came

746
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:32,320
from but claiming 50 000 targets across

747
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,720
a wide range of mobile devices

748
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:37,039
north korea targeting researchers the

749
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:39,919
code curve compromise and also last year

750
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:40,720
the

751
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:43,520
ios hacks targeting uyghurs in china in

752
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,240
the insomnia breach

753
00:27:46,240 --> 00:27:49,279
these all at first glance appear to be

754
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:51,120
very different

755
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:54,080
but i wanted to draw to you a couple of

756
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,320
commonalities

757
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:59,360
and a few observations here

758
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,960
the

759
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,919
intrusions that cause the really big

760
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,880
physical real world challenges or

761
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,960
overwhelmingly ransomware-based attacks

762
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,279
these are the ones which really seem to

763
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:12,159
cause

764
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:16,159
massive problems in the physical world

765
00:28:16,159 --> 00:28:18,320
another observation is that a lot of

766
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,799
these seem to be driven

767
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,279
by supply chain compromises and these

768
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:25,120
ones which are driven by supply kit and

769
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,640
chain compromises

770
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:27,760
do have

771
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,840
very high volume and usually

772
00:28:29,840 --> 00:28:32,320
indiscriminate targeting associated with

773
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,240
them these things are happening at a

774
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,720
much bigger scale when there's supply

775
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,480
chain that's enabled

776
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,399
and the third thing that i wanted to

777
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:41,840
draw attention to

778
00:28:41,840 --> 00:28:44,080
is the use of stolen zero day several of

779
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:46,080
these stories are fundamentally about

780
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,240
stolen zero day

781
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,679
things like the

782
00:28:49,679 --> 00:28:50,640
uh

783
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,240
north korean targeting of security

784
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,320
researchers why were they doing that

785
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:55,679
they were doing it in order to gain

786
00:28:55,679 --> 00:28:58,399
access to this security research and in

787
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:01,200
both the cassette hack and the exchange

788
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:03,840
hacks there's credible evidence that

789
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,440
security researchers had found these

790
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:06,880
vulnerabilities these exact

791
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,720
vulnerabilities and written exploits for

792
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:09,679
them

793
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:12,000
and at some point between that and the

794
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,520
patch being released or shortly

795
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,880
afterwards

796
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,000
somehow

797
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,399
these proofs of concepts these working

798
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:21,440
exploits managed to get into the hands

799
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:24,080
of these offensive actors who used them

800
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:28,559
enabling some of these massive attacks

801
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:29,520
and

802
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,360
so i think there's sort of three driving

803
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,840
stories really behind a lot of what's

804
00:29:35,840 --> 00:29:37,679
happened in the past year the first of

805
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:39,279
course is that stolen zero day is a

806
00:29:39,279 --> 00:29:41,440
component of several of these high

807
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,919
profile stories the second is that

808
00:29:43,919 --> 00:29:45,360
there's a huge

809
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:47,840
increase in the number of zero days

810
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,240
being detected exploited in the wild but

811
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,600
particularly

812
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,760
against mobile devices

813
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,640
and the third is that supply chains are

814
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:58,480
responsible for several of the really

815
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,000
major breaches and i want to come to

816
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:03,840
this one in particular in a moment

817
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,080
of these three the first one is perhaps

818
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,559
the easiest one to talk about it's not

819
00:30:08,559 --> 00:30:10,960
supply chains but i think it deserves a

820
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:12,799
brief mention

821
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,320
if you're a security researcher and

822
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,240
you're building or finding zero days in

823
00:30:16,240 --> 00:30:17,360
the wild

824
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,600
and these zero days are high impact

825
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:23,039
platform security or remote rc's you are

826
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,480
a target

827
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,159
governments are interested in taking

828
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:27,520
your zero days

829
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:29,600
and you need to secure your systems and

830
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,080
your vendor communications properly

831
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,000
in the event that you have these do be

832
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,000
careful what you publish point-and-click

833
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,480
zero-day can hurt others of course it's

834
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:40,159
your exploit do what you want with it

835
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,120
but be aware that there are trade-offs

836
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:44,960
associated with this

837
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,679
the reason this is important is because

838
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:49,279
in the event that governments can gain

839
00:30:49,279 --> 00:30:52,880
access to free zero day this changes

840
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:55,679
their economic assessment of using it

841
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,360
in the event that they have access to

842
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:59,919
this for free it costs nothing to lose

843
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:00,559
it

844
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:03,360
so the incentives to not throw it widely

845
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,080
are very different in this scenario the

846
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,399
opportunity and the incentive for them

847
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:12,480
to mass exploit is much harder higher

848
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,799
from the perspective of vendors dealing

849
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:17,200
with this problem is also important the

850
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,960
faster you make your updates your

851
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:21,279
automatic update systems and the lower

852
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:23,519
the friction you can add to this the

853
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,919
faster these zero-day chains once

854
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:29,039
discovered in the wild lose their value

855
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:32,480
the steeper that curve is the higher

856
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:35,840
the risk is for adversaries to make use

857
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:36,720
of it

858
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:40,240
and a consequence of that is that as the

859
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:42,640
threat actors see this as higher costs

860
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,440
as they see it as being a higher risk

861
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,440
they're going to use these zero days in

862
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,720
the wild

863
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,039
less often and that leads ultimately to

864
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,120
safer customers

865
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:55,519
this final point is perhaps a little bit

866
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,519
less obvious

867
00:31:57,519 --> 00:31:59,760
several companies in the past few years

868
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:01,760
have started bug bounty programs where

869
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:03,760
they will encourage security vendors

870
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,399
security researchers to provide

871
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:09,360
bugs vulnerabilities and in some cases

872
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:12,000
working exploits or even full exploit

873
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,760
chains to the vendor

874
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:15,919
in exchange for different quantities of

875
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,279
payments

876
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:18,799
but it's

877
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:21,200
in the event that you require security

878
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,480
researchers

879
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,279
to provide full chains or fully working

880
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,760
exploits instead of just vulnerabilities

881
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,679
or you pay them more for these fully

882
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,200
working chains

883
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,120
and you incentivize you create this

884
00:32:33,120 --> 00:32:34,559
perverse incentive for security

885
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:37,440
researchers not to publish or not to

886
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:40,000
report their vulnerabilities early

887
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,640
you're creating some weird incentives

888
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:44,399
that maybe we should have to think about

889
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:47,120
and i think here is a good exchange

890
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:48,640
between a security researcher and

891
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:51,440
someone from google project zero

892
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,480
about

893
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,399
uh security vulnerability that was

894
00:32:54,399 --> 00:32:56,799
discovered in the wild being exploited

895
00:32:56,799 --> 00:33:00,399
in ios 14.7.1 or the the latest version

896
00:33:00,399 --> 00:33:02,799
of ios at the moment

897
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:04,320
this vulnerability was being exploited

898
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:05,600
in the wild and there was a security

899
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:08,320
researcher out there who operates in

900
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,720
good faith with apple and reports their

901
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:12,720
security vulnerabilities

902
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,399
why did the security researcher not

903
00:33:14,399 --> 00:33:16,000
report this security vulnerability to

904
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:17,440
apple early

905
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:19,840
well because they were waiting they

906
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:21,600
wanted to do additional work on their

907
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:23,440
security vulnerability to turn it into

908
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,360
fully working exploit because the fully

909
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:26,799
working exploit would get a higher

910
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:29,760
bounty this is an incentives failure at

911
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,000
the vendor

912
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,159
allowing submission

913
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:34,960
of

914
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,679
exploit components in parts

915
00:33:37,679 --> 00:33:40,399
reduces the overall risk both to you as

916
00:33:40,399 --> 00:33:42,080
a vendor because it means that you get

917
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:43,840
vulnerabilities reported to you earlier

918
00:33:43,840 --> 00:33:45,039
in the cycle

919
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,960
it also means that the security

920
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:49,919
researcher doesn't have fully working

921
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,159
zero day chains on their laptop that can

922
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:53,679
get stolen

923
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:56,080
building this system allowing the

924
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:57,679
submission in parts

925
00:33:57,679 --> 00:34:01,200
increases overall security

926
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:03,279
the second big theme

927
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:06,480
from this year is that on mobile devices

928
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,960
there's been some really high volume

929
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,560
exploitation

930
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,040
the amount of in the wild zero day

931
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:15,520
exploitation against mobile phone

932
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,719
devices is up dramatically

933
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,280
but here's a weird observation

934
00:34:21,280 --> 00:34:23,440
the reason that we know these are being

935
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:25,760
exploited in the wild is overwhelmingly

936
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:28,560
not from on-device telemetry

937
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,520
this is

938
00:34:29,520 --> 00:34:31,119
an important observation because it

939
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,119
means that if we're not getting this

940
00:34:33,119 --> 00:34:35,599
from the devices we're only really

941
00:34:35,599 --> 00:34:38,560
getting a tiny glimpse of what actually

942
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,399
might be happening out there in the

943
00:34:40,399 --> 00:34:42,560
world a lot of these zero days that are

944
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,480
being discovered are being left

945
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,639
untargeted by governments on watering

946
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:48,639
whole sites you know maybe they're being

947
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:50,399
discovered by threat intelligence

948
00:34:50,399 --> 00:34:53,280
collaborations and the nso list is a

949
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:54,879
great example we don't know where this

950
00:34:54,879 --> 00:34:57,200
nso list came from we do know that it

951
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:59,040
didn't come from apple and we do know

952
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,119
that it didn't come from phones

953
00:35:01,119 --> 00:35:03,280
so we know that there's some enormous

954
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,200
amount of exploitation happening in the

955
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,920
mobile space and we have no visibility

956
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,400
into it this is a real problem and it

957
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,880
needs to change

958
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,480
but finally

959
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:17,200
supply chain intrusions are completely

960
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,599
upending the entire traditional

961
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:22,160
mechanics

962
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:23,760
from the attacker's perspective supply

963
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:25,359
chain intrusions are relatively

964
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:27,599
straightforward instead of targeting the

965
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:29,920
system that you actually want to target

966
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:32,800
you target a system that's upstream from

967
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:35,280
that system

968
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:37,440
untargeted supply chain intrusions are

969
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,280
the ones that cause massive disruption

970
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:42,640
there are targeted supply chain

971
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,640
intrusions as well things like single

972
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,640
government contractors things like

973
00:35:46,640 --> 00:35:49,119
target specific interdiction and things

974
00:35:49,119 --> 00:35:51,280
like special purpose software and

975
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:53,920
platforms like isis communication apps

976
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,599
in the event that these get compromised

977
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:57,119
this is not going to compromise

978
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:59,040
everybody in the world but it's the

979
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,760
untargeted ones that are really changing

980
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,839
the dynamic this is where we're talking

981
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,160
about things like multi-customer

982
00:36:06,160 --> 00:36:08,480
contractors things like managed service

983
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,119
providers things like general purpose

984
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:12,480
software and platforms like the

985
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:15,760
solarwinds software or things like medoc

986
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,839
the ukrainian accountancy software that

987
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:20,480
was compromised and was eventually led

988
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:23,839
to the not patio attacks in 2017 as well

989
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:24,800
as

990
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:28,079
attacking and compromising library code

991
00:36:28,079 --> 00:36:31,839
in developer systems as well

992
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,760
supply chain intrusions

993
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:36,320
are unusually enormous

994
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,160
let's have a look at an example for

995
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,720
espionage the solarwinds case just this

996
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:43,200
year was enormous

997
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,960
but was it as enormous as it could have

998
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:46,079
been

999
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,599
solarwinds has 300 000 customers

1000
00:36:49,599 --> 00:36:52,240
33 000 of them are using the orion

1001
00:36:52,240 --> 00:36:53,680
platform

1002
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:55,680
eighteen thousand of those were infected

1003
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,839
with the first stage the pre-positioning

1004
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,680
stage

1005
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,079
the second stage the people that were

1006
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,040
actually ultimately compromised in order

1007
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,040
to extract all of this information the

1008
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:09,200
people the you know the organizations

1009
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,200
that the attacker was ultimately

1010
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,880
actually interested in

1011
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,599
was about nine federal agencies

1012
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:17,280
and about a hundred private sector

1013
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,800
organizations

1014
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:20,160
i want to draw attention to some of

1015
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,520
these private sector organizations

1016
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,119
because some of them are themselves

1017
00:37:23,119 --> 00:37:25,200
software suppliers

1018
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,680
so there's you know potentially in some

1019
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:29,680
of the supply chain attacks also a

1020
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,400
waterfall effect that perhaps one supply

1021
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:33,920
chain attack can get you onto a

1022
00:37:33,920 --> 00:37:35,839
different supplier that you can then use

1023
00:37:35,839 --> 00:37:37,680
to do a supply chain attack

1024
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,720
even further on

1025
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,000
in the ransomware case

1026
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,960
corsair is a good working example this

1027
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:49,119
was a huge ransomware incident it had

1028
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:51,920
enormous physical world impacts

1029
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:54,079
but it was weirdly small when you think

1030
00:37:54,079 --> 00:37:56,400
about how big cassaya actually is

1031
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,320
cassaya has about eight hundred thousand

1032
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:00,560
to a million small businesses using

1033
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:02,240
their software

1034
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,560
and about hundred to one and a half

1035
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:07,359
thousand were infected

1036
00:38:07,359 --> 00:38:10,160
that's about point one percent of

1037
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,520
corsair's

1038
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,760
actual customers ended up getting this

1039
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,000
ransomware and think about how big the

1040
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,240
incident was how disruptive it was in

1041
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,599
the physical world

1042
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:21,920
and then think about how small the

1043
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,040
actual intrusion was this is a not

1044
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,599
household name company and a tiny

1045
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:29,599
fraction of its customer base causing

1046
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:33,440
that level of real world impact

1047
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,079
and finally destructive malware the not

1048
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,960
patio example in 2017 is the canonical

1049
00:38:38,960 --> 00:38:41,280
example of the most destructive cyber

1050
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,520
attack in the world ever this was

1051
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,520
achieved by performing a supply chain

1052
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,839
intrusion against medoc the ukrainian

1053
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:50,240
accountancy software firm and this ended

1054
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,160
up distributing destructive malware to

1055
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,240
virtually all of their customers eighty

1056
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:56,800
percent of this uh ended up in ukraine

1057
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:59,359
but some of the estimates put this at a

1058
00:38:59,359 --> 00:39:02,480
global damage to u.s firms to global

1059
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:05,200
firms at 10 billion

1060
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:06,240
the

1061
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,640
impact of these attacks

1062
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:10,960
is really huge

1063
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,040
mobile attacks mobile apps are also not

1064
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,280
immune from supply chain operations uh

1065
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:19,200
we saw this year one 1 200 ios apps with

1066
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,079
over a billion total installs we're

1067
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:24,800
using a chinese sdk and this chinese sdk

1068
00:39:24,800 --> 00:39:27,440
was compromised as a supply chain attack

1069
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:32,480
the level of disruption here is enormous

1070
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,560
supply chain intrusions

1071
00:39:34,560 --> 00:39:37,119
are not like other intrusions we might

1072
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:39,599
like to think of them as just unusually

1073
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:41,599
big intrusions but they're not they're

1074
00:39:41,599 --> 00:39:43,760
different they're a different category

1075
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:46,079
and they work in different ways

1076
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,240
unlike normal intrusions

1077
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,839
where bigness is not the default in

1078
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:54,880
supply chain intrusions they are huge by

1079
00:39:54,880 --> 00:39:57,680
default the solarwinds hackers had to

1080
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:00,560
actively engineer their system to use a

1081
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:02,880
multi-stage process

1082
00:40:02,880 --> 00:40:04,240
why

1083
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,560
because the initial infection was going

1084
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:09,839
to compromise 18 000 targets and they

1085
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:12,880
needed to down sample the intrusion down

1086
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,560
to a hundred or so

1087
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:17,760
workable operations for them

1088
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,440
the scale here

1089
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,400
just dwarfs everything else in cyber

1090
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:24,720
security and these are with small

1091
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:29,279
vendors and fractions of their customers

1092
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:31,040
in supply chains there's no natural

1093
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,599
breaks or disincentives

1094
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:34,400
to

1095
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:38,319
ultra wide scale mass exploitation

1096
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:40,480
target selection here is easy it's all

1097
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,079
of the customers i don't need to

1098
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:44,640
discriminate internally

1099
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:46,640
looking for the attack surface

1100
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:47,920
this is easy

1101
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:49,760
the update system will just

1102
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:52,560
automatically route my implant my

1103
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:54,880
malware directly past all of the cyber

1104
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,200
security defenses that the organization

1105
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:58,880
might have

1106
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,400
escalation

1107
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:02,480
this is also simple the updater is

1108
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:05,040
running a system it's running with some

1109
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,280
of the highest permissions that these

1110
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:09,599
infrastructures provide and lateral

1111
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:11,760
movement is also not a problem because

1112
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,680
these agents are probably running on all

1113
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:15,599
of your client systems and if they're

1114
00:41:15,599 --> 00:41:16,800
not they're probably running in the

1115
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,040
heart of your network anyway all of this

1116
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:21,040
happens for free in supply chain

1117
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,680
intrusions in normal intrusions all of

1118
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:27,599
this is complexity and individual cost

1119
00:41:27,599 --> 00:41:30,240
in supply chain intrusions is just a

1120
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:34,000
one-time cost

1121
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:36,160
how do we fix it

1122
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:39,759
this is a much harder question

1123
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,760
i think the first thing to point out is

1124
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,920
the government is not going to fix this

1125
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,920
this isn't going to get fixed by a

1126
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,359
collection of international

1127
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,200
organizations it's not going to be fixed

1128
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:51,040
by the us government it's not going to

1129
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,119
be fixed by federal agencies it's not

1130
00:41:53,119 --> 00:41:55,680
going to be fixed by a consortium of

1131
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:58,160
governments the only way to tackle

1132
00:41:58,160 --> 00:42:00,640
supply chain intrusions at the scale

1133
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:03,280
that's needed is to fix the underlying

1134
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:06,240
technology and this requires platform

1135
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:09,520
vendors to step in

1136
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,280
unfortunately

1137
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:13,839
there's lots of easy sounding answers in

1138
00:42:13,839 --> 00:42:16,079
this space but all of them suck things

1139
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:17,680
like you know maybe we could just turn

1140
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:19,680
off updates but if you turn off updates

1141
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:21,760
and everyone's insecure you know maybe

1142
00:42:21,760 --> 00:42:23,760
we could man manage service providers

1143
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,319
but that's also unworkable all of the

1144
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:28,800
easy answers are bad

1145
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,800
and the harder answers

1146
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,359
are really difficult they bring you into

1147
00:42:33,359 --> 00:42:36,079
necessary conflict with some very very

1148
00:42:36,079 --> 00:42:38,319
entrenched substantial business

1149
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:40,480
interests

1150
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:41,839
ultimately the question that we're

1151
00:42:41,839 --> 00:42:44,079
asking in supply chain security is can

1152
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:46,319
we automate trust

1153
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:47,920
and it's tempting to go for the

1154
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:50,000
nihilistic answer of no

1155
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:54,800
but the real answer is well sometimes

1156
00:42:55,760 --> 00:42:57,680
so i wanted to talk about some real

1157
00:42:57,680 --> 00:42:59,440
world successes that we've had in this

1158
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,839
space because different platforms have

1159
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:04,480
taken different approaches and some of

1160
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:06,079
these approaches

1161
00:43:06,079 --> 00:43:07,280
might help

1162
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,280
some of the other platforms to succeed

1163
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:14,480
one of these is mobile entitlements

1164
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,160
in the mobile space

1165
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:18,720
your app does not have

1166
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:21,200
any components running as root or

1167
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:23,440
running a system there's no

1168
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,920
system permissioned custom installer

1169
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:27,760
there's no system permissioned

1170
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,760
background updater

1171
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,000
in the event that supply chains

1172
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:34,480
do compromise your app it's only going

1173
00:43:34,480 --> 00:43:36,800
to compromise the app it's not going to

1174
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:40,480
compromise the entire phone

1175
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:42,480
supply chain attacks do happen against

1176
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,119
mobile apps but entitlements limit a lot

1177
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:47,200
of these damages

1178
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:48,800
and finally i want to point out that

1179
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:50,960
entitlements can have weird and bespoke

1180
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:54,720
preconditions the covid entitlement the

1181
00:43:54,720 --> 00:43:56,800
covid exposure entitlement for example

1182
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:58,000
in ios

1183
00:43:58,000 --> 00:43:59,760
is an entitlement that allows you to

1184
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,599
access the ios kovids test and trace

1185
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:06,160
bluetooth system that they've created

1186
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,960
but not any app can just ask for this if

1187
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:11,359
you want to have this permission there

1188
00:44:11,359 --> 00:44:13,599
are additional requirements that there's

1189
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:15,200
some other entitlements you can't have

1190
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:16,960
at the same time and maybe you need to

1191
00:44:16,960 --> 00:44:18,800
be a healthcare provider or there's

1192
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:20,960
other bespoke requirements attached to

1193
00:44:20,960 --> 00:44:23,200
certain entitlements these entitlements

1194
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:27,200
don't need to be available to everybody

1195
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,280
in the windows system we do have an

1196
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:31,440
entitlement system but nobody uses it it

1197
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:34,640
comes from the winrt space and

1198
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:37,520
essentially none of the important apps

1199
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:40,960
in windows use it

1200
00:44:41,200 --> 00:44:44,640
in order to fix the windows landscape we

1201
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,040
need to de-privilege applications at the

1202
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:48,960
moment windows basically has two

1203
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,520
different categories of privilege it has

1204
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,599
the yes privilege which is everything is

1205
00:44:53,599 --> 00:44:55,839
running a system and it has the maybe

1206
00:44:55,839 --> 00:44:57,200
yes privilege which is everything

1207
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,440
running at medium integrity

1208
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:02,400
we need to break these privileges apart

1209
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,040
into a workable entitlement system that

1210
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,520
developers actually use

1211
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:10,000
because an entitlement system gives the

1212
00:45:10,000 --> 00:45:12,880
machine a machine readable understanding

1213
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:15,520
of what the app should be allowed to do

1214
00:45:15,520 --> 00:45:16,880
and that means that in the event that

1215
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:19,680
that app becomes compromised the ability

1216
00:45:19,680 --> 00:45:22,079
of malware inside that app to do things

1217
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:24,560
outside of the scope of the application

1218
00:45:24,560 --> 00:45:28,240
becomes dramatically reduced

1219
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,319
certificate transparency is another

1220
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:33,920
weird example where we've looked at

1221
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,680
some intractable trust problems

1222
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:39,839
in the early 2000s certificate

1223
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:42,400
authorities for https sites

1224
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:44,319
were a constant

1225
00:45:44,319 --> 00:45:46,160
concern

1226
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,480
what happens when they go wrong

1227
00:45:48,480 --> 00:45:50,800
bad things might happen

1228
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:51,920
and they did

1229
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,720
and bad things happened

1230
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,880
the solution to this quote-unquote

1231
00:45:56,880 --> 00:45:59,040
solution to this was a technology called

1232
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:01,839
certificate transparency essentially all

1233
00:46:01,839 --> 00:46:04,480
https certificates that are minted by

1234
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:06,400
https certificate authorities and this

1235
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:09,280
was rolled out over time all https

1236
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,200
certificates are now provided in a

1237
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:14,079
public ledger and this means that threat

1238
00:46:14,079 --> 00:46:16,240
intelligence firms or organizations or

1239
00:46:16,240 --> 00:46:18,079
any member of the public can scan this

1240
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,240
list and see whether or not any of the

1241
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:22,880
big certificate authorities is creating

1242
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,480
certificates for their site without

1243
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:25,760
their permission

1244
00:46:25,760 --> 00:46:28,640
in the event that that happens this is

1245
00:46:28,640 --> 00:46:30,480
all cryptographically signed you can

1246
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,480
prove that the certificate authority has

1247
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:34,000
gone rogue

1248
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:35,520
and once you prove that the certificate

1249
00:46:35,520 --> 00:46:37,599
authority has gone rogue there can be

1250
00:46:37,599 --> 00:46:39,040
consequences on that certificate

1251
00:46:39,040 --> 00:46:41,280
authority and the penalties for

1252
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:43,520
misbehavior can

1253
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:45,599
go up to and including the certificate

1254
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:49,359
authority being delisted by the platform

1255
00:46:49,359 --> 00:46:51,200
but the platform security providers

1256
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:53,280
don't just maintain this external

1257
00:46:53,280 --> 00:46:55,839
observability in terms of certificate

1258
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:58,400
transparency they also impose mandatory

1259
00:46:58,400 --> 00:47:00,400
internal audits that are overseen by the

1260
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:03,040
platform vendors themselves the browsers

1261
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,040
and a consequence of this is that this

1262
00:47:07,040 --> 00:47:08,839
observability this

1263
00:47:08,839 --> 00:47:10,960
transparency occurs both on what the

1264
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,359
certificate authorities do and how they

1265
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:15,599
run their internal systems and if they

1266
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,560
fail it gets detected and when that

1267
00:47:18,560 --> 00:47:21,280
happens in either of these cases there

1268
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,000
is

1269
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,640
penalties imposed by the platforms up to

1270
00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:26,640
including the certificate authority

1271
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:28,720
losing its ability to create these

1272
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:31,359
certificates

1273
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,400
platform observability

1274
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:36,839
in the mobile

1275
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:39,760
space is a constant problem

1276
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:42,720
there's a huge industry

1277
00:47:42,720 --> 00:47:46,240
in the defensive space scanning window

1278
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,880
systems and scanning windows binaries to

1279
00:47:48,880 --> 00:47:51,040
look for malware when you discover a new

1280
00:47:51,040 --> 00:47:52,960
threat actor one of the first things

1281
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,200
that most incident response firms most

1282
00:47:55,200 --> 00:47:57,839
threat intelligence firms will do

1283
00:47:57,839 --> 00:47:59,440
is they will go back and they will look

1284
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:02,160
at an enormous pile of windows binaries

1285
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,079
and they will say do any of these other

1286
00:48:04,079 --> 00:48:06,559
binaries show similar artifacts

1287
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:08,640
because maybe that's malware that's been

1288
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:11,119
used in the past maybe there's other

1289
00:48:11,119 --> 00:48:12,800
pieces of malware that show the

1290
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:15,680
development stages of this thread actor

1291
00:48:15,680 --> 00:48:16,720
working

1292
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:18,720
this helps with attribution it helps

1293
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:20,480
with detection it helps with working out

1294
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:22,880
who the victims are and it increases the

1295
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,280
cost to the attacker that these systems

1296
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,640
exist

1297
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:28,720
they should exist on mobile

1298
00:48:28,720 --> 00:48:31,200
but they don't

1299
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,640
the problem at the moment is that

1300
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,800
platform security vendors in the mobile

1301
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:38,000
space are actively obstructing some of

1302
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,720
the security features that we need

1303
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:43,680
one of these is the ability to scan apps

1304
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:45,200
we should be able to scan all

1305
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,520
applications in a given app store and we

1306
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,000
can kind of do this on the play store on

1307
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,359
google android

1308
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:53,440
but we really can't do that on ios at

1309
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:54,880
the moment

1310
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,960
it should also be possible to install

1311
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:59,040
security agents on mobile devices in

1312
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:00,800
order to do forensics

1313
00:49:00,800 --> 00:49:03,040
and this should be both post compromise

1314
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:05,760
and also in anticipation of compromise

1315
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,599
that we can't do that the platform

1316
00:49:07,599 --> 00:49:10,000
vendors have engineered their systems to

1317
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,480
prevent this reduces the observability

1318
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,119
on their platforms and a consequence of

1319
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:17,359
reduced observability on their platforms

1320
00:49:17,359 --> 00:49:19,200
is that people that do have zero day

1321
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,440
chains against those systems

1322
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:23,760
have much lower risk profiles in

1323
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,079
deploying those zero-day chains against

1324
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,800
those platforms

1325
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,720
in summary there's three key themes

1326
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:34,160
this year

1327
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,920
be careful about stolen zero day

1328
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:38,319
stolen's zero day does change the

1329
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:41,200
economics of zero day exploitation

1330
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:43,680
so if you are reporting vulnerabilities

1331
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:45,440
keep that secure

1332
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,599
the second is that there's an enormous

1333
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:50,720
amount of exploited zero day being

1334
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:52,720
detected in the wild

1335
00:49:52,720 --> 00:49:55,359
and no device observability

1336
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:56,960
this should be a wake-up call to all of

1337
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,800
the platform vendors it's something

1338
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,200
that's deeply disturbing that we know

1339
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,880
that there's massive amounts of zero day

1340
00:50:02,880 --> 00:50:05,040
being exploited against mobile platforms

1341
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:06,160
and we have

1342
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,839
no forensics on devices in order to

1343
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:12,319
collect this data

1344
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:15,040
and finally supply chains are just

1345
00:50:15,040 --> 00:50:17,440
completely different they completely

1346
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:20,319
upend the entire economics of mass

1347
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:21,920
exploitation

1348
00:50:21,920 --> 00:50:24,160
they completely invert the targeting

1349
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,640
model they make massive exploitation the

1350
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:29,119
default for espionage you get things

1351
00:50:29,119 --> 00:50:31,599
like solarwinds colossal intelligence

1352
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:32,800
successes

1353
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:35,680
in terms of ransomware you get vast

1354
00:50:35,680 --> 00:50:39,200
destruction in the physical world

1355
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:41,040
supply chain infections can only be

1356
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:43,680
fixed by platform vendors the government

1357
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:46,240
is not coming to save you

1358
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:47,520
in mobile

1359
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:49,520
in non-mobile space we need to

1360
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:51,680
de-privilege applications break

1361
00:50:51,680 --> 00:50:54,760
permissions into entitlements and impose

1362
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:58,160
observability on these applications both

1363
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:00,880
externally on the app itself and perhaps

1364
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:03,200
also internally for very highly

1365
00:51:03,200 --> 00:51:06,160
permissioned applications and finally we

1366
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,800
should allow legal third-party scanning

1367
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:11,760
of applications at scale in mobile

1368
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:13,040
platforms

1369
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:15,200
my name is matt tate thank you so much

1370
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:17,520

00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:37,839
them

1381
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:46,640
okay i've got two mats i've got matt up

1382
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,359
here and i've got matt down here

1383
00:51:49,359 --> 00:51:51,920
hey thank you for your comment

1384
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,800
um i've got a couple questions for you

1385
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,160
uh and

1386
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:57,440
yeah hopefully we can have a little bit

1387
00:51:57,440 --> 00:51:59,440
of a dialogue in and take some audience

1388
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:00,720
questions

1389
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:02,559
okay so

1390
00:52:02,559 --> 00:52:04,559
what you said sounds a lot like we're

1391
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:07,119
really in the early days right we're

1392
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:09,440
we're figuring this out this is not

1393
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:10,880
we're not halfway through the fight

1394
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,960
we're just recognizing now that we're

1395
00:52:12,960 --> 00:52:14,319
really seriously getting punched in the

1396
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:15,599
face and we're trying to figure out what

1397
00:52:15,599 --> 00:52:17,920
to do about it

1398
00:52:17,920 --> 00:52:19,599
so

1399
00:52:19,599 --> 00:52:21,280
if we are in the early days what does

1400
00:52:21,280 --> 00:52:23,520
that mean um you know you see in

1401
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:25,920
congress there's been a lot of interest

1402
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,960
around the software bill of materials

1403
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:30,000
and

1404
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,440
there's a lot to criticize about that

1405
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,000
but it feels like we're not even walking

1406
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:35,920
yet you know we're we're trying to

1407
00:52:35,920 --> 00:52:37,520
figure out how to even build the

1408
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,559
foundation so we can even try to stand

1409
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:42,240
what what are your thoughts around where

1410
00:52:42,240 --> 00:52:45,119
we are in the whole spectrum of i mean

1411
00:52:45,119 --> 00:52:46,640
in the military they talk about you know

1412
00:52:46,640 --> 00:52:48,720
you have to organize to operate

1413
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:51,040
can we even operate are we even trying

1414
00:52:51,040 --> 00:52:53,839
to figure out how to organize

1415
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:56,079
yes so you're absolutely right one of

1416
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:57,920
the big problems that we have at the

1417
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,079
moment is the supply chain attacks are

1418
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:02,480
really only just starting they're only

1419
00:53:02,480 --> 00:53:03,760
you know if when we look at the really

1420
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:05,520
big supply chain attacks that have taken

1421
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:08,000
place so far they're mostly actually

1422
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:10,240
with pretty small vendors vendors that

1423
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,760
most people won't have heard of

1424
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:13,119
beforehand

1425
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:15,040
and when we think about you know a good

1426
00:53:15,040 --> 00:53:17,920
example is a couple of weeks ago ea was

1427
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,200
hacked right

1428
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:20,960
and the number of customers that they

1429
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:23,680
have is enormous and so when we start

1430
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,119
thinking about you know some of these

1431
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:26,960
really big companies that are

1432
00:53:26,960 --> 00:53:28,720
potentially getting hacked and that have

1433
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:31,200
you know numbers of customers at a

1434
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:33,520
colossal scale and we start thinking

1435
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:34,720
through well what would you know the

1436
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:36,319
cassaya ransomware event have looked

1437
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:38,400
like if it had been targeting customers

1438
00:53:38,400 --> 00:53:40,240
at that kind of scale that just

1439
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,559
completely changes the way that we sort

1440
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:44,640
of have to approach this

1441
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:45,520
and

1442
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,800
like the the

1443
00:53:46,800 --> 00:53:49,040
the moment we see you know uh some of

1444
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,640
these ransomware actors in particular

1445
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:52,240
targeting some of these smaller vendors

1446
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:55,040
what happens when it starts getting big

1447
00:53:55,040 --> 00:53:56,319
and this is one of the reasons why i

1448
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:58,160
think platform vendors need to start you

1449
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,400
know stepping up and paying attention

1450
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:01,920
you know uh uh

1451
00:54:01,920 --> 00:54:04,160
the the the risks in the event that this

1452
00:54:04,160 --> 00:54:06,559
escalates and it's you know likely to

1453
00:54:06,559 --> 00:54:08,480
escalate in the you know coming months

1454
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:09,440
and years

1455
00:54:09,440 --> 00:54:11,760
when that happens these things are going

1456
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:13,760
to start looking really big you know

1457
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:15,040
they're going to make everything that

1458
00:54:15,040 --> 00:54:16,559
we're seeing at the moment look like

1459
00:54:16,559 --> 00:54:19,200
complete peanuts in comparison

1460
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:20,720
so

1461
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:21,839
okay so

1462
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:23,839
now it's the future where we're i know a

1463
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:25,920
couple years in the future and we're

1464
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,319
having multiple compromises the supply

1465
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:30,160
chain is not just being compromised by

1466
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:32,960
nation state a it's being compromised by

1467
00:54:32,960 --> 00:54:34,640
nation state a b and c and three

1468
00:54:34,640 --> 00:54:37,440
different crime groups right

1469
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:38,960
i i always come back the idea of like

1470
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:40,880
sort of a multi-tenancy

1471
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:43,680
uh infection right how many crime groups

1472
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:45,599
can infect the supply chain at any given

1473
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:48,079
time um and then do we just sit back and

1474
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:51,200
watch for them to fight for supremacy

1475
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,119
and know who we're going to ultimately

1476
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:54,400
deal with

1477
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,839
we have some of these problems with real

1478
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:57,119
networks does it work the same way in

1479
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:59,359
supply chain

1480
00:54:59,359 --> 00:55:01,119
so i think one of the things where it

1481
00:55:01,119 --> 00:55:03,359
goes really badly wrong in supply chains

1482
00:55:03,359 --> 00:55:06,240
is when one of those groups breaks ranks

1483
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,920
and you know does something that's going

1484
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:10,319
to end up damaging those systems right

1485
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:12,000
you know in the event that you have you

1486
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:13,599
know four different groups who are all

1487
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:15,119
just trying to do espionage then you

1488
00:55:15,119 --> 00:55:16,640
know potentially you're going to flood

1489
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,480
the internet you know with the sheer

1490
00:55:18,480 --> 00:55:20,480
volume of exfiltration at that sort of

1491
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,880
scale but apart from that it's probably

1492
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:24,880
you know uh

1493
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:26,640
something that's sort of manageable but

1494
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,559
when one of them you know is a crimeware

1495
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:30,000
group and they say you know you know

1496
00:55:30,000 --> 00:55:31,440
what we're breaking ranks and deploying

1497
00:55:31,440 --> 00:55:33,760
ransomware to you know 400 million

1498
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:35,920
devices you know a couple of billion

1499
00:55:35,920 --> 00:55:38,319
devices you know suddenly all of you

1500
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:40,880
know however you try and build that sort

1501
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,079
of uh

1502
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:44,240
uh

1503
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:46,079
ability to sort of work with each other

1504
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:47,760
in the offensive space you know you

1505
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,760
might try and build that but it's not

1506
00:55:49,760 --> 00:55:51,920
going to be sustainable as soon as one

1507
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:53,920
of them breaks ranks it all just goes to

1508
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:56,000
hell really quickly

1509
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:57,920
yeah and so

1510
00:55:57,920 --> 00:55:59,760
so it seems like then you've got this

1511
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,520
this dichotomy if you've got the

1512
00:56:01,520 --> 00:56:03,040
operating system vendors you've got one

1513
00:56:03,040 --> 00:56:04,799
group the free open source software

1514
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:07,280
vendors where you can see everything you

1515
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,559
can see the source code you can do

1516
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:10,079
everything you've got the middle vendors

1517
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:12,160
right the windows the microsoft and

1518
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,599
apples and then you've got the mobile

1519
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:16,240
platforms and it seems like in that

1520
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,760
middle space

1521
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:19,119
maybe just talk about the difference

1522
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:21,440
between what you think on say windows

1523
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:22,559
versus

1524
00:56:22,559 --> 00:56:24,160
os x

1525
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:27,440
on least privilege or

1526
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,680
right so you know the windows system i

1527
00:56:29,680 --> 00:56:31,839
think has uh uh you know done a

1528
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:34,079
relatively good job job on things like

1529
00:56:34,079 --> 00:56:36,319
observability but you know the the

1530
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:38,160
number of vendors which are able to

1531
00:56:38,160 --> 00:56:40,240
deploy software to these systems at

1532
00:56:40,240 --> 00:56:41,839
enormous scale and with enormous

1533
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:42,960
privilege

1534
00:56:42,960 --> 00:56:45,040
is you know really problematic things

1535
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:47,680
like os x are somewhere in between that

1536
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:49,520
and sort of the mobile space where you

1537
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:51,920
have you know ios and android where most

1538
00:56:51,920 --> 00:56:53,760
apps are running in sort of these

1539
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:57,359
extreme containerized environments uh

1540
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:59,040
and you know in the mobile space you

1541
00:56:59,040 --> 00:57:01,200
still have this pathological case of the

1542
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,599
platform vendor itself right you know in

1543
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:05,599
the event that uh someone was able to

1544
00:57:05,599 --> 00:57:07,520
break into say apple and they were able

1545
00:57:07,520 --> 00:57:10,400
to deploy a fake version of ios to all

1546
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:11,680
of their customers that would be

1547
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:13,760
catastrophic you know globally and you

1548
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,200
know this is something that sort of

1549
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:17,119
pathological you know platform vendors

1550
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:19,200
are always going to be able to deploy

1551
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,520
software at the highest permission

1552
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:24,000
and you sort of have your uh

1553
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,599
that's sort of in contrast to windows

1554
00:57:25,599 --> 00:57:27,520
where you have you know this is a wide

1555
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:29,440
range of things you know both microsoft

1556
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,520
but also you have things like you know

1557
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,520
uh all of your drivers coming from you

1558
00:57:33,520 --> 00:57:35,520
know nvidia or from dell you have lots

1559
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,920
of software uh with system permission

1560
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,520
background installers things like you

1561
00:57:39,520 --> 00:57:41,760
know adobe photoshop right you know it

1562
00:57:41,760 --> 00:57:43,680
doesn't need to have system permissioned

1563
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,200
installs it just does because that's the

1564
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:48,000
way that windows works and osx sort of

1565
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:49,920
tries to take a middle road and you know

1566
00:57:49,920 --> 00:57:52,160
i think that's a good system you can

1567
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:53,760
install much more highly privileged

1568
00:57:53,760 --> 00:57:55,760
processes

1569
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,599
if you would like you have a much more

1570
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,839
user control in that system

1571
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:02,160
but the level of things you know running

1572
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,720
with you know very high permissioned uh

1573
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:07,680
by default is much lower in that system

1574
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:10,240
so um okay so i've got i've got another

1575
00:58:10,240 --> 00:58:12,079
another question to the people in the

1576
00:58:12,079 --> 00:58:14,000
audience who are building systems or

1577
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,559
maintaining large networks what is that

1578
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:18,640
foundational technological building

1579
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:21,119
block that they should deploy

1580
00:58:21,119 --> 00:58:24,160
to on which they will their keystone on

1581
00:58:24,160 --> 00:58:27,520
which they will build future trust

1582
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,119
you know is it

1583
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:30,559
code signing

1584
00:58:30,559 --> 00:58:32,480
what would they do that really enables

1585
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:36,160
the next level of protection

1586
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:37,599
right so there's a couple of

1587
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:39,040
technologies which i think are

1588
00:58:39,040 --> 00:58:41,440
foundational and that you really don't

1589
00:58:41,440 --> 00:58:43,520
manage to build anything secure without

1590
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,359
and one of those i think is code signing

1591
00:58:45,359 --> 00:58:46,799
and making sure that code signing is

1592
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:48,960
everywhere and this is for you know

1593
00:58:48,960 --> 00:58:51,280
perhaps slightly unintuitive reason but

1594
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:53,280
code signing actually gives you a lot

1595
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,200
more that you know supply chain attacks

1596
00:58:55,200 --> 00:58:56,799
can of course you know compromise code

1597
00:58:56,799 --> 00:58:58,720
signing certificates as well but code

1598
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:00,160
signing gives you a couple of really

1599
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:02,079
important things right number one it

1600
00:59:02,079 --> 00:59:03,920
gives you a point of contact in the

1601
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:05,599
event that you know you discover a

1602
00:59:05,599 --> 00:59:07,200
binary doing something you know

1603
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,200
suspicious you can you know go and

1604
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,280
contact the person that is the the owner

1605
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:13,760
of that you know piece of uh software

1606
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,440
and work out with them whether or not

1607
00:59:15,440 --> 00:59:17,359
that's something you know that they

1608
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:18,880
intended to deploy or whether you know

1609
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,480
that's a problem in their internal

1610
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:22,640
environment and another big important

1611
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:26,000
thing is that with code signing you can

1612
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,079
mandate things like entitlements an

1613
00:59:28,079 --> 00:59:29,839
entitlement based system doesn't really

1614
00:59:29,839 --> 00:59:31,520
work very well if you don't have some

1615
00:59:31,520 --> 00:59:34,160
kind of code signing system on top of it

1616
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:35,680
and also code signing provides you with

1617
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:38,079
the trusted external date we don't

1618
00:59:38,079 --> 00:59:40,000
really think about this very often but

1619
00:59:40,000 --> 00:59:42,319
this externally imposed date or this

1620
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:44,720
externally trusted date allows you at a

1621
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:47,119
later point as a platform vendor to

1622
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:49,599
obsolete you know entitlements that are

1623
00:59:49,599 --> 00:59:50,319
uh

1624
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:52,240
you intend to break up into multiple

1625
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:54,079
parts right you know you might have a

1626
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:56,559
system entitlement in your first build

1627
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,079
of this platform and you might want to

1628
00:59:58,079 --> 00:59:59,520
break this up into you know three

1629
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,599
entitlements later and insist that

1630
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:03,680
nobody uses this extremely powerful

1631
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,920
entitlement but how do you obsolete

1632
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:07,839
stuff without you know breaking

1633
01:00:07,839 --> 01:00:09,920
application compatibility

1634
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:12,000
one of those ways is to use this date

1635
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,400
system as a way of saying that future

1636
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:16,319
builds of this product are not going to

1637
01:00:16,319 --> 01:00:18,160
be allowed this you know entitlement as

1638
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:20,319
i obsolete it but i'll honor it with the

1639
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:22,319
older versions

1640
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,559
so finally uh before we call your

1641
01:00:24,559 --> 01:00:27,040
session to close it really sounds like

1642
01:00:27,040 --> 01:00:29,680
um zero trust

1643
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:32,079
is not

1644
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:33,520
is not

1645
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:35,839
applicable on the large platforms or in

1646
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:37,760
mobile and so it really seems like we

1647
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:39,359
have a disconnect between marketing and

1648
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:41,440
saying around zero trust capabilities

1649
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:44,480
and uh it's maybe very euphoric and then

1650
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:46,079
what what's possible in a mobile

1651
01:00:46,079 --> 01:00:48,240
platform there's no way for an external

1652
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:50,079
provider to provide zero trust it has to

1653
01:00:50,079 --> 01:00:51,839
be done by the platform provider right

1654
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:52,799
there's a

1655
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:54,720
you're helpless but for what the

1656
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:58,000
providers give you

1657
01:00:58,000 --> 01:01:00,160
right so like the the

1658
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,480
unless you trust the platform itself

1659
01:01:02,480 --> 01:01:04,319
then really you don't have any trust in

1660
01:01:04,319 --> 01:01:06,000
any of the things that are running on

1661
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:08,000
that system and really the problem is

1662
01:01:08,000 --> 01:01:10,400
that xero trust is sort of uh

1663
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,400
a long-term goal it's something that we

1664
01:01:12,400 --> 01:01:14,160
should try and get to i think we're

1665
01:01:14,160 --> 01:01:15,920
gonna struggle to get to a point where

1666
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:17,839
you know platforms themselves don't have

1667
01:01:17,839 --> 01:01:19,920
to be trusted unless you're willing to

1668
01:01:19,920 --> 01:01:21,599
you know build everything from the

1669
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:23,440
ground up by yourself and there's very

1670
01:01:23,440 --> 01:01:26,480
few people qualified to to do that you

1671
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:29,200
know in the the current environment um

1672
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,359
but yeah like you you're always going to

1673
01:01:31,359 --> 01:01:32,799
need to trust the platform vendors the

1674
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:34,559
problem is that we don't just have to

1675
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:36,319
trust the platform vendors we also have

1676
01:01:36,319 --> 01:01:38,480
this colossal additional set of people

1677
01:01:38,480 --> 01:01:40,319
that we have to trust and platform

1678
01:01:40,319 --> 01:01:43,040
vendors can help work to reduce that

1679
01:01:43,040 --> 01:01:45,599
down to a much smaller group of people

1680
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:47,599
that you know have entitlements for you

1681
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:48,799
know

1682
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:50,400
very important things that you know they

1683
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:52,720
have strong business needs to do and for

1684
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:54,400
those types of uh

1685
01:01:54,400 --> 01:01:56,240
groups maybe you can reduce that set

1686
01:01:56,240 --> 01:01:58,640
down to a minimum and impose like

1687
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,960
additional internal checks to you know

1688
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:03,359
verify that that organization is secure

1689
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:04,720
before you grant those types of

1690
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:06,400
permissions and insist that if they

1691
01:02:06,400 --> 01:02:08,319
violate that if they they break that

1692
01:02:08,319 --> 01:02:10,400
trust they will be able to sort of go

1693
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:11,680
back and revoke those kind of

1694
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:13,760
permissions as we did in like the https

1695
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:16,319
certificate authority case

1696
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:18,559
