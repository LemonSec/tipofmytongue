2
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,160
good day everyone my name is christopher

3
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,840
hart and i'm it's a privilege and an

4
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,800
honor for me to be asked to participate

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,439
in this panel with scott shackleford on

6
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:25,199
the case for a national cyber security

7
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,080
safety board scott is the cyber expert i

8
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,480
am the i'm a former chairman of the ntsb

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:32,558
so i'm the safety board expert so we'll

10
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:34,960
present together scott is going to start

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,480
and talk about the cyber security

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,559
aspects then i'll take over with the

13
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:41,600
ntsb aspect so so enjoy the conference

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,079
and and afterward i understand we have q

15
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,320
a for people to ask questions so we look

16
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,079
forward to that as well and meanwhile

17
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,960
let me turn it over to scott scott

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,120
thank you so much chris and greetings

19
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,039
everyone as chris said it's an honor and

20
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,960
a pleasure to be here with all of you at

21
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,840
least virtually to discuss a very timely

22
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:01,920
topic that's even gotten more so

23
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,000
recently that is the creation of a

24
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,240
national cyber security safety board

25
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,400
modeled after the ntsb

26
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:10,400
before we dive into the particulars

27
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,960
though um including the recent bite

28
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,119
administration executive orders setting

29
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,360
up a cyber safety review board we

30
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,360
thought just a bit of context may be

31
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,280
helpful particularly for the uninitiated

32
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,880
you know first it's important to note

33
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,479
that the topic we'll be speaking on

34
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,119
today the national cyber safety board is

35
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:31,759
of course just a small part of a much

36
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,920
bigger conversation on how we should go

37
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,079
about protecting not only the nations

38
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:38,320
but the world's vulnerable critical

39
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:40,400
infrastructure as many of you are

40
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,320
doubtless aware this is a topic very

41
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:44,320
much in the eye of the beholder here in

42
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,479
the u.s we have 16 critical

43
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,880
infrastructure sectors as designated by

44
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,720
our department of homeland security

45
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,560
whereas in the eu there are seven

46
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,079
critical infrastructure sectors

47
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,920
recognized under the network information

48
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,640
security directive there so even at the

49
00:01:58,640 --> 00:01:59,759
starting gates we're coming from

50
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,680
different starting points which as we'll

51
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,920
see is very different than is the case

52
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:05,920
in the aviation context

53
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:07,520
with ntsb

54
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:09,440
though as a quick aside we have seen

55
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:11,360
some progress recently through the

56
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:13,440
various cyber norms building efforts

57
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,000
through the u.n to come to a more common

58
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,760
understanding about what we mean by

59
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:19,680
critical infrastructure including with

60
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,319
regards to elections this does beg the

61
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,760
question though especially here in the

62
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:26,160
states given our broad perspective on

63
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,760
critical infrastructure

64
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,840
now that the majority of our economy has

65
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,239
been designated as critical if

66
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,560
everything is critical than is anything

67
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,959
at the end of the day and even more

68
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,280
importantly how can we best coordinate

69
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,239
our expertise and resources to defend

70
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,080
vulnerable critical infrastructure

71
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,640
against the huge array of cyber-enabled

72
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,480
threats including ransomware that we've

73
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,840
seen recently

74
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,440
indeed cyber threats to critical

75
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,920
infrastructure are not a new problem

76
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,760
despite the fact that they're constantly

77
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,920
in the news these days uh such as the

78
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,319
ransomware attack on colonial pipeline

79
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,640
or even in the agricultural sector as we

80
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:07,760
saw with brazil-based jbs

81
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:09,599
there are varying estimates for when

82
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,080
this story really got going one common

83
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,000
date that always gets some attention is

84
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,720
november 2nd 1988 which is of course the

85
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:19,200
date of the morris worm when roger

86
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
morris who was a cornell grad student at

87
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,000
the time um wound up infecting mit's

88
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,680
networks which of course then spread

89
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,519
into what became one of the world's

90
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,080
first ddos attacks of course roger felt

91
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,760
really sorry in the aftermath since a

92
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,760
note of apology interesting the dark

93
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,360
side also tried to send that note of

94
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,400
apology after colonial pipeline recently

95
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,319
um but you know things didn't work out

96
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:42,239
too poorly for roger at the end of the

97
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:44,239
day despite being prosecuted other than

98
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:46,159
pretty recent computer fraud and abuse

99
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,200
act

100
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,200
this is a relevant episode to keep in

101
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,200
mind because in the aftermath of the war

102
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,120
of the morris worm we saw the creation

103
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,120
of the world's first cyber emergency

104
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:57,040
response team or search based at

105
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,680
carnegie mellon and indeed right around

106
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,000
that same time the first report as we'll

107
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,280
mention in just

108
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,519
a moment in more detail came out that

109
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,360
called for the creation believe it or

110
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,879
not of an ntsb like organization to help

111
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,120
promote cyber security particularly for

112
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,480
critical infrastructure

113
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:16,478
now these days of course the stakes

114
00:04:16,478 --> 00:04:18,639
could not be higher in this context

115
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,959
given the huge proliferation of cyber

116
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,680
attacks in terms of numbers

117
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,280
sophistication and severity the fact

118
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,280
that they're targeting companies and

119
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,280
countries alike both critical and

120
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,759
non-critical infrastructure providers

121
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:34,000
and of course the attack surface as well

122
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,759
continues to grow exponentially with the

123
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,639
rapidly expanding internet of things

124
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,639
to give you an idea of one state level

125
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,040
snapshot for how this is playing out we

126
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:45,280
were asked by the indiana executive

127
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:47,680
council on cyber security this last year

128
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,479
to put together a report for how both

129
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,800
critical and non-critical infrastructure

130
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,280
providers were faring given this huge

131
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,040
array of cyber-enabled threats that

132
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:59,199
they're facing and it's a classic good

133
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,840
news bad news story we found for example

134
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,919
that more than 95

135
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,919
of the respondents to this survey which

136
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,400
went out across the state to small

137
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,240
medium-sized businesses local

138
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,960
governments we had hundreds of responses

139
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,840
95 were either somewhat or very

140
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:18,639
concerned about cyber attacks um and

141
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:22,560
indeed there were a lot a a follow-up to

142
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,080
that concern as we'll see in just a

143
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:26,400
moment but unfortunately it was not

144
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,000
always enough

145
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,400
many uh the majority even had

146
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,160
experienced cyber attacks in the last

147
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,280
three years

148
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,840
28 though of non-critical infrastructure

149
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,520
providers experienced those cyber

150
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,240
attacks whereas only 13 of critical

151
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,000
infrastructure providers did though

152
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,520
which is interesting and goes to show

153
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,280
that there could be some benefits with

154
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,440
being classified in a critical

155
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,440
infrastructure sector in terms of

156
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:51,280
information sharing and different cyber

157
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:53,360
security best practices and resources

158
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:54,560
that they could

159
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:57,600
have access to

160
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,440
one other quick finding that we thought

161
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,520
was interesting 91

162
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,600
of these survey respondents reported

163
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,440
taking these proactive steps that i

164
00:06:05,440 --> 00:06:07,360
mentioned a moment ago now these really

165
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:10,720
ran the gambit in terms of new antivirus

166
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,960
new anti-malware software that was being

167
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,199
installed updating perhaps an incident

168
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:17,759
response plan purchasing cyber risk

169
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:19,520
insurance more than half of our

170
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,080
respondents had already had a cyber risk

171
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,800
insurance policy with another 20

172
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,400
reporting that they were actively

173
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,800
considering such a purchase um though we

174
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,960
found a huge amount of confusion over

175
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:32,720
what was in these policies including

176
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,039
with regards to the exclusions which has

177
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:36,639
gotten so much attention lately

178
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,199
especially the hostile acts and warlock

179
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:41,039
axe exclusions which have been such a

180
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,199
big deal in nation state-sponsored cyber

181
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,240
attacks

182
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,800
and again 94 of these critical

183
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:48,880
infrastructure organizations reported

184
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,599
taking those proactive steps versus 88

185
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:53,199
so not as big of a difference there but

186
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:56,400
still a bit of a difference worth noting

187
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,199
so as we can see we have made some

188
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,280
progress with regards to identifying

189
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:04,080
conceptualizing this

190
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,840
cyber-enabled threat to critical

191
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,759
infrastructure and how we define that

192
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:08,880
key term

193
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,720
but clearly there's a long way to go

194
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,000
we've had a series of exercises over the

195
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,479
years that have been designed to better

196
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,880
protect the nation in this space those

197
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,120
really date back quite a long time at

198
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,960
this point more than 20 years to

199
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,520
presidential decision directive 63 way

200
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,639
back in 1999 which established this

201
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,560
sector-specific approach to cyber

202
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,880
security and the birth of these ice axes

203
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,720
information sharing and analysis centers

204
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:36,240
tasked to each one

205
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,960
um but you know clearly that was not

206
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,479
enough um during the obama

207
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:42,479
administration there was a big push to

208
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:46,080
establish uh dhs as the focal point for

209
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:48,000
protecting critical infrastructure there

210
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,319
was a bill back in 2012 that would have

211
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,800
given dhs responsibility to not only

212
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,960
define critical infrastructure sectors

213
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,199
but to send cybersecurity benchmarks

214
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,960
along with a safe harbor to help

215
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,199
incentivize companies to meet those

216
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:03,440
benchmarks but that was filibustered and

217
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,120
didn't go anywhere which was the big

218
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,360
reason we got the nist cyber security

219
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,520
framework which has done a lot to help

220
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,759
define and establish cyber security due

221
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:13,440
diligence in both the critical

222
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:14,720
infrastructure

223
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,960
and non-critical infrastructure context

224
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,120
but as we've seen with solar winds um

225
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,879
the various supply chain attacks

226
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,840
recently this is only a data point and

227
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:25,919
more needs to be done which is one

228
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:28,479
reason that we think it could be time

229
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:30,800
for this national cyber security safety

230
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,200
board now again this is not a new

231
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,519
concept the idea has been around for

232
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,519
more than 30 years at this point again

233
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,519
shortly after the morris worm we had

234
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:43,360
this 1991 report computers at risk which

235
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:45,680
explicitly called for the creation of a

236
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:47,920
national cyber security safety board or

237
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,560
an analog to it 2014 there was another

238
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,000
nsf report that made a similar case

239
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,240
lately we've seen proponents including

240
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,640
alex damos and senator mark warner come

241
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,360
out in support of this concept as well

242
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:03,519
as a brand new hot off the presses

243
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,440
report from the belfor center that both

244
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,600
chris and i were involved with learning

245
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,080
from cyber incidents that takes a deep

246
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,880
dive in this topic and was organized

247
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,800
by rob kanaki and adam shostak and then

248
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,560
and we'll give a few insights a few

249
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,320
takeaways from this report though it's

250
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,839
still in draft form at the time we

251
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:23,680
recorded this so we have to take some of

252
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,519
those with a grain of salt and of course

253
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:27,440
all this is leading up to the brand new

254
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,240
executive order um that establishes this

255
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,959
cyber safety review board so a few

256
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,959
highlights from this order given the

257
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:36,640
limited time that we have as you see

258
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:39,760
here section 5 in particular establishes

259
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,480
the cyber safety review board co-chaired

260
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,640
by both public and private sector

261
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:45,600
leaders

262
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,519
now dhs and the attorney general's

263
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:49,600
office are working together as we speak

264
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,920
to staff the board and ensure that it

265
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:54,000
has an appropriate interdisciplinary

266
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,519
composition to investigate significant

267
00:09:57,519 --> 00:10:00,000
cyber incidents a lot of that is

268
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,240
supposed to be wrapped up

269
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:03,920
by the end of june at the time we're

270
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,680
recording this we don't have that final

271
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,839
public report in hand in terms of the

272
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:10,079
board's scope and responsibilities and

273
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:12,480
structure so that's being worked on but

274
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,480
it's important to note that regardless

275
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,880
of how this gets fleshed out this is not

276
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:19,519
the ultimate national cyber security

277
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:21,360
safety board it's not an independent

278
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,320
agency in the guise of the ntsb though

279
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,320
this is certainly this cyber safety

280
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,160
review board you know an important step

281
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,000
in that direction

282
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,839
now before i turn things over to chris

283
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,240
here in just a moment there are a number

284
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,560
of important you know challenges as well

285
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:38,720
as opportunities to keep in mind as we

286
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,120
think about and move toward the creation

287
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,200
and fits and starts of this national

288
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,680
cyber security safety board and again

289
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,720
many of these are going to be

290
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,560
highlighted in much greater detail in

291
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,959
that forthcoming belfor center report

292
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:52,959
first it's important to note the scope

293
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,959
what types of cyber attacks should be

294
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,200
investigated how many people should be

295
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:59,360
impacted should it be only on critical

296
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,360
infrastructure we know how broad that is

297
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,800
maybe just particular critical

298
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:05,120
infrastructure sectors should it involve

299
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,360
you know trade secrets or perhaps novel

300
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:09,200
cyber attacks using some number of

301
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,680
zero-day exploits that scope question is

302
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:14,240
critical in the second half of 2018

303
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,560
alone there were more than 40 000

304
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,760
breaches reported under the gdpr scheme

305
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:22,880
in the eu it's impossible to investigate

306
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,720
all of these attacks under a type of

307
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,880
national cyber security safety board so

308
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,959
that scoping question is an incredibly

309
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:31,600
important and difficult one um in the

310
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,920
belfor center report we settled on at 10

311
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:36,480
million people or 40 million in losses

312
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,120
threshold but again open for debate

313
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,360
workforce is another important one as

314
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,040
many of you are aware there's a zero

315
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,279
percent unemployment rate in cyber

316
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,680
security according to many experts so

317
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,600
finding the right folks ensuring it's an

318
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,839
appropriate mix of expertise to staff

319
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,760
not only the review board but the

320
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:55,600
interdisciplinary interdisciplinary

321
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,519
teams excuse me that are actually going

322
00:11:57,519 --> 00:11:59,519
to be conducting these reviews as

323
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,600
absolutely vital and incredibly

324
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,720
difficult

325
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,639
there could be industry resistance that

326
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:06,399
we'll run into as we've seen in the tech

327
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,160
sector and otherwise

328
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,160
there's been a lot of pushback for many

329
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:11,920
years now against cyber security

330
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:14,480
regulations it looks like that log jam

331
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:17,600
might be starting to break at least here

332
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,360
and there but still it's important to

333
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,480
note that

334
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,959
some elements of industry including

335
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,279
insurance that could be supportive of

336
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,160
this

337
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,240
there's also a large number of practical

338
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,399
considerations to keep in mind including

339
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,639
with regards to sharing confidential

340
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,959
information personal health information

341
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:37,040
between these interdisciplinary review

342
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,040
teams between the various stakeholders

343
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,200
in play here that is certainly easier

344
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,600
said than done as well as defining

345
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,360
appropriate terminology should it be

346
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,040
based around risk management you know

347
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,639
for example the way the nist cyber

348
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,480
security framework is

349
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,279
and balancing a need to get reports out

350
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,320
quickly um given you know the the huge

351
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,399
stakes oftentimes in the aftermath of

352
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,000
these breaches think about colonial

353
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,920
pipeline as a case in point while

354
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:03,839
ensuring that there's a comprehensive

355
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:06,480
investigation being done so

356
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,320
there's a need for this slow careful

357
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,480
approach to investigations but at the

358
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,240
same time in this executive order that

359
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,440
we just saw from the bible

360
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,600
administration the requirement is 90

361
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,639
days

362
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,399
to submit these reviews so that's

363
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:20,160
another really difficult balancing act

364
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:21,519
that we're going to have to see play out

365
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:23,120
in practice and then i think we can

366
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:26,079
learn from from the ntsb content again

367
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,440
chris is going to turn to in just a

368
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:29,920
moment my last quick point first though

369
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:32,800
is that this is just one of several much

370
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,120
larger and more complicated reforms that

371
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,440
we think are needed in this space

372
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,839
including the establishment of a full

373
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:42,240
bore national cyber security safety

374
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,320
board or as we see here a major cyber

375
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:46,399
incident investigation board

376
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,399
that would have the power as we see in

377
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:51,360
the ntsb context including the power um

378
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,160
to subpoena uh when needed this bureau

379
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:55,839
of cyber statistics that's been talked

380
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:57,920
about a lot completely think and agree

381
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,839
that that is also a vital component of

382
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,680
these reforms that are required to get a

383
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,920
much better picture for the types of

384
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:05,920
threats that are happening what trends

385
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,320
that we're seeing in particular

386
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:11,120
as well as a cyber safety reporting

387
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:13,120
system that's incredibly important for

388
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:15,199
any near misses perhaps they weren't

389
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,639
actually breached in terms of these

390
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:18,880
organizations but if it was close if

391
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,959
other organizations are vulnerable then

392
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:22,399
we need to get the word out about that

393
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,480
too so a piece of the puzzle but we

394
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,320
think an important piece

395
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,720
as this gets stood up um because these

396
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,320
are very early days we think it's

397
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:32,399
incredibly vital to learn lessons from

398
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,199
the ntsb so that's why i could not be

399
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,199
more excited to turn this now over to

400
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:39,600
former chairman uh chris hart to dig

401
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,920
into this context for us so without

402
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:44,720
further ado chris over to you sir

403
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,079
well thank you scott that was a good

404
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:47,680
foundation for what i'm about to talk

405
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:50,800
about is uh how how applicable is the

406
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,199
ntsb framework to this context because

407
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:54,959
in some respects it's very applicable in

408
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:57,040
some respects not necessarily so one

409
00:14:57,040 --> 00:14:59,680
size doesn't necessarily fit all so it's

410
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:00,320
a

411
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,639
the agency was created to investigate

412
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:04,399
transportation accidents in all modes

413
00:15:04,399 --> 00:15:06,399
and determine

414
00:15:06,399 --> 00:15:09,040
and the output of the investigation is

415
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,440
recommendation so the ntsb doesn't is

416
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,360
not a regulatory agency it can't require

417
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:14,959
anything what it does is it makes

418
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:16,480
recommendations and it makes those

419
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,040
recommendations without a cost benefit

420
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:21,199
bias so the idea is if this were a

421
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,199
perfect safety world what would you

422
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:25,120
recommend to do to improve the safety

423
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,040
without looking at the cost benefit

424
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,360
analysis and that that's an important

425
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,440
aspect of the ntsb is that the

426
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:32,800
regulators have to look at the cost

427
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,480
benefit analysis but what they want from

428
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,720
us would be what i would call the pure

429
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:39,199
safety advice so so we investigate

430
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:40,959
individual accidents we also investigate

431
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:42,399
trends if something is trending in the

432
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,320
wrong direction we investigate those and

433
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,240
make recommendations to try to correct

434
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,519
those trends

435
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:49,440
the a lot of people say well if all we

436
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,000
do is recommend then can people do

437
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,680
people just ignore what we send them

438
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:56,160
they get a letter letters from the ntsb

439
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:58,480
file 13 no that doesn't happen 80

440
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,920
percent of the time

441
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,600
people do what we what we recommend and

442
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:02,959
that's because the recommendations are

443
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,800
so good that what you never want to

444
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,360
happen is to be in front of the judge

445
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:09,360
explaining why you didn't do a

446
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,120
recommendation and why that and that

447
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,800
recommendation caused the crash that now

448
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:14,639
has you in front of the judge that's

449
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:18,160
that is our main our source of impetus

450
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:20,000
is if people don't want to be in front

451
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,279
of the judge explaining why they didn't

452
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:22,639
do one of our recommendations they

453
00:16:22,639 --> 00:16:24,720
better do it so more than 80 percent of

454
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,560
the time even though they don't have to

455
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,279
they do let me just mention as a final

456
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,880
on this is that we are also an

457
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:33,279
accredited representative for accidents

458
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,720
outside the u.s and i mentioned that

459
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,720
because the cyber security board is also

460
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,399
is obviously going to have to be an

461
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:39,920
international work with the

462
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:42,800
international cyber community big time

463
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:43,759
because

464
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:45,440
ideally you want harmonization and you

465
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,600
want cooperation because to really stop

466
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:48,560
it

467
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,480
in totality you need to have

468
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,160
collaborated effort amongst all the

469
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,000
international members and not just one

470
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:55,759
at a time doing this that the other they

471
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:57,279
need to be working together in a

472
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,279
collaborated sense next slide please

473
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:00,560
scott

474
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,959
so the reason they make it independent

475
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:05,599
is because in most industries

476
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,599
if there's if it's a regulated industry

477
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,119
and that's a big question here because

478
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:10,959
this is not yet a regulated industry but

479
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,520
i predict that someday it will be but in

480
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,039
most regulated industries when something

481
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:17,039
goes wrong the regulator is the

482
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,959
investigator the problem with that is

483
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:20,799
oftentimes the regulator's actions or

484
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:21,919
inactions

485
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:23,599
are links in the chain to the accident

486
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,400
so so so if if that's the case then is

487
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:27,839
the regulator's report going to mention

488
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,760
the regulator's actions or inactions

489
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:31,760
probably not but when we do it as an

490
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:33,919
independent investigator we definitely

491
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,280
we definitely mentioned what the

492
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,280
regulator did or didn't do and in fact

493
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:39,120
in every industry we deal with in every

494
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,039
one of the transportation modes

495
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,480
the regulator has received more

496
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,160
recommendations than any other single

497
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,760
entity in that in that mode of

498
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:47,840
transportation so so that's the point of

499
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,919
having an independent investigation so

500
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:51,760
that you you get the totality of the

501
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:53,760
picture not just one that's biased by

502
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,360
the regulator's viewpoint

503
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:58,159
next slide please

504
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,440
so we started in as as

505
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,520
separate investigators in various

506
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:04,799
different modes so the aviation

507
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,880
accidents have been investigated for

508
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,799
almost since aviation began but most of

509
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:09,919
that was under the department of

510
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,840
commerce other modes were investigated

511
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,440
in other ways so so in back in 1967 they

512
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,360
created a department of transportation

513
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,440
which brought all the modes under one

514
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,039
roof for the purposes of safety

515
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:22,799
regulation and when they did that they

516
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:25,520
created the ntsb to investigate

517
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,039
all of those accidents and all those

518
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,360
modes and to report those and report

519
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,440
those accidents to to the public and to

520
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,919
d.o.t but they quickly realized this is

521
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:35,520
kind of strange because if ntsb

522
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:37,840
recommendations go to their boss d.o.t

523
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,760
that's pretty awkward so that's why they

524
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,200
realize that's not going to work let's

525
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,760
make the ntsb totally independent so

526
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:46,720
that's what it is today so since 1974 it

527
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:48,400
has been independent so we didn't have

528
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:50,480
that awkwardness of sending

529
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:52,400
recommendations to our own quote boss

530
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,640
because now we don't have a boss we just

531
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,720
are in an independent agency

532
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:59,440
next one please

533
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,720
so why

534
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,000
how do they make us independent well

535
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:03,600
there are several steps just you'll find

536
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,760
that we are very unique there's only one

537
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,400
other independent agency in the us and

538
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:09,679
that's the chemical safety board and

539
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,280
they have a lot of these features as

540
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:13,200
well so for example they want party

541
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,760
balance so they're the congress the

542
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:18,160
president nominates each member and the

543
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,200
congress

544
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,720
confirms those members so there are five

545
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,640
members and only three of those five can

546
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,240
be the president's party so that's to

547
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:26,000
create some party balance so it's not a

548
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:28,400
democratic thing or a republican thing

549
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,960
they insulate us by from from the lot of

550
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,960
the political forces by giving us fixed

551
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,480
terms instead of having a serve at the

552
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:36,240
pleasure of the president because most

553
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,000
political appointees serve at the

554
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,200
pleasure of the president what that

555
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:41,280
means in real world terms is if they do

556
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:42,799
something politically unpopular they're

557
00:19:42,799 --> 00:19:45,200
probably out they've seen that many

558
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:47,360
times the point of this is that if an

559
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,960
investigation is going along and it's

560
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:51,520
starting to look like it's disfavoring

561
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,520
the operator or the manufacturer or the

562
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,600
or the labor union or whoever and and

563
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,840
they get upset with that that appearance

564
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,840
that it's not looking good for them they

565
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:01,200
can't go to the president and say if you

566
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,360
don't get rid of this guy who's

567
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,840
starting to to blame me for this i'm

568
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,440
gonna ask you to thaw them out well they

569
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:09,200
can't throw me out because i'm there for

570
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,200
a fixed term and that's the point of

571
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,120
creating that independence because the

572
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:15,440
idea the ultimate idea is you want our

573
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,679
recommendations to be based on the facts

574
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:19,200
and the evidence and not based on

575
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,039
political lobby

576
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:22,880
knowledge requirement is very very rare

577
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,320
for political appointees you could be

578
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,520
the head of the department of labor and

579
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,200
not know how to spell labor but in our

580
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,000
case you three of the law requires that

581
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,679
three of the five members have some

582
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:33,919
relevant background or experience so

583
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,360
there's lots of lots of things in our

584
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,200
law that that have made us independent

585
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,799
and again the purpose of that is to help

586
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:40,400
ensure that what we come up with in

587
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,320
terms of our cause determinations and

588
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,320
recommendations are based on the facts

589
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:46,400
and not influenced by lobbying or you

590
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:49,039
know smoke filled back back room dealing

591
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,559
under the table next slide please

592
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,640
so the impetus for that is actually very

593
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:56,000
simple because

594
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,400
most in many many countries the only

595
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,000
thing they investigate is airplane

596
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:01,360
accidents and that's because there's a

597
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,120
large percentage of the public that's

598
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,440
afraid of flying so so that's that's the

599
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,919
case in the us as well and not only that

600
00:21:07,919 --> 00:21:09,280
let me put a footnote on that and that

601
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,360
is most federal legislators fly a lot

602
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:13,360
between home and dc so and they're the

603
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,720
ones who make the law so of course

604
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,080
they're going to have things that that

605
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,600
make that law very strong so that's part

606
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:20,000
of the reason why the ntsb is so unusual

607
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,840
and the reason i mention this is because

608
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,280
i'm not the chemical safety board

609
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,960
doesn't have this level of political

610
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,280
support scott mentioned how will there

611
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,520
be any resistance against a cyber board

612
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:31,280
and that that's very possible because

613
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:32,559
they don't have these kinds of

614
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:34,960
incentives about the public being so

615
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,600
interested in what we do as as the ntsb

616
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,240
does so stay tuned on whether the ntsb

617
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,480
model in that respect is can be can be

618
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:44,559
followed by the cyber security board we

619
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,600
we will see next one please

620
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,679
so separation from litigation is also

621
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:50,880
important because we don't want our

622
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,720
investigators to be worried wow if this

623
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,080
came out that company would be out of

624
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,679
business so we don't we don't want them

625
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,600
to be concerned about the other impacts

626
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:59,679
we just want them to look at the safety

627
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,600
so so the way they did that was that our

628
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,679
reports are public but they are not

629
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:06,159
admissible in litigation and the factual

630
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:08,960
part of the of the investigation is what

631
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:10,960
involves everybody in the parties that

632
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,240
are involved so if it's a big airplane

633
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:13,600
accident it would include the airline

634
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,280
the manufacturers the pilots the

635
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:16,880
mechanics the airport the regulator

636
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,960
everybody who has a dog in this fight

637
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:20,799
who's involved in that accident in any

638
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,720
way so so we need them for technical

639
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:24,559
support because if we saw a piece of

640
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:26,000
metal out in the field we would have no

641
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:27,679
idea what that piece of metal is but the

642
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,360
manufacturer could tell us exactly what

643
00:22:29,360 --> 00:22:31,039
it is and so we need them for that

644
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:33,280
technical support once we get past the

645
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,559
factual portion and get to the

646
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:36,559
analytical portion then it's only the

647
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,000
ntsb because we don't want the

648
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,400
analytical portion to be unduly biased

649
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:42,400
by any of the parties so we invite the

650
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,480
parties to submit their own analysis if

651
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,080
they want but the real analysis that

652
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,919
counts is the one that we do and we do

653
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:49,600
that by ourselves so it's a very

654
00:22:49,600 --> 00:22:51,600
collaborative process during the during

655
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,600
the fact-finding phase but it's not

656
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,440
collaborative at all it's just the ntsb

657
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,600
during the analytical phase

658
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:59,120
likewise we want to protect our

659
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:00,640
investigators from being in court all

660
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,120
the time so we allow only one deposition

661
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,360
of our investigators and and that can

662
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:06,880
only go to the facts it can't go to

663
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,280
their analysis or opinions and now that

664
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:10,960
now that with the internet with all of

665
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:12,240
our facts out on the internet

666
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,840
depositions are less likely because

667
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,520
they're already getting the facts from

668
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,520
the from the internet the cockpit voice

669
00:23:17,520 --> 00:23:20,080
recorder is is protected and that's not

670
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,480
public because we don't want the last 30

671
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,080
seconds of i love you mom and this that

672
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:26,720
and the other we we we redact the the

673
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,799
non-pertinent part before we release it

674
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:30,240
to the public but that is never made

675
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:31,840
public just the parts that are pertinent

676
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,200
to the accident

677
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:36,559
next one please

678
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:38,640
so here's the difference between what we

679
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,120
do in cyber attacks almost all of our

680
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:42,880
accidents are caused by inadvertent

681
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:45,360
error it's rare that we have intentional

682
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,799
wrongdoing when we do have intentional

683
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,600
wrongdoing we go to the fbi so 911 that

684
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,799
was intentional they flew into the

685
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:52,880
building on purpose that was intentional

686
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,520
we go to the to the fbi but the inves

687
00:23:55,520 --> 00:23:57,279
objective of our investigations is not

688
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,200
to blame anyone but to propose

689
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,279
improvements to prevent these things

690
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:02,400
from happening again because the

691
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,400
assumption is as with cyber security

692
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:05,840
the people are trying to do the right

693
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,600
thing and under sometimes difficult

694
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,120
circumstances and if they do the wrong

695
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:10,559
thing despite their efforts to do the

696
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,320
right thing then it's time to look at

697
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,000
the difficult circumstances and not just

698
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,080
focus on the person that's that's why

699
00:24:16,080 --> 00:24:18,799
we're we're we're looking at not blame

700
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,720
but try to propose improvements to

701
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,480
prevent recurrences

702
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:24,400
our investigation as i say are very

703
00:24:24,400 --> 00:24:26,640
collaborative because everyone nobody

704
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,080
wants an airplane to crash and again

705
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,760
that's a question in cyber will we be

706
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,840
able to say that well i don't know maybe

707
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:33,840
so maybe not so we'll have to see if

708
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:36,159
that piece of the of the picture is

709
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,080
transferable so the outcome of our

710
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,360
investigations as i say is

711
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,279
recommendations to whoever can take the

712
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:43,200
necessary action to fix it and our

713
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:44,799
investigations are very transparent

714
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,200
starting from the very first day when

715
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:49,360
the members are on scene in front of the

716
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:51,919
smoke smoke filled hole

717
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:53,840
on scene talking on the television about

718
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:55,679
what we have found thus far that we can

719
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,080
confirm as confirmed facts so so we want

720
00:24:58,080 --> 00:24:59,520
to be very transparent and the purpose

721
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,200
of the transparency is so that the

722
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,279
public will know without any doubt that

723
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,039
what we concluded was based on the facts

724
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:07,760
and not based on political lobby so as i

725
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:09,279
say when we find evidence of criminal

726
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,760
activity we go to the fbi they take over

727
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:13,760
and we provide technical support to the

728
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:17,360
fbi next slide please

729
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:18,799
so here's the difference is that cyber

730
00:25:18,799 --> 00:25:20,640
attacks aren't because of inadvertent

731
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:22,960
error they are intentional so now we've

732
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,559
got an interesting mix here because it

733
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:25,679
combines the need to find the

734
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:27,840
perpetrator as criminal investigations

735
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,440
want to do along with the need to

736
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,840
improve the defenses so that there will

737
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,760
be fewer mishaps in the future as the

738
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:35,600
ntsb tries to do so that's going to be a

739
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,200
challenge to mix those functions

740
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,320
together and one of the reasons it's

741
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:39,919
going to be a challenge is because

742
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,799
transparency is crucial to the ntsb as i

743
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,080
mentioned so that the public will have

744
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:45,520
confidence that what we are doing is

745
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,720
based on the facts but transparency is

746
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:50,159
what you do not normally want in

747
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,919
criminal proceedings and you certainly

748
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,279
don't want it here when that

749
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:54,880
transparency could provide information

750
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:56,880
to potential hackers about oh wow now

751
00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,720
there's a thought i could i could use

752
00:25:58,720 --> 00:25:59,520
that

753
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:01,360
that aspect of that system and and use

754
00:26:01,360 --> 00:26:03,919
that to my advantage to hack that system

755
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:05,760
so so the question is going to be how do

756
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:08,240
we how do we do this process that

757
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:09,760
involves both the need to find the

758
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,760
perpetrator and the need to to improve

759
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,080
defenses to prevent future events how do

760
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,600
we combine those processes that's going

761
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:17,279
to be part of the challenge that we'll

762
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:18,640
have to learn from because there is no

763
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,480
precedent for that for an agency that

764
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,760
does both

765
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,000
next one please

766
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:25,840
so people ask me all the time what about

767
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,799
ntsb in healthcare to look at all of the

768
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,799
who knows what the number is 200 000

769
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,640
deaths every year in u.s hospitals due

770
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:35,039
to medical mistakes what about the night

771
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,760
the 2008

772
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:40,000
mess up that so that so a lot of people

773
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,360
came up with solutions immediately they

774
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,640
were throwing solutions all over the

775
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,640
place but nobody had really identified

776
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,559
the problem that's what the ntsb would

777
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,080
do is identify the problem so you have

778
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,520
an idea what

779
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:51,279
what the target is for your solutions so

780
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:53,919
that so when when people ask me about

781
00:26:53,919 --> 00:26:55,600
ntsb and other applications like this

782
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,240
one like cyber i say here's here's my

783
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,559
two recommendations one is if it's a

784
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,320
rare mishap that even surprised the

785
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,640
experts wow how did that happen

786
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:06,799
then i would i would recommend an

787
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,720
exhaustive ntsb type investigation that

788
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:10,880
looks at that event to find out what

789
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:12,400
caused that event and what could be done

790
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,320
to prevent that type of event from

791
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,000
happening again so those investigations

792
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:17,600
are very thorough and that's why our

793
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,520
investigations usually take at least a

794
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,919
year for things that happen almost every

795
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,840
day like in healthcare wrong side

796
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,520
surgery is basically still happening

797
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:27,760
every day so when they happen every day

798
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,520
that usually suggests that there are

799
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:31,679
some systemic issues not issues related

800
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,440
to that specific event but systemic

801
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,679
issues and i have to think that cybers

802
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:37,440
the cyber world is going to have both of

803
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,480
these types is going to they're going to

804
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,240
have the ones that occur frequently as

805
00:27:40,240 --> 00:27:41,840
scott mentioned and they are also going

806
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:43,520
to have the really rare ones that

807
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:45,760
confounded even the experts so when it's

808
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:47,679
the ones that are rare that's why i

809
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,440
would put the ntsb after that but for

810
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,440
the ones that are frequent the aviation

811
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:54,480
system has developed a trend

812
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,679
a trend

813
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,399
situation analysis technique called cast

814
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,200
commercial aviation safety team and they

815
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,880
look at the trends because usually as i

816
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,880
say that and that suggests systemic

817
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:06,640
issues that need to be fixed rather than

818
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:09,200
issues related to a specific event so i

819
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,120
suspect that the cyber board is going to

820
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:13,039
have to be able to both of those next

821
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:14,840
slide

822
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,760
please so when if anybody asked me what

823
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,200
would i tell the byte administration i

824
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,640
would tell them just what i said if the

825
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,120
problem occurs a lot that reflects

826
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:25,200
systemic shortcomings and suggests that

827
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,039
you investigate the trend rather than

828
00:28:27,039 --> 00:28:28,720
individual events and that's the

829
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,320
commercial aviation safety team but if

830
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,320
the problems are rare and surprise even

831
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:34,080
the experts that's when you really need

832
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,760
an in-depth investigation to try to

833
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,559
prevent that from happening again

834
00:28:38,559 --> 00:28:40,880
next slide please

835
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:42,799
so one size does not fit all but i think

836
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:44,159
there's lots that can be learned from

837
00:28:44,159 --> 00:28:46,799
the ntsb processes and one of them is

838
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:48,720
active participation by the parties for

839
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:50,480
technical support because i guarantee

840
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,000
you the cyberboard will need that

841
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,600
technical support to try to figure out

842
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,440
the details of what happened so some of

843
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,279
that will be transferable to to look at

844
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:59,200
cyber but some of it won't and the part

845
00:28:59,200 --> 00:29:01,760
about combining needing combining the

846
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,360
the desire to find the perpetrator with

847
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,880
the desire to prevent things from

848
00:29:04,880 --> 00:29:06,399
happening again that's going to be an

849
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:08,320
interesting mix that has no precedence

850
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,720
so we'll be glad to do what we can as in

851
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:13,120
our role as nksb to see if we can help

852
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:15,440
that that mixture work because this is

853
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,360
going to be a new one so thanks again

854
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,960
for the opportunity to come and

855
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:20,240
participate in this i look forward to

856
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:22,159
participating more as this procedure

857
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:24,159
moves along and i'm i'm happy to have

858
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:26,159
the opportunity to work with scott and

859
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:28,720
and go as far as we can into this to

860
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,159
prevent these things from happening

861
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:31,919
again because it's it's really scary

862
00:29:31,919 --> 00:29:34,159
when you read about what's vulnerable

863
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,919
and how many things are vulnerable that

864
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,760
could be messed with when we saw the one

865
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,520
with the pipeline that was scary enough

866
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,880
there was also the one with the

867
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,559
municipal water system and actually

868
00:29:42,559 --> 00:29:44,799
poisoning the water there's so many ways

869
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:47,520
that the electric grid is truly is truly

870
00:29:47,520 --> 00:29:48,799
vulnerable there's so many ways that

871
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:50,960
this is is so important so i'm glad to

872
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,520
be able to play a part in it so scott

873
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,600
thank you for including me

874
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,600
no and thank you so much chris for those

875
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,640
incredibly helpful insights built on a

876
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:03,440
exemplary career in this space and just

877
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,600
a final note before we have to conclude

878
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:07,679
here in the interest of time is as chris

879
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:08,799
said there's so many important

880
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:11,279
differences between aviation and cyber

881
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,679
security in aviation you know there's a

882
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:15,679
single regulator oftentimes in many

883
00:30:15,679 --> 00:30:17,279
countries there's an international

884
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,679
organization ical right that can help

885
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:22,799
coordinate um these regulations it's a

886
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:25,360
lot harder you know to uh you know for

887
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:26,720
example i

888
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:29,120
hide a airline disaster than a cyber

889
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,159
attack so there's a number of

890
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,080
differences um but

891
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,399
one key point we wanted to end with is

892
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,559
the fact that one reason the ntsb has

893
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:39,279
been successful as it is and mercifully

894
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:41,840
has helped to bend the curve in terms of

895
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,679
safety for mass transit is because of

896
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:46,399
this global network of ntsb like

897
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:49,200
organizations um so this is called out

898
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,799
in the executive order and we just

899
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,559
wanted to put it out there as well that

900
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:53,840
if we're really going to see the

901
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:56,000
benefits from this come to the fore we

902
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,679
need to build on the foundations that

903
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:59,760
are already there including the dozens

904
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,279
of countries around the world that are

905
00:31:01,279 --> 00:31:03,200
using risk management frameworks

906
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:06,000
likeness or even more omnibus approaches

907
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:10,000
like gdpr to build this consensus around

908
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:13,039
cyber security and risk management and

909
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,279
the utility of these types of

910
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,679
investigatory review boards for the

911
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,840
situations in which they make sense as

912
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,000
chris said this is not a

913
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:23,279
one-size-fits-all approach but by having

914
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:25,600
this global system in place uh we might

915
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:27,200
not be able to make cyber attacks as

916
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,200
rare as airline disasters but i think we

917
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:31,600
can certainly um make them hopefully a

918
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,840
more manageable problem so thank you so

919
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,919
much again for this opportunity and we

920
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,519
welcome any questions you might have
