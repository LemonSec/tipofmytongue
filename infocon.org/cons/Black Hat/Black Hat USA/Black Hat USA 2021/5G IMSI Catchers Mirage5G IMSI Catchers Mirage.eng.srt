00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:18,800
hello my name is ravishankar burgawker

3
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,400
i'm a senior research scientist at

4
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,560
synthetic digital and also associate

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,320
professor at university of stavanger in

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,400
norway my co-colleague

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,720
of course speaker is sheikh he is a

8
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,119
senior researcher at turbulent norway

9
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,920
our talk title is 5 gmc catches mirage

10
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:36,399
with today's talk we hope to answer your

11
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,239
question whether the emc catcher's

12
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,200
problem has been completely addressed in

13
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,039
5g mobile networks or not

14
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,360
so before we proceed further let's try

15
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:48,960
to cover the background of sub fc

16
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:50,719
catches mg catchers they can also be

17
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,640
referred as stingrays or fake base

18
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:55,680
stations they basically are fake devices

19
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,160
which try to simulate a part or complete

20
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,239
cellular networks so that they can

21
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,039
identify or track their target that is

22
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:05,438
basically a mobile phone devices which

23
00:01:05,438 --> 00:01:07,840
are in the range of

24
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:10,159
the fake base stations they can be also

25
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,920
used for interception of mobile user

26
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,840
data or radio signaling data that

27
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,920
includes the metadata that can be linked

28
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:18,159
to the targeted

29
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,479
mobile phone device in addition these

30
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:22,479
devices can also be used for battery

31
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,720
drain attacks or denial of service

32
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,119
attack or queensland kill switch or

33
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:28,880
downgrading to lower generation but this

34
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:30,560
is out of scope at least for today's

35
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,360
talk

36
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:33,200
and uh of course simpson catches uh

37
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,799
silently afflicts more user privacy

38
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,479
today we will only address about

39
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:38,240
identification and tracking of mobile

40
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:40,799
phone device with five gbc catches

41
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:42,240
and there are two types of mc capture

42
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:43,840
what is called passive and another is

43
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:44,799
active

44
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:46,479
so in passive in passive attacks

45
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:48,880
basically uh mc catchers are trying to

46
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,280
e-stop the communication between mobile

47
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,880
phone and the network

48
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,200
uh and this and these are very difficult

49
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,719
to detect because they never interact

50
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,719
with mobile phones or network

51
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:00,320
whereas active

52
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:02,399
type of mc catchers are more powerful

53
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,000
because they can control the mobile

54
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,439
phones they can

55
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:07,200
force them to

56
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:09,360
force them to interact with the way they

57
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,959
want similar like master slave

58
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:13,120
architecture and they can be detected

59
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,560
technically so they there will be a

60
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,640
signature to protect them it is almost

61
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,080
impossible to detect on immersion

62
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:19,920
commercial mccarthy commercial mobile

63
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,560
phone device which is also out of scope

64
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,360
for this talk so we will cover later

65
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:27,120
sometime on a separate talk on this

66
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,879
matter

67
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,040
and let's try to look at the 4g networks

68
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:33,360
and how four gmc catches work before we

69
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,440
move towards the 5g ones imagine that

70
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,680
this is the radio access network

71
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,440
which consists of a mobile phone and the

72
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:41,519
base station we call node b in the 4g

73
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,120
and this is basically connected with the

74
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,519
core network imagine that alice went to

75
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,519
a shop he bought a sim card

76
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,360
which basically has to put in the mobile

77
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,680
phone you power on the mobile phone

78
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:53,920
it attaches to the network

79
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:55,920
and then basically using this setup

80
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,239
there like a list can make a phone call

81
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,519
with the bob

82
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:01,120
and basically in this scenario then

83
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,959
comes the mc catcher and what it does

84
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,680
basically it exploits the weaknesses in

85
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,159
the in the procedures of when the mobile

86
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,840
phone is being attached to the network

87
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:11,920
which is we call device attached

88
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,120
once it's attached it has to

89
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,640
authenticate with mobile network whether

90
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,200
it has a money to pay or make a call so

91
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,959
there has to be option paging procedures

92
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:20,319
when the alliance receives at least

93
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,680
receive a call

94
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:22,959
and these are the three technical

95
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,280
procedures which usually been exploited

96
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:27,840
by mc catchers also in 4g networks and

97
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,840
the identities which can try to steal

98
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,159
basically is called emc which is

99
00:03:32,159 --> 00:03:34,000
attached to your sim card it could be

100
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,159
also imei which is identifier for your

101
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:38,319
mobile phone device and also there could

102
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,159
be some other identities which can be

103
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,440
linked to

104
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,840
allies in this case for example and this

105
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:44,799
is what

106
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,680
the mc catches is doing here

107
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,319
uh and now when we before we move

108
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:52,159
towards the five gmc catchers we try to

109
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:54,159
see what has been new additions in the

110
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,879
security um in the random security of 5g

111
00:03:56,879 --> 00:03:58,879
networks and we will try to look so five

112
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,519
networks we just briefly go it has been

113
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,439
started to deploy all over the world it

114
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,760
has ultra high speed ultra low latency

115
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:08,239
all the technical features of 5g

116
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:10,159
but also it has more security features

117
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,159
than the 4g network so definitely this

118
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,840
is much better than what we have in

119
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,519
today's 4g network

120
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,519
now also there are two types of 4g

121
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,399
deployment types uh so billions of

122
00:04:20,399 --> 00:04:23,759
devices what we have as of 2021 these

123
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,600
so we have a 5g and 4g towers

124
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,080
combination of and these towers are

125
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,800
basically connected to 4g core network

126
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,479
this type of network we called as a

127
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:34,479
non-stand-alone mode

128
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:37,440
then in somewhere in future hopefully in

129
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,759
couple of years we may have the

130
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,759
another architecture which is called 5g

131
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,400
towers and these will be connected to a

132
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,120
brand new 5g core network which has been

133
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,759
transformed for 4g core networks and

134
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:51,360
this type of networks be called a

135
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,880
standalone board of course there are

136
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,000
different

137
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,680
features of two different networks but

138
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:57,520
this is just to give impression we will

139
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,199
have a two radio network one is for

140
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,360
non-standalone mode and one one for

141
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,680
standalone mode we try to focus

142
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,680
and uh the five security architecture

143
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:07,680
has been improved a lot now there are so

144
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,000
so many jargons were difficult to go

145
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
through each block in the in in this

146
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
presentation but we try to stick with

147
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,320
the radio access network within a 5g and

148
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,240
that radio access network basically this

149
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,320
red block what you see here and we try

150
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,520
to focus on the sim card which basically

151
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,280
it could be a 4g or it could be a bad

152
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,120
new file to sim card and the 5g phones

153
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:28,479
which are available in the market and

154
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,320
basically they will be connected to g

155
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,400
not b that's the next generation node b

156
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,479
which is called in 5g and that will be

157
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,400
connected to core network but we focus

158
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,080
on the rand component how the mobile

159
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,600
phone and the base station interact with

160
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,400
each other and we just try to focus on

161
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,440
this one

162
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,440
so what are the new identities has been

163
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,520
added so let's look at the some security

164
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:50,160
features of 5g so basically there is a

165
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,840
new super which is called subscription

166
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,759
formula identifier which is equivalent

167
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,600
of mcl 4g

168
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,840
and this super has been protected so it

169
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,319
means that over radio interface it will

170
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:02,400
be protected it will be protected using

171
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,479
home network public keys

172
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,440
uh that will be encrypt your superior

173
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,000
and encrypted super uh is basically

174
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,080
recognized as a suki we also refer to

175
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,680
this as the sushi for authentication

176
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:14,800
procedures

177
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,880
and this supie the intention is never

178
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,560
transmit this supie in a plain text

179
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:23,919
to the network and unless you are using

180
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:25,360
legacy networks basically you are

181
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,440
downgrading to 4g or you are using null

182
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:29,280
scheme in 5g where you don't want it to

183
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:30,800
use encryption mechanism and use

184
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,240
basically this one

185
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,039
another feature is that with supe so the

186
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:37,360
network will never page a mobile phone

187
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,680
using supe so that has been protected

188
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,240
that has been avoided so that the mc

189
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:44,000
caches will not get super at all during

190
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,360
the paging process so that's a good

191
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:46,560
improvement

192
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,479
and basically the benefits of these

193
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,319
things is that uh the mc catcher is

194
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:51,919
acting as a passive

195
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,080
or active mode is difficult to each drop

196
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:55,759
on super because it never transmitted

197
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,919
over over the network and also it's

198
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,800
difficult to probe as an active uh uc

199
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,639
catchers to get this super from the

200
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:04,319
mobile phone because mobile phone will

201
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,080
not give the supie because it instead it

202
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,840
will give you the sushi which will

203
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,919
difficult to link to with the target for

204
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:10,880
example

205
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,800
and the combination of this super suki

206
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,240
looks like this so sushi means

207
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,919
subscription has concealed identifier

208
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:17,759
which is called sushi

209
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:19,360
and this uses public key so

210
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,039
representation is looks is kind of

211
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:23,120
looking like this so supe is consists of

212
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,440
mcc mlc and msin

213
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,240
uh and to convert suki so basically it

214
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,120
uses the encryption algorithm e-c-i-e-s

215
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,960
or it could be proprietary algorithm

216
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:34,880
which receives the input as a home

217
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,280
network public key and this can be used

218
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,560
to to increase the msi and part of url

219
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:43,599
so p so basically mcc mnc will be plain

220
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,160
text in sushi and green will be

221
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,400
encrypted which is msin

222
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,520
now i will hand over my next part to my

223
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,919
colleague

224
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
and he will take you to the next rest

225
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,360
features

226
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,199
i would like to begin by presenting you

227
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,800
the security features that have been

228
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,440
introduced in the 5g specifications and

229
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,120
followed by our research and

230
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,039
experimental findings that we have been

231
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:08,800
doing over the last

232
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,639
three to four months on the 5g nsa

233
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,160
networks

234
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:13,759
to start with i would play the paging

235
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:14,800
procedure

236
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,639
the 5g paging procedure has been

237
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:18,960
drastically improved compared to the lte

238
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,400
paging procedure

239
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,240
paging is nothing but an activity that

240
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,080
is carried out by the core network

241
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:24,960
before

242
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,120
actually delivering the call or a data

243
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,400
message

244
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,400
in the past uh researchers have

245
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:32,479
demonstrated that it's possible it's

246
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:33,679
possible to

247
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:36,000
track the location of a user by

248
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,399
basically observing the paging messages

249
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,880
over a period of time and trying to link

250
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:43,039
the temporary identifiers to the to the

251
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:44,959
users and this way they were able to

252
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,760
calculate precise location of the user

253
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,760
which has been demonstrated on 2g and

254
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:52,000
also 4g networks as well

255
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,279
but now with various security

256
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,000
improvements the 5g paging procedure is

257
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,560
pretty strong um in terms of for example

258
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,200
let's say the paging occasion that used

259
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,920
to be calculated based on the mc which

260
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,160
is a permanent identifier which is

261
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,399
directly linked to the sim card is now

262
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:10,160
being replaced to

263
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,399
calculating the paging location by using

264
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,560
only stmc

265
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,279
and second as we see that

266
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,279
normally paging messages contain either

267
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,360
a temporary identifier or in certain

268
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,440
cases well we can also call like the

269
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,920
abnormal cases they might contain the mc

270
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,560
but now in 5g it's mandatory that the

271
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,640
paging messages should only contain the

272
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,680
temporary identifiers such as the stmc

273
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,200
or the radio network temporary

274
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,839
identifier

275
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:41,120
and moving on um not only the temporary

276
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:43,760
identifier is used for the paging but

277
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,320
now the core network is also responsible

278
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:47,360
for

279
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:50,160
refreshing the temporary identifier

280
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,600
of course like this

281
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,160
refreshing was also existing in 4g but

282
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,839
now it has been made mandatory in the

283
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,160
specifications that the core network

284
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:00,399
entity for example in case of 5g it's

285
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,839
the amf

286
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:03,360
that is not only responsible for

287
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,519
assigning the temporary identifier but

288
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,920
it should also like keep track of um

289
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:09,440
updating or refreshing the template

290
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,600
identifier sufficiently it has been

291
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:13,760
proven in 4g that

292
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,440
the the network configurations were

293
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,200
designed in such a way that the

294
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,959
temporary identifier you can also call

295
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:20,240
it guti

296
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,360
that remained the same unchanged for

297
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,680
over a period of even more than 10 days

298
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,480
or even in certain cases like months

299
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,160
because the mobile device has not

300
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,640
changed its location

301
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,480
and now in 5g the temporary identifier

302
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,959
would be a short-term identifier that is

303
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,680
sufficiently refreshed and sufficiently

304
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,360
randomized

305
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,600
this way you you increase the privacy of

306
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,600
a 5g user in

307
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,760
with respect to passive attacks or even

308
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,440
active attacks as well

309
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:54,640
now the guti is in 4g but like it's the

310
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,200
same similar terminology which is a 5g

311
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,160
uti

312
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,519
here there's a screenshot from the

313
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,839
specification which says that

314
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,480
the 5d uti the temporary identifier will

315
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:05,920
be assigned to the mobile device during

316
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,160
the registration procedure and after

317
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,760
that it is the

318
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,399
responsibility of the network to update

319
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:14,079
this template identifier there are

320
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:17,120
various occasions such as um whenever a

321
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:19,040
paging message is delivered to the

322
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,519
mobile device during that procedure they

323
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:22,880
resolved an existing signaling

324
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:25,120
connection which could be reused to

325
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,839
update that particular temporary

326
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:29,440
identifier this way the privacy of the

327
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,480
5g user would be drastically enhanced

328
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,519
compared to what it was in 4g or even 2g

329
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:38,000
networks

330
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,680
moving on to the anti-bidding down

331
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,560
between architecture's parameter

332
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:46,959
normally um in in any in any

333
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,480
communication architecture it's the

334
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,880
client that actually or it's a client

335
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,959
that actually provides this the security

336
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:55,040
algorithms to the server and the server

337
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,880
actually decides which of the security

338
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,800
algorithms to be chosen so the same

339
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:01,279
approach also goes in mobile networks

340
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:03,920
where the mobile phone provides the list

341
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,839
of security algorithms and then the core

342
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,600
network actually decides

343
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:10,000
which is the best algorithm to be chosen

344
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,760
there are classic attacks

345
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:14,000
are operated by mc catchers in this in

346
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,160
this particular issue

347
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,839
but now 5g networks will actually

348
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:20,320
overcome this by using the anti-bidding

349
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,959
down between architecture's parameter

350
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:25,200
which uh which is a parameter that

351
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,360
actually carries the list of security

352
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:28,880
features that are actually supported by

353
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:31,279
the core network now the mobile device

354
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,279
is also aware of what kind of security

355
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:35,600
features are actually enabled in the

356
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,760
core network that is that it is actually

357
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,240
that it is currently connected to

358
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,160
in this way the classic beating down

359
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:44,639
attacks where the server or you can also

360
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:47,360
call the network um lies about its

361
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,360
security features and downgrades the

362
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,279
mobile device to air

363
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,440
to use a less secure

364
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,560
um

365
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:56,399
or let's say weaker encryption

366
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,200
algorithms this this uh such type of

367
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:01,519
attacks can actually be avoided by using

368
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,839
the abba parameter and as you see that

369
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:05,839
this is sent in an ni security mode

370
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:07,360
command which is already a security

371
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,800
protected message

372
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:11,040
so the man in the middle cannot actually

373
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:12,399
tamper with such

374
00:13:12,399 --> 00:13:14,880
messages

375
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,040
if you have been following lte research

376
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,920
for the over the last two to three years

377
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,360
you must have come across the alter

378
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,120
attack so ultra attack is basically um

379
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:27,040
due to the lack of integrity protection

380
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:28,639
on the user plane traffic in lte

381
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:30,320
networks a man in the middle can

382
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,279
actually

383
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,079
identify the encrypted dns packets and

384
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,959
try to hijack the dns session thereby

385
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,959
hijacking the whole data session

386
00:13:38,959 --> 00:13:41,440
but now if this has been overcome in 5g

387
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,360
networks by introducing integrity

388
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,760
protection also for the user plane there

389
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,360
is already integrity protection

390
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:49,040
mandatory integrity protection for the

391
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,120
control plane but now there is integrity

392
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,040
protection also introduced for the user

393
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,240
plane traffic

394
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,399
however this is not a mandatory feature

395
00:13:56,399 --> 00:13:58,560
and is optional to use depending on the

396
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:02,320
operator's policies

397
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:04,639
in the past we have demonstrated that

398
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:07,199
when a mobile device communicates its

399
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,279
capabilities to the core network

400
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,600
we have noticed that there has been some

401
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,440
kind of

402
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:15,839
misconfigurations in the network due to

403
00:14:15,839 --> 00:14:18,560
those misconfigurations

404
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:20,639
a man in the middle can actually modify

405
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:22,880
these capabilities and which actually

406
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,880
causes various dental of service attacks

407
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:27,120
or even downgrading of the user to a

408
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:29,760
less secure network

409
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,120
this is the reason because the

410
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:34,000
capabilities are actually exchanged

411
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:37,519
prior to establishing a security context

412
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,800
which actually allows a man in the

413
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,639
middle to modify the capabilities and

414
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:41,440
take

415
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:43,360
advantage of or exploit the particular

416
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,199
situation

417
00:14:45,199 --> 00:14:47,680
but now in 5g this has been mandated

418
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:48,560
that

419
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,320
the capability should only be exchanged

420
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,920
after having a secure

421
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:54,880
establishment session

422
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,959
it is the first time that mcc capture

423
00:14:56,959 --> 00:14:58,720
detection has been considered in the

424
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,880
specifications or i would say entered

425
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:02,399
into specifications

426
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,440
if you look at the security

427
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:04,600
specifications

428
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,360
33.501 and in nxe

429
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,720
there is a mechanism that has been

430
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,720
defined to

431
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:13,360
where uv assisted network based insight

432
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,760
detection mechanism is defined and could

433
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,000
be used by the networks

434
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,519
um normally

435
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,000
in in a normal call procedure or during

436
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,240
a call transaction or a data transaction

437
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:26,560
mobile phones usually send measurement

438
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,399
reports to the core network

439
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,639
um these measurement reports usually

440
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:31,839
contain

441
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,079
the signal strengths or the whatever the

442
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,000
radio information that a mobile phone

443
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,759
can actually see at that particular

444
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:39,519
instant

445
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,399
for instance

446
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,720
uh cell identifiers for the base station

447
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:45,440
identifiers the frequencies the signal

448
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,199
strength all this information can be

449
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,279
actually sent from the using measurement

450
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:50,240
reports

451
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,560
so now the mobile the core network can

452
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,360
actually use that information

453
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:57,519
in a systematic approach and try to

454
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:59,519
identify for inconsistent cell

455
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:02,560
identifiers or unknown frequencies and

456
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,199
try to differentiate between genuine and

457
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:07,600
big base stations although this is not a

458
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:09,519
bulletproof approach i would say but

459
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:11,680
it's a pretty good start

460
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,199
to actually

461
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:15,920
implement such um such mechanisms into

462
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:17,920
the into the mobile networks

463
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:19,759
these have been always on the paper but

464
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:21,279
we never saw them actually happening in

465
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,519
the specifications but now

466
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,040
operators can actually take lead to

467
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,959
implement such features and

468
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,680
such mechanisms and and can actually

469
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,079
get it off or let's say detect base

470
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:36,000
stations or fake base stations

471
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,240
this is a summary of um all the security

472
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,079
features that we have discussed until

473
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,800
now and as you see that the current 5g

474
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,199
nsa networks only support the secure uv

475
00:16:45,199 --> 00:16:47,759
capability transfer and the rest of the

476
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:49,920
security features are only available in

477
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:51,920
the 5g standalone networks which are yet

478
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,079
to come in the

479
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:56,719
next years

480
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,600
now let's talk about five gmc caches in

481
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,040
the nsa mode

482
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:03,279
um as you as you have seen the security

483
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,359
features that the nc

484
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:07,839
um which is one of the most important um

485
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:10,720
identifier or or let's say privacy

486
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,160
identifier in

487
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,319
in this whole mobile network business

488
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:16,559
is not encrypted and is usually exposed

489
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:19,520
over the air and also due to the lack of

490
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:21,280
any mandatory

491
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:24,319
regulations to frequently update or to

492
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:26,319
sufficiently update the random

493
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:28,720
identifiers we might still see some kind

494
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,200
of tracking attacks happening in 5g nsa

495
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,520
networks as well

496
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,320
and now i would like to give you a show

497
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:38,480
your video where we actually operate our

498
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,039
own 5g rsa test network and try to

499
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:42,080
register

500
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:46,520
one of our test devices to that

501
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,919
so as you see that we have already

502
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,400
started the test network which is using

503
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,280
a 5g nr base station but the background

504
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,160
is a

505
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,480
coordinate 4g core network as you see

506
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,640
now the mobile phone actually has

507
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,360
actually identified a 5g or a 5g nsa

508
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:05,360
network and it would immediately connect

509
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,960
to this 5g

510
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,520
nsa network on the right side we have

511
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:12,240
our logs where we actually

512
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:13,679
um

513
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:15,520
log whichever device is connecting and

514
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,280
as you see on the left side here the

515
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:18,799
device has actually registered to the

516
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:19,760
network

517
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:22,240
and now we should be able to see that

518
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:23,840
this device the information about the

519
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:28,320
device such as its nc and imei being

520
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,679
extracted to our

521
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:34,880
internal logs i would say

522
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,640
and this is performed using one of our

523
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:40,240
test devices

524
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,600
and

525
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:43,679
to explain more about you about the

526
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,600
security features that we have been

527
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,080
testing in uh 5g nsa networks over the

528
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:50,160
last three to four months uh we have

529
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:52,000
tested up to four nsa networks in two

530
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,840
different countries and now let's take a

531
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,919
look at what kind of security features

532
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,000
are active at the moment what have been

533
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,080
changed in the past and how operators

534
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,160
have updated their configurations

535
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,080
considering various

536
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,720
attack demonstrations and

537
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:11,160
responsible disclosures over the past

538
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:15,760
first i would start with tracking with

539
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,039
guti

540
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:18,000
um

541
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,240
in 2015 we have done

542
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,919
various experiments trying to identify

543
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:24,640
the configuration policies of gutis in

544
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:26,480
various operator networks

545
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:28,960
um so basically what we do is here we

546
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,280
try to register and register the device

547
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:33,200
across various time instance

548
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:35,360
and try to identify and try to note what

549
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:36,960
kind of random identifier has been

550
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,160
assigned to that particular mobile

551
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,880
device as you see here in 2015 the

552
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,400
identifiers

553
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,400
rarely change as you see that there's

554
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,240
only one digit change compared to the

555
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:48,400
previous one and this is a pretty bad

556
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,240
configuration policy

557
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,960
and now when we compare it with um

558
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:54,720
what uh the network is actually

559
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:56,960
assigning in 2021 we see there is a

560
00:19:56,960 --> 00:19:59,919
sufficient randomization in the in the

561
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,159
gutis which in the first place

562
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:06,159
eliminates tracking in 5g gnsa networks

563
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:07,919
and we also done similar experiments in

564
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:09,919
the 5g nsa networks as well as you see

565
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,320
on the right side um

566
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:15,440
the identifiers sufficiently change

567
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,919
although the beginning dd remains to say

568
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:19,840
it remains to be same but however like

569
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:21,679
it changes after a couple of

570
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,400
hours or next the next day but at least

571
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:26,240
i would say this is sufficiently

572
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,679
randomized and has been updated

573
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:29,440
periodically

574
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:31,039
moving to another operator we don't

575
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:33,600
observe the same level of randomness

576
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,720
because the the guti tends to remind the

577
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:39,200
same for several days and it updates

578
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,080
after

579
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,360
several days

580
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,919
um in such configuration policies are a

581
00:20:43,919 --> 00:20:46,559
bad practice and this actually allows

582
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:49,919
tracking of gotis or let's say linking

583
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:51,919
linking a random identifier to a

584
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:54,720
particular subscriber

585
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:56,559
and with operator 3 it doesn't get

586
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:57,600
better

587
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:58,559
because

588
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,799
we see that the guti do not change at

589
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,520
all even for 10 plus days even after we

590
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:04,400
have

591
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,640
restarted the device multiple times

592
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,799
these are pretty bad configurations that

593
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:10,880
we have been identified in 5g nsa

594
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,360
networks

595
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:16,400
one last thing about the tracking but

596
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,799
by sufficiently or frequently um

597
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:21,120
randomizing the temporary identifiers in

598
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,799
the first place you can actually avoid

599
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,159
several attacks

600
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,080
uh but this requires like some changes

601
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:27,919
in the internal policies and timers to

602
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:29,280
activate that

603
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,559
um

604
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,159
also there are several mechanisms

605
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,000
available in the specifications that

606
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,720
could be invoked to randomly or to

607
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,080
frequently change the temporary

608
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,720
identifier such as the periodic tau or

609
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:42,559
let's say periodic routing area update

610
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,120
or a gut relocation command

611
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:47,678
this could be

612
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:50,159
periodically like invoked to update the

613
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:52,640
identifiers but in practice in our logs

614
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,640
we actually don't observe

615
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:55,919
these commands

616
00:21:55,919 --> 00:21:59,200
being sent to the mobile devices

617
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,000
which is still um i don't understand

618
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
like it's still a surprise but uh i

619
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,760
would we would like to see this

620
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,600
happening at least in the in the future

621
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:10,000
networks where configurations are better

622
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,080
configured

623
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:13,679
and the classic downgrading attacks

624
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:16,240
where um

625
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,320
emc catches downgrade from higher

626
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,919
generation to learn a lower generation

627
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:21,840
network we have shown this in the past

628
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,080
that using unprotected

629
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:25,760
mobility management messages it's

630
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:28,720
possible to send a mobile device or

631
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,400
let's say download a mobile device from

632
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,559
higher generation to a lower generation

633
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,240
um of course this is still possible in

634
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:36,400
the 5g nsa networks but the

635
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,760
specification

636
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:40,799
has already provided different solutions

637
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,640
to avoid such attacks for example like

638
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,000
there is an automatic timer based

639
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,559
recovery

640
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,360
but we haven't seen this implemented in

641
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:52,159
several mobile phones or one of the the

642
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:54,480
most widely used mobile phones

643
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,720
there are several reasons for that

644
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:58,720
but if such mechanisms are not

645
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,760
implemented the device would stay in the

646
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,760
no service mode and would require a

647
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,159
manual restart or a flight mode toggling

648
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:08,960
to actually obtain service pack

649
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:10,799
there are several other mechanisms that

650
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:12,559
have been demonstrated in the past how

651
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,880
to actually downgrade the user from an

652
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,799
lte network to a

653
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:20,159
2g network by using rrc release messages

654
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:22,880
but the same is also possible in 5g nsa

655
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,600
networks by using various by using some

656
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:27,919
sophistications

657
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,200
of course the downgraded attacks are

658
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:31,039
still not completely gone they would

659
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,000
still be

660
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,320
derailing given in 5g nsa and sa

661
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:37,520
networks as well

662
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:39,760
and coming to the capability exchange

663
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,320
our experiments in 2019 compared to 21

664
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,679
21 shows big difference because as you

665
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:48,080
see here in 2019 the capabilities are

666
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,400
actually exchanged

667
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:52,559
prior to the security establishment

668
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:54,000
which actually allows a man in the

669
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,559
middle to modify them and cause various

670
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:58,080
dos attacks

671
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,919
but now due to the

672
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:01,919
update in the configurations we see that

673
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:03,679
in all the four nsa networks that we

674
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,080
tested the capabilities are

675
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:08,000
exchanged only after having a security

676
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:10,320
session which means there is a integrity

677
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:11,919
protection which prevents a man in the

678
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,360
middle to modify

679
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:16,600
such capabilities

680
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:20,159
and the last one the last feature that

681
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,159
we have tested in the 5g nsa networks is

682
00:24:22,159 --> 00:24:23,520
that

683
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:25,440
by now you might have understood

684
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:28,720
in a 5g nsa configuration it's the 4g

685
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,080
base station that actually carries the

686
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,760
control plane traffic

687
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,640
and after that the 5g nr base station

688
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,320
comes into place and carries the data

689
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:37,520
traffic

690
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,360
but now by using the integrity

691
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,440
protection for the control plane

692
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:43,520
or user plane you can actually avoid the

693
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:45,520
alter attack so we try to understand

694
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,360
what kind of configuration is provided

695
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:49,760
over the 4g base station and that could

696
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:52,799
be used on a 5g base station so here you

697
00:24:52,799 --> 00:24:54,159
see that there's a security

698
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:56,240
configuration which is actually used

699
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,320
when the mobile device connects to the

700
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:00,640
5gb station as you see here there is

701
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:02,960
only the ciphering algorithm and ea2

702
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,960
which means new radio encryption

703
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:07,360
algorithm

704
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,159
but there could also be optionally

705
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:11,440
integrity protection algorithm which

706
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:13,200
would have been specified but in

707
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,120
practice in the four nsa networks we

708
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,480
don't see

709
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,559
the integrity protection algorithm being

710
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:20,799
used in this case which actually makes

711
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,400
the networks vulnerable to the alternate

712
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,919
attacks that have been demonstrated in

713
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:26,240
the past

714
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,960
with this i conclude the attacks on the

715
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,120
nsa 5grsa networks

716
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,039
from here on rabi would like to continue

717
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:35,760
the presentation

718
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:38,880
thanks santa

719
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,039
now let's look at the 5 gbc catchers and

720
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,279
how they works in 5g standalone mode

721
00:25:43,279 --> 00:25:45,600
network only so if the user is forcing

722
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,200
mobile phone to be only on friday

723
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,520
standalone what are the possibilities

724
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,080
that they can be tracked

725
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:55,120
let's look at first on decoding sushi

726
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:57,520
now if you have a sushi now we already

727
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:00,080
covered the part that supe is encrypted

728
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,840
so they it will not be exposed over

729
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,080
there so the user cannot be identified

730
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,799
why based on the supie or we call this

731
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:08,880
equivalent of mc

732
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:12,320
but if the mobile phone is using sushi

733
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,880
so actually uh it is being protected at

734
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,120
least your super is protected however it

735
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,520
reveals the home operator name and if

736
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,080
you remember the architecture of

737
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,640
sushi so it comes it's a combination of

738
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:25,679
mcc

739
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:27,760
uh that is a mobile country code mobile

740
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:29,120
network

741
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,320
code mnc and encrypted msin so basically

742
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:35,200
mcc and mnc are not encrypted and the

743
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,559
reason they are not encrypted for

744
00:26:36,559 --> 00:26:38,559
routing purpose

745
00:26:38,559 --> 00:26:41,279
it was it may not be feasible to encrypt

746
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:44,559
those mccmc at this stage in in 5g

747
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,400
standardization procedure but it should

748
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,520
be

749
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,760
possible to encrypt them and also also

750
00:26:49,760 --> 00:26:51,840
enable routing as well so hopefully we

751
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,080
will see that in the next version either

752
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,200
in 60 or in the second or later phase of

753
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,960
5g standardization it may be fixed for

754
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,600
example so at least it will protect

755
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,200
the home operator name as well

756
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,120
especially on something and what is the

757
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,000
impact of this basically imagine that uh

758
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:10,080
if you are running uh if attacker is

759
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,080
earning an emcee catches near one

760
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:15,279
essential building maybe like uh

761
00:27:15,279 --> 00:27:16,559
let's say i assume that the black hat

762
00:27:16,559 --> 00:27:19,679
conference room for example or maybe

763
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:21,360
embassy for example so they can hear

764
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,520
they can run the mc catcher there which

765
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:25,679
can decode all the sushi and it can

766
00:27:25,679 --> 00:27:28,000
easily say that okay in this building

767
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,320
particularly or in the range of 300

768
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:33,039
meter area we already see some of the

769
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,960
users which are coming from asia or

770
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,640
africa for example so you can easily

771
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,399
differentiate between the

772
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:40,960
uh the people who are in the inside the

773
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,559
building so that reveals something but

774
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:44,320
not exactly your target but there's

775
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,159
still so scope to decode some

776
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:48,559
information there

777
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:50,559
going forwards if the super is not based

778
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:51,279
on

779
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:54,080
mc uh understand it allows that your

780
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,399
super may not have a different may have

781
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,640
a different forms for example super is

782
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,880
equal to user name at the rate

783
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,799
uh

784
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:04,720
for example it could be pop at the

785
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,480
retina essay.com it could be your email

786
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,720
address for example and these scenarios

787
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,720
are not very interesting for commercial

788
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:12,559
mobile operators but maybe

789
00:28:12,559 --> 00:28:14,960
5g private network that is the new types

790
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:17,679
of network can be can be deployed in

791
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:19,760
industry 4.0 scenario maybe for a

792
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,840
factory purpose maybe for military

793
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:23,360
communication purpose maybe for

794
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:25,039
strategic communication purposes maybe

795
00:28:25,039 --> 00:28:27,440
some airports also been deploying those

796
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,559
private 5g networks and it's easily able

797
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,399
to distinguish between the private phi

798
00:28:32,399 --> 00:28:34,080
general subscriber

799
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,159
against the public 5g subscriber as well

800
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:37,840
and the reason is because

801
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,320
the sushi which may be derived from

802
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,480
those supe

803
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,960
may not be random especially the length

804
00:28:44,960 --> 00:28:46,720
because length will be different

805
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:49,360
depending on the length of the the user

806
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:51,520
name this has been used and this was

807
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:52,960
discovered by extreme research

808
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,279
especially the john and prajwal and then

809
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:56,720
it could be the problem if it's not

810
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:59,279
being fixed for example so if you are

811
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,200
deciding to not use mc then maybe you

812
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:02,399
need to give this attention to this

813
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:04,080
problem as well that your

814
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,960
your 5g users will not be

815
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:08,000
distinguishable from the

816
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
other 5g subscribers

817
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:11,919
then tracking with 5g cover levity

818
00:29:11,919 --> 00:29:14,240
especially using a protocol

819
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,080
uh you need to be an active mc catcher

820
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,320
here with the standalone networks

821
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:20,640
uh and the random eot and infi jacob

822
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:23,120
protocol i will come back to this later

823
00:29:23,120 --> 00:29:24,640
but due to the limitation we'll just

824
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,799
focus to the points here so the random

825
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,799
eutn which are not being encrypted in a

826
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,640
protocol they can be easily sniffed or

827
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,799
requested from the network if we if the

828
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:36,399
target the targets mc is basically known

829
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:37,919
either by downgrading or other

830
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:39,840
mechanisms and again this is target

831
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:42,320
attack not like a mass level of attack

832
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,559
and once the attacker knows random autn

833
00:29:44,559 --> 00:29:46,960
it is possible using an uh 5g bank

834
00:29:46,960 --> 00:29:48,399
station 5g

835
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,559
stand-alone base station uh you can

836
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,360
replay those random utn to the

837
00:29:53,360 --> 00:29:55,520
to the targeted mobile phone and based

838
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:57,039
on the response you can use easily

839
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,640
identified and they are basically

840
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,720
exploiting the two vulnerabilities

841
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,559
which we have been discovered in the

842
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,960
past for the first one was from 2012

843
00:30:04,960 --> 00:30:06,320
research works with university of

844
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,240
birmingham that we have been done in the

845
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:10,159
past and basically you can look at the

846
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,720
mac or sync failure in the protocol and

847
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,399
recognize whether this is your right

848
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:16,880
target or not and also the human liberty

849
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:19,440
we discovered last year in 2019

850
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,159
uh in last year 2019 blackhead talk and

851
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:24,799
this was about the xor

852
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,399
encryption mechanism that has been used

853
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,480
in the auts that allows identification

854
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,159
of a user and as well as monitoring

855
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,159
attacks so this has been discussed in

856
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,360
pets 2018 or 2018 talk and we haven't

857
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,120
tried this one liberty at least in 5g

858
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,039
standalone but uh the researchers from

859
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:41,440
university of uh vulcan road university

860
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,760
of boca marilyn david christina and

861
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:44,720
thurston

862
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:47,120
uh they have released the paper actually

863
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:48,799
and they talk about they

864
00:30:48,799 --> 00:30:50,799
they verified this

865
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,559
problem in 5g standalone as well and

866
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,480
that's pretty a good effort from them as

867
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,480
well so this problem is still there

868
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,720
because it hasn't been fixed in the file

869
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,000
jacob protocol at least the two

870
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,600
vulnerabilities which we discovered one

871
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:05,120
is 2012 and 2019. but still this hasn't

872
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,279
been addressed for example

873
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,519
uh and uh i will skip with the file

874
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:11,039
jacob protocol because this has been

875
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,360
discussed in 2019 blackhead talk but

876
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:15,360
just to give a significance that what

877
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,200
you see here is that the

878
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,000
sushi and also the random utn which are

879
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:21,440
being exchanged over the radio

880
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:23,600
communication this can be easily

881
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,399
uh sniffed by the base station at the

882
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:28,480
same time by using other means as well

883
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,480
so they are not being protected so it

884
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,679
can be

885
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,480
used to exploit the vulnerabilities of

886
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,240
autn

887
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,760
i skipped those five jacob protocol

888
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:39,679
slides but uh please

889
00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:41,120
feel free to read later or you can

890
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,279
listen to the 2019 black hat talk for

891
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:44,799
the more details

892
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:46,640
then another vulnerability is that 5g

893
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,240
standalone networks if your phone is

894
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,080
there it's possible to downgrade to 4g

895
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:51,760
networks downgrading attack is still

896
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,159
possible from activity catches because

897
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:56,080
uh the base station can still say that

898
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,159
okay fine this is a registration reject

899
00:31:58,159 --> 00:32:00,080
we don't support 5g network services

900
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:02,240
then basically phone will drop to 4g

901
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,000
network and downgrading attack works and

902
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,000
again you can bring on your

903
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,080
4 gmc catcher attacks will be possible

904
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:10,159
then again downgrading to 3g or 2g may

905
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:11,760
not be straight forward but of course if

906
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:13,360
you do some sophistication of attack

907
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,919
that may be possible at the same time

908
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:17,700
and even if the 5g standalone

909
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:18,880
[Music]

910
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:20,480
features which are proposed in the file

911
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,799
security standard are been

912
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,960
been operational

913
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:27,360
are implemented in the 5g network

914
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,720
devices also core network devices but if

915
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,640
the operator who is deploying those

916
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,720
networks are having some issues with

917
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,320
their configuration maybe they are not

918
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:38,000
compliance with the mandatory features

919
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,679
that has been suggested by the

920
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:41,120
standardization bodies

921
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:43,200
then that may allow tracking of a user

922
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,799
and what we have witnessed so far with

923
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:46,799
5g non-standalone network that we have

924
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:49,200
been analyzed i think they are missing

925
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:51,039
most of the mandatory feature there not

926
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:52,799
every operator but some operators so we

927
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,720
have some deviations there and if this

928
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,279
this will also be if it's possible in 5g

929
00:32:57,279 --> 00:32:59,200
standalone then we may have a problem

930
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,440
again that tmc caches will be

931
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:02,880
very easily

932
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,720
they can be worked on 5g standalone

933
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,399
network as well

934
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,320
there are some other open issues in 5g

935
00:33:08,320 --> 00:33:10,399
that we would like to also address

936
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:12,240
and and the first is about the master

937
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,720
slave perspective i think the 5g

938
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:16,640
standard is definitely better than 4g

939
00:33:16,640 --> 00:33:17,600
but still

940
00:33:17,600 --> 00:33:19,120
the architecture style between

941
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:20,640
communication between the base station

942
00:33:20,640 --> 00:33:22,960
and the mobile phone device is

943
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,519
base station still act as a master here

944
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:27,360
so it has a more power about security

945
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:29,440
negotiations like what network to choose

946
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:31,519
or what not so and again this problem

947
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,760
may not be easy to solve

948
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:34,960
but i think

949
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:37,440
still the way we are developing our

950
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:39,760
networks i i believe that the more power

951
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:42,000
also equal power should also be towards

952
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,519
the mobile phone

953
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:46,240
mobile phones as well uh not the higher

954
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:48,080
power with the base station as well this

955
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,519
may solve some of the issues as well

956
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,159
with tmc caches being addressed maybe

957
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:54,080
for example then we have a steelhacker

958
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:55,600
protocol one liabilities that hasn't

959
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,679
been fixed yet and that that that needs

960
00:33:57,679 --> 00:33:59,279
to be addressed to prevent the targeted

961
00:33:59,279 --> 00:34:01,519
tracks of five gmc caches

962
00:34:01,519 --> 00:34:02,799
then we have a lack of ciphering

963
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:04,559
indicator for data traffic especially on

964
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,640
the mobiles we have seen in the past

965
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,560
that in at least older generation until

966
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,399
3g there used to be some mobile phones

967
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,560
from nokia or blackberry they used to

968
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,639
show you these lock symbols for example

969
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,719
so when you make a phone call the phone

970
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,399
the phone used to tell that your current

971
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:20,480
mobile phone call is been encrypted or

972
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:21,359
not

973
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:24,239
however i mean since 4g or 5g we are

974
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:26,399
using more data oriented call you mean

975
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:28,079
your normal calls are going over data

976
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:30,399
network so i believe that even if we use

977
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:32,000
data network we need to have some kind

978
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,320
of indicator of whether the network is

979
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,159
being increased traffic is encrypted or

980
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:37,040
not

981
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:40,800
right now the tgp standard defines that

982
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,800
those ciphering indicators should be

983
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,280
provided per video sessions either via

984
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,599
apis for example so there should be api

985
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,760
for which which gives all this ciphering

986
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:51,918
indicator information to the upper layer

987
00:34:51,918 --> 00:34:54,399
so that the the mobile os can show this

988
00:34:54,399 --> 00:34:56,960
to the user for example for their calls

989
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:59,200
however the standard does not mandate

990
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,200
how to use these apis or ciphering

991
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,839
indicators so there should be a

992
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,800
method to tell that how uh to mandate

993
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:08,880
these apis for example and also when we

994
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,880
look at the current smartphones we have

995
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,480
the 5g phones

996
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,079
still 5g phones

997
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:15,839
do not show this mandatory ciphering

998
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:18,480
indicator at all on our mobile phones

999
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:19,760
either

1000
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:21,839
it has been implemented but it may not

1001
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,160
be enabled or enforced and of course we

1002
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:26,079
know that the sim card also there is a

1003
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,760
bit in the sim card that also allow

1004
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,240
enabling this ciphering indicator so

1005
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:31,839
this has to be coordination between the

1006
00:35:31,839 --> 00:35:33,839
mobile operators and also the

1007
00:35:33,839 --> 00:35:35,599
oems for examples especially the

1008
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:37,520
smartphone oems that they need to

1009
00:35:37,520 --> 00:35:38,880
coordinate with mobile operator and

1010
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:40,240
actually they should push the operator

1011
00:35:40,240 --> 00:35:42,160
to have this feature

1012
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,680
to the user because this will be the

1013
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,839
first level of at least the

1014
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:47,599
the the bottleneck for the mcgee guys

1015
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,680
have to be work so at least they can get

1016
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,359
indicator okay why their call is

1017
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,040
suddenly not being encrypted now so at

1018
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,720
least they get some kind of flight for

1019
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,280
example right this is good to have and

1020
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,359
then why i should give this argument

1021
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:02,320
imagine that now the way we are

1022
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,400
shaming some web server web services for

1023
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:06,400
example if they are not proving https

1024
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,839
people are shaming them hey why don't

1025
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:10,240
you provide https and why your website

1026
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:13,040
is http so same same argument right now

1027
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:14,560
if your network is already supporting

1028
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,400
encryption i mean there is no shame

1029
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:17,920
showing that whether it's encrypted or

1030
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,680
not i mean and then they should support

1031
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,200
at least mobile operator should support

1032
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:23,920
or care about the privacy of mobile user

1033
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,000
then going back to downgrading so it's

1034
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,599
still possible to downgrade to 4g

1035
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:30,400
network again this problem may not be

1036
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,280
easy to solve in the standards but uh

1037
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:34,079
but

1038
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:36,240
not technically difficult uh at the same

1039
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,079
time so maybe

1040
00:36:38,079 --> 00:36:40,320
you know and sadly for users it's

1041
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,480
difficult to remove 2g because if they

1042
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,839
believe that they don't want to support

1043
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:45,520
2g they can just delete from the their

1044
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,440
mobile phone saying that okay i don't

1045
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,760
want my mobile phone to go on 2g and

1046
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,359
this is really contradiction with mobile

1047
00:36:51,359 --> 00:36:52,640
operators saying that mobile operator

1048
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,320
says sometimes that okay fine our

1049
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:57,680
network has recovered 99 of the range to

1050
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:59,440
all over the country for example right

1051
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,839
so so so why don't you also support 5g

1052
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:03,520
only mode for example and this is the

1053
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:05,839
next point basically there is no clear

1054
00:37:05,839 --> 00:37:07,920
guidelines for the oems the choice of

1055
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,079
secure network selection so users should

1056
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,079
get option actually to select the best

1057
00:37:12,079 --> 00:37:14,800
secure network first like 5g not like an

1058
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,200
auto mode again this is like a comfort

1059
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:19,520
for the user that they should not deny

1060
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,520
any network service auto mode is always

1061
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,359
good but assuming that the city which

1062
00:37:23,359 --> 00:37:25,440
you are living in have full 5g coverage

1063
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:27,280
i mean it's it makes sense to enable

1064
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:29,359
your phone for 5g network mode only of

1065
00:37:29,359 --> 00:37:30,720
course and if you are not getting

1066
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,400
coverage of course you will see that

1067
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,280
you're not getting service so user can

1068
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:37,280
change the network selection for example

1069
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:38,800
so at least having this option makes

1070
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:40,320
sense for the user

1071
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,000
and again not a single phone in the

1072
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,240
market we have been compiled among

1073
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:47,280
different vendors 5g users they don't

1074
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:49,599
give you any option to choose 5g only

1075
00:37:49,599 --> 00:37:52,079
mode or at least 5g non-standalone or

1076
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,839
standalone mode so it's complete

1077
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:55,839
variation across the operators you can

1078
00:37:55,839 --> 00:37:57,680
see from iphone 12

1079
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,880
to opporeno oneplus st ui p4t samsung

1080
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:02,160
they have different completely

1081
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:03,599
variations so there is no clear

1082
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:06,400
guidelines from the gsma what the device

1083
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:08,160
vendor should do or implement these

1084
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:10,320
features for example at least also from

1085
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:13,040
from mobile operators as well

1086
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:14,480
and what could be the guidelines for

1087
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,800
operators for the sim c caches again so

1088
00:38:16,800 --> 00:38:18,079
based on our experience with the

1089
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,480
variations of their uh

1090
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,640
network uh configurations especially the

1091
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,520
brand

1092
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,520
uh the goodie was always being

1093
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:28,320
problematic because uh goodie we we if

1094
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,720
you don't really randomize or or freshen

1095
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:33,839
your guti uh as per the standard and if

1096
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,079
it's possible to link the target based

1097
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,079
on the goodie in the traffic i think

1098
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:40,640
there is a problem again so so so the

1099
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,720
operator has to follow verification of

1100
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,560
ram features suggested by the standard

1101
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:46,560
or gsma in enormous b also in the co

1102
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:48,000
network as well

1103
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,400
and continuous monitoring of those rand

1104
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:52,320
security features as well for example

1105
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:54,960
some networks not changing tmc at all

1106
00:38:54,960 --> 00:38:57,280
for 10 days 10 days that's not a good

1107
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,119
sign and then this kind of problem

1108
00:38:59,119 --> 00:39:00,800
should be automatically detected rather

1109
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,200
than somebody uh third-party so there

1110
00:39:03,200 --> 00:39:04,320
has to be some mechanism to

1111
00:39:04,320 --> 00:39:07,200
automatically uh detect those deviations

1112
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,599
from the standard baseline and then this

1113
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:10,960
this should be required and also

1114
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:13,040
mechanism to detect dmc catchers or bad

1115
00:39:13,040 --> 00:39:15,599
devices as per the 3gb standard it could

1116
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:16,800
be good good

1117
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:18,400
feature for the mobile operators that

1118
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,040
they could try to implement as well

1119
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:22,000
to to

1120
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,320
protect the users again fc catches

1121
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,560
for oem again the verification of ram

1122
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,079
security features and that's very

1123
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:29,599
important especially from the best bank

1124
00:39:29,599 --> 00:39:31,520
perspective we have seen in the past the

1125
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:33,760
base band has so much implementation

1126
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,440
issues especially the mandatory feature

1127
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,079
of

1128
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:37,760
rand security

1129
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,839
first of all imei should not be leaking

1130
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:41,760
4g network or it should not be given to

1131
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:43,440
the user before the authentication this

1132
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,040
was our work from 2017 so sorry 16

1133
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:48,800
and also the eia

1134
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,880
algorithm was being accepted even in

1135
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:52,800
non-emergency calls for example this is

1136
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:54,640
completely deviation from the standard

1137
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,240
which was described by binoid there are

1138
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:58,880
various other feats other issues as well

1139
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,240
so there has to be a verification of

1140
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:02,400
such features for uh

1141
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,800
important or critical security

1142
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:06,560
features that has been supported in 5g

1143
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:08,480
as well so there has to be verification

1144
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:10,319
and the mandatory ciphering indicator

1145
00:40:10,319 --> 00:40:11,680
for uh

1146
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,680
all cell network calls and also the data

1147
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:14,880
traffic i mean

1148
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,200
it should be implemented and the vendors

1149
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:19,200
or oem should push the operators in

1150
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:21,200
coordination with to allow these

1151
00:40:21,200 --> 00:40:24,160
features for the mobile users to be

1152
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:26,000
displayed for example because this will

1153
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:29,119
be this could be the clear

1154
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,520
one of the feature for the mobile

1155
00:40:31,520 --> 00:40:32,880
operators to see that whether the mcc

1156
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,960
catcher is being not giving encryption

1157
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:36,560
or at least if

1158
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:38,480
it's being connected for example

1159
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,480
an option to choose the best secure

1160
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:42,319
network it should be there and i hope

1161
00:40:42,319 --> 00:40:44,720
that the oem should allow these features

1162
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:46,640
for mobile phone now if you look at the

1163
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,040
oip 401 if you enable the developer mode

1164
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,720
on your mobile phone actually it gives

1165
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:53,200
you an extra option for user it's saying

1166
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,520
that you can choose auto 5g mode or

1167
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,960
non-standalone or standalone

1168
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,440
non-standalone mode but i mean having

1169
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,119
either standalone mode is also been

1170
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:03,040
helpful for the user to to stick to the

1171
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:04,560
best secure network

1172
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,720
available so far so what are the

1173
00:41:06,720 --> 00:41:08,560
takeaways that uh definitely ran

1174
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,800
security is improved in 5g definitely

1175
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,640
but however the post deployment security

1176
00:41:12,640 --> 00:41:14,720
is always differing from the mandatory

1177
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,400
baseline

1178
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:17,599
and yes

1179
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:19,839
emc capture attack is possible both in

1180
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:22,000
5g non-standalone standalone networks

1181
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,880
but this mcc attack is targeted it's not

1182
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,880
like a mask level you can identify every

1183
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:28,880
user in the area but again once you know

1184
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:31,440
your targets targeted track is possible

1185
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:33,440
before grant security is almost similar

1186
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:36,079
what we have in 5g standalone currently

1187
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,240
deployed 90 percent of mobile networks

1188
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,119
in all over the world especially 5g so

1189
00:41:41,119 --> 00:41:43,280
this gives false sense of 5g security

1190
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,920
because it's a 5g network and that

1191
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,400
doesn't really says 5g is non-standalone

1192
00:41:48,400 --> 00:41:50,640
so it's basically 5g non-standalone mode

1193
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:52,960
network which is similar as a 4g so it's

1194
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:54,800
not a same security level

1195
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,079
we still have someone fixed radio

1196
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:57,680
protocols that hasn't been addressed in

1197
00:41:57,680 --> 00:41:59,520
5g security yet at all that allows

1198
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:00,960
targeted attacks especially a car

1199
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:02,480
attached protocols

1200
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:03,920
suki decoding still allows a

1201
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,760
notification of roaming subscriber that

1202
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:08,079
gives some hint right and for end users

1203
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:09,599
there is no control over choosing the

1204
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:11,040
most secure network so there is a

1205
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:12,240
variation there has to be some

1206
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:14,400
guidelines for the vendors and no

1207
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:16,640
security indicators for connected uh

1208
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:19,040
network either for example for a call or

1209
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,200
date or traffic so i believe that since

1210
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:24,000
5g we are more data oriented traffic

1211
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,680
there should be indication as well when

1212
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,000
you using 5g data

1213
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,599
more most of the time that your data

1214
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,200
traffic is being secured of course we

1215
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,040
have application level security but it

1216
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:34,720
makes sense to have a layered security

1217
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:36,640
and we should know that what kind of

1218
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,720
security at each layer for example right

1219
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,480
this could be a good indicator

1220
00:42:40,480 --> 00:42:42,640
and also lack of enforcement of security

1221
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:44,319
features in operational networks allow

1222
00:42:44,319 --> 00:42:46,960
tracking of five users users uh easily

1223
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:48,560
and that we have seen in 5g

1224
00:42:48,560 --> 00:42:50,160
non-standalone network that we have been

1225
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,560
analyzed uh most of the operators are

1226
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,040
actually lacking some mandatory features

1227
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,839
uh to be enabled there and we suggest

1228
00:42:57,839 --> 00:42:59,839
that we need a continuous or proactive

1229
00:42:59,839 --> 00:43:01,760
security pointing of these 5g random

1230
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:04,079
configurations going in the future

1231
00:43:04,079 --> 00:43:06,880
and there is a scope for development so

1232
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,960
definitely yes we are improving uh but

1233
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,880
at the same time it's still possible to

1234
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:13,119
do some sequester attack in 5g

1235
00:43:13,119 --> 00:43:15,280
non-standalone and standard standalone

1236
00:43:15,280 --> 00:43:16,560
networks

1237
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:19,680
so thank you for listening and

1238
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:21,839
we hope to convey

1239
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:22,800
our

1240
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,760
summary

1241
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:25,280
if you have any questions feel free to

1242
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:27,680
drop us email or we can have a question

1243
00:43:27,680 --> 00:43:29,440
and answer in the chat session thank you

1244
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:32,599
