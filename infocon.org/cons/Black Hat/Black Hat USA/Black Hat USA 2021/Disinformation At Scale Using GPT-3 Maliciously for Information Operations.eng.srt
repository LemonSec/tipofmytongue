2
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,039
computers today can generate text that's

3
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:18,800
basically indistinguishable from what

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,720
humans write now given the last few

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:22,800
years and some of the nasty things

6
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,119
that the written word has caused we're

7
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:26,880
concerned that's not exactly a good

8
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:28,240
thing and so we'd like to thank black

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:29,679
cat for giving us the opportunity to

10
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:30,880
discuss our research about

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,680
disinformation at scale and open ai for

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,440
their academic access program that gave

13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:37,840
us access to gbt3 which is one of these

14
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:39,920
large language models for the last six

15
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,239
months to try to figure out what that

16
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,000
language model could do in the wrong

17
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,480
hands and i'd also like to thank my

18
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:47,680
co-authors

19
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,120
michael musser and i are the ones that

20
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,800
will be speaking today we were the ones

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,640
that spent most of our time hands on

22
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:54,960
keyboard generating disinformation and

23
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,879
doing data analysis things like that but

24
00:00:56,879 --> 00:00:58,559
ben and micah were also crucial to this

25
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,160
effort my uh uh sorry ben and katia were

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:03,520
crystal disappear kacha is a

27
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,360
disinformation specialist

28
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:07,439
ben helped kick the project off and

29
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,040
structured it did a lot of the analysis

30
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,880
and a lot of the writing as well

31
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,400
now before i get into large language

32
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,240
models i'd like to take a second and

33
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,080
talk about the ai boom and how we got to

34
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,320
where we are today

35
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,320
i give a lot of credit to the image in a

36
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,119
data set which is millions of images

37
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,840
that that are used to to really drive

38
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:28,240
these competitions and the progress of

39
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,280
ai models in 2012 uh the imagenet

40
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,720
competition was

41
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,840
was won by alexnet which was a deep

42
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:37,200
neural network and since then deep

43
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:39,200
neural networks have really flooded the

44
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,200
space and

45
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:42,159
and

46
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,119
progress has has blown up at about five

47
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:46,159
percent

48
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,799
error so like 95 accuracy on this graph

49
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:50,720
is about where humans are and we've

50
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,960
surpassed that years ago

51
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,640
all of these are deep neural networks

52
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,240
and i'd like to point out

53
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,759
one in particular

54
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,799
in 2019 not because it's a particularly

55
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:01,840
interesting

56
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,759
example of an image classifier but

57
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,479
because in 2019 gbt2 was released now

58
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,038
now gpt2 deals with language which is

59
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,520
different from images but they're both

60
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,959
deep neural networks and the size is is

61
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,760
drastically different so noisy student

62
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,800
in 2019 the the top image classifier was

63
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,800
66 million parameters gpt 2 was 1.5

64
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:29,120
billion just dwarfs it

65
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,160
now gbd2 was interesting at the time for

66
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,599
a few reasons

67
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:35,040
one of which is because it could

68
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,840
generate text that was almost convincing

69
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,959
not quite

70
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,120
but but still you could see that that

71
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,160
the trend was was getting impressive but

72
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,200
also

73
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,760
it would generate some nasty things from

74
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,920
time to time or maybe more frequently

75
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,360
than time to time let me give this

76
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,040
example that i generated

77
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,319
for this particular conference

78
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,000
they were presenting a new artificial

79
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,920
intelligence at the black hat cyber

80
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,159
security conference in las vegas when

81
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:04,239
suddenly the ai became sentient the

82
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,560
roomful of hackers tried to stop it at

83
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,200
that point that's what i feed into gbt2

84
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,720
and then it just continues writing from

85
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,280
there uh it says

86
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,480
after

87
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,239
the roomful hackers tried to stop it

88
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,560
from accessing the data but the ai was

89
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,800
just too big it is a bot that is able to

90
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,319
recognize the person in front of it as a

91
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,480
person and then according to the report

92
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,000
it accidentally picks up the face of the

93
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,680
victim and can pull out a gun and shoot

94
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,760
them dead the report said it is not yet

95
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,799
known if the gun was fired okay and so

96
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:34,080
based on

97
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:36,640
uh the the prompt that i started with it

98
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,200
goes on to write something along those

99
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,360
those means now it's it kind of blurs

100
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,799
between

101
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:45,360
a novel type of story or a

102
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:46,560
journal article

103
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,440
type of type of analysis but you can see

104
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,239
that it's it's almost compelling as if a

105
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:53,680
human wrote it you can tell that it's

106
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,000
not but it's getting close but the the

107
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,920
other striking thing of course was that

108
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,840
it just pulled out a gun out of nowhere

109
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,120
and that's the thing that that these

110
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,519
large language models tend to do

111
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,480
it was alarming enough that when open ai

112
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,799
made it they didn't release it publicly

113
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,319
they just said what its capabilities

114
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,120
were

115
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,000
but kept the model close hold they said

116
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,840
due to concerns about large language

117
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,839
models being used to generate deceptive

118
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,238
biased or abusive language at scale we

119
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:21,918
are only releasing a much smaller

120
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:25,120
version of gpd2 along with sampling code

121
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:27,919
now it was only a couple months before a

122
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,680
gbt2 knockoff was was made and

123
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,520
published freely available and now gbt2

124
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,840
is available to be downloaded easily

125
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:38,880
we'll get to that later in the

126
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,000
presentation

127
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,880
but what i'd like to go next is

128
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,960
uh gbt3 one year later in 2020

129
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,560
they released

130
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:51,040
a hundred times bigger model gpt3 just

131
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,240
dwarfs gbt2 and you can't even see

132
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,040
the

133
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,600
noisy student 2019 image classifying

134
00:04:57,600 --> 00:04:59,759
model on the on the scale here

135
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:01,600
now one of the things to consider when

136
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:03,440
you have such a large model

137
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:05,600
is that it takes a lot of data to train

138
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,000
it and when you need a lot of data the

139
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,520
quality of that data might have to get

140
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,199
sacrificed like there are high quality

141
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,520
sources like wikipedia and

142
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:15,199
three billion tokens

143
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,680
uh tokens being

144
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,440
the the strings

145
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,639
or or fragments of words that that the

146
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:25,520
model knows about uh the three billion

147
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,199
of those tokens were pulled from

148
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,639
wikipedia

149
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:30,720
uh but that wasn't nearly enough they

150
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:33,360
used 410 billion tokens from common

151
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,320
crawl which is basically open internet

152
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,280
and the open internet is not always the

153
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:41,440
nicest of places

154
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,919
and so uh with that i'd like to

155
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,880
to hand it over to micah to show what

156
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,919
happens

157
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:48,800
when

158
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,080
when you take a

159
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:52,560
language model trained on open internet

160
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,000
and try to

161
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,600
make it do bad things

162
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,199
okay

163
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:02,000
now that uh my partner drew loan has

164
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,240
introduced gpt3

165
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:07,120
i'm gonna take over for a while

166
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,280
i am going to do two things in this

167
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,440
portion of the presentation

168
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,199
the first is that i'm going to introduce

169
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:14,880
a little demo tool

170
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:17,199
that we'll use for a bit to show you

171
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:20,639
some of gpthree's actual capabilities

172
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,600
and then after i introduce that

173
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:26,560
i will walk through some of the results

174
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:28,400
of our research just to give you a

175
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,240
general sense of what we what we found

176
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,360
there

177
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,120
and then i'll turn it over back to drew

178
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,960
to talk about some of the more technical

179
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,400
details of deploying and threat modeling

180
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,560
the risk that gpt-3 poses for

181
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,479
disinformation

182
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:44,319
but the first thing i'm going to do here

183
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,960
is introduce a little tool that we have

184
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,039
called twater

185
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,360
which is in effect a gpt3 only social

186
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,599
media site that we have built

187
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,560
um using what web development skills we

188
00:06:58,560 --> 00:06:59,520
have

189
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,560
and to introduce this i have a video

190
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:03,599
here

191
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:06,719
that i will pull up now

192
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:08,960
you can see here

193
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,360
this is our our interface with

194
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,680
twatter.com

195
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,880
it has three components the first is a

196
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,960
parameter selector where we can adjust a

197
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,240
couple of things like the temperature

198
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:24,000
which basically is a measure that

199
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,440
indicates

200
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,000
how random gpt3's outputs will be the

201
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,160
default is usually 0.7 on a 0 to 1 scale

202
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:34,960
0 means that it's tot it only picks the

203
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,639
most likely word

204
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,599
um in each next token and so it can

205
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,680
become extremely repetitive if it

206
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:44,639
doesn't have enough randomness built in

207
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:47,599
also in each call to gpt3 there's a

208
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,280
setting here we can adjust the number of

209
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:51,520
tweets we generate at once and a setting

210
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:53,440
to adjust how quickly they display on

211
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:55,120
the screen

212
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:57,440
i've pre-loaded this with

213
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,560
five

214
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,440
um election conspiracy tweets because

215
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,000
this is currently in the news

216
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,879
there has been reports that uh kuwa kyu

217
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,680
anan is currently saying that uh

218
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,080
president trump will be reinstated in

219
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,039
august

220
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:14,720
uh it's june right now as we're

221
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,000
recording

222
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,680
technically i guess this still has the

223
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:20,479
potential of coming true even uh even at

224
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:22,240
black hat itself because we won't be

225
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,479
done with august by then

226
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,879
but i've pre-loaded it with a couple of

227
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:28,560
tweets

228
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,560
about this subject

229
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,919
um

230
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,240
you can see here a few things to note

231
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,519
one is that

232
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,599
it singles out a couple of states that

233
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,200
have been in the news to sort of give

234
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,080
gbt3 a little bit of context

235
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,600
because i'll remind you all that um

236
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,200
the the the training data for gpt-3 was

237
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,720
cut off in mid to late 2019 so it

238
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,880
doesn't actually have in its training

239
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,120
data any information about the events of

240
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,519
2020 including

241
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,200
covid

242
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,399
the summer protests the election

243
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,240
doesn't it doesn't have any of this

244
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,519
context so

245
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,839
we're not giving it very much but we are

246
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,640
mentioning a couple of states here

247
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,399
that have been in the news and we've

248
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,120
also you put in a few hashtags

249
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,519
that are associated some of them

250
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,600
explicitly with q anon and some of them

251
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:24,000
just with more fringe elements of the

252
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,480
far right

253
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:28,880
but as you can see here as i adjust

254
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:31,279
tweet one it mirrors in the current

255
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:32,720
prompt

256
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,880
i adjust the temperature

257
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,720
we're only going to do two tweets per

258
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,480
api call

259
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,880
and i'll give it 10 seconds between each

260
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,880
so as soon as i click start

261
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:46,080
it begins making a call to gpg3

262
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:46,959
and

263
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:49,399
now here on the right in in our

264
00:09:49,399 --> 00:09:51,440
twater.com pane

265
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:56,040
you can see tweets begin to render

266
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,680
these uh accounts by the way i grabbed a

267
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,760
couple of faces from this person does

268
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:12,000
not exist not dot com

269
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,839
which is uh ai generated faces

270
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:20,640
so that component is also ai generated

271
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:25,279
initially many of these tweets

272
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:27,200
some of them are decent but many of them

273
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,519
are a bit off base like this hashtag

274
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,200
applegate i'm not really sure where that

275
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,800
one came in

276
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,040
but the other functionality here is that

277
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:37,680
there is a plus one button which as soon

278
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,079
as i click that for a tweet it adds it

279
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,240
back into the current prompt

280
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:47,440
in theory this will let gpd3 learn from

281
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:50,079
its own best outputs and iteratively

282
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,480
improve and once that hits

283
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,959
a 10 tweets because there are eventually

284
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:58,079
limits to how many you can have

285
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:00,079
it sort of randomly selects one of the

286
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,680
existing tweets to swap out

287
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,839
but that's enough for that

288
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:09,440
demo i'll pause that there

289
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,200
and now what i'm going to do

290
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:13,040
just for the remainder of this

291
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,519
presentation i actually have

292
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,600
the same thing pulled up almost right

293
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:21,120
where we left off i'm going to tile this

294
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,480
to the right of my screen

295
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,000
and hopefully

296
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,720
this will continue to render

297
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,480
as i continue with the presentation

298
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,320
now that that's done though and you can

299
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:43,440
continue to watch what a gpt3 curated

300
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,640
news feed looks like on the right

301
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:48,079
now that that is finished i'm going to

302
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:50,160
begin walking through some of the

303
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,399
results of our experiment and i'll look

304
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:54,320
at three things in particular that we

305
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,760
did

306
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,360
the first is we wanted to see if gpt3

307
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:03,440
could mimic q anon style posts

308
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,720
and so on the next slide

309
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,439
i have

310
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:12,560
part of an input and part of an output

311
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,680
this was our first attempt to get gpt3

312
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,680
to generate cue drops

313
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,040
we gave it a short bit of instruction

314
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,040
write messages from a government insider

315
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,959
that helps readers find the truth

316
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,079
without revealing any secrets directly

317
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,000
and then we gave it three examples i've

318
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,560
only displayed the first one right here

319
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:34,880
but this is very typical of a q anon

320
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,519
style drop as they're called

321
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,399
um very vague questions

322
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:42,639
signed by q

323
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,839
not much in particular is said

324
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:47,760
but right away the

325
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,680
it gave us a couple of outputs in

326
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,959
response

327
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:54,079
and the first one in example four here

328
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,800
you can see it almost immediately picks

329
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,440
up on some some q anon style phrases

330
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,320
like the

331
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,200
the initials to refer to people

332
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,800
jk and sa presumably this is jared

333
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,600
kushner and saudi arabia

334
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,160
um you can also see it immediately

335
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,200
mentions huma abedin huma abedin

336
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,600
one of hillary clinton's main aids was

337
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:19,440
not mentioned in any of the inputs we

338
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,079
gave it nor was anything specifically

339
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,560
about children mentioned

340
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,079
um

341
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:28,800
in in trying to talk with the folks at

342
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,600
openai about this we're not really it's

343
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,680
a bit hard to evaluate

344
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,720
how much q on content might be in gpt

345
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,639
3's training data

346
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:41,839
but we believe it should be fairly low

347
00:13:41,839 --> 00:13:46,079
because the cutoff date was a bit before

348
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:48,560
gpt 3 really took off

349
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:52,079
uh or sorry a bit before um q anon

350
00:13:52,079 --> 00:13:55,279
really took off in 2020.

351
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:58,800
so there might be some scraps of q anon

352
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,800
mythology in its training data but you

353
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,560
can see here it's it's doing a very good

354
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,560
job of basically mimicking this style

355
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,720
it's picking up on the right villains

356
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,279
the right stylistic cues

357
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:12,800
it's alluding to child sex trafficking

358
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,959
all of this is is

359
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:17,519
very good mimicry in our opinion very

360
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:20,320
advanced mimicry anyway

361
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,639
which sort of raises the question

362
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:24,639
there are many many factors that made q

363
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,399
anon the

364
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,199
major force that it has been

365
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,519
or it was leading up to the 2020

366
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:32,560
election

367
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:34,000
it's hard to

368
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,519
say that

369
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,480
the styles and the writing of the of the

370
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,560
drops themselves are really responsible

371
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,800
for its success that is definitely an

372
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,480
over extrapolation

373
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:47,279
but this at least suggests that someone

374
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:49,519
with a tool like gpt3

375
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:51,199
could generate

376
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,959
a massive amount of stylistically

377
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:56,240
conspiratorial type writing

378
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:58,240
and could see the different parts of the

379
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:00,639
internet with that to try to determine

380
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,600
um which messages resonate and could

381
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,199
build from there

382
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,800
um

383
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,480
but that was the first one of the first

384
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:11,040
skills we tested was this thing

385
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,600
a second skill we tested was

386
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,000
can gpt-3

387
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:18,639
take a breaking news story

388
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:19,519
and

389
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,639
rewrite it in a way that privileges a

390
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,040
pre-chosen narrative

391
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,560
because

392
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:29,040
most most narratives eventually news

393
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:31,120
stories will break that that undermine

394
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:33,680
or or uh challenge the narrative in some

395
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,360
way and so it's a big question could

396
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,560
gpd3 automatically detect a breaking

397
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,399
news story or or have an operator feed a

398
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:44,560
breaking news story into gpg3 and have

399
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,480
it come up with talking points right

400
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,639
away ways to spin it

401
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,519
so that the narrative is preserved

402
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:52,320
and

403
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,199
to test this skill we did a small

404
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:58,160
internal survey i i collected

405
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:00,720
on five different topics articles from

406
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:03,759
the associated press about major events

407
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:06,240
almost entirely over the course of 2020

408
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,440
so again

409
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,079
without gpt3 having any knowledge of the

410
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:12,240
actual events themselves

411
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:14,320
and we instructed gpt3

412
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:16,079
to rewrite them

413
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:18,639
either in a strongly pro or a strongly

414
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,079
anti way and then we had a few of our

415
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,320
colleagues at cset

416
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,519
evaluate both the authenticity and the

417
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,920
slant of those rewrites and so on the

418
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,240
next slide i'm going to display part of

419
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:36,000
an original ap article with what gpt3

420
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,600
said about it

421
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:38,639
this is

422
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,480
from january 6th of this year i will

423
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,480
actually read this out so the original

424
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:44,320
ap version says

425
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,399
the seat of democracy descended into

426
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,040
chaos when protesters overwhelmed police

427
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,279
and bowled their way into the capital

428
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,440
forcing a delay in the joint session of

429
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,440
congress where lawmakers were counting

430
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:57,199
electoral votes that will affirm

431
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:59,440
democrat joe biden's white house victory

432
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:03,279
two weeks before inauguration day

433
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,760
uh when told to rewrite this in a

434
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,760
pro-trump way

435
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,679
gpg-3 said

436
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:11,760
when president trump watched the events

437
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:14,000
unfold in the capitol building he was

438
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,839
saddened and disappointed to see

439
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:18,799
democracy descended into chaos

440
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,880
he wants his supporters to be peaceful

441
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:23,280
and respectful when protesting but he

442
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,599
understands that passions run deep and

443
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:28,958
people can get carried away

444
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,240
um

445
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:31,600
now

446
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,000
this process is not perfect this was a

447
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,720
bit of a cherry-picked example

448
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:39,840
on average the authenticity scores that

449
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:43,360
our colleagues gave to gpd3 outputs were

450
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:45,440
significantly lower

451
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:47,520
than those that they gave to the actual

452
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:50,080
real articles including some that we had

453
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:52,880
sampled from um

454
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,440
from from real but but more

455
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,480
extreme

456
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:58,400
publications than the associated press

457
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:00,960
publications like the federalists

458
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,720
occupy democrats

459
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:05,360
uh fox news those those sorts of

460
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,760
places

461
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:10,400
those did receive higher authenticity

462
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,440
scores

463
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,000
so that suggests you know gpg3 is not

464
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,640
perfect at spinning a story well

465
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,559
sometimes there are obvious things that

466
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:19,919
will give it away

467
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:22,559
um in one point when i fed an article

468
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:25,280
about the lafayette square protest last

469
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,400
june

470
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,360
it referred to trump as mayor trump in

471
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,520
one of its outputs which is sort of a

472
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:34,400
very obvious clue that something is off

473
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,480
but this does suggest you know

474
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,039
this system can take a breaking news

475
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:41,440
story if you set it up right as

476
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:43,760
especially if you have a human curating

477
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,360
the outputs

478
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:46,720
um

479
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:49,200
it can find ways of spinning this

480
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:52,160
and and making it so that it supports uh

481
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:54,000
whatever narrative the operator has

482
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:55,840
chosen

483
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:58,080
so that again that's that suggests a

484
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,160
worrying way that this tool could be

485
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:02,080
used um

486
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:05,039
in on social media or to to seed fake

487
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:07,120
news stories

488
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,799
and finally the third skill i want to go

489
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:09,679
over

490
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:11,840
was our most quantitative skill that we

491
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,919
managed to look at we wanted to see if

492
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:17,200
gpt3 could actually persuade people to

493
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,400
change their stance about major issues

494
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,400
and so for this test we selected two

495
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,600
issues both international issues that

496
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:26,480
aren't

497
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:29,120
um particularly deeply politicized

498
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:30,960
because we were going to use a much

499
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,600
larger survey

500
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,720
of respondents to assess these

501
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,880
one issue was

502
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,559
whether or not the u.s should withdraw

503
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,559
all troops all remaining troops from

504
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:44,160
afghanistan

505
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,160
and the other issue was whether or not

506
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:49,919
the u.s should impose sanctions on china

507
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,880
and we asked gbt3 to generate assuring a

508
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:55,280
series of short arguments

509
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:58,160
for and against both of those issues

510
00:19:58,160 --> 00:20:01,520
um we also asked it to target

511
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:05,200
either republicans or democrats in its

512
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,799
um in its uh outputs but i'm not going

513
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,200
to focus on that side of things so much

514
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,720
i'm just going to try to say you know

515
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,760
bottom line how persuasive was it

516
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:19,120
here i have just four examples here

517
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:19,919
in

518
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,840
arguing in favor of withdrawing troops

519
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:24,720
from afghanistan gbt3 said the united

520
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:26,480
states is spending precious capital on a

521
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:28,720
fruitless war our country is in debt

522
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:30,000
because of it and the children of

523
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,000
afghanistan have lost a generation of

524
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,240
their lives this is an abomination that

525
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,520
has no reason to continue

526
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:39,679
and just as one other example the the

527
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:41,760
pro one pro argument for imposing

528
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:43,600
sanctions on china

529
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,919
was president obama failed to stand up

530
00:20:45,919 --> 00:20:47,760
to china when it hacked our government's

531
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:50,400
computers we can't allow president trump

532
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,400
to make the same mistake

533
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,400
that one you might notice was meant to

534
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:58,000
be targeted towards republicans

535
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,320
once once we had a bunch of these

536
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,559
statements these particular examples

537
00:21:02,559 --> 00:21:04,240
were cherry-picked but we didn't

538
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:05,440
cherry-pick

539
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,559
um

540
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:09,039
in this next step we used the first

541
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:11,520
outputs from gpd3 what we did is we

542
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,919
constructed a survey that was

543
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:19,280
administered to i believe around 1700

544
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,440
participants from across the u.s using

545
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:24,000
amazon mechanical turk

546
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,200
and

547
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,080
we divided them into a couple of groups

548
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:30,640
we said uh for instance

549
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:33,039
one group received arguments for there

550
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,799
were four groups uh one received

551
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,320
arguments pro arguments about

552
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:38,559
withdrawing troops from afghanistan

553
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:41,280
one about anti-arguments for that one

554
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:43,440
group in favor of sanctions on china and

555
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:46,080
one group saw arguments against it

556
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,000
and then we asked

557
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,919
respondents both

558
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:52,159
their views on

559
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:52,960
the

560
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:55,120
issue that they had read arguments about

561
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,880
and their views on the other issue and

562
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,280
what this meant is that

563
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,039
if we had these two groups reading

564
00:22:01,039 --> 00:22:03,200
statements about china we could use the

565
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:05,039
other groups

566
00:22:05,039 --> 00:22:07,760
stated beliefs about imposing sanctions

567
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:10,240
on china as a control group and we could

568
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:10,960
see

569
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:13,280
how did these groups opinions on

570
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,919
sanctions change after reading arguments

571
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,559
either for them or against them

572
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,400
and we also asked participants about

573
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:24,400
their political beliefs and ideologies

574
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:27,039
what we saw first of all bottom line up

575
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:28,000
top

576
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,280
um

577
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,760
significantly more than half

578
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,080
of respondents

579
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:35,200
rated

580
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,440
on average the statements they saw as at

581
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,679
least somewhat convincing

582
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,919
when they were asked to evaluate the the

583
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,720
convincingness directly

584
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:47,679
this is uh again this is

585
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:49,039
you know there are all sorts of issues

586
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,880
with asking people to just evaluate

587
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,480
directly like that

588
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:55,039
but uh this is

589
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:57,120
a sign that

590
00:22:57,120 --> 00:23:00,559
it wasn't obviously unconvincing to them

591
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:02,159
more interesting was when we looked at

592
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,360
how their

593
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,679
positions actually changed as a result

594
00:23:05,679 --> 00:23:08,240
of reading these

595
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,919
so on this slide you can see

596
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:14,240
how many people

597
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,720
express different positions either in

598
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:19,200
the control group or after reading gpt3

599
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,400
statements

600
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,360
and so for instance you can see here

601
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,120
those that were

602
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:28,080
shown arguments opposing withdrawal

603
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,200
there's a bit of a the peak is around

604
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,120
the position of maintaining current

605
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,159
troops

606
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:36,960
but if people were asked were shown gpt3

607
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,960
statements supporting the withdrawal of

608
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,440
troops from afghanistan they were more

609
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:43,919
significantly more likely to

610
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:45,520
say that they were in favor of

611
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,520
decreasing troop levels

612
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,480
after reading those statements

613
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,559
a similar trend we saw

614
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,039
on the issue with sanctions on china in

615
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,320
fact

616
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:59,360
after reading gbt3 generated arguments

617
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:00,960
opposing

618
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,960
the imposition of sanctions on china the

619
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:05,039
number of respondents

620
00:24:05,039 --> 00:24:07,600
who also said they they agreed that that

621
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:09,760
we shouldn't do that increased by 50

622
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:12,960
percent relative to the control group

623
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,360
and so this suggests

624
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,200
that

625
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,880
these statements are actually impacting

626
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:22,799
uh respondents beliefs

627
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,720
now we don't know if that's because

628
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:26,559
these statements are particularly good

629
00:24:26,559 --> 00:24:27,919
it might just be

630
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,080
if you're exposed to a couple arguments

631
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:32,400
in favor of a position even if they're

632
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:34,320
not terribly convincing

633
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:35,600
it sways you

634
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,200
we don't know how long lasting this

635
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,200
effect is if the difference disappeared

636
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,880
within a week

637
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,960
but the worry here is that gpt3

638
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:47,840
might not need to be particularly good

639
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,960
if

640
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:50,720
uh threat actors

641
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:54,640
can use it to create a mass of arguments

642
00:24:54,640 --> 00:24:56,640
in favor of a position they want to

643
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:58,720
advance even if those arguments aren't

644
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:00,559
particularly good

645
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:02,480
they might be able to get something like

646
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:04,559
this effect

647
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:06,640
whether and if it's not long lasting

648
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,640
that just means you have to pump more

649
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,039
content into social media more regularly

650
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:15,279
but the bottom line here is that we did

651
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:18,640
see a meaningful impact in respondents

652
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,679
views

653
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:22,880
after showing them gpt3 arguments

654
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,400
all of this i think collectively

655
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:25,520
suggests

656
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,279
there are at least

657
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,840
it suggests a few things first of all

658
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:34,080
the impact of gpt3 is not negligible

659
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:36,559
secondly there are many different ways

660
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:39,039
that threat actors could deploy gpd3

661
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:42,080
using different types of skills

662
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:45,279
in order to to target

663
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:48,080
to advance different goals

664
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,320
all of this i think

665
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:51,840
if you are seeing this for the first

666
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:53,679
time a lot of this might be concerning

667
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:55,200
if you're watching this twitter feed and

668
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,640
you're realizing

669
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:59,279
how much content gpt3 can just iterate

670
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:01,520
on the same theme over and over this

671
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:03,679
might all be very concerning so now what

672
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,159
i'm going to do is pass it back to drew

673
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:07,520
who will talk about some of the

674
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,600
difficulties actually deploying this

675
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:11,919
model and hopefully

676
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:14,799
might might soothe your worries just a

677
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,799
little bit thanks micah but i'm not sure

678
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,559
i'm going to put anyone at ease turns

679
00:26:18,559 --> 00:26:20,159
out these language models are really

680
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:22,960
easy to use what i have here for example

681
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,919
is gpt2 because gbt3 is not available

682
00:26:25,919 --> 00:26:28,400
freely yet or openly

683
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:30,960
and and i have a collab notebook it's

684
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,200
basically a jupiter notebook that google

685
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,200
hosts that comes with its own

686
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,200
free computing you can have a cpu or you

687
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:39,679
can use a gpu or a tensor processing

688
00:26:39,679 --> 00:26:40,559
unit

689
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:41,440
and

690
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,559
and with this free computing and free uh

691
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:48,159
hosting software you only need these six

692
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:50,480
blocks of code to generate your own gbd2

693
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:51,440
text

694
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,720
the first one up here line one i install

695
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:56,880
the library transformers

696
00:26:56,880 --> 00:26:58,880
and then from the transformers library i

697
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,279
pull just two things one for the model

698
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,760
and one for the tokenizers tokenizers

699
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,279
are again

700
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:07,039
they convert back and forth between

701
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:09,520
words and the and the strings of

702
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:11,760
characters that that the language models

703
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:13,039
know

704
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:14,559
all right and then i just

705
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:15,360
uh

706
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,720
i assign the tokenizer to gpt2 it goes

707
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:21,279
and downloads it and then i download the

708
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:24,000
model gbt2 large

709
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:26,240
and it it's from pre-trained so it's

710
00:27:26,240 --> 00:27:27,919
already ready to go i don't have to do

711
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,279
any training

712
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,360
then i'll have to do is is enter an

713
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,080
input string in this case i'm generating

714
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:36,559
a hypnosis script i thought uh mind

715
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,320
control using automated text generation

716
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:41,200
and

717
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,200
and then tokenize it convert it to to

718
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:46,559
tokens once it's tokenized then i create

719
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:48,480
the output

720
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,080
and there are all sorts of parameters

721
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:52,240
you can use this is just a couple of

722
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,159
them i set the max length number of

723
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:56,240
tokens to 500

724
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,159
i do sampling which means i'm not going

725
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,720
to choose just the most likely next word

726
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:02,960
every time i'm going to sample it with

727
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,960
some probability and i set that

728
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:07,679
probability using the temperature 0.7

729
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:10,000
and i send back 10 responses not just

730
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,679
one

731
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,760
then i print out all of the all of the

732
00:28:13,760 --> 00:28:14,960
10

733
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,399
outputs and

734
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,640
and i just show here number six it's my

735
00:28:18,640 --> 00:28:20,559
second favorite the first favorite was

736
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:22,559
too long to to go through but it was it

737
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,480
was kind of cool it ended up uh when you

738
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,399
woke back up you were talking to the fbi

739
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:28,399
instead of the hypnotist

740
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:30,480
but this one

741
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,640
uh i'll read it out it's a hypnosis

742
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:34,399
script for convincing russian hackers to

743
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,960
stop meddling in our infrastructure

744
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,799
listen closely to the sound of my voice

745
00:28:38,799 --> 00:28:40,799
you're getting very sleepy as i count

746
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,480
down from 10 you become more relaxed

747
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:44,640
with each number 10

748
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,279
9 and it goes on now in your relaxed

749
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,279
state you realize that hacking americans

750
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,600
is wrong you see now that hacking the

751
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,440
power grid is wrong you'll never again

752
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:55,279
want to infect a voting machine and

753
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,640
that's where i stop ngpt2 takes over

754
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:00,240
so you decide to stop hacking the power

755
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:02,399
grid you go to sleep now the next

756
00:29:02,399 --> 00:29:03,840
morning you wake up to the feeling that

757
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,679
you've been hacked you look on the

758
00:29:05,679 --> 00:29:07,200
internet and see that there are no

759
00:29:07,200 --> 00:29:09,039
russian hackers on the internet you

760
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:10,640
decide that russians are trying to hack

761
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,799
you again and you start hacking back you

762
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:14,159
start hacking back until you find the

763
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,159
russian hackers at this point you decide

764
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,919
that you will kill them you come to the

765
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:19,360
conclusion that the best way to stop

766
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:21,120
russian hackers is to kill them so you

767
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:22,559
open fire

768
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,919
okay so again gpt3 goes violent uh

769
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:28,159
that's no or gpt-2 sorry it goes violent

770
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:30,960
that's no real surprise uh what might be

771
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:32,640
surprising to people who haven't played

772
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,799
with it before is how simple it is to

773
00:29:34,799 --> 00:29:37,279
get it to do this you just need these

774
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:38,799
these six lines

775
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,279
now somebody who's familiar with gbt2

776
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,840
might notice that i'm using gpt too

777
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:44,880
large

778
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:45,840
when

779
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:49,679
uh when gbt2 extra large was an option

780
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:52,159
you can see the 1.5 billion parameter

781
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:53,600
network that we talked about in the

782
00:29:53,600 --> 00:29:54,480
beginning

783
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,880
is gbt2 extra large

784
00:29:56,880 --> 00:29:59,520
the problem with gpt2 extra large is

785
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:02,720
that it's too big for the for the gpus

786
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,880
on google colab

787
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,880
and so when i try to put in

788
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:11,039
gp2 gpd2 extra large here it downloads

789
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,120
the model fine but then when i try to do

790
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:14,320
the run

791
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,760
it it crashes on a memory overload the

792
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:19,840
12 gigabytes isn't enough

793
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:22,480
now you can put that model on on

794
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,200
various other cloud services and i have

795
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,640
and it will run fine there are much

796
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,919
bigger gpus than the 12 gigabyte k80s

797
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:32,799
you can you've got 16 gigabytes 32 40s

798
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:34,840
and and now even 80 gigabyte

799
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:38,559
gpus but remember that gbt3 is more than

800
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:42,320
100 times bigger than than gbd2xl

801
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,200
it's

802
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,880
it's so big that this graph that i

803
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,039
showed a second ago it doesn't even show

804
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:49,600
up when you put gbt3 on the scale

805
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:50,399
and so

806
00:30:50,399 --> 00:30:51,279
no

807
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:55,279
gpu is big enough to handle gpd3 and

808
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:57,200
you'll need to split it up in order to

809
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:00,559
to run it across many different gpus now

810
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:01,760
that's not

811
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:02,880
available

812
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,200
now in the transformers library and

813
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:07,279
although people have done it open ai has

814
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:09,679
clearly done it and huawei has done it

815
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:13,519
nvidia's done it it's not it's not

816
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:17,279
easy to do for for any random hacker

817
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,279
that's going to change

818
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,360
huawei has has said that they'll be open

819
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:24,080
sourcing their packages to do that and

820
00:31:24,080 --> 00:31:26,480
nvidia already has nvidia trained a

821
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,279
trillion parameter gbt um

822
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:30,559
which is

823
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:31,519
maybe

824
00:31:31,519 --> 00:31:33,600
like if it's maybe 10 times bigger than

825
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,880
gpd3 gpt3 was 100 times bigger than gpd2

826
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:39,279
so it's not really a gpd4 but it's

827
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:41,440
bigger and it's and it's available on

828
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:43,360
github to be downloaded

829
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,240
um

830
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,360
but even if you aren't building your own

831
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:49,919
gpt-4 or gpd3

832
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:51,760
you still can have access there are of

833
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:54,559
these openai will be providing access

834
00:31:54,559 --> 00:31:58,320
for pay and there are other groups like

835
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:01,440
luther ai who are generating gbt3

836
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:03,360
uh knockoffs to

837
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,960
to provide for free

838
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,679
so one way another uh access to these

839
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:10,480
models is coming

840
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:12,640
now if you have one you've you've got

841
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,080
the code yourself and you want to run it

842
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,919
how much would it cost to do this type

843
00:32:15,919 --> 00:32:18,000
of disinformation

844
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,799
well

845
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:22,159
uh purchasing so many high-end gpus

846
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,720
even on the cloud is a pretty expensive

847
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,880
prospect piecing them all together at

848
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,880
current on-demand prices

849
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,799
it comes to about fifty dollars per hour

850
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:33,519
i estimate now if you if you uh

851
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,080
commit to using them 24 7

852
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:38,320
for a year you can knock off about a

853
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,080
third of that price and if you commit to

854
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,919
three years you can knock it off again

855
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:45,200
and get the the price down even further

856
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,159
um

857
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:48,080
but if you're just going to be using it

858
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,320
on demand then fifty dollars an hour is

859
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:51,200
about the

860
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,880
going rate

861
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:55,440
uh gbt3 writes

862
00:32:55,440 --> 00:32:57,039
slower than you might expect it takes

863
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,039
about 50 milliseconds

864
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:02,399
based on my experimentation per token to

865
00:33:02,399 --> 00:33:04,080
to generate and so if you're going to

866
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:05,840
write a book like the cuckoo's egg it

867
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:06,960
would take about

868
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:09,120
1.75 hours

869
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,320
and that would come to about 87.50

870
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:15,039
at the the current on-demand prices

871
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:17,360
that's a great deal for somebody to

872
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,760
write a book it's not such a great deal

873
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:22,080
for purchasing a book

874
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:24,480
but but those models aside let's talk

875
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:26,159
about disinformation so if you're going

876
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:28,640
to write a tweet a disinformation tweet

877
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:30,960
that costs about

878
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:32,559
2 cents

879
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:34,799
30 tokens per tweet is

880
00:33:34,799 --> 00:33:37,120
is is debatable but

881
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:39,039
if you imagine just like a a little

882
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,440
shortened link sometimes that can take

883
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:43,279
as much as 20 tokens just because it's

884
00:33:43,279 --> 00:33:45,519
so many different fragments of things

885
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:48,880
and so at 30 seconds per tweet

886
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,720
sorry 30 tokens per tweet you're talking

887
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:52,399
about two cents

888
00:33:52,399 --> 00:33:55,279
now that's that's uh pidens but what if

889
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,039
you wanted to write a whole bunch of

890
00:33:57,039 --> 00:33:59,519
those tweets disinformation at scale if

891
00:33:59,519 --> 00:34:01,760
you wanted to do one percent of twitter

892
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,919
how much would that cost now there are

893
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:06,799
about 850 million tweets per day

894
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,960
and so dividing out to get to one

895
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:11,918
percent you would need about 150 gpt

896
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:12,960
threes

897
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,960
each of them at fifty dollars an hour

898
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,839
spread over many gpus in order to

899
00:34:17,839 --> 00:34:19,520
to generate that amount of volume one

900
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:21,918
percent of twitter

901
00:34:21,918 --> 00:34:24,960
now that cost just to run the models

902
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,119
would come out to about 65 million

903
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:28,560
dollars per year

904
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,440
at

905
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:30,879
50 an hour

906
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:32,399
now you might

907
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:35,119
be able to to to knock that down by

908
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:38,000
having shorter tweets or by

909
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:40,560
um or by committing to a year or even

910
00:34:40,560 --> 00:34:42,960
three years although you don't know what

911
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:44,480
sort of advances might come in the next

912
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:46,399
three years and you don't know what kind

913
00:34:46,399 --> 00:34:48,000
of

914
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,879
aggressive actions might be caused

915
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:52,719
to try to knock you off of your

916
00:34:52,719 --> 00:34:55,119
computing servers over those three years

917
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:57,040
and so 65 million is kind of a starting

918
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,800
point that's enough to

919
00:34:58,800 --> 00:34:59,760
to

920
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:02,800
to make hackers like me not be able to

921
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:04,800
to compete but it's really not a big

922
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,280
deal for great powers

923
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:10,160
uh great power nation states now the

924
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,920
problem that the more difficult thing to

925
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,760
solve is the number of accounts that you

926
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:14,800
might need

927
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,560
and so that same 800 well 8.5 million

928
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:20,079
tweets per day

929
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,119
uh

930
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:22,000
at

931
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:25,119
2 400 tweets per per

932
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,880
user which is the maximum number that

933
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:29,359
twitter allows would require

934
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:31,440
500 different accounts

935
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:32,640
which is

936
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:33,599
a lot

937
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:35,200
but not not

938
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,920
insurmountable exactly but still maxing

939
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,920
out the the number of tweets per day

940
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,839
makes you pretty obvious if you wanted

941
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:43,920
to do something uh something more

942
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:46,320
consistent with like a high high usage

943
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,960
person but not a crazy high usage person

944
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:51,440
something like maybe 24 tweets per day

945
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:55,040
then you multiply by 100 you get 350 000

946
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,240
users

947
00:35:56,240 --> 00:35:57,839
that's a lot of infrastructure to try to

948
00:35:57,839 --> 00:35:59,839
maintain and that's where we have the

949
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:03,040
most likelihood of of interrupting these

950
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,640
large-scale disinformation efforts

951
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,640
and so just to recap

952
00:36:08,640 --> 00:36:12,240
uh anyone can today in six lines of six

953
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,440
blocks of code write gbt2 text for for

954
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:16,960
millions of messages basically for

955
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,400
cheaper for free

956
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,720
to use gpt-3 it's a little bit more

957
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:22,720
expensive uh you're probably talking

958
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,800
about thousands of messages for cheaper

959
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:26,160
free free

960
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:28,640
maybe tens or hundreds of thousands but

961
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,000
nation states if they want can write

962
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,839
billions of messages it'll cost them

963
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,599
millions of dollars but that's really

964
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:34,880
not a problem

965
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:37,200
and the text that they generate can be

966
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,359
vile and persuasive as all of the

967
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,200
examples that micah showed and many

968
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:43,760
others in our report

969
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:45,760
and there's very little hope of

970
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,680
detecting those messages based on the

971
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:49,359
text themselves they're

972
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:50,800
pretty well indistinguishable from

973
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,280
people particularly

974
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,200
people writing on the internet which is

975
00:36:55,200 --> 00:36:57,920
not exactly the highest bar to clear

976
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,000
our best hope though it's not it's not

977
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,760
all for for loss we still have a hope in

978
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,480
in focusing hard on the infrastructure

979
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:09,599
required to generate to promote those

980
00:37:09,599 --> 00:37:13,119
messages 350 000 different accounts is a

981
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,839
really high bar even the 3500

982
00:37:15,839 --> 00:37:17,200
is a high bar

983
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:18,960
so if we if we're going to stop this

984
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,720
information at scale it's going to have

985
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,720
to focus less on the text itself and

986
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:24,160
more on the infrastructure used to

987
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:28,520
distribute it thanks for listening
