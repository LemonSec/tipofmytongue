00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,760
welcome everybody laudrina here with

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,080
martijn horton for our talk a

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,480
survivor-centric trauma and foam

5
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:24,640
approach to stalkerware

6
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,160
we hope that by acknowledging the

7
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,160
experiences of survivors and people

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:30,320
whose voices are often marginalized

9
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:32,640
minimized and erased by controlling

10
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,800
parties we can also acknowledge the

11
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,480
privileges that many of us attending

12
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,239
black hat have just by being in the

13
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,360
space

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:41,040
we would like to begin by offering a

15
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:42,879
land acknowledgement and with credit to

16
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,719
adrian wong share this statement that

17
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,760
pays respects to indigenous people

18
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,200
since our activities are shared

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,879
digitally to the internet let's also

20
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,039
take a moment to consider the legacy of

21
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,039
colonization embedded within the

22
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:56,800
technology structures and ways of

23
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,960
thinking we use every day

24
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,559
we are using equipment and high-speed

25
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,239
internet not available in many

26
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,159
indigenous communities

27
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,920
even the technologies that are central

28
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,680
to much of the work we do leave

29
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,200
significant carbon footprints

30
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,640
contributing to changing climates that

31
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,840
disproportionately affect indigenous

32
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,159
communities worldwide

33
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:18,240
i invite you to join us in acknowledging

34
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,439
all this as our shared responsibility to

35
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,600
make good of this time and for each

36
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:25,119
other to consider our roles in

37
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:26,520
reconciliation

38
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:30,399
decolonization and allegiance

39
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,720
with that

40
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,479

66
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,920
and we'll share the url and the qr code

67
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,879
at the very end as well

68
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,920
now before we start with the actual

69
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,080
presentation i want to give a content

70
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,200
warning

71
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,200
this presentation will discuss intimate

72
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,879
partner violence and gender-based

73
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,680
violence this may be triggering for some

74
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,040
of you

75
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,400
if you want to seek help about this

76
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:49,440
topic

77
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,879
there are many helplines around the

78
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,000
world

79
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,920
including the national domestic violence

80
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,160
hotline in the united states

81
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,840
you can also call such helplines if

82
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,920
you're concerned about a friend a

83
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,360
co-worker or relative and want to

84
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,120
support them

85
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,800
it's also important to know that these

86
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:07,280
helplines can also help you or refer you

87
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:09,680
to an appropriate program if you believe

88
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,680
that you are self engaged in abusive

89
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,200
there's not an easy step to take but

90
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,519
it's also a very important one

91
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,480
if that applies to you

92
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:23,360
so now on to the agenda for today

93
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,799
we'll start with a brief introduction

94
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:26,640
into intimate partner violence and

95
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,720
gender-based violence

96
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:31,519
then moving on to tech abuse which is

97
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,120
a subset of that

98
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,200
and then we'll go to the core of this

99
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,599
talk stalk aware which is one specific

100
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,159
form of tech abuse and we'll talk about

101
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,440
how it works

102
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,280
what you can do to support someone who

103
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,120
may have stock aware on their device and

104
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,879
then what can we collectively do about

105
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,440
this issue

106
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,720
so let's start by talking about

107
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,239
intimate partner violence and

108
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,120
gender-based violence

109
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,000
intimate partner violence or ipv

110
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,080
is abuse or aggression that occurs in a

111
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,840
romantic relationship

112
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,159
other terms used for the same phenomenon

113
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,040
are domestic abuse or domestic violence

114
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,239
and really none of these terms is

115
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,599
perfect

116
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,680
it doesn't always happen in a domestic

117
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,600
setting and it doesn't always involve a

118
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,040
current or

119
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,519
past partner abuse can for example also

120
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:23,919
take place between siblings or between

121
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,560
parents and children

122
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,880
the center for disease control in the

123
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,800
united states reports that one in three

124
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,960
women and one in seven men experience

125
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,560
physical violence at the hand of an

126
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,240
intimate partner again this only

127
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,160
includes physical violence

128
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:40,000
and the fact that the cdc reports on

129
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,919
this is a good reminder this is actually

130
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,560
a health issue

131
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,639
in this presentation we will use the

132
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,880
term survivor rather than a victim which

133
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,600
is more empowering but it's important to

134
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,080
note here that intimate partner violence

135
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,639
is sometimes fatal it is a second

136
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,080
leading cause of death for young

137
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,240
african-american women and the third

138
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,680
leading cause of death for young

139
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,080
american indian women

140
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,639
you'll also note a huge gender disparity

141
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,039
which points to unequal relationships in

142
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,160
society gender-based violence is any

143
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,840
violence rooted in exploiting such

144
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,440
relationships and it's therefore closely

145
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,039
linked to intimate partner violence

146
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,960
in the part of violence is a huge

147
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,360
subject and if it interests you i

148
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,720
recommend you follow a course or

149
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,960
training on a subject or read a book

150
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,400
about it for now i'll just discuss a few

151
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,800
common misconceptions first as already

152
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,560
mentioned it doesn't always involve

153
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,240
physical violence and other kinds of

154
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,560
abuse it could include

155
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:43,039
verbal abuse emotional abuse but also

156
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,120
financial abuse

157
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,080
um

158
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,759
and though again there is a huge gender

159
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,240
disparity not all survivors are women

160
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,600
not all abusers are men also

161
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,520
infant partner violence does occur

162
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,520
within same-sex relationships and both

163
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:02,000
abuser and survivor may be non-binary

164
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,680
and finally if you're not too familiar

165
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,759
with partner violence you may wonder why

166
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:07,919
someone doesn't just leave an abusive

167
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:09,120
relationship

168
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,479
um

169
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,000
there are actually great many reasons

170
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,160
for people not to be able to do that not

171
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:14,960
only

172
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,120
varies between survivor

173
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,520
but um it may not be safe for her and

174
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,600
our children to do so or it may not be

175
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,199
financially possible for her to relieve

176
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,639
the relationship

177
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,600
or it may not be society considered

178
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:30,560
socially acceptable for them to leave

179
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,919
a relationship

180
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,400
even if it's abusive

181
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,960
so let's talk about tech abuse

182
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,199
tech abuse is the use of any kind of

183
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,960
technology to facilitate intimate

184
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,800
partner violence

185
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,600
to show you how widespread it is west an

186
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,759
australian ngo that supports women and

187
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:51,759
children surviving abuse

188
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:55,199
reports that more than 99 of domestic

189
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:57,360
violence practitioners they spoke to

190
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,280
have worked with clients experiencing

191
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:03,400
some kind of tech abuse

192
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:08,319
there are many kinds of tech abuse

193
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,880
one example includes iot devices you can

194
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:13,360
think of hidden cameras but also smart

195
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,880
toys which often

196
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,880
come microphones inside them

197
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,639
but also remotely controllable

198
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,280
thermostats or lights which abusers have

199
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:22,800
used to demonstrate their power

200
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,080
something which can be very intimidating

201
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,720
there's a worrying trend of air attack

202
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:31,039
and tiles and other ways to find the

203
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,039
device or item

204
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,520
these have legitimate uses

205
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,120
but they can and are being used by

206
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,639
abusers and stalkers to track people

207
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,319
one thing that's very common that's

208
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,400
often overlooked is shared password for

209
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,120
social media or email or even online

210
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,720
banking that's very common in pretty

211
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,240
much any relationship

212
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:52,639
it's common in abusive relationships um

213
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,280
it's a very common way for an abuser to

214
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,440
say read the survivors

215
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,520
facebook messages

216
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,000
and even more simple um and almost

217
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,319
non-technical is sometimes the

218
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,879
abuser just has regular access

219
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,520
to a device say a shared pc

220
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:11,280
and uses this to read emails and

221
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:13,759
messages

222
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,919
um it's important to keep in mind here

223
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:16,960
and especially if you're here with your

224
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,879
black hat mindset

225
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,319
tech abuse rarely involves hacking

226
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:23,280
and

227
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,160
it just tends to exploit a feature of

228
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,720
the technology um

229
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,759
technology is rarely built with ipv

230
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,760
in mind and audrina will talk a little

231
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,760
bit about that later on

232
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,440
there are some really great and useful

233
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,679
uh resources on tech abuse on the web

234
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,279
there's ceta which is the clinic to end

235
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,959
tech abuse which is part of cornell

236
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:49,120
university they have published a great

237
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,519
number of guides and checklists

238
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,839
uh there are some pretty good websites

239
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:56,480
on tech safety by an edv here in the

240
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,680
united states

241
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,680
westnet in australia and refuge in the

242
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:02,959
uk and again we list them in the

243
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:05,839
resources website

244
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,560
and now i'll hand it over

245
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,320
to lodrina

246
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,600
so

247
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,760
we'd like to talk about what soccerware

248
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,240
does but first we have to define what it

249
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,519
is

250
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:20,000
and we have some very purposefully

251
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,000
worded descriptions on this slide

252
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,519
this is from the coalition against

253
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:26,959
dockerware

254
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:29,120
and the definition is that stalkerware

255
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,440
is software made available directly to

256
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,160
individuals that enables a remote user

257
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,160
to monitor the activities on another

258
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,959
user's device without that user's

259
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,000
consent and without explicit persistent

260
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,880
notification to that user in a manner

261
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:47,120
that may facilitate intimate partner

262
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,760
surveillance harassment abuse stalking

263
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,360
and or violence

264
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:53,120
now two things to highlight in

265
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,519
particular one is that this is made

266
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:57,760
directly to individuals

267
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,120
not uh nation states or governments not

268
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,640
criminals

269
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,800
and also

270
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:08,959
that there is no persistent notification

271
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,480
um even if on install uh there's some

272
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,880
kind of notification about do you wish

273
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,800
to share information with this

274
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,399
application

275
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,120
one-time consent is not enough and

276
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,160
really the key word here is consent

277
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:26,880
because the person who then is using

278
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:30,160
that device that phone that computer

279
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,800
has no way to continue to give their

280
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,000
consent

281
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,519
to something they don't know is

282
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,519
monitoring them in the background

283
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,240
now with that definition let's move on

284
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,160
to a couple um

285
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,640
common spyware and stalkerware

286
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,920
applications

287
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,959
this one here flexispy is one of the

288
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:53,120
more popular applications with many

289
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,880
capabilities

290
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,079
and i do want to highlight

291
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:01,200
well how can this software exist if it

292
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,519
can monitor you 24 7 on all your devices

293
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,480
well purportedly this is for keeping

294
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,079
track of what your kids are doing for

295
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:12,720
example on social media or maybe

296
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,640
employee monitoring

297
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,640
if you're running a business and looking

298
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:18,560
to keep track of what your employees are

299
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:19,839
doing

300
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:20,880
um

301
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,920
so this is what it is on the surface

302
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,200
is software that claims to be oh this is

303
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,040
for good this is for keeping track of

304
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,760
kids or your business

305
00:11:31,760 --> 00:11:33,839
however

306
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:35,200
you know um

307
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:38,320
stalker ware also boasts in addition to

308
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,079
all these features

309
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:42,399
that it's a hundred percent hidden

310
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,079
or stealthy

311
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:46,000
uh now

312
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,880
some stalker where it claims um you know

313
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,279
makes very blatant claims about being

314
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:53,360
able to spy on a partner

315
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:56,800
frankly this is quite rare

316
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:58,480
often

317
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,040
the hints about this being used for

318
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,440
intermittent partner surveillance are

319
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,120
often more subtle

320
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:07,600
this is a fact from m spy another

321
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,200
popular product

322
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:11,120
and uh users of this product appear to

323
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,880
be concerned about how their purchase

324
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,120
shows up on a credit card statement but

325
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,160
for a product that's purportedly to keep

326
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,320
track of your kids and keep them safe

327
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,200
well

328
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,279
you know kids don't typically check

329
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,040
their parents credit card statements

330
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,279
from the abuser perspective this is what

331
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:33,279
the interface looks like it's a slick

332
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,160
web interface that can show messages and

333
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,839
this is where other data from the phone

334
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:42,000
shows up often in real time

335
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,920
next some basic facts about stalkerware

336
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:50,560
this is almost always installed through

337
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,839
physical access to an unlocked device

338
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:56,480
i stress physical access because it is

339
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:58,800
incredibly rare for these kind of

340
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,120
surveillance mechanisms to be installed

341
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,800
remotely

342
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,360
just takes a few minutes less than 10

343
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,079
requires no special skills

344
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:11,680
and you don't need to be on any criminal

345
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:13,920
dark web or you know any kind of

346
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,200
underground

347
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,760
uh part of any underground crime network

348
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:20,480
to access this software it's fairly

349
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,040
affordable

350
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:28,240
technically it's not very advanced

351
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,720
you know if if i'm talking

352
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,560
with my forensic hat on and talking

353
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:34,639
about these applications

354
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,959
they're not going to be hidden from

355
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:38,399
somebody like me who's a forensic

356
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:39,680
practitioner

357
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,360
but they are hidden from the user

358
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,399
so again um the activity that can be

359
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:49,519
monitored is really vast this includes

360
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,560
real-time cell phone conversations

361
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,120
the ability to turn on a camera remotely

362
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,320
take photos and videos in real time

363
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,800
it's pretty

364
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:03,279
scary when we get down to different

365
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:06,000
devices uh stalkerware is most commonly

366
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,720
seen on android for a few reasons

367
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,959
uh one there usually isn't a need to

368
00:14:10,959 --> 00:14:12,560
root the device

369
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:13,600
um

370
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:16,480
and but some some stalker word does this

371
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,720
for advanced functionality

372
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,040
the other thing is android allows you to

373
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,279
disable security protections during

374
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,399
install

375
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:26,240
and this is what a lot of these

376
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,240
installation guides for these programs

377
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,839
will do teach you how to go into

378
00:14:29,839 --> 00:14:32,079
security settings when you've got a

379
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:33,600
phone in your hand you're trying to

380
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,760
install that spyware on and how do you

381
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,639
circumvent those security measures

382
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:40,240
by the way thanks to the coalition

383
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,480
against dockerware antivirus detection

384
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,959
for stalkerware is pretty decent these

385
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,199
days however there are some important

386
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:48,959
caveats that martin will talk about

387
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,279
later

388
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,519
going next to ios

389
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:58,560
this is typically more rare and this is

390
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:00,959
because stalkerware isn't something

391
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:02,880
that's can be found just on your app

392
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,760
store

393
00:15:03,760 --> 00:15:06,000
so typically a jailbreak needs to be

394
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,519
done to install stock or wear on the

395
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:08,720
device

396
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:11,600
because ios and apple devices need to be

397
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,680
jailbroken

398
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:15,680
it is typically only something that

399
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,480
we'll find on older devices or maybe

400
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:22,000
unpatched devices

401
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,279
so again

402
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,079
if your device has the latest ios

403
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:29,920
updates ios 11 or later

404
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,360
this isn't possible to do

405
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:36,320
by the way more typically

406
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:39,120
with ios we're going to see different

407
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,800
types of monitoring

408
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,839
tech abuse that deals with icloud

409
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:45,360
monitoring

410
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,759
shared passwords and that kind of thing

411
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:49,920
which brings me to stalkerware on

412
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,759
desktops

413
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:54,560
this exists it's less common

414
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,920
i have investigated a case of a couple

415
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:00,079
that was going through a divorce

416
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:02,399
and in the divorce

417
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,279
one spouse always seemed to know

418
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,199
what his wife was up to even though they

419
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:08,880
hadn't lived in the same house for

420
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,920
months

421
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,519
and it turned out

422
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,959
that um

423
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:15,040
the soon to be x had purchased

424
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,279
commercial spyware we were able to get a

425
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,880
court order to look at his credit card

426
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:21,279
statements see who bought the spyware

427
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,680
find it on his credit card statement

428
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,040
but um

429
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,199
the issue here isn't so much that it was

430
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:29,519
technologically advanced it was just

431
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:33,360
like we see on ios it was that sharing

432
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,079
of credentials in this case a sharing of

433
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,720
an account on a desktop computer when

434
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,959
the couple was still living together

435
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:45,199
that was the reason behind this monitor

436
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:47,519
so i'm going to turn it back to martin

437
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,519
to talk about how to support someone who

438
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,600
believes that they have stalkerware on

439
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,839
their device

440
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:55,600
thank you ladwina

441
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:58,240
so now let's talk about how you as a

442
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,240
tech or security expert can support

443
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:02,839
someone who may have stalker on their

444
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:04,480
device

445
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,079
so the first thing to keep in mind here

446
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,439
is that you're not dealing with a

447
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:09,439
technical problem yes there may be a

448
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:11,439
small technical component to it which is

449
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,439
what you're an expert on but this is

450
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,119
primarily an abuse problem and it's

451
00:17:15,119 --> 00:17:17,439
crucial that you treat it as such

452
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:19,439
um to begin with and this may seem

453
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,199
counter-intuitive it isn't always a good

454
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:23,919
idea to remove software from a device um

455
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,079
if you do this the abuser who plays

456
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,120
stalker there will find out and this

457
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,799
sometimes could lead to escalation of

458
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:32,480
the abuse

459
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,080
removing stalker i could also remove

460
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,200
evidence

461
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,280
to be used in a court case or just for

462
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,720
someone to later understand what

463
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,200
happened to them

464
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,039
so always let the survivor decide what

465
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,520
is the safest thing for them to do

466
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,000
try to understand that threat model

467
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,679
which is often very different from your

468
00:17:49,679 --> 00:17:52,000
standard infosec threat model

469
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,120
and also

470
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:54,799
differs a lot from one survivor to the

471
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:57,039
next

472
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,600
and if you're helping someone

473
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,280
who's trying to prevent stalker from

474
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:03,600
being installed or reinstalled

475
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,520
keep in mind that what we all consider

476
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:07,600
good security practice quite often isn't

477
00:18:07,600 --> 00:18:10,240
feasible within an abusive relationship

478
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,480
for example setting a strong passcode

479
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,039
and not sharing it is something one

480
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:18,160
often can't do when the course

481
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:21,840
plays a role within a relationship

482
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
it's very important to

483
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,360
keep in mind that

484
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:29,600
these days a lot of people self-identify

485
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,720
their problem

486
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:32,240
as stalker

487
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:33,600
because they may have read about it it's

488
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:35,360
been in the news quite a bit

489
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:39,120
um more often than not the problem

490
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,559
that they have is actually something

491
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,320
else some other kind of tech abuse

492
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,559
sometimes some non-tech abuse

493
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:46,880
um it is important to believe survivors

494
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,480
and take their concerns seriously but

495
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,520
don't narrowly focus on stalker

496
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,120
and i've mentioned that before but the

497
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,720
checklists from sita are extremely

498
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,120
helpful in helping a survivor checking

499
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,039
and securing the various accounts and

500
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,919
devices they have

501
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,520
and finally it is very important to

502
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,200
remember that intimate partner violence

503
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,039
and other kinds of abuse

504
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:10,880
are very traumatizing

505
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:13,520
and as a consequence survivors are often

506
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,200
hyper-vigilant because this

507
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,640
hyper-vigilance is actually how they

508
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,799
survived

509
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,160
so they may have concern that you

510
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,240
believe aren't well founded

511
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:24,640
some survivors are very distrustful

512
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,039
others will place all their trust in you

513
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:28,880
as the technical expert

514
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,440
some may be easily irritable some will

515
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,039
insist that you help them do something

516
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,880
even if you believe there isn't anything

517
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:36,799
for you or for them to do

518
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,799
and all of this is normal

519
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:41,600
this is as it is normal for you to feel

520
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:43,760
frustrated or impatient

521
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:45,919
or just guilty about not being able to

522
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:47,520
help someone um

523
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,440
i personally find this the hardest part

524
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,720
of working with survivors of tech abuse

525
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,520
um

526
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,799
and that's good for me to remember it

527
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,480
isn't about me or if you're helping

528
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,799
someone it's not about you and it's okay

529
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,559
to ask help too um

530
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,720
we mentioned the helpline numbers before

531
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,000
you can call these two if you're trying

532
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,600
to help someone and want to

533
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:10,799
know what's best for them to do

534
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:12,480
and remember always take survivors

535
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,240
seriously and empower them and don't

536
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,840
take decisions on their behalf

537
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,559
and for the final part go back to

538
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,720
laurina

539
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,360
so from here if you are somebody who's

540
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:28,559
not face to face with a survivor

541
00:20:28,559 --> 00:20:32,320
what can we do to help this problem

542
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:35,120
well there are many researchers who have

543
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,840
thought about and written papers on this

544
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,720
issue

545
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,080
um

546
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:43,440
when we think about designing products

547
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:45,760
that um

548
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:49,919
that can be used for multiple purposes

549
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,880
i like to think in product design of how

550
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,280
would my product be used in a horror

551
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:56,320
movie

552
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:58,559
what are the unintended consequences of

553
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:00,320
deploying this software

554
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:02,080
and i'd like to challenge everybody

555
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:04,880
listening to consider intimate partner

556
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,799
violence and that threat model during

557
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:09,200
product design

558
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:11,280
beyond that i recommend building

559
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,000
connections with advocacy groups uh

560
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,919
whether this is domestic violence

561
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:17,200
shelters

562
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,240
or abuse shelters in your own area you

563
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:22,240
can learn a lot from them about this

564
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,880
issue and potentially maybe you can

565
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,520
offer your help skills and tech skills

566
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,559
to help them out

567
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:32,880
in conclusion

568
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,120
we've heard a lot about how stalkerware

569
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,520
is a part of tech abuse

570
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:40,000
it is a very very real problem

571
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,320
especially for survivors who are in the

572
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:45,440
moment who are experiencing this kind of

573
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,039
tech abuse

574
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,039
but understand

575
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:51,919
if you take nothing else away this is

576
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,039
not a tech problem this is not as simple

577
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,520
as identifying iocs

578
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:00,559
or removing malware it is really a

579
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:02,960
complex problem that we hope we've given

580
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,720
you some insight into during this

581
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:06,400
presentation

582
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,520
