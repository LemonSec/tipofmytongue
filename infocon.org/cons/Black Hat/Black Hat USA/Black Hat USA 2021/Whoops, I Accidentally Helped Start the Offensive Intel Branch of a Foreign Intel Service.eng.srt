hacking branch of a foreign intelligence

13
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,120
service

14
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,960
it uh it was uh really it was a a mix up

15
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:44,719
on my part not really understanding or

16
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,239

having me on as well

40
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,680
um so within episode 47 i kind of walk

41
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,920
through a lot of this discussion but uh

42
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:41,439
but again in this

43
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:42,720
there's a few other things i'd like to

44
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,240
show and like to share

45
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,439
i'm actually going to share everything

46
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,119
within the capacity of this things that

47
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,000
i did share at b-sides nova that i was

48
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,439
not able to take pictures of or share

49
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:53,360
very specifically but because this is

50
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,280
black hat we want to be as granular as

51
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,880
we possibly can to the entire community

52
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,759
i'm just going to share everything

53
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,600
um so my story starts off within me

54
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,360
transitioning out of a linguistics

55
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,479
capacity into a hacker for the nsa when

56
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:10,399
i rotated out of that role

57
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:12,239
i was offered an opportunity to go

58
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,160
overseas with my wife

59
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,360
to help coalition forces hunt and fight

60
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,120
isis and al-qaeda operatives in the

61
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,080
middle east it was a fascinating job and

62
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,920
we did a really awesome great job for

63
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:25,920
the first couple of months until we

64
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,080
rotated into a different area of

65
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,239
jurisdiction hunting and finding money

66
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:31,519
as you can see just in case you don't

67
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:33,360
really know where the uae is it's just

68
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,760
between saudi and oman and just north of

69
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,360
yemen

70
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,640
so the role that i was offered was as a

71
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,400
targeting or threat hunting analyst

72
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,560
within cyberpoint international

73
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,400
the role was

74
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,120
provided to me by a headhunter within

75
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:50,400
the dc area

76
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,239
that everything seemed

77
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,879
pretty you know legitimate and even the

78
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:56,000
people on the ground that i was

79
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,760
interviewing with of course all felt the

80
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:59,280
same exact thing

81
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,040
the role and opportunities that we were

82
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:03,599
providing to the area of jurisdiction

83
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,319
was all above board and we all felt very

84
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,120
confident in what we were doing

85
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,200
so um kind of mapped this out again

86
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,040
different things that we've talked about

87
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:15,280
over there was while we were got on site

88
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,959
we moved into that space

89
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:17,680
and

90
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,120
we

91
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:21,599
go to this off-site and

92
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,680
i would say a black site location where

93
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,120
is the villa and the villa is broken up

94
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,799
into different capacities where

95
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:30,159
management um security you know analysis

96
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,400
and research targeting and so on and so

97
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:33,599
forth where they might sit and where

98
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,640
they might operate so so this is a good

99
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,319
description right here of what the

100
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:40,000
different levels of the bill look like

101
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,680
and where we operated that and the teams

102
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:45,040
that we worked in conjunction with

103
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,120
so when we first step into the the space

104
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:49,519
initially uh our team or our leadership

105
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:50,720
on the ground gave us two different

106
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,120
briefings one again the isis and

107
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,799
al-qaeda um

108
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,879
attack leadership that we were i'm sorry

109
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,000
the uh the isis and uh al-qaeda

110
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,840
operatives and the hunt threat hunting

111
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,120
of those

112
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,680
personnel within that that region

113
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,879
and then we turn around giving a

114
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,720
completely different one so again it's

115
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,159
important to understand here that the

116
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,400
state department approval for

117
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,480
prior intelligence professionals within

118
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,358
the united states have very limited

119
00:04:17,358 --> 00:04:19,199
authorities to operate in different

120
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:21,358
capacities for commercial organizations

121
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,720
so the state department might have given

122
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:25,520
approval to help for us to help train in

123
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,360
a specific capacity but not actually

124
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,440
performing offensive operations and then

125
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:31,680
when you get on the ground in the event

126
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,960
that you are performing offensive

127
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,880
operations the local

128
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,280
country might provide their or might put

129
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,280
their own classification on what it is

130
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,479
that you're doing

131
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,720
and that was what was happening here so

132
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,639
uh so personnel will assist with the

133
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,040
development and defense measures of that

134
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:49,440
um you know that jurisdiction or that

135
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,759
area of authority that that theater if

136
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,000
you will and then um again switching

137
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,840
over there for project dread

138
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,479
really doing offensive operations um in

139
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,199
conjunction with nisa which is the uae's

140
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:02,880
nsa

141
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:04,880
basically similar to the nsa

142
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,240
all technical offensive operations and

143
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:10,320
technical and sigic collection happens

144
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,960
through nissa

145
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,240
so uh this sort of steps into um

146
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,000
starting this process of what we were

147
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,840
doing to track and hunt isis what we're

148
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,360
going to do is walk through

149
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,240
this particular conversation and then

150
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,240
how it moved into

151
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,039
a significantly more

152
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:31,520
dreadful operation that multiple

153
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,800
analysts on the ground decided to step

154
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,960
back away from and we'll get there

155
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:37,600
so again in one year the seven wars of

156
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,680
the muslim countries kind of looking at

157
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:42,000
what the isis and al-qaeda and taliban

158
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,560
leadership and operations within the

159
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,400
area of jurisdiction what they were

160
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,240
doing and how they were operating in

161
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,120
different areas at that particular time

162
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,680
our main focus was the operations that

163
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,360
were happening in iraq and uh and as op

164
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,120
as operatives moved out of iraq into

165
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:00,720
different countries and

166
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,720
took over different

167
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,400
fobs for operating bases in that region

168
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:08,080
and allowing for us to provide

169
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:09,520
intelligence back to different

170
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,680
leadership that might be able to provide

171
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:12,960
assistance

172
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:14,319
overcoming those different attack

173
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,759
vectors

174
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,479
so

175
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:18,479
most of the tracking that was taking

176
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,319
place because of the nature of the way

177
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:22,000
isis

178
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,319
communicated was from

179
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,960
their feeds at the time again this is

180
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:30,080
2014 2015 2016

181
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,000
and how they communicated over twitter

182
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,479
twitter handles of different utilization

183
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:36,560
of keywords keywords that would initiate

184
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,160
or drive different operations in the

185
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,360
region

186
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:41,440
and while we were doing a lot of this

187
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:43,440
work the same work and research was

188
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,800
being performed by ran back in the

189
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,280
united states so we use different

190
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,479
twitter applications

191
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,080
and collectively utilized uh twitter api

192
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,000
to pull information and perform holistic

193
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,120
analysis

194
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,360
against the

195
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:59,360
different keywords different handles

196
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:00,800
usernames the way the usernames were

197
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,199
designed and where different handles

198
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,840
were created and initiated from

199
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:06,560
so

200
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,199
again uh chatter cross correlations if

201
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:10,639
you see different keywords used in

202
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,440
different areas of operation if you see

203
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,759
them used over and over again and then

204
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,319
computational deltas so if you do see

205
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:20,080
different types of patterns performed

206
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,400
over series of time and then those drop

207
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,919
then you see very similar types of

208
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:25,440
patterns associated with

209
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,520
maybe

210
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:29,599
like keywords keywords that are similar

211
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,280
to other keywords

212
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,720
you can begin to see different types of

213
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,280
pattern used within chatter online and

214
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,840
then computational deltas of those

215
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,199
chatters over periods of time

216
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:42,720
and so um

217
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,400
again moving back to like keyword

218
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,599
analytics being able to perform um

219
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:49,440
i would you know really it's it's not

220
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,800
you're not moving into artificial

221
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,080
intelligence i would even say you're not

222
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:54,479
even moving into uh machine learning at

223
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,879
that time it's really just data science

224
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,440
against what is the data that's being

225
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,440
pulled down from different handles and

226
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,400
different keywords across um

227
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,400
uh associated personnel for known

228
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,599
associate personnel at the time we were

229
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,680
operating under the uh ovsc 1203

230
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,199
collection of

231
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:17,199
uh known targets and that would be two

232
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:19,520
persons away from a known active target

233
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,879
so if you know somebody's an active

234
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,479
target and you can collect on people

235
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:24,560
that that they communicate with and then

236
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:26,479
you can also collect on people that

237
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,879
those first hops communicate with but

238
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:30,080
not necessarily being able to

239
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,200
communicate collect on the associates of

240
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,039
that third level but you can collect on

241
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,719
the activity that they're doing just not

242
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:38,640
on the activity of

243
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:40,399
outside boundaries because we're not

244
00:08:40,399 --> 00:08:41,839
performing in that capacity the

245
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:43,279
offensive operation of collecting on

246
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,279
that we're able to pull down information

247
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:47,360
that might just be um on twitter over

248
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,959
the web but in the event that you gain

249
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:50,080
access to that infrastructure you're

250
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:51,839
pulling information down you can't do

251
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,320
that outside the two those two lanes and

252
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,279
then um i think at that time

253
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:00,800
2014 1516 barack obama changed that

254
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:03,839
regulation from three persons um a three

255
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,839
person circle to a two person circle and

256
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:07,360
so that was a significant change in the

257
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,560
ability to collect on known targets

258
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,560
again different types of activity that

259
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,920
was going over a period of time this

260
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,360
right here really is

261
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,440
between

262
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:21,279
2012 and 2013 moving into 2015 for

263
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,279
north sniper conviction that happened on

264
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:25,120
may 18th but

265
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:26,959
as you can kind of see like different

266
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:28,399
types of

267
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,560
people and different handles

268
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,519
within the jurisdiction of duae and

269
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:35,200
where they might be and correlations

270
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,200
between them and other people that are

271
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:40,320
known targets

272
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,160
and so as we kind of move into this

273
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:44,160
space some of the other questions we're

274
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,480
starting to get are

275
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:49,360
personnel that are raising significant

276
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,399
awareness

277
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,000
to activities that might be happening in

278
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,160
the unite i'm sorry in the uae

279
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,480
and um and rory donahue was one of those

280
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,080
people uh

281
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:58,880
and

282
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,160
he's actually a journalist out of the uk

283
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,839
but uh the way that it was painted as a

284
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,079
picture for us on the ground was that he

285
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:10,480
was um a an activist that was a national

286
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:13,279
security threat in the uae uh and it was

287
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:14,800
painted a very specific picture that he

288
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,240
might be funneling different types of

289
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,000
information to different organizations

290
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,200
that might

291
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,000
provide a security threat

292
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,920
associated with isis in that in that

293
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,000
region of course after a long period of

294
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,240
time and different research and

295
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:30,560
multiple other stories including chris

296
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,560
being and other people it just became

297
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,240
clear that this was just absolutely made

298
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:37,040
up um but as you can see

299
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:38,720
the stealth falcon which is what was

300
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:40,959
known within that capacity eventually

301
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:43,600
turned over to project raven but uh fake

302
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:45,120
personas that were used in order to

303
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:47,040
target rory and then those particular

304
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,920
targets and how they were pushed out and

305
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,200
um and how they were perceived to him

306
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:54,560
in order to deliver different types of

307
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,240
content that would take over his machine

308
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,720
and collect information in reality at

309
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,839
the end of the time what we ended up

310
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:03,519
learning was that rory's main focus

311
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,000
was a human rights activist to talk

312
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,839
about the injustices that were happening

313
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:10,079
in the uae so it's very important to

314
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:11,839
understand that

315
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,360
intelligence professionals coming out of

316
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,959
different regions going to help other

317
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,240
foreign intelligence countries

318
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,160
might be manipulated to perform

319
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,000
different offensive operations against

320
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,480
somebody that that other country

321
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,480
perceived as a threat for a different

322
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,240
purpose other than why those

323
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:29,680
intelligence professionals and offensive

324
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,040
security professionals or offensive

325
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,720
intelligence professionals might be

326
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,399
there to perform actions again so we

327
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,560
were there for actions against isis and

328
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,720
nakata operatives and then other tasking

329
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,079
came down against people who don't fit

330
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:41,200
into that

331
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,040
category

332
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,360
so just it's an important um sort of

333
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,720
lesson to keep your eyes open that

334
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,760
things might be spun differently to uh

335
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,920
to force you or allow for you to move

336
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,360
into an area of jurisdiction that you

337
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,440
don't have one the authority to be there

338
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,600
but one uh but two

339
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,639
you wouldn't want to be there in the

340
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:00,560
first place anyways if you have you know

341
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:03,040
that level of um understanding that

342
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,959
that's not somebody that really deserves

343
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,720
to be targeted just because they're

344
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,120
raising awareness to human rights um

345
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,279
injustices within a region you know let

346
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,360
them write about it the targeting of

347
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,600
journalists for the sake

348
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,240
of quieting them is something that uh

349
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,600
has been

350
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:21,200
you know it's it's been frowned upon

351
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,200
it's it's it's against the law in a lot

352
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,680
of countries and it is something that

353
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:27,839
needs to be protected um across

354
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,519
different you know different capacities

355
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:31,760
and different uh justice groups

356
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,920
so this is an example of one of the

357
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,839
emails that might have been sent to rory

358
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,480
um i pulled this off of a website i kind

359
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,320
of outlined that from the stealth falcon

360
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,880
and i have a list of uh references at

361
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,040
the bottom of this uh slide deck so you

362
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,320
can pull the different references and do

363
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,760
some mobile research and pause it there

364
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:49,440
and pull that information if you want to

365
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:51,920
so um again just kind of talking about

366
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,079
and and and forming into

367
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,880
uh discussing here the human rights of

368
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,040
the middle east so after this sort of

369
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:01,120
got pushed out became aware that that

370
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,160
was really what his goal was and that um

371
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:06,240
entire concept or subject matter was

372
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:08,079
used against him to get him to open

373
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:09,760
something or click on something that

374
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:11,600
would then um

375
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,680
download something within his uh his

376
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,880
computer

377
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,160
so you can see

378
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,440
you just make up something that looks

379
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,760
like it's a it's a macro protected

380
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,040
document and all you have to do is just

381
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,040
tell them you have to go enable macros

382
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,320
once you enable those macros as

383
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,240
downloads and we all know that process

384
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,079
download something and uh and you get a

385
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,000
call back from that machine

386
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:31,920
his particular machine was a was a mac

387
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:34,399
os so the uh the the different exploit

388
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:36,160
that was targeted against him to be able

389
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,760
to run that that exploit and gain

390
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:39,680
persistence on that machine of course

391
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,440
was very specifically crafted and

392
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,680
purchased from

393
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,920
you know different exploit brokers and

394
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,680
and targeted against rory so again um

395
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,480
fight for the right to fight uh so again

396
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,320
using different concepts and subject

397
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:58,079
matters very specifically to his um

398
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,199
uh i would say his uh his desires to

399
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:02,720
produce

400
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,800
you know

401
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,359
spoken

402
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,360
rather to speak specifically to the

403
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,760
injustices happening in that region

404
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:13,839
so after we kind of started to move in

405
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:15,279
this space and started asking a little

406
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:17,680
bit of other questions we began also to

407
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:18,880
get different

408
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,120
questions about following the money now

409
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,560
this is very normal this is a very

410
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,639
normal question hey isis and al-qaeda

411
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:26,240
how are they operating is the mother

412
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,079
muslim brotherhood

413
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,160
funneling the money if so how is that

414
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:32,079
happening and can you prove it so we

415
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:34,079
were um we were asked can you prove that

416
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:36,000
this is actually happening we said well

417
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,920
do you have a a key or do you have an

418
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,600
idea of what might be happening and of

419
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:40,800
course they came back to us and said

420
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,320
well we feel like that it might be the

421
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,639
country of qatar can you gain access to

422
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:46,639
the country of qatar and identify a way

423
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,079
um whether or not they're funneling

424
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:50,079
money to the muslim brotherhood

425
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:53,040
so again it was brought back to us qatar

426
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:55,760
saudi iran and yemen there was different

427
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,279
um you know whether or not be the the

428
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,480
houthi

429
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,360
the houthis or the um you know isis

430
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,680
al-qaeda mujahideen whatever it might

431
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,199
have been but terrorist organization

432
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:07,360
within that region was the main focus of

433
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:09,040
identifying how that money was being

434
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:10,399
funneled to them

435
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:12,800
they all became targets and uh and then

436
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,120
we we sent a request back and said you

437
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,519
know we need to we need permission from

438
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:18,800
the state department in order to perform

439
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:21,440
these actions can we do this and so as

440
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,040
we went from there we got that

441
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:24,800
permission back and then we move forward

442
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,160
in that conversation in order to say

443
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:28,800
let's let's begin a target um katada was

444
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,720
our first one and for the first time i'm

445
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,000
actually going to walk through the

446
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,000
exploitation life cycle of how the

447
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,839
country of the uae gained access to the

448
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:37,920
country of qatar

449
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:40,160
so what initially happened was it was a

450
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:43,199
full wall and scan and within hho we

451
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,839
identified a a vpn

452
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:47,920
infrastructure for hho that gave us

453
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,079
access to that infrastructure within the

454
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,160
infrastructure misa had stood up a

455
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,880
manage engine service desk plus platform

456
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,759
that had a a default administrator

457
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,839
administrator login so we were tunneling

458
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:01,920
through our hso

459
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,800
access into a private ip address that

460
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,120
had shared infrastructure between hho

461
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,600
and misa just for scanning

462
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,959
we

463
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,639
gain access to that manage engine

464
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:14,720
services plus machine

465
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:17,040
routed through that platform dumped the

466
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,120
database on there and then used the

467
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:21,519
javascript code that was used to encrypt

468
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:24,160
the passwords in that database reverse

469
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,399
that process and then decrypt the um the

470
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,759
passwords in that database in order to

471
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:29,519
print them out and play text what we

472
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:31,519
ended up finding was that not only was

473
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,399
this

474
00:16:32,399 --> 00:16:34,560
managed engine plus machine designed as

475
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,279
a testbed to scan this infrastructure

476
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:38,959
was also

477
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,639
designed to scan a bunch of other

478
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:42,160
different machines or different networks

479
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,440
within

480
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:45,440
the authorities of misa as it pertained

481
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,519
to them being a

482
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:49,600
state-sponsored msp

483
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,600
and so we from there we were able to

484
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:52,959
tunnel through misa gain a bunch of

485
00:16:52,959 --> 00:16:54,639
other infrastructure gain access to

486
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,120
amiri flight gain access to manae

487
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,800
mofa uh

488
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,000
qatari foundation and moi so

489
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,679
it was a pretty significant um

490
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,160
access that that it obtained and allowed

491
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:09,760
for us to gain access to

492
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,280
pretty much every military and

493
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:13,199
government entity within the country of

494
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:14,559
qatar

495
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,079
there was different area of jurisdiction

496
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:18,319
within different countries they wanted

497
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:19,760
access to this they wanted access to

498
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:23,039
that and the whole entire goal was to

499
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:25,280
in that capacity was to gain access to

500
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:27,919
moi so it was assumed that the ministry

501
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:29,919
of interior if there was money being

502
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:31,200
funneled out of the country was

503
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:33,600
happening through there

504
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,799
and then in other countries

505
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,559
you know it might have been like nuclear

506
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:39,840
research that might have been happening

507
00:17:39,840 --> 00:17:41,600
against you know within the country of

508
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:44,160
iran so targeting different

509
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,320
university researchers and so on and so

510
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:49,280
forth was our main area of jurisdiction

511
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,400
uh so

512
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:52,160
intel requests at that point in the

513
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:53,840
country guitar started deviating from

514
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,160
our mission plan and they wanted flight

515
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,440
patterns for

516
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,400
the uh qatari rural family and so on and

517
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,200
so forth and those became you know kind

518
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,559
of suspicious so um as we started asking

519
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:08,559
more and more questions that's when the

520
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:10,799
initial deviation started between or

521
00:18:10,799 --> 00:18:12,880
when when the um

522
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:15,760
when the exit strategy began to get put

523
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,400
into play for moving away from um

524
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,600
cyberpoint as a a contracting agent and

525
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,600
then moved into dark matter

526
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:24,880
and so dark matter you go to their

527
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,320
website take a look

528
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,400
they are state-sponsored organization

529
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,600
for the country of the uae to perform

530
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:34,000
actions against um foreign intelligence

531
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:36,240
organizations apart from the uae

532
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,840
they are just an offensive intelligence

533
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:39,600
shop whether or not it be intelligence

534
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,120
gathering intelligence collection

535
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,200
offensive operations

536
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,120
research exploitation development so on

537
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,600
and so forth um it's been a while since

538
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,440
i've done my own research against this

539
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:50,799
organization

540
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:52,320
but from what i understand they're not

541
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,840
the primary organization doing this has

542
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,039
been broken up into a bunch of different

543
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,039
groups now so if you still are

544
00:18:57,039 --> 00:18:58,480
interested in doing that research

545
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,600
there's a bunch of different people that

546
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,120
you can talk to even within about the

547
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,559
united states that are continuing to do

548
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:04,000
that research you might be able to ask

549
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,520
them different questions

550
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:06,880
but for instance you go to the site and

551
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,240
you take a look at it

552
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:10,160
there's no links if they're a commercial

553
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,799
organization uh you would expect to see

554
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,039
some type of way to

555
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:17,360
hire them for their business a way to

556
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,559
perform different actions but there's

557
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:20,240
nothing on their website to be able to

558
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:21,440
reach out to them

559
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,440
so um

560
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:24,640
uh that was a that's a pretty

561
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:25,840
significant indicator that an

562
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:28,880
organization may not be legitimate

563
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:29,679
so

564
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,080
um again dark matter and departure when

565
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:33,760
raven was created in 2009 i would www a

566
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:36,160
little cyber expertise

567
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:38,160
and over the course of five to ten years

568
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:40,320
mri intelligence officers

569
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:41,440
were skilled enough to take over

570
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,880
documents um shown and in 2013

571
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:48,640
uh the uae really went into and hired

572
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:51,280
cyberpoint in order to bring them over

573
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:52,720
to the uae in order from those

574
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:54,640
operations in late 2015 the power

575
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,280
dynamic of the villa shifted as uae grew

576
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:58,640
more uncomfortable with the core

577
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,919
national security program being

578
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:02,159
controlled by foreigners so we kept

579
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,240
telling them no we can't do that if you

580
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,400
see an isis or a kind of personnel move

581
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,679
into the country the united states we

582
00:20:07,679 --> 00:20:09,840
can't track them we can't follow them if

583
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:11,280
they use a piece of infrastructure that

584
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:12,400
is within the boundaries of the united

585
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,679
states we don't have permission to gain

586
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:16,480
access to that so it was it was some of

587
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:18,320
this stuff was really slowed down and

588
00:20:18,320 --> 00:20:20,880
that was one of the main um

589
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,720
one of the main uh i would say driving

590
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,880
forces to move away from using

591
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:27,760
uh u.s sponsored personnel and um

592
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,919
contracting organizations

593
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:30,640
so

594
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,000
we were really told either you're

595
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,320
joining here or you're leaving obviously

596
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,840
people who are loyal to the united

597
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:37,760
states are not going to do that we're

598
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:39,280
going to so we we jumped ship and came

599
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,200
back to the u.s

600
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,360
so some of the lessons learned in my

601
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,600
capacity would be if it's too good to be

602
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,120
true if you're giving too much money if

603
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:48,000
you're going to different spot

604
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,520
everything seems to be wonderful and

605
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,640
perfect

606
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:52,559
it's too good to be true

607
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,080
vet your leadership that was one of the

608
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:56,480
main things that i learned out of this i

609
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,360
did some leadersh some research on the

610
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:00,960
leadership on the ground there

611
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,960
and they came back and said yes they're

612
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:04,799
known they're aware of them

613
00:21:04,799 --> 00:21:06,320
i should have dug more deeper into that

614
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,760
because after i left i asked even more

615
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,440
questions into that and of course there

616
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:10,640
were stories that came out of that that

617
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,640
i should have been

618
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:15,440
aware of or cognizant to

619
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,760
if you move to a foreign country and

620
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,840
they take your passport for any period

621
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,240
of time other than 24 hours that should

622
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:23,760
be pretty significant and pretty it

623
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,760
should worry you a lot

624
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,120
always ask for printed and signed

625
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:28,720
documentation of your authorities to

626
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,520
perform operations for in especially if

627
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,880
those authorities are signed by the

628
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,400
state department so you can vet to make

629
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,600
sure that that you actually have

630
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,200
permissions to be doing that documents

631
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,200
i'm sorry to be doing that work

632
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,440
um as in you're doing construction work

633
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,480
you're building something out you

634
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,280
measure twice you cut once i've really

635
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,000
learned ask twice hack once make sure

636
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,200
that you're hacking the right targets

637
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:50,240
make sure you have permission to be

638
00:21:50,240 --> 00:21:53,039
doing that remember your training that's

639
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,799
that's really important too if you get

640
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,440
those hairs standing up on your arms you

641
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:59,520
start to feel really uncomfortable um

642
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,600
you need to step back and say my spidey

643
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,200
sense is going off here i need to i need

644
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,400
to to

645
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:06,480
to change what i'm doing have an exit

646
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,240
strategy if you move overseas to work

647
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:09,919
overseas and you don't have an exit

648
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:11,360
strategy you don't have a plan to get

649
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,280
out of there that's that's pretty

650
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:15,679
important part of this process

651
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:16,880
whether or not your organization that

652
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,400
you're working with provide you an exit

653
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,919
strategy you also need one yourself

654
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:24,159
it's always important family is your

655
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:26,320
most important asset if you move over

656
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,320
somewhere else by yourself and is your

657
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:30,480
intent to live there long term

658
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,159
awesome that's great if you move over

659
00:22:32,159 --> 00:22:34,320
somewhere else with a family make sure

660
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,840
that you know what to expect when you

661
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,280
get there what's going to happen the

662
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,600
first two weeks is 60 days

663
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:41,520
and and if you're going to have enough

664
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,559
food if you're going to have enough

665
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,400
money and if you don't have enough money

666
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,840
what is your backup plan in the event

667
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,600
that you don't um

668
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,919
it is uh it's really important it's a it

669
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,360
was a really good

670
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,600
lesson to learn for our family

671
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:56,320
again here's our citations

672
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,400
and uh if you have any questions and
