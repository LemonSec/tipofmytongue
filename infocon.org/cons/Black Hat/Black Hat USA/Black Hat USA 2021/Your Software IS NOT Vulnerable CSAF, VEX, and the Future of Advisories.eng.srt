2
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:17,920
we are super excited to present you this

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:20,000
international collaboration on the

4
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,039
future of security advisories and how it

5
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,240
lies together with current trends in

6
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,160
security and supply chain

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,760
this torque is not about s-bomb

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,480
you all know ellen my colleague here

9
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,879
as the guy who won't shut up about

10
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,520
s-bomb but

11
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:44,239
today he won't talk about it and that's

12
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:47,600
a good thing as f-bomb is now in

13
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,320
everyone's mind and it's it's not like

14
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:52,800
noble now so

15
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,879
ellen what are we going to talk about

16
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:57,520
today so instead we're going to be

17
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,000
talking about vulnerabilities now this

18
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,079
is black hat we all know we all love

19
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:03,520
vulnerabilities

20
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,320
some of them are fancy and have logos

21
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,159
and theme music and rolled out press

22
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,280
releases

23
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,799
some of them are kept hidden uh and you

24
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:15,119
use them as your special stash uh when

25
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:19,200
you're on uh in operation uh but uh

26
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,040
really a lot of what we wanna talk about

27
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,520
today is the known vulnerabilities um

28
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,640
and frankly in security world known

29
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:30,799
vulnerabilities should be among the

30
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:33,680
easiest parts right it doesn't require a

31
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,960
particular approach a particular

32
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:36,960
expertise because we already

33
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,479
should know about them and you know of

34
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:39,360
course

35
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:41,520
bad guys know about them too

36
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,200
um now we're going to know a lot more

37
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,520
about potential vulnerabilities down the

38
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,840
road for certain reasons that we won't

39
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,920
get into here there is going to be more

40
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,320
visibility into our entire software

41
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:56,640
supply chain stack what we want to get

42
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,880
to and the starting point is how do we

43
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,200
communicate vulnerabilities

44
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,200
and again if these are known there is

45
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,360
going to be some frame of reference most

46
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,160
common is cve common vulnerable

47
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:10,878
enumerations um but of course there

48
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:13,040
might be other vulnerability databases

49
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:15,120
uh there may be private ones that you

50
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,640
subscribe to

51
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,319
if you want to know more about that and

52
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,920
why you can't rely on certain of the

53
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,599
more commonly used ones

54
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:23,280
go talk to jay coons he'll tell you all

55
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,319
about it

56
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,440
but essentially the focus is we have a

57
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,040
common frame of reference or frames of

58
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,440
reference to communicate vulnerabilities

59
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,200
but suppose we don't just want to know

60
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,360
what they are we also want to be able to

61
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,360
communicate which versions are affected

62
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,440
a little more details um what

63
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,160
remediations are there well we have

64
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:44,160
security advisories and so we're going

65
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,160
to be spending some time talking to you

66
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:48,720
today about security advisories but

67
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,800
before we get into that

68
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,440
um i want to point out a very common

69
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:55,280
thing that allows far too many folks in

70
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,080
security forget which is that

71
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,959
not all vulnerabilities are actually

72
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:03,200
exploitable or actually uh you know

73
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,800
things that bad guys can use now i'm not

74
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,720
talking about vulnerabilities that

75
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:08,640
aren't exploited in the wild that's a

76
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,879
very interesting problem there's lots of

77
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,720
great exciting research that's coming

78
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,040
out uh about how to predict which ones

79
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,360
are actually being exploited

80
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:18,560
but what we're talking about is

81
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,360
exploitable so for example

82
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,799
openssl 1.0.1 also known as the code in

83
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,159
which we found the heartlead bug um

84
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:30,080
he has depend on how you measure it

85
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:32,239
between 600 and a thousand different

86
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:34,159
function calls you can make

87
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,680
two of them

88
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,840
actually call the code uh the heartbeat

89
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,200
function that then allows a reading of

90
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,959
random memory space that you're worried

91
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:45,760
about to go fix it so

92
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,360
you know if you're only using heartbleed

93
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,040
or heart the the if you're only using

94
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,280
openssl for say the pseudo random number

95
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,120
generator i don't know why you would use

96
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:55,200
an slc or random number generator uh if

97
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,280
there's a freestanding function but

98
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,760
this wouldn't affect your code and some

99
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,879
estimates uh from from vendors say

100
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:03,920
actually

101
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,480
the amount of vulnerable code that's

102
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,120
actually affected is quite low you know

103
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:11,439
some put it below 10

104
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:13,599
of vulnerable libraries that once you're

105
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,680
using them the vulnerability actually is

106
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,918
manifest in the code

107
00:04:17,918 --> 00:04:20,798
so we need a way to communicate

108
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:23,759
that your product is not affected so for

109
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:26,320
example um the

110
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,040
zephyr uh iot

111
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,280
uh real-time operating system that's an

112
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:32,880
open source project produced by the

113
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,560
linux foundation or part linux

114
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,479
foundation um when the amnesia 33

115
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:40,320
vulnerability with its fancy logo some

116
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,639
great research by jasof and forescout uh

117
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:43,759
came out

118
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,440
the good folks in the zephyr project

119
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,639
said hey

120
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:48,240
let's actually make sure that's not

121
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,440
affected because this is supposed to

122
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,919
affect you know potentially tens of

123
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:54,240
millions of iot devices so they wanted

124
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,560
to say ours were not effective so they

125
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,960
did the work and they had to produce uh

126
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,560
and they released a statement saying you

127
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,479
know we heard about this

128
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,560
um we had even had advanced notice

129
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,240
because we're you know doing good

130
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:08,560
vulnerability coordination multi-party

131
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,320
coordination we analyzed these

132
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,199
vulnerabilities we looked at the

133
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,440
effective code and we determined that

134
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,560
our project was not affected now that's

135
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,720
great that's exactly what good product

136
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,160
security teams

137
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,680
should be doing the challenge is that uh

138
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,360
this doesn't really scale

139
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:27,440
so imagine

140
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,600
if you're using zephyr on your plant

141
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,720
we've got a bunch of different things

142
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,560
that you need to map that to but also

143
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,919
you're using a whole bunch of other

144
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:35,840
devices on your plan

145
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:36,560
so

146
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:38,639
you've got uh

147
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,800
five vendors 10 vendors hundreds of

148
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,960
vendors when you talk to

149
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,240
shops that are more than just uh basic

150
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,080
office shops you're gonna find out that

151
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,160
they're using hundreds or even thousands

152
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,000
of different suppliers

153
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,240
so doing this is going to be quite

154
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,280
tricky so how do we communicate

155
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,199
that a device or piece of software is

156
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:03,680
not actually exploitable

157
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,800
and the answer is a new idea called the

158
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:09,440
vulnerability exploitability exchange or

159
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,120
vexed

160
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,360
now a couple of things to clarify about

161
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,400
vex

162
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,039
first is while the term exploitable is

163
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,280
in the name um

164
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:22,240
we're a little too uh experienced in

165
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,080
infosec to want to get into a

166
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,000
discussionary debate about exactly what

167
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,919
we mean by exploitable we'd much rather

168
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:30,000
talk about what our favorite text editor

169
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,560
is and why it's better than yours so

170
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,080
we're going to be using the term

171
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,440
affected

172
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:38,400
um not gosh allen is really pretentious

173
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,800
and affected but do i need to do

174
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,840
anything

175
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,960
so another way of defining it is that

176
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:47,039
a software a piece of software is

177
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,199
affected by a vulnerability if there are

178
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:50,960
really any actions that are needed or

179
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:53,039
recommended to remediate or address this

180
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,440
now the actions could just include

181
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,759
learning more about the vulnerability uh

182
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,000
making a system to patch apply defense

183
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,360
in depth there are a lot of things it

184
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,120
could just be as simple as

185
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,280
hey you remember when we explicitly told

186
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,080
you

187
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,520
not to plug your product into the

188
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,479
internet

189
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:09,840
could you please make sure that you

190
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,680
follow that very simple step

191
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,880
um so it really covers any side things

192
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:17,280
now the opposite of affected is of

193
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,000
course not affected and this means

194
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,199
you're good

195
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:23,280
no remediation is required for this

196
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,840
vulnerability now this could be because

197
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,680
the vulnerable software is executed

198
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,199
could mean that the vulnerable code was

199
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,360
excluded uh

200
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,440
from in the compiler which just didn't

201
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,960
just didn't include it in the compiling

202
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,280
or do conditional compiling statements

203
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,039
could be that existing security controls

204
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:41,520
make it impossible exploit uh could be

205
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,280
the vulnerable code was fixed by the

206
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:44,800
downstream developer there are a lot of

207
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,280
different reasons that we can go into um

208
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,319
but we're not going to touch on just now

209
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:52,000
so what do we actually need for vex we

210
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,840
don't need that much

211
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,400
we need apart from a slightly better

212
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,720
name than vex but it's one we're going

213
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,720
with for the moment so we need a

214
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,720
descriptive data model for the software

215
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:04,080
right how do i talk about what i'm

216
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,280
talking about

217
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,240
and we need this vulnerability status

218
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,560
starting off with high level right

219
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,639
affected or not affected and then moving

220
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,599
on

221
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:16,479
uh and it needs to be machine readable

222
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:18,400
and it needs to be automatable

223
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:20,400
so what are the fields that we have here

224
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,240
well we need the metadata you know where

225
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,160
did this information come from who's the

226
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:26,960
author uh right what's the time stamp

227
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:28,639
what products are we talking about so

228
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:30,000
for example we could talk about multiple

229
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,520
different products and then for each

230
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,760
product um there might be

231
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:35,519
vulnerabilities that we want to say

232
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:37,039
what's the id what are some of the

233
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:39,120
vulnerability details what's the status

234
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,719
effect they're not affected and then

235
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:41,599
either

236
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:43,279
an action statement which is what other

237
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:45,120
mediations what i need to do

238
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:45,839
or

239
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,000
uh an impact statement which is why

240
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,200
you're not affected so having some ideas

241
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,160
now

242
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:54,880
that sounds a lot

243
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:57,040
like a security advisory now you

244
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,959
remember security advisors right you

245
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,040
probably had one

246
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:02,720
or two

247
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:04,320
or three

248
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,800
or many that you've had to deal with in

249
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,080
your life and that's one of the big

250
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:10,240
challenges is security advisories

251
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:13,279
proliferate so now we're proposing a new

252
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,200
idea which is that we should have

253
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,000
negative security advisories uh where we

254
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
can sort of convey in addition to is

255
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
affected we're trying to use the same

256
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,839
idea but saying

257
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:26,399
uh let's have a security advisory that

258
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,000
communicates that something is

259
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,760
potentially not affected

260
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,839
as ellen has told us

261
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:36,080
we should look into security advisories

262
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:39,600
first and see what is already there

263
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,240
so we have a lot of different vendors

264
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,480
here but as you can see there are

265
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,080
different websites

266
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,399
and it doesn't really

267
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,000
has this this part of automation in it

268
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:55,120
and it gets even worse if you look into

269
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,240
the single security advisory then

270
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,800
you have them in different file formats

271
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,519
so html pdf text

272
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:04,959
and

273
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:07,360
you also have them in in all of

274
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,800
different

275
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:11,760
specifications so

276
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:14,480
the the one puts your your affected

277
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,440
products um on top and then

278
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,000
puts all the other text blobs below and

279
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,120
it gets all different structures here

280
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,959
and it's not really machine readable

281
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:27,120
it's built for humans to read them and

282
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:30,000
it has all this fancy corporate design

283
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,320
in it

284
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,959
so what could we do

285
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:39,279
at first we should take a look at our

286
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,560
timeline of disclosure

287
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:45,600
our timeline of concern is basically

288
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,079
from when the vendor

289
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:50,720
does release a security advisory and

290
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:52,320
then until the asset owner does

291
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,640
something

292
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,000
and

293
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,399
we can shorten that

294
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,000
by looking into the process and put in

295
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
automation

296
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,680
but how do we automate security

297
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,399
advisories well the answer to that is

298
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,200
the common security advisory framework

299
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:12,720
csaf and that's

300
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:15,279
one of the other part which we which is

301
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:16,240
the

302
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,880
main part of our presentation today

303
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,959
um csaf is currently

304
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,000
published in the version 2.0 it's a json

305
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,640
format it is machine readable and it's

306
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,720
really built this automation in mind

307
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:31,519
if you know cvrf

308
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,120
csaf is

309
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,800
its successor

310
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:37,279
and it's standardized in an industry lab

311
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:42,439
process and the oasis open

312
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:47,200
so if you look at the process today

313
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,040
a vendor produces

314
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:52,720
human readable security advisories say

315
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,839
15 advisories with different severity

316
00:11:55,839 --> 00:11:58,480
and then you as a user have to go to the

317
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:01,200
websites find the new or updated

318
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,920
advisories and download them

319
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,480
after you have downloaded them you have

320
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:10,160
to prioritize them um for their criteria

321
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,079
criticality so that you actually

322
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,200
care about the most important first

323
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,480
and then you start with your database

324
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,200
and look into do i have affected devices

325
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,720
if not perfect scratch them off the list

326
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:29,839
and if you have

327
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,000
affected devices you do your risk

328
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,120
assessment and decide what decisions you

329
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:38,240
want to do

330
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:40,480
if we could automate that

331
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,920
well the vendor obviously had to release

332
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,200
machine readable security advisories

333
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,040
and publish them but then really

334
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:52,399
automation kicks in and gets us off the

335
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:53,680
first step

336
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,920
finding these advisories that's that's a

337
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,160
simple and boring task so we should

338
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,600
automate that

339
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:01,760
and get them downloaded but then we get

340
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,440
a second benefit here as the step of do

341
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,440
i have affected devices so the

342
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:10,079
evaluation can also be done

343
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,720
in an automated fashion um

344
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:15,519
so compare that to your asset database

345
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:18,839
and then you got only those

346
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,120
advisories where you all

347
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,200
have effective devices but there's a

348
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,920
second thing here which you can actually

349
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,000
add to the process

350
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,079
as maybe say advisory number nine is

351
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,040
something which is internet facing and

352
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,200
you're really worried about that an

353
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,279
adversary can come in through that

354
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:42,399
vulnerability um you prioritize the

355
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,959
security advisory based on your

356
00:13:44,959 --> 00:13:47,040
infrastructure

357
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:50,160
and maybe number 12 that's something

358
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,160
buried way down in your um

359
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,279
ot network so multiple layers of defense

360
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,160
and depth around that and detection so

361
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,720
that's probably something which you can

362
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,880
worry a little bit later about

363
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,959
and then you do your measures you sift

364
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,399
through the advisories where you have

365
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:11,600
affected devices for and decide what you

366
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,399
want to do with them

367
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:19,120
now you need tools for that to do the

368
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,040
automation and

369
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:23,600
we already defined in the standard two

370
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,760
tools which will help you to do that and

371
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,600
that's the csaf content management

372
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,560
system

373
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,800
on the vendor side

374
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:33,519
and the csev asset matching system on

375
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:36,000
the asset owner so hopefully you can go

376
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,360
in a few months

377
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:40,240
into your commercial of the shelf

378
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:42,800
software provider and get that software

379
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,720
or even have an open source project

380
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,720
which provides that software to you

381
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:49,920
but

382
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:53,839
what are the benefits here well we are

383
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,320
reducing the human workload

384
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:59,199
we don't have to search this this boring

385
00:14:59,199 --> 00:15:02,079
search stuff for new advisories

386
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,959
we can easily determine the affected

387
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,600
devices we can even delegate

388
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,440
um this decision process to those

389
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:15,199
business units who actually we are

390
00:15:15,199 --> 00:15:18,079
responsible for the devices

391
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,639
and we see only the relevant advisories

392
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:22,800
as it is machine readable you don't have

393
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:25,600
to worry about the corporate design

394
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,399
stuff so it's scalable across vendors

395
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,160
and you can do your risk assessment

396
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:32,800
based on your own environment

397
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,959
but how does that help us in the supply

398
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:35,920
chain

399
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,880
well every supplier is a user

400
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,839
so if you look at our supply chain a

401
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:44,079
little bit more upstream than we had

402
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:45,519
before

403
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:48,000
then you see the supplier is basically

404
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,079
doing the same as the vendor

405
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:53,279
so he also releases an advisory and then

406
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,639
the vendor becomes aware of the

407
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:56,079
vulnerability

408
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:57,040
so

409
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,079
let's look at that time frame now

410
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:04,240
and see how it might help there

411
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,120
since if we could automate that part it

412
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,839
would go much further through the supply

413
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:10,880
chain

414
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:11,600
so

415
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,720
we have

416
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,639
similar benefits here

417
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,600
um we can scale that across our

418
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,560
suppliers um we don't have to do this

419
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:23,519
this um searching for security

420
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:25,920
advisories manually

421
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:27,600
um we can

422
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,639
determine our affected devices easily

423
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,959
and we can even delegate that to the

424
00:16:32,959 --> 00:16:36,160
product owners and make them responsible

425
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:39,120
to look out for security

426
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:41,759
and we can automate our advisory

427
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,040
creation

428
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,560
now

429
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,519
if you have s-bombs internally which you

430
00:16:47,519 --> 00:16:50,720
already should then you could already

431
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,720
automate that

432
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,639
but um what does that mean for vex

433
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,599
so this is great news for vex because

434
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,240
now we're working on putting vex as a

435
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:13,439
profile in csaf uh this is great news

436
00:17:13,439 --> 00:17:15,439
because now we can use the same

437
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,760
infrastructure the same systems that

438
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,280
we're using for

439
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:22,400
uh csaf to communicate vex and also to

440
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,880
ingest facts so we're building on an

441
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,559
existing system now there may be other

442
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:28,720
ways that we can implement vex as well

443
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:31,600
uh so for example inside cyclone dx

444
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,960
but really the vex profile allows great

445
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:36,880
scaling across organizations and to

446
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,080
integrate it into this work as well now

447
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:42,320
part of the benefit here is that your

448
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,120
product security team is already doing

449
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,880
this work now that's a core assumption

450
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:49,200
we're saying that um for this to work

451
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,960
you need to have a product security team

452
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:52,880
and that they have some process for

453
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:55,360
analyzing vulnerability data um

454
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,760
if your organization does not have a

455
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,280
product security team and you don't have

456
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:00,799
the ability to analyze vulnerability

457
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,039
data for your product um it's a little

458
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,799
late in the talk to say this but

459
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,799
please stop watching this right now and

460
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,320
spend the next five or ten minutes

461
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:09,840
working on that that really is a

462
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:12,799
priority once you have that um then we

463
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,559
say well listen you're already doing

464
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:16,720
this already so there's some advantages

465
00:18:16,720 --> 00:18:18,160
here uh

466
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,600
to actually making this information

467
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,559
public um core one is this can save on

468
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,480
customer support so if you can

469
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,160
communicate downstream uh that there is

470
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,000
no vulnerability that doesn't affect

471
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,120
your product it means that your

472
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:33,200
customers won't be bothering you and

473
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,799
i've talked to countless vendors who

474
00:18:34,799 --> 00:18:37,520
when a major vulnerability comes out uh

475
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:39,039
the first thing that happens the next

476
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,559
morning is they get calls from all their

477
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,400
major customers saying hey are you

478
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,720
affected have you fixed this yet and so

479
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,480
having an automated way to communicate

480
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,039
that will be very very helpful and in

481
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:50,799
fact there's a field we didn't touch on

482
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,039
which says this is under research we

483
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:54,720
know about this and we're actively

484
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,160
trying to figure it out so that

485
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,840
customers will be able to look and know

486
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:59,280
that an automated response is gonna be

487
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:00,559
coming soon

488
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:02,640
uh and in fact when i've talked to some

489
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,320
vendors they've sort of announced hey

490
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:06,799
even when vendor when uh vulnerabilities

491
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:08,400
are announced in our competitors

492
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,360
products people still ask us so there

493
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,280
may be companies that will want to issue

494
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,280
an affirmative denial even if this pro

495
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,640
even if a vulnerability isn't anywhere

496
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,400
near their product they may say hey

497
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,559
listen um we're going to affirmatively

498
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:21,840
say that it's not even though there's no

499
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,400
reason anyone would expect so

500
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:26,799
the other approach here is that

501
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:28,480
this data is coming straight from the

502
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,600
source

503
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,760
but the source can vary

504
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:34,320
one of the fields in csaf is and one of

505
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,480
the benefits of csaf is anyone can issue

506
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,480
a security advisory and it's up to the

507
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,400
customer to decide which to trust and

508
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,000
which not to trust because there is some

509
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,640
mechanism for authenticity in there so

510
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,360
the vision is that you know ideally the

511
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:48,799
product security team will say this is

512
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:50,240
effective it's not affected but there's

513
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,600
plenty of room for other people as well

514
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:53,600
this is a great opportunity for security

515
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,200
researchers to talk about things to

516
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:57,440
validate that they've got the expertise

517
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,600
um and for security companies and

518
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,600
security vendors to say you know what we

519
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:03,919
can do value add for vulnerability

520
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:05,919
management process or for prioritization

521
00:20:05,919 --> 00:20:08,080
process and we can provide real value

522
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,600
for our customers not just in which

523
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,480
vulnerabilities they should pay

524
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:12,240
attention to but which ones they

525
00:20:12,240 --> 00:20:13,200
shouldn't

526
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,360
and in fact we're implementing this

527
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:17,919
today or we're starting to in

528
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:20,080
not the most advanced it sector in the

529
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,400
world although some of the major leading

530
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,640
tech vendors are working on implementing

531
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:26,640
csaf and vex but

532
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,000
i think even more impressive we're

533
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,080
seeing this being implemented by

534
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,840
healthcare providers and by medical

535
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,000
device manufacturers not a not

536
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,840
necessarily the sector that you think of

537
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:39,520
as the vanguard of you know high-end

538
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:41,600
cyber security investment but it is a

539
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:44,000
community where one security is very

540
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:46,240
important and two

541
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,960
uh patching can actually and security

542
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,200
updates imposes a real cost right you

543
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,120
need to take things offline you may not

544
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,760
want to do it on a live network um and

545
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:57,440
that means potentially saying well now

546
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:59,200
i've got to find you know a way of

547
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,960
caring for this patient while i take

548
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,720
this important device and make sure that

549
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,480
it's updated so the security management

550
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,720
uh can accident patient care the more

551
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,200
efficient and automated we can make that

552
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,480
it's going to have real benefits not

553
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:12,559
just for security but for literal human

554
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,960
health and safety

555
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,760
so i think we've got this problem

556
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:21,840
completely solved right thomas

557
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,520
well

558
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,720
alan nearly solved we still need you the

559
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,559
audience to

560
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:35,679
help us to make that work

561
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,679
and now i know what you're you're going

562
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:38,880
to say

563
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:41,039
um well security

564
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:42,320
nice to work

565
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,000
um i probably do that next month well

566
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,240
here are three actions for you which you

567
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,559
can start doing right now

568
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,280
well the first one pretty easy request

569
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,039
your suppliers to provide their

570
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,520
advisories and csaf so that you can

571
00:21:57,520 --> 00:22:01,280
actually automate it process them

572
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,840
and if you write a security advisory

573
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,640
provide that at csaf there's already

574
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,039
tools out there which you can use one of

575
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:10,799
them is segfasgram

576
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:12,480
and they also

577
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:14,240
give you the

578
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:17,679
human readable advisory for free so

579
00:22:17,679 --> 00:22:19,440
it's nothing different than writing an

580
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,039
advisory for you

581
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,760
just putting him in in a machine

582
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,200
readable format

583
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,320
and the third and most important one is

584
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:31,120
spreader word so we put in some hashtags

585
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:34,000
for you to use on twitter or any social

586
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,880
platform you want to use that on

587
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,120
and please don't forget about sbone

588
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,039
let's sum it up

589
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,520
the numbers of vulnerabilities

590
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,080
discovered is rising

591
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:49,120
and that's

592
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,840
good for for the security researchers

593
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:54,880
who discover them and it's good for us

594
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,400
who are actually getting that

595
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,039
vulnerabilities fixed and we get better

596
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:01,440
insights in our supply chains

597
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:04,640
so we will have more advisories over

598
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:06,080
time

599
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:08,080
and we really need those advisories to

600
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,880
make this risk-based decisions as alan

601
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,919
has told us um also in healthcare sector

602
00:23:13,919 --> 00:23:16,320
where patient care is

603
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:19,280
related to security but also in other

604
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:20,720
sectors as well

605
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,280
our manual process which we deal today

606
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,159
with

607
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:25,919
it doesn't really scale

608
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:29,120
but automation is possible so go ahead

609
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:30,799
automate boring stuff

610
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,960
and also publish the no not a factor to

611
00:23:34,960 --> 00:23:36,559
save your

612
00:23:36,559 --> 00:23:39,520
support hotline the questions and inform

613
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,400
your customers in a timely manner

614
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:46,080
come join us here and help us um or

615
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,720
offer constructive criticism we're open

616
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,400
to that and we look forward to having

617
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,960
you join the conversation

618
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:57,360
thank you

619
00:23:57,760 --> 00:24:00,240
thank you
