1
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,279
we've got beer and you don't

2
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:11,040
that's not fair

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,599
how do you know i like that hey i'm jeff

4
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:14,960
moss we're going to take off our masks

5
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,960
here because we're socially distanced

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:19,760
and vaccinated

7
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,320
and i want to welcome you to our lock

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,080
note on day one

9
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:25,760
and for those of you who haven't been to

10
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:28,080
one of these before it's kind of casual

11
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:30,720
and the idea we have is we want you to

12
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:33,440
feel like you're listening to us have a

13
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,640
conversation arguing joking

14
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,239
and uh

15
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:39,520
we're trying to get it a couple of

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:41,280
different things that are either

17
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:43,280
controversial or buzz words or trends

18
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:44,719
that they've spotted

19
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,000
while they're doing their work on the

20
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,520
review board reviewing hundreds of

21
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,719
submissions

22
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,960
looking for trends but then also toward

23
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,160
the end we'll open it up to questions

24
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:54,399
and answers from the audience and so

25
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,320
it's meant to be pretty casual

26
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,120
and

27
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,440
and we just we're looking forward to it

28
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:00,960
so i'm going to start um by introducing

29
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,399
everybody on my

30
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:05,680
right is jay healy at uh columbia

31
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,640
and then next to him is stephanie domas

32
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,240
from intel

33
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,560
i'm jeff moss kimberly price consultant

34
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,400
and neil weiler grifter from rsa

35
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,360
so says the bio

36
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,200
all right so um i want to start it off

37
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,560
with just some general conversations and

38
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,400
normally what we do is we sit in a table

39
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,320
before this and we say who has a good

40
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,320
topic as soon as we start arguing with

41
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,400
each other we stop the conversation and

42
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,479
try to keep it bottled up for when we

43
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,119
come out here so the first one

44
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,680
that sort of kicked that off

45
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,479
was based on the keynote this morning

46
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:45,119
it got to an interesting point of

47
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,200
okay so who's responsible for solving

48
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,960
keynote i mean keynote well i know who's

49
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,280
responsible for the keynote

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,840
drink

51
00:01:56,799 --> 00:01:59,040
who's responsible for supply chain it is

52
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,159
those

53
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:02,079
closest to the levers like if you're

54
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,320
closest to the build environment you are

55
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,719
responsible is it the ceo

56
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,560
where do you where does the the

57
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:10,479
responsibility lie

58
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:12,560
and we're gonna kick that off yeah i

59
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,280
don't i mean i'll i'll just jump in uh

60
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:16,800
where i i thought it was interesting

61
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,920
that matt said that he was like okay um

62
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,480
his opinion was that it was up to the

63
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,599
platform developers um which to me

64
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:27,840
like just made me go

65
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,000
oh we're screwed right like right like

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,599
i'm like oh totally the only one that's

67
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,000
gonna save us is apple amazon microsoft

68
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,800
or right i mean is that what he's saying

69
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,080
or is it all the middleware

70
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,920
manufacturers that produce middleware

71
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,040
that we've never heard of that are

72
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,040
making the technology

73
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,560
that's fair you know because when you're

74
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,760
talking about like like what

75
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,440
dependencies lie all between all those

76
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:48,720
different things like how do you even

77
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,239
begin to have that conversation about

78
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,080
who's responsible

79
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,599
you know like who's responsible when

80
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,840
everybody is responsible

81
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:58,080
right and that's the thing is you know

82
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,159
you mentioned are we waiting for apple

83
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:01,680
you know one of the fang companies

84
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,480
microsoft whatever

85
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,560
the reality is people have been talking

86
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,440
about this since 2014 about securing

87
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,519
supply chain about securing open source

88
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,680
and it's always been a theoretical risk

89
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,920
and it's really complicated and really

90
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,080
expensive and it really doesn't help

91
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:20,239
this quarter's profits

92
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:22,480
so the problem is too abstract nobody's

93
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,040
doing it nobody's doing it correctly yet

94
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,080
and

95
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,680
i've had a lot of rage for the last

96
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,599
month over this quite frankly

97
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,959
you know i'm watching incident response

98
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,120
teams around the world um burn out after

99
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,120
all of the pressure of covid and now

100
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,920
ransomware and and leaders are acting

101
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,560
like it's such a shock oh my gosh who

102
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:48,799
could have seen this company all of us

103
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,720
saw it coming like all of us saw it

104
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:52,239
coming and nobody wanted to listen

105
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:54,080
remember when ransomware was limited by

106
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,840
your cpu i mean we all knew ransomware

107
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,080
was a thing but it's like it was a 386

108
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:00,080
and you could not encrypt the drive fast

109
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,599
enough right and you could open the

110
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:04,480
floppy drive to stop it but that's no

111
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,720
longer the case and now people are

112
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,959
forced to care

113
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,560
right and so

114
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,720
so i like what he was uh also what matt

115
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,640
said about um

116
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,040
as a foundation code signing

117
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,918
right you have to start somewhere and um

118
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:21,199
and so i guess that's going to move us

119
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,280
to our first buzzword

120
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,639
bingo

121
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:27,639
s-bomb

122
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:29,840
i'll take that one okay

123
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,638
um so

124
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,960
there are people who are hardcore

125
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:37,919
against s-bomb i think it's a road map

126
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,919
for the attackers i'm sorry the

127
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,160
attackers don't don't need our s-bombs

128
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,120
for that um i'm i'm taking a much more

129
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,440
pragmatic view of it there's there's two

130
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:50,800
scenarios where i think s-bomb helps

131
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,639
the first one is

132
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:55,440
the incident response team doesn't know

133
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,360
what they don't know they don't know

134
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,520
what open source and what third party

135
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,440
components are in their enterprise so

136
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:03,199
they can't defend it

137
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:05,440
so something you know

138
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,560
happens

139
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,720
and a supplier gets breached and

140
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,320
everyone's running around going do we

141
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,560
use that yeah so but so so s-bomb is

142
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,199
like step one of a 50-step program is

143
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,880
what you're saying it's forcing

144
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,919
inventory right in in organizations that

145
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:23,199
are like oh it's complicated um and and

146
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,720
it's the same thing you're seeing

147
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,680
vendors have the same reaction to we

148
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,759
don't know what's in our systems that

149
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:31,759
hospitals have been having for years

150
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,000
with grifter was you was mentioned that

151
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,440
if you go down and look at the vendors

152
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:37,360
they're like they're all busy telling

153
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,199
you what you own on your network

154
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:40,800
yeah well i mean that's the i mean

155
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,560
that's the thing is we uh we when we

156
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,960
talked about it briefly but just um

157
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,639
it's difficult to secure things if you

158
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,080
don't even know you have them right so

159
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:50,479
doing asset management is the first part

160
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:52,400
of all of this right and we've been

161
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,880
trying to do that for 30 years as well

162
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:57,199
um but it's it it sounds like it should

163
00:05:57,199 --> 00:05:59,280
be simple right you know yeah oh yeah

164
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,440
yeah you person out there for agreeing

165
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:03,280
with me i like you person who agrees

166
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:05,600
with me um so

167
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,039
so like we've been trying to do this

168
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:09,280
this thing and and it does sound like

169
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,120
it's something easy but when you're

170
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,120
acquiring a company company after

171
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,240
company and then you're like i don't

172
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:16,160
even know what they had but quickly i

173
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:18,000
want to see you do asset inventory on

174
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,680
your third-party provider i'd like to

175
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:22,319
see that inventory for your house jeff

176
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,840
yes

177
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:26,479
but i think asset inventory s-bomb is

178
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,400
the asset inventory of your code base

179
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,160
sure like

180
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,479
do we use free type i don't know do you

181
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,560
use chromium i don't know do you use

182
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,400
electron yeah well then you use free

183
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,800
type and chromium and like 20 other

184
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:40,639
things i i feel like this side is

185
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:43,120
dominating the conversation sorry let's

186
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,039
go to this side

187
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:47,199
i have tons of things to say

188
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:50,000
so back to the first comment

189
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,039
yeah

190
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:53,199
who's responsible and so we kind of look

191
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,800
at some of these big players and say

192
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,319
well you know maybe they're responsible

193
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:57,680
right they own the platform they should

194
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,520
put in security but then i'd push back

195
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,560
and say

196
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,080
there's a lot of security features that

197
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,199
they're putting out there right now that

198
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:05,919
nobody uses nobody turns on nobody

199
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,080
applies patches in a timely manner so

200
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:09,680
we're looking at these big guys and just

201
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,840
saying well protect me please

202
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,199
they're actually putting a lot of knobs

203
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:14,400
at your disposal right now that aren't

204
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:17,280
even being used who uses the txt on your

205
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:19,680
cpu right very few like it's a feature

206
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,400
there but nobody uses it yeah so i mean

207
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,560
there's tons of irresponsibility to go

208
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:26,639
around right now um and then yeah i was

209
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,160
the one making the comment backstage

210
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,360
that i felt like when i walked the

211
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,440
vendor floor half the half of the

212
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:32,880
vendors out there were trying to sell me

213
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:35,039
a solution that helped me do inventory

214
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,039
of what's on my network and i thought

215
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:39,199
that was so fascinating that still like

216
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:41,199
in 2021 one of the biggest struggles is

217
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,120
just trying to figure out what do i even

218
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,360
have on my network and your network is

219
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,720
probably getting smaller because you're

220
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:49,440
outsourcing more of it right

221
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,199
i i might push back on the who's

222
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:53,280
responsible i mean it's a great question

223
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,560
how can you argue against who's

224
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:56,639
responsible but like i'm a sucker for

225
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,840
the olympics i've been watching a lot of

226
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,360
the olympics so sport i've got sports

227
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:00,879
analogies on the mind

228
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,360
and it's not who's responsible well in

229
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,199
addition to who's responsible it's who's

230
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,680
in the position to make the play

231
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,960
right and we can argue about who's

232
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,360
responsible but who's in the position to

233
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,080
actually make the change that we need

234
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,400
at scale because because we can't just

235
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,720
do a billion changes

236
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,639
of all of us making

237
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:22,639
the right configuration error all of us

238
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:24,639
doing you know buying the new vendor

239
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,479
widget that's going to be perfect and we

240
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:28,000
have to buy a billion of them we need to

241
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,440
maintain a billion and we need to train

242
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,720
a billion of we need to integrate a

243
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,039
billion of them

244
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,279
but if we've got some that can be in the

245
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:36,958
position and make one small change and

246
00:08:36,958 --> 00:08:38,240
help a billion

247
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,799
and to a substantial degree that's

248
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,640
that's the platform

249
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,240
um and so

250
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,000
we can like that we can hate that we can

251
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,839
work around it what i liked about matt's

252
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,519
keynote was he wasn't just well we have

253
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:51,200
to trust them and put pressure on to do

254
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,720
the right thing he was also saying on

255
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:55,200
mobile devices we need them to let go of

256
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,560
the control

257
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,560
right that we don't need them to do

258
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:01,200
things better we need them to let go

259
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,279
so now we can take all of the forensics

260
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,120
and all the other telemetry that we do

261
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,640
in windows environments and now we can

262
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,120
do that on on our apple phones

263
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,399
and and the other mobile devices

264
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,120
so that's the um you're not gonna agree

265
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,560
to me this side oh i was hoping i was

266
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,000
gonna get where's that person who yelled

267
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,680
that's team grifter over there

268
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,040
don't say that when i'm drinking man

269
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,880
yeah did you bring your mom so i'm gonna

270
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,240
own the throat

271
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,560
i'll throw baby

272
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,720
i'm gonna throw jaya softball

273
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,240
okay because i'm on the sports analogies

274
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,519
right that's right

275
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:36,480
so

276
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,360
um

277
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,800
jay is fond of saying you know what do

278
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,399
we need to do to make defense greater

279
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:43,040
than offense d greater than o

280
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,880
because it really feels like offense is

281
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,640
just eating defense's lunch and it's

282
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:48,800
just either it's automation or it's the

283
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,440
scale or it's something and so for years

284
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,680
jay's been thinking about what needs to

285
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,200
happen

286
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:57,279
to give defense a chance

287
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:58,800
and uh

288
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,760
give us the d greater than o update 2021

289
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:03,440
edition

290
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,279
um yeah because it was

291
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,880
def con it was 2013 2013 i wrote that

292
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,399
when you wrote that and said boy it

293
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,079
feels like the attackers are running

294
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:14,320
away from it right we hadn't had stuxnet

295
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,760
maybe two years earlier we're just

296
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,519
coming out of out of the revolu

297
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,240
revelations what nsa had been doing um

298
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:23,360
uh that we learned from from snowden and

299
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,600
in dt wrote it feels like offense is

300
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,959
running away from the field and here we

301
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,760
are eight years farther along

302
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:32,399
and it still feels that way

303
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:34,079
right i think

304
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:35,680
and so when we say

305
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:36,640
every time we're thinking about a

306
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:37,680
solution

307
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,279
every time we think about a metric i'm

308
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,399
trying to say is this going to

309
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,480
preferentially aid the defense at scale

310
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,079
or is this going to aid the attackers at

311
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,279
scale

312
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:46,399
and i think

313
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:47,920
we still don't have good metrics for

314
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,399
that i'd be really curious i think on

315
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:52,160
the offensive security side right we can

316
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:54,560
say all right is is what we're doing as

317
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,720
researchers and as a community

318
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,240
and pushing offensive security and

319
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,120
research is that helping

320
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,440
the defenders like if we're releasing a

321
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,959
new tool and say oh by releasing this

322
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:06,800
new tool we'll now know about this and

323
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:07,920
now everybody's going to be able to

324
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,200
patch this and we're going to do better

325
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:11,920
does that actually work

326
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,399
when we do that to improve the security

327
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:16,160
right we're coming up on def con 30 and

328
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:18,399
i still don't know if we know the answer

329
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,000
if what we're doing is making things

330
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,320
more secure

331
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:23,519
yeah i wasn't expecting a whole lot of

332
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:25,360
applause on that one

333
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:27,600
way to bring the room down jay yeah yeah

334
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,040
but you highlight one of the things you

335
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:31,040
know i always see as a trend

336
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:33,040
i mean this year was no different was

337
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:35,920
this emphasis that um how do we optimize

338
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,360
the human i think one of the biggest

339
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,920
challenges in defense is you have humans

340
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,640
overrun by telemetry they have so much

341
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:44,320
information at their disposal and the

342
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,000
signal to noise ratio is is just

343
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,240
literally too high and so there's always

344
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:50,560
this the struggle of how do i optimize

345
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,240
the human and so this year was no

346
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,639
different we had talks about how you

347
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,480
basically all the buzzwords you can

348
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,200
think of right ml ai how do we use this

349
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,120
to optimize the human

350
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,920
and

351
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,920
visualization techniques i saw some new

352
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,000
ones i saw one that was a in the arsenal

353
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,600
that was about how to write pen testing

354
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,920
reports automatically for you so we can

355
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,360
free up the person from having to

356
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,959
actually write a pen testing report like

357
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:14,560
put them on something more important and

358
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:16,320
so that optimizing the human is always

359
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,600
such a really fascinating thing because

360
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,279
at the end of the day i think security

361
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,160
is still rooted in humans

362
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:23,519
the rand

363
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:25,279
defense at nsa for years i'm totally

364
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:27,600
blanking on his name now rob joyce no no

365
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,360
uh um

366
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,560
oh gosh

367
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,959
liking on his name tony sager oh yeah

368
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,800
and tony had this saying the first time

369
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,240
i'd heard it but it was essentially like

370
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,920
you can't win man-to-man there's too

371
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,320
many so you have to automate and so you

372
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,760
spend a whole lot of time trying to

373
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,279
figure out what you can automate as

374
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:44,959
automate as much as you can to free up

375
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,600
the human and then you have to figure

376
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,839
out how to automate everything else

377
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,680
like you cannot have a hope in this

378
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:53,920
world without automation

379
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,200
and i think that goes to what you're

380
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,720
saying either you're going to burn out

381
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,720
your human team you're going to stress

382
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,120
whatever it is like automation is huge

383
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,040
part of it and i don't think people take

384
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,440
that seriously enough

385
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,680
yeah i think it's also um i mean part of

386
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:10,320
the problem is the age-old problem of

387
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,320
offense versus defense is that offense

388
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,480
is sexy and defense is not like right

389
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,639
it's like oh somebody comes out with a

390
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:17,839
new exploit discovers a new

391
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,600
vulnerability and it's like oh what a

392
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,000
rock star they're amazing um you defend

393
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,399
your network successfully

394
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:25,839
good job

395
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,760
you must be offense because you are

396
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,990
pretty sexy

397
00:13:29,990 --> 00:13:31,630
[Applause]

398
00:13:31,630 --> 00:13:32,959
[Music]

399
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:34,160
he's trying he's trying to win over the

400
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,639
grifter side of the crowd yeah he is

401
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:38,560
yeah one person clapped once said you

402
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,560
were sexy one

403
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,560
the uh but yeah i'm curious if it's a

404
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,079
metrics thing so when i think about it

405
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:45,040
it's like

406
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,600
you know when you win with offense

407
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:49,040
you get shell you know there's a

408
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,279
feedback cycle but on defense it's like

409
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:52,480
well

410
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,240
was i just attacked

411
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,480
did i defend myself

412
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,800
like i have no feedback loop to optimize

413
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,560
my defense where the

414
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,800
attackers do and so i think it's just

415
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,000
naturally more prone to automation i

416
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:07,920
think you get that to a degree where

417
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,079
it's like you have you know like maybe

418
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:11,920
uh who knows if it's just all smoke and

419
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,839
mirrors but but you have successfully

420
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:16,480
defended against these things today

421
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,480
but i don't think it has that same

422
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,480
impact that a pen tester gets when they

423
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,800
you know pop a shell like when you see

424
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,800
those things as a defender

425
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:27,199
you just get sad you're like what if i

426
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,040
what if i miss something what if what if

427
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:31,120
that missed something right but i think

428
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:33,680
to your point like automation can

429
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,519
it's not there right we haven't arrived

430
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,120
with automation it helps us do things it

431
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,360
helps us carve up very large data sets

432
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,279
and and hopefully hone in on things

433
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:43,120
where we can spend time doing threat

434
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,040
hunting in areas that matter right

435
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,880
rather than having your hunters and your

436
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,639
analysts pulling together data sources

437
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,320
from all of the different devices logs

438
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,839
from here this packets from here

439
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:53,839
endpoint telemetry from here like

440
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,519
automation can help us do that so we can

441
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,839
take those limited folks that limited

442
00:14:57,839 --> 00:14:59,360
skill set and point them at the things

443
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:00,959
that matter

444
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,199
but it's sure not going to

445
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:05,920
defend things for us at least not today

446
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,720
well and you said that offense is sexy

447
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,240
and defense is

448
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,120
not

449
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,120
um and that you know there's all these

450
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,920
hot new bugs you don't need a hot new

451
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:18,079
bug to own people like we still have

452
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:20,560
cross-site scripting and like all

453
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,959
input sanitization problems that we know

454
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:24,320
how to prevent

455
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,600
and it's really easy to fish people i

456
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:28,480
mean

457
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:30,480
i almost got fished last night like i it

458
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,160
was like so close and i'm like wait a

459
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,839
minute

460
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,480
that doesn't look right but it was it

461
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,279
was really good well-crafted fish

462
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,279
and if i can almost fall for it you know

463
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,399
normals

464
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:45,759
are gonna fall for that they're gonna be

465
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,040
like oh no there's something wrong with

466
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,720
my account let me click this right my

467
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,759
mom would have clicked on that

468
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:50,800
apparently she's somewhere in the

469
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:53,120
audience yeah cause she keeps clapping

470
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,959
i don't think she's she part of is she

471
00:15:54,959 --> 00:15:57,360
part of team grifter

472
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:59,040
she might be on jay's team now

473
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,800
by now i mean who isn't but yeah no

474
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:02,399
you're absolutely right

475
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:05,600
until we get this automation stop

476
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,680
understaffing our security teams we're

477
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:09,600
burning our people out and just amen

478
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,279
you've got to put more bodies on it

479
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,399
until we have the tools team kimberly in

480
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,800
the house

481
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,079
can i can i pick up on something you

482
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,160
said no

483
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,160
when you said surprise on supply chain

484
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:24,240
like of course you're absolutely right

485
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,440
like we've been we've been talking about

486
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:27,519
then we've been hit but there's so much

487
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,600
kindling out like there's so much dry

488
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,800
grass

489
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,040
that that spark can come from anywhere

490
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:35,040
we've just been building complexity on

491
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,880
top of complexity

492
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:38,320
bill woods said like we started an

493
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,240
insecure internet and we put a band-aid

494
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,519
and then we added more things to the

495
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,040
stack we kept adding band-aids and now

496
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,040
it's like band-aids all the way down all

497
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,079
the way down

498
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:48,880
and any one of those can lead to that

499
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,040
surprise of saying oh my god we're gonna

500
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,639
and we're gonna lose a whole year of

501
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,360
progress a whole year of kids birthdays

502
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,360
a whole year of god damn it hit on

503
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,360
another friday night because it can be

504
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,040
any one of those that that's gonna get

505
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:02,079
hit

506
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:03,839
yeah so so i want to know when do we get

507
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:06,319
to stop blaming the users

508
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:07,919
we should have already yeah i would say

509
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,199
we should have already stopped yeah i

510
00:17:09,199 --> 00:17:12,240
agree we aren't speaking human language

511
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:13,760
if if

512
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,240
if people are making the wrong trust

513
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:19,439
decision that's not because they're dumb

514
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,119
heart surgeons don't know how to change

515
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,640
the oil in their car not because they're

516
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,119
stupid but because they're not mechanics

517
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,959
and we have to

518
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:29,679
make better communications for users we

519
00:17:29,679 --> 00:17:31,039
can't keep blaming them we have to do

520
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:33,120
better design better accessibility

521
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,360
better user experience

522
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,880
so there was this um

523
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:39,280
i never got to play with it but i was

524
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,360
super fascinating that the the human

525
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,440
engineering or human

526
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,440
feedback cycles i guess on some

527
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:48,559
automobiles where they knew sort of the

528
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,320
limits of the car's speed you know

529
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,919
you're driving your car you're up at 120

530
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:53,520
130 whatever and you're starting to kind

531
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,960
of reach the limit

532
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:56,400
and the steering wheel starts feeling a

533
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,799
little loose and you're like oh i'm kind

534
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,039
of at the limit of my vehicle right i

535
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:03,200
know i'm near a boundary

536
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:04,799
and so i was always curious if you could

537
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:06,880
put like a little vibrator thing in a

538
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,039
mouse and you tie that to like a safe

539
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:10,320
site list

540
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,000
and you're about to click on something

541
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:14,160
and it's like

542
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,840
you're like whoa my mouse doesn't

543
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,600
normally do that right i shouldn't

544
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:20,240
there's no feedback loop again right you

545
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,320
do something unsafe

546
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,240
and you get owned and you notice that

547
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:26,240
three weeks later you can't tie it back

548
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,160
to an unsafe behavior from three weeks

549
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,640
ago so there's no feedback loop and i

550
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:32,080
was just hoping that somebody would be

551
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,480
selling the mouse like if you try to tie

552
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:36,400
a vibrating mouse to the sites my users

553
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,679
are going to you're just going to give

554
00:18:37,679 --> 00:18:40,919
them a feature

555
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,679
i'm just saying we could probably think

556
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:45,600
of the problem it's a good

557
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:49,200
a haptic feedback to reinforce security

558
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:50,960
let's call it that electrical shock i'm

559
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:53,520
not talking some little dildonic you

560
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:54,320
know

561
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,640
wrong conference right wrong conference

562
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,559
but um but yeah they hook them up to a

563
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,080
tens machine and whenever something

564
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,600
happens they're just the whole right

565
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,880
side of their body

566
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,400
so obviously don't you click that

567
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,000
grifter so pumped yeah he's been

568
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,960
clicking a lot of you know spam lately

569
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,799
don't think this is fundamentally one of

570
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:13,679
the challenges we have with stl is

571
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,360
developer sdl sdl software development

572
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,880
life cycle it used to be a thing it was

573
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,760
like 10 years ago and

574
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,559
the developer writes some code and they

575
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,640
release a product and then a researcher

576
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,240
finds the vulnerability and hopefully

577
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,000
they report it to the security response

578
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:31,679
team before they come speak about it at

579
00:19:31,679 --> 00:19:34,160
black hat and the security response team

580
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,240
has to triage it and then go get it

581
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:38,640
fixed but whoever has to fix it isn't

582
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:41,120
usually the developer that wrote it so

583
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,720
your feedback loop is broken again

584
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:45,679
broken i see a trend developing

585
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:47,120
yeah one of the like i always try to

586
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,840
correlate security to safety right and

587
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,919
it should be in my mind it should be

588
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,000
synonymous we don't have to train users

589
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:55,600
how to not electrocute themselves with

590
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,200
their laptop and we have railings

591
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:58,480
everywhere so you don't fall over i

592
00:19:58,480 --> 00:19:59,520
don't have to walk through the world

593
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,440
thinking about i'm trained on safety the

594
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,960
world has the environment has been made

595
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:05,280
in such a way that i can't screw it up

596
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:07,120
um and i feel like security is failing

597
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,480
in that we should be making it so that

598
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:10,880
users can't screw up

599
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,720
um from a security perspective but my

600
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,159
freedom to own myself

601
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:18,559
my rights jeff jeff can i ask you a

602
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,919
question so when you wrote that the

603
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,440
offense was getting better like i was

604
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,240
thinking about this when we were talking

605
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,840
about sdl

606
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,760
what areas do you think since you wrote

607
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:26,960
that in the eight years since you wrote

608
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,960
that that that the defenders have done

609
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:30,400
the best at

610
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,400
that you look back and say man since

611
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,840
we've done that boy we've really been

612
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:37,520
putting away these classes of problems

613
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:38,960
i'll answer the question with a question

614
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,320
which is crap

615
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:42,799
yeah crap it's like i can't think of as

616
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:44,960
a defender off and i can't think of any

617
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,440
any class of vulnerabilities

618
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,880
i think maybe one

619
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,559
that we've

620
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,440
closed right off by one memory

621
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,240
corruption i just i don't think

622
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,200
like

623
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,120
what have we actually solved i think we

624
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,360
move very quickly and leave problems in

625
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,280
our wake but we don't actually close

626
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,880
them down

627
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,799
can we push back a second because i know

628
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:07,760
others are going to want to jump in

629
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:09,840
sorry for speaking over you um i think

630
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:11,200
if we open up we don't just think about

631
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,640
the technical

632
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,559
debt if we think about for example the

633
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,400
process innovations

634
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:19,200
right i mean boy we we've got mitre

635
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,120
attack framework i mean it's it's it's

636
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,000
an invention it was free right and just

637
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,440
think of it i mean that's really helped

638
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:27,440
us think differently about well i mean

639
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,039
the people that's the biggest i'd say

640
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,480
the biggest gains

641
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,480
apple with their ecosystem their walled

642
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,480
garden but apple does

643
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:37,039
comparatively speaking a better job than

644
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:38,240
others

645
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:40,240
and you either agree with it or don't

646
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:41,200
but

647
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,760
there's not a better phone you can buy

648
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:45,679
from a security standpoint unfortunately

649
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,039
but that's the current state of the art

650
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:48,480
for consumers

651
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:49,440
um

652
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,200
and so i would say okay in the defense

653
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:52,720
world sure you can still get your iphone

654
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:54,799
owned with a zero click but it's it's an

655
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:57,760
edge case now it's not like you know

656
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:00,320
and so i think the market can supply

657
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:02,000
those solutions but if you look at why

658
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,480
is apple supplying those solutions it's

659
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,760
not because they necessarily want to

660
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,360
make a great secure phone it's they want

661
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,760
to protect the app store

662
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:12,320
revenue right so we're getting a

663
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,400
positive benefit but not for the reason

664
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,039
we wish we were getting it for right

665
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,280
it's not necessarily altruistic

666
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,480
to make the world a better place

667
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,200
cool team grifter

668
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:29,280
no i'm good okay so that brings me to

669
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:31,760
another buzzword bingo

670
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:34,640
zero trust

671
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,159
i said it

672
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:38,480
do we drink yes

673
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:41,760
we do drink

674
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,440
so whenever i hear the word zero trust i

675
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,640
just think least privilege

676
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,039
what am i missing

677
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:50,240
you know i'm thinking network

678
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,799
segmentation i'm thinking you know like

679
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,640
what what is it just a new coat of paint

680
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,520
on the old problem yes yeah okay that's

681
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:58,880
it i mean that's that's the extent of

682
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:00,320
the i think the conversation around that

683
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:02,080
yes like we're talking about incredibly

684
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:03,520
foundational things we talked about for

685
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:05,840
a very long time being done under the

686
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,559
umbrella of zero trust right this is

687
00:23:08,559 --> 00:23:10,480
what we should have been doing since 19

688
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,320
diggity and we're still not doing right

689
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:16,159
now um we we love remember mandatory

690
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:17,679
access control

691
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:20,799
well that was awesome in like the 80s

692
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:23,200
and we still don't have it

693
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,120
and i think but we will we'll put

694
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:26,720
another coat of paint on this 10 years

695
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:27,919
from now and we'll call it something

696
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,440
else and all the banners in the expo

697
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,200
floor will have another

698
00:23:31,200 --> 00:23:33,520
couple of buzzwords on it negative trust

699
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:35,840
yeah minus one negative what's it gonna

700
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:36,720
be

701
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:39,280
um but yeah i mean that's the uh we're

702
00:23:39,280 --> 00:23:42,159
having a lot of conversations like that

703
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:44,080
that's probably the most buzzwordy

704
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,760
buzzword i think that i hear right now

705
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,039
is zero trust and it really like feels

706
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,159
like we were trying to come up with a

707
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:51,919
drinking game earlier

708
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:53,760
around zero trust but we would all be

709
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:54,799
wrecked

710
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:57,039
by the time we left the vendor floor

711
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,200
i mean i like that i it was like the

712
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,120
four remember the four ice principle you

713
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,480
need to have two different people

714
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:04,720
involved in a network change so no one

715
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:07,200
rogue administrator can snowden you yeah

716
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:09,279
you know things like that and it seems

717
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:10,720
like they're all trying to get to the

718
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:11,919
same

719
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:13,279
they're trying to get to the same place

720
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:14,559
but

721
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:17,919
something invisible isn't in inhibiting

722
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:19,039
us

723
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,320
because it's not like these problems are

724
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,720
unknown we understand them but something

725
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:24,880
is at the invisible hand of the free

726
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:27,600
market i i can accept i'll be a little

727
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:29,919
bit friendlier to zero trust

728
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:32,640
because if we can get

729
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:34,880
the c-suite and the other senior leaders

730
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,320
and say tell me about i keep hearing

731
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,320
about this thing zero trust

732
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,960
it's it's a snazzier phrase than the end

733
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,799
of the perimeter or are other ways that

734
00:24:42,799 --> 00:24:44,559
we can talk about this

735
00:24:44,559 --> 00:24:47,279
and if it can help if individual leaders

736
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:48,640
can grab on to that within their

737
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,320
organization

738
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:52,480
and say that's right we've been saying

739
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:54,480
this for 20 years but now i get to say

740
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,480
it in this way zero trust and if they

741
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,360
can help us push through that good point

742
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:01,360
i i can i can take that

743
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:03,520
yes for the win marketing for the world

744
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:04,720
team

745
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,640
i bathe in your approval

746
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:08,799
it's effective executive communication

747
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,320
my concern is when you're walking

748
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,440
through the vendor hall and it's

749
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:14,799
snake oil

750
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:15,760
and

751
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,080
it's not actually it's selling you

752
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:20,000
something you maybe don't need

753
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,240
or it's you know it's got a little zero

754
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,000
trust in here but it's really something

755
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,000
else yeah

756
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:29,679
so um one in the back

757
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,120
let's do the right thing for the right

758
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:33,520
reasons

759
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,279
there we go

760
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,120
okay so the follow-up question then i

761
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,039
guess is is we we touched on it earlier

762
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:40,480
third parties

763
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,159
right we're so reliant we're so

764
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:43,440
dependent on third party we talked about

765
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:45,600
a little bit around supply chain

766
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,840
where you're i mean go install xm and

767
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:50,480
you're gonna have 148 dependencies want

768
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:52,559
to get installed right good luck

769
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,480
um so

770
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,799
i i view that as like a microcosm of the

771
00:25:56,799 --> 00:25:59,120
third party problem well for efficiency

772
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,000
and

773
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,799
cost savings we're going to continue to

774
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:04,880
outsource to third parties

775
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,880
and i sort of see it as your corporate

776
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:08,400
identity is sort of three things it's

777
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:10,400
your email it's your dns and it's your

778
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,360
website

779
00:26:11,360 --> 00:26:12,960
and once you start losing control of

780
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,960
those you've essentially lost control of

781
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,799
your website right because if you lose

782
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:18,720
your email people can do password resets

783
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:20,080
they can get your domain if they get

784
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:21,600
your domain they can

785
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,840
and so as we outsource everything at

786
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,840
some point we've outsourced the identity

787
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:27,679
of our business

788
00:26:27,679 --> 00:26:28,640
and

789
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,880
do you see a logical

790
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:32,400
for everybody do you see a point where

791
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,840
like okay we've outsourced enough

792
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,760
there's enough third party

793
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:37,679
out there we

794
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,520
or is this just

795
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:41,440
at some point you've fully outsourced

796
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:43,200
the entire enterprise

797
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,480
and all of your employees are

798
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,120
essentially like aws consoles managing

799
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,960
their your infrastructure is there a

800
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,720
logical stopping point where companies

801
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:52,880
say there's enough risk i'm keeping my

802
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:54,240
name server

803
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,000
or do we not think like that and it's

804
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,520
just going to be

805
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,440
maximum cost saving means maximum

806
00:26:59,440 --> 00:27:01,120
outsourcing and that's just what will

807
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,439
happen

808
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,120
because it seems to be just organically

809
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:06,720
happening but i don't i've never read a

810
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,960
paper that says here's how to tell if

811
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,799
you've outsourced enough

812
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:14,080
right it just seems to keep going

813
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,679
yeah at least from my perspective what i

814
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:18,320
saw early on was just this

815
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,720
this fear of outsourcing originally

816
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,279
actually in and then there was kind of

817
00:27:23,279 --> 00:27:24,159
this

818
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:25,600
putting the toe in the water right you

819
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,960
outsourced a little bit you're like wow

820
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,399
this is actually great this is awesome

821
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:29,760
right this is actually great i just

822
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:32,159
moved all my risk to somebody else

823
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,679
you get a little bit deeper in and i

824
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,200
think we're still like maybe half the

825
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:37,279
body's halfway in um where that comfort

826
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,600
level is um and i've actually seen this

827
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,880
this last like year and a half with the

828
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:42,480
pandemic actually i think it's

829
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,720
accelerating accelerate the the jumping

830
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:46,720
in the pool and so i think over the next

831
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:48,799
couple years you'll start to see maybe

832
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:50,320
some of that back pedal where you start

833
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,080
to realize like maybe i outsourced a

834
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,000
little bit too much of my risk

835
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,360
what would trigger i mean why would they

836
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,440
even think that

837
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,200
yeah i mean it's hard to say from from

838
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:00,799
my perspective at least i think it'll be

839
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:02,080
that you've outsourced that critical

840
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,919
piece of your identity of the company

841
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,679
right at some point there's a lot of

842
00:28:05,679 --> 00:28:07,200
like

843
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:08,559
peripheral things you do right for your

844
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:09,679
company stuff that doesn't really need

845
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:11,679
to be tied to the culture and your

846
00:28:11,679 --> 00:28:13,520
values but then there are core pieces

847
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:14,960
that if they're not actually tied to

848
00:28:14,960 --> 00:28:16,480
that kind of central soul of your

849
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,240
company you start to have trouble with

850
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:19,520
it and if you outsource the piece of

851
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,880
that central soul i think that's when

852
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,559
you're going to start to have trouble

853
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:25,760
with it and reel it back but

854
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:27,360
you did a project a couple of years ago

855
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,360
it was for for an insurance company

856
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,440
and they were saying boy it seems like

857
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,600
these these internet risks and you

858
00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:35,440
talked about and that they're getting

859
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:36,720
passed around

860
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,880
and someone early on called it cyber

861
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:40,960
subprime it wasn't long after they're

862
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:43,360
like oh my god please i can i say cyber

863
00:28:43,360 --> 00:28:45,760
a lot and that was too much for me drink

864
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:46,640
and then

865
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:49,120
and then i thought

866
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,039
it's actually it was actually one of the

867
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,399
analogies that helped me think more

868
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:53,600
deeply

869
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,760
because right prior to 2008 i had been

870
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:57,440
in the finance industry my wife had been

871
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:58,960
in finance industry

872
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,039
and the people that knew most about the

873
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,080
risk

874
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,640
said these risks aren't correlated

875
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:06,399
that the american real estate market

876
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:07,679
it's not like you can have a problem in

877
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,039
one area it doesn't affect somewhere

878
00:29:09,039 --> 00:29:11,039
else and the more expert you were in

879
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:12,960
that field the financial risk the more

880
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,880
you would have said it was crazy that

881
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,679
these risks for the american real estate

882
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,440
would take down

883
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,919
governments in the uk would almost break

884
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:23,840
break apart the euro the more expert you

885
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:25,360
were the more you'd say that was

886
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:27,279
impossible but it ends up the risks were

887
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:29,200
really correlated

888
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,200
um because you had these hidden pools i

889
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,640
was like oh my god that kind of sounds

890
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,240
like our field right

891
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,399
we've got these these risks and they're

892
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:39,360
aggregating upstream and we have no idea

893
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,440
where they are or how they can cascade

894
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,200
see i just think you know there'll be a

895
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:46,799
gdpr fine against amazon so great people

896
00:29:46,799 --> 00:29:48,480
declare bankruptcy

897
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:50,559
right yeah where's that in your risk

898
00:29:50,559 --> 00:29:53,120
calculus so what do we do when one of

899
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,200
these i.t companies that's too big to

900
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,960
fail has a lehman moment right they're

901
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,640
there with all of our data on friday and

902
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,240
they're going on monday right it

903
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:02,320
happened to banks that were 130 years

904
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,320
old right how do we think and again

905
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,399
whether or not that's a

906
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,799
ridiculous example or um what are we

907
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,720
going to do when we have these these

908
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,120
correlated risks that are well upstream

909
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:16,080
jeff

910
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,279
you asked

911
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:19,120
what would be the trigger to make the

912
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:21,600
pendulum swing back from hey maybe we've

913
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,000
outsourced too much and unfortunately

914
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,640
that trigger is going to be an incident

915
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,399
it's going to be a breach it's going to

916
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:31,039
be we had a supplier that we outsourced

917
00:30:31,039 --> 00:30:31,760
to

918
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,559
and they got compromised and the

919
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:36,799
adversary moved laterally and stole our

920
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:38,000
crown jewels

921
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,120
and

922
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:41,279
that's what that's what the weight is

923
00:30:41,279 --> 00:30:42,799
it's sort of like

924
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:44,799
careful the oven's hot and you don't

925
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:45,919
believe until you touch it like we're

926
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,440
just going to keep outsourcing until we

927
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:48,640
start burning our fingers and it'll be

928
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,320
like okay

929
00:30:50,320 --> 00:30:51,600
that's where we burn our fingers so

930
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,360
we're not going there anymore and and

931
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:54,480
it'll be the

932
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:57,120
wow we burned our fingers really badly

933
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,760
how do we how do we solve this oh wow

934
00:30:59,760 --> 00:31:01,039
solving that's really hard let's just

935
00:31:01,039 --> 00:31:03,919
bring it in house again and so we'll we

936
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:06,080
we get permissive and then we contract

937
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,640
and get controlling um it's kind of like

938
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,720
parenting you let your kids do something

939
00:31:10,720 --> 00:31:12,559
they break the rules you get controlling

940
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:13,840
you take it back so you think we're

941
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:15,919
still in that expansion phase we haven't

942
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:18,240
had i hope not but probably do you think

943
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,840
solar winds and cassette i mean do you

944
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,200
think the last year has affected that

945
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:22,880
were there where they're starting to be

946
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:24,159
caught yes

947
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:26,320
things that uh i can

948
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,240
things i proposed five years ago are

949
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,720
suddenly getting funded now so

950
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:32,399
yay i think

951
00:31:32,399 --> 00:31:33,519
um

952
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:37,120
you know but but yes i i it's similar to

953
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:39,600
when sony got hacked all the gaming

954
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,240
companies suddenly realized oh we

955
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,360
actually

956
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:45,519
have something of value that we need to

957
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,080
care about security it's not just gamer

958
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:50,640
tags and your reputation score oh yeah

959
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,720
there's credit cards in here oh there's

960
00:31:52,720 --> 00:31:54,799
in-game currency in here oh they could

961
00:31:54,799 --> 00:31:57,279
take down our network which is basically

962
00:31:57,279 --> 00:31:59,039
printing money for us

963
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:01,120
um and so all of a sudden you see

964
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:03,360
somebody get hit whether it's

965
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,120
um you know

966
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,399
the entire east coast not getting

967
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,559
gasoline and thinking huh

968
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:10,880
it wasn't could that happen to him yeah

969
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,720
so i think that's i heard the entire

970
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,240
east coast not getting vaseline i was

971
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,120
like boy this time

972
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,960
wrong conference jay wrong conference

973
00:32:20,960 --> 00:32:21,919
frank

974
00:32:21,919 --> 00:32:23,840
um

975
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,519
no i think so i think the i think that

976
00:32:25,519 --> 00:32:28,159
goes back to this the core question is

977
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:30,640
will ransomware make people care because

978
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:32,640
nothing else has made them care is

979
00:32:32,640 --> 00:32:34,320
ransomware

980
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:36,399
going to do it right and there was one

981
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,240
observation somebody made which said

982
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,519
that

983
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:40,880
originally it was

984
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,039
anything that can run a bitcoin miner is

985
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:44,320
going to run a bitcoin miner right

986
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:45,679
people will break in and they'll run it

987
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:47,039
on your toaster and they'll monetize

988
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,720
your toaster

989
00:32:48,720 --> 00:32:50,159
but not so much that didn't really come

990
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:53,200
about but they might ransom the toaster

991
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,720
controller company

992
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:57,440
and so is is sort of ransomware the new

993
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:00,159
bitcoin mining scam and will that make

994
00:33:00,159 --> 00:33:03,200
people care all right i think yes um and

995
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:05,840
just like we've but why because we've

996
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,519
seen that shift already in malware and

997
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:08,960
the way that it targeted people just

998
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:10,960
like that where before it was like okay

999
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,240
if i get onto this machine then i'm

1000
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:14,159
going to use it to mine cryptocurrency

1001
00:33:14,159 --> 00:33:16,159
but then cryptocurrency dives here and

1002
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:17,279
dives there and then it's like oh well

1003
00:33:17,279 --> 00:33:18,880
now that's not probably there's 90 000

1004
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,240
different coins and which one do you

1005
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:21,840
mind exactly which one am i mining and

1006
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:23,679
so it's like oh instead i'm just gonna

1007
00:33:23,679 --> 00:33:25,760
lock everything down and i'll get my i'm

1008
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,279
gonna get my currency i'm just gonna get

1009
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:29,679
it a different way um and we talked

1010
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:31,519
about this briefly you know hiding

1011
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,440
behind the curtain back there before but

1012
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,200
um but the thing that was interesting is

1013
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,559
we were talking about healthcare you

1014
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,080
know and that was like healthcare has

1015
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,320
been targeted by ransomware boom um

1016
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,080
healthcare has been targeted by

1017
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,240
ransomware for years and like this is

1018
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:46,080
people's lives people are on life

1019
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,919
support and things and and

1020
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:49,600
they pay it they pay it immediately

1021
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:51,519
because it's like oh this is scary quick

1022
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:55,039
pay pay pay and um and so you you hear

1023
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,720
about it and then it goes away and then

1024
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,320
you hear about it and it goes away but

1025
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,880
no one seemed to care um

1026
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,720
when all of a sudden everyone cared to

1027
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,559
the point of the white house putting out

1028
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,240
a you know a memo and saying this is

1029
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:08,079
what you need to do is as soon as gas

1030
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:09,599
prices went up

1031
00:34:09,599 --> 00:34:12,320
and that's up

1032
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,320
right and

1033
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:15,440
yeah

1034
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:17,199
and and can i be cynical i don't know if

1035
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,560
you're i don't want to step on either if

1036
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:20,399
you're going to jump in

1037
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:21,599
i don't know if this is cynical or

1038
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:22,960
realistic

1039
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,159
another reason that we're caring about

1040
00:34:24,159 --> 00:34:26,560
ransomware is because it's tied to

1041
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,079
nation state

1042
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:32,000
and that's led to more wake-up calls in

1043
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:34,159
washington dc than if it were purely

1044
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,280
criminal

1045
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,159
um

1046
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,599
you know if solar if um colonial

1047
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,520
pipeline didn't have russia on the other

1048
00:34:41,520 --> 00:34:44,159
end if that was a brazilian group would

1049
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:45,359
the white house be carrying as much

1050
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:46,800
about it right now and i'm saying that's

1051
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,560
bad that they are

1052
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:50,159
um so i worked in the white house about

1053
00:34:50,159 --> 00:34:52,239
15 years ago and when i was there

1054
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:54,000
this kind of policy

1055
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,399
fell under more economic policy right i

1056
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:58,240
mean we were saying technology was this

1057
00:34:58,240 --> 00:35:00,160
policy was a subset of economic policy

1058
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:01,599
and innovation

1059
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:02,480
now

1060
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:03,920
technology policy is a subset of

1061
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,920
national security policy because it's

1062
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,200
about competition with russia and

1063
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:09,520
especially competition with china

1064
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,240
and

1065
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,920
and i think that's one of the reasons

1066
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:14,320
that ransomware not just because the

1067
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,280
impact on all of us and on each of us

1068
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:19,680
but also because it's a nation on the

1069
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,520
other side

1070
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:22,960
yeah one of the things you know as your

1071
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:24,960
time out we were talking in the behind

1072
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:27,200
behind our sneaky curtain about

1073
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,359
healthcare and it was it was just very

1074
00:35:29,359 --> 00:35:30,960
fascinating that over the last couple of

1075
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,680
years we saw this immense rise in

1076
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,520
healthcare cybersecurity tax if you

1077
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:36,800
looked at like all of the different

1078
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,400
various breach reports that come out

1079
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,000
every year that kind of surmise all of

1080
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,440
the annual statistics you would have

1081
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:42,800
seen healthcare in the top three of

1082
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,560
basically every single one of them

1083
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,720
but i felt like the amount of attention

1084
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:48,800
that it got

1085
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:52,160
it didn't align with the impact and

1086
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,320
icons whoops i concentrated on the

1087
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,160
healthcare medical device space for

1088
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:58,480
about the last seven years and so being

1089
00:35:58,480 --> 00:35:59,920
in the thick of it and to see that there

1090
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,320
really wasn't the spotlight and and why

1091
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:04,240
and to grifter's point as soon as a an

1092
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,240
oil pipeline gets shut down everyone

1093
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:08,079
comes out of the woodwork and it's just

1094
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:10,400
all about this you're like we have had

1095
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:12,880
patients lives at risk for years with

1096
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:14,560
this immense rise in ransomware and

1097
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:17,280
attacks on hospital systems and

1098
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:19,760
like why did nobody care and to kim's

1099
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:20,800
point

1100
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,320
we needed more incidents which is a

1101
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:24,480
really sad thing to say like we need to

1102
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:25,359
burn

1103
00:36:25,359 --> 00:36:27,839
of patients getting hurt

1104
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,079
um i think for people to care and

1105
00:36:30,079 --> 00:36:31,839
unfortunately we didn't really have a

1106
00:36:31,839 --> 00:36:33,440
lot of those incidents but it's sad that

1107
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,280
we needed those yeah the healthcare

1108
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,720
industry needs patients to get hurt

1109
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,880
before people care but here's the thing

1110
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,240
about that and this is they're never

1111
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,839
gonna let me do this again by the way

1112
00:36:41,839 --> 00:36:42,640
okay

1113
00:36:42,640 --> 00:36:44,800
i'm just gonna get super super real here

1114
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,160
you and i are gonna have a podcast keep

1115
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,079
it up all right we're gonna get super

1116
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,800
real here which is um we're asking like

1117
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,640
will users take the right steps will

1118
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:54,240
companies take the right steps when will

1119
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:55,680
people do the right things when it comes

1120
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,839
to security um and and the reality is

1121
00:36:59,839 --> 00:37:02,160
if this pandemic has taught me anything

1122
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,960
it's that even when the threat can kill

1123
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,160
you we still won't apply the patch right

1124
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:09,200
at least

1125
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:11,359
forty percent of people won't apply

1126
00:37:11,359 --> 00:37:12,800
that's the patch that was that

1127
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,200
observation that we every zombie movie

1128
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,640
has it wrong

1129
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:17,359
right

1130
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:19,440
if there is a zombie apocalypse forty

1131
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,960
percent of the people will run toward

1132
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,640
the zombies yes

1133
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:25,200
absolutely but and the thing is the only

1134
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:27,200
like i mean like to to not just leave it

1135
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,760
like super dark but like the only like

1136
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,000
the hope that i have is that that there

1137
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,599
are still people who are going to

1138
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:36,160
continue creating the patches so as new

1139
00:37:36,160 --> 00:37:38,160
threats come as things come at us there

1140
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:41,520
will always be someone willing to create

1141
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:43,520
the patch and then it's up to us whether

1142
00:37:43,520 --> 00:37:45,920
or not we apply it

1143
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,240
i'm since we're trying to be slightly

1144
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,000
optimistic in our last couple minutes

1145
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,240
yeah let's not make everybody be like oh

1146
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:54,400
let's go drawing this is terrible i'm

1147
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,280
seeing

1148
00:37:55,280 --> 00:37:58,800
more and more appreciation and focus on

1149
00:37:58,800 --> 00:38:01,440
culture and communication and security

1150
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:04,320
yes technology is king code rules show

1151
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:07,599
me your owe days but if you can't get

1152
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,079
your user base to not click to see the

1153
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,720
dancing hamsters you're gonna be

1154
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:14,400
having your pipeline owned again because

1155
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,920
most of these

1156
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:17,680
ransomware attacks

1157
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:20,160
aren't something that microsoft or

1158
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,560
google or facebook can save you from

1159
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,800
because it's the person in your mailroom

1160
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:26,720
who clicked the link in their mail so

1161
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,800
the more we talk about culture the more

1162
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:31,119
we talk about

1163
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:34,480
reinforcing behaviors smart design i

1164
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:37,119
think the better we'll will be

1165
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:38,400
yeah and so one of the things i always

1166
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,839
like to bring up i am a hardware

1167
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,839
security geek and i love anything and

1168
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:43,359
security that we can push down into the

1169
00:38:43,359 --> 00:38:44,800
hardware layer and so you kind of

1170
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,480
brought up we have these just very

1171
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,480
horizontal ubiquitous security issues

1172
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,240
across everything that we don't seem to

1173
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,160
be fixing and so one of my fascinations

1174
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:53,760
is how do we bring that protection to

1175
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,440
the hardware layer and just squash

1176
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:56,960
entire families of things so you are

1177
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:59,440
starting to see things like that emerge

1178
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:01,119
at that fundamental just hardware layer

1179
00:39:01,119 --> 00:39:03,119
like how do we squash all rop attacks

1180
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,040
right how do we squash all jobs cops how

1181
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,640
do we squash all of these just at the

1182
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:08,560
hardware layer no longer relying on the

1183
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,359
individual application to do security

1184
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:12,480
right

1185
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,480
and so i think there's this real rise in

1186
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,160
the industry of this appreciation if you

1187
00:39:16,160 --> 00:39:17,920
take security lower you can actually

1188
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,000
squash entire things and not that

1189
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,599
software developers shouldn't do

1190
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,520
security well but we all know at the end

1191
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:25,839
of the day there's still a lot of issues

1192
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:28,320
in writing software so if we can just

1193
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:30,800
make it safe for them to write shitty

1194
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:32,400
software um

1195
00:39:32,400 --> 00:39:33,680
because we'll protect them at that

1196
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:36,160
hardware layer and so so anyway i'm a

1197
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,880
huge fan of how do we take entire

1198
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:41,359
families of vulnerabilities and squash

1199
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:43,520
them at the hardware layer so we don't

1200
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,200
have to rely on the software to do it

1201
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,880
correctly and i love that because you

1202
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:48,720
can think about that all the way up just

1203
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:50,720
applause

1204
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,079
right you can take that all the way up

1205
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,400
like all the way up osi and saying like

1206
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,800
instead of blaming the user first right

1207
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,440
another seven layers had to fail

1208
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,880
for that for that human to make the

1209
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,480
mistake i love that idea yeah that's

1210
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:04,800
great well and because the attackers

1211
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,359
don't really need the super exclusive

1212
00:40:07,359 --> 00:40:09,040
exploit when i can just get you to click

1213
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,599
a mail yeah

1214
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,359
okay so we're coming to the end of our

1215
00:40:13,359 --> 00:40:15,200
session and i feel like i've cheated you

1216
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,480
because i haven't gone to the audience

1217
00:40:16,480 --> 00:40:18,560
yet for a question so i must at least

1218
00:40:18,560 --> 00:40:20,160
get an audience question to feel like

1219
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:22,800
i've completed my my duties so any

1220
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:24,640
questions in the audience for our

1221
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,079
illustrious panel

1222
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:27,520
well they turn the lights on you the

1223
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:28,720
pressure oh geez they're putting their

1224
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,319
hands down really cover their eyes not

1225
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:31,760
to ask questions

1226
00:40:31,760 --> 00:40:34,240
everybody had a collective hisk

1227
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:36,240
it's from the crown that's right

1228
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:38,480
it's okay it burns our eyes too so

1229
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,599
okay well if you don't have any

1230
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:44,280
questions oh yes go ahead sir

1231
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:09,000
like on the major platforms

1232
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,040
well that's all is so his observation is

1233
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,319
yeah yeah we

1234
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,960
repeat it to them

1235
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:41,760
so they didn't hear that will you

1236
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:43,680
summarize that for the crowd since then

1237
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:45,680
yeah yeah so the question was that in

1238
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:47,760
the last eight years the platforms ios

1239
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,560
and android and windows the the type of

1240
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:52,240
attacks character of attacks have gotten

1241
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:54,240
much more either social engineering or

1242
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:56,319
maybe phishing and the the attacks have

1243
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:57,599
actually gotten harder and harder and

1244
00:41:57,599 --> 00:41:59,599
that's a cause for hope

1245
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,200
and and i would agree

1246
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:03,920
but i think we also heard in the talk

1247
00:42:03,920 --> 00:42:05,200
this morning that the number of zero

1248
00:42:05,200 --> 00:42:07,040
days being deployed by adversaries is

1249
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:10,640
going up well is that is that a so

1250
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,560
here's a question is that a cause for

1251
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:14,000
concern does that mean we're getting

1252
00:42:14,000 --> 00:42:15,520
better at finding them because i feel

1253
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,280
like that's something we have definitely

1254
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,480
yeah we're getting better at finding

1255
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:21,920
them our visibility into our security

1256
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,319
issues has

1257
00:42:23,319 --> 00:42:27,040
absolutely improved and so is this

1258
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,960
more a question of that there are more

1259
00:42:28,960 --> 00:42:30,640
of these problems out there or are we

1260
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,480
just finding them

1261
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:34,880
more readily like because i i mean i

1262
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:36,560
want to take the optimistic approach

1263
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:38,640
that yes in fact we're getting it

1264
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:40,560
remember the sales pitch of cloud in the

1265
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:42,319
original early days was that they have

1266
00:42:42,319 --> 00:42:44,880
the experts they can protect you better

1267
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,800
than a small to medium business so it

1268
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,240
absolutely made sense to trade your

1269
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,160
current set of problems for some cloud

1270
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:52,079
problems but in the end it was a net

1271
00:42:52,079 --> 00:42:53,119
gain

1272
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:55,280
right microsoft can protect your email

1273
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:56,800
better than you can protect your own

1274
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,720
email so that was a considered a good

1275
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,640
trade and i think we're at that point

1276
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:01,920
now where we're getting those cloud

1277
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,000
benefits long enough

1278
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:06,000
that we're probably seeing some and i

1279
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,040
think that's what i mean it was

1280
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:08,319
communicated a little bit where like

1281
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:10,079
where where is the dial back i think i

1282
00:43:10,079 --> 00:43:11,599
think the two things that people came to

1283
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:13,440
was like control like when you decided

1284
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,000
like control or pain right those were

1285
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:17,440
the things i think that's what i took

1286
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:18,960
away from that like when do we start

1287
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,880
thinking i outsource too much when you

1288
00:43:20,880 --> 00:43:23,599
realize you have lost control

1289
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:26,960
or something hurts yeah so i mean i

1290
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,240
guess that's where we'll start

1291
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,160
ratcheting back

1292
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:31,680
all right well thanks for sitting in for

1293
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,760
our lock note session

1294
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:35,599
it's always enjoyable

1295
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:37,280
we'll see you around tomorrow if you

1296
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,720
have any questions we'll be around for a

1297
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:39,680
little bit

1298
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:42,839
thank you
