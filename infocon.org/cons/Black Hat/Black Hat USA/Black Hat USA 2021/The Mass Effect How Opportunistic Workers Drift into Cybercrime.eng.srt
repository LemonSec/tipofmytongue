00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:15,519
hi and welcome to our presentation the

3
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:17,760
mass effect how opportunistic workers

4
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,240
drift into cyber crime i'm massah paket

5
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:22,400
klusten from go secure and i'm sergio

6
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,960
lucia parquet from secureworks

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,480
and we also want to thank sebastian

8
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:28,560
garcia from the stratosphere laboratory

9
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,960
as well as machia jose jaga from cisco

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:33,120
system who both have participated in the

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,960
research

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,640
so today what we're doing is we are

13
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:38,719
presenting our research journey that

14
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,360
goes from studying but masters or at

15
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,120
least we thought all the way up to

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:45,760
uncovering an informal economy involved

17
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,920
or potentially involved in cyber crime

18
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,160
and we also thought it was a very good

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,399
opportunity to present three research

20
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,039
techniques that we believe are unusual

21
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:57,440
in the field of cyber security research

22
00:00:57,440 --> 00:00:59,280
but could be beneficial for other

23
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:00,559
projects

24
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,280
so let's jump into the background and

25
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:04,239
how this

26
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,560
research came alive so it all started a

27
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,320
few years ago when the stratosphere

28
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,040
laboratory uncovered the geospatnet

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,720
while monitoring the htbot proxy malware

30
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,200
what is geos well it's an android

31
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,439
banking trojan button targeting mainly

32
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,600
russian citizens

33
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:24,880
it has infected over 800 000 russian

34
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,400
phones and also

35
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,000
was estimated to have made millions of

36
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,040
dollars

37
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,119
if you have any questions related to gs

38
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,079
infrastructure cnc panels and all that

39
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,640
you can look online there has there are

40
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:38,240
two really good presentations one from

41
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,680
virus bolton the other one from black

42
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,680
hat europe

43
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,320
done by the stratosphere laboratory what

44
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:46,560
is of interest today is while doing that

45
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,920
investigation

46
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,079
veronica valeros found a chat log on

47
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,240
virustotal that contain

48
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,240
private discussions among individuals

49
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,320
involved at spreading the buttnet so

50
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,240
this really triggered

51
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,399
this research that we're presenting

52
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:01,280
today

53
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:04,479
so this private chat log between people

54
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:06,960
uh directly involved into spreading

55
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,720
malware was a very very unique

56
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,520
opportunity because very seldom can we

57
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:14,000
assess first-hand conversation between

58
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,480
people spreading malware

59
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,280
so this chat log is a skype leak

60
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,840
of about 6000

61
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,480
messages that spreads from between 2017

62
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,200
and 2018 for about 11 months and it's

63
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,760
between 32 individuals

64
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,160
so we know they were discussing gist

65
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,680
because

66
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,160
they were exchanging key information

67
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,720
about the cnc internal commands

68
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:40,800
ip addresses and domains

69
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,360
as well as some freshly infected apks

70
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,680
that they shared among themselves so the

71
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,440
conversations are in russian and they

72
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:49,920
were translated by a security researcher

73
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,879
named

74
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,760
ana shurikova which is also russian

75
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:55,200
speaking

76
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,840
and in the conversations there are 32

77
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,720
individuals but only three important the

78
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,000
three main

79
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,760
important ones an entrepreneur a

80
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,560
developer and a webmaster and we want

81
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:08,000
you to remember them because they're

82
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,879
going to come later in the presentation

83
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,959
now the very interesting thing is that

84
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,200
in this con in this chat log they were

85
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:17,440
also mentioning conversations that

86
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:20,080
happen on a public space

87
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:22,879
and very really rarely do we have

88
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,120
information on private discussions as

89
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,959
well as public ones

90
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,280
so we pivoted to understanding what they

91
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,239
were discussing on a public forum called

92
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,280
search engines.guru which has over half

93
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,280
a million users

94
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,959
this specific forum is a

95
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:40,640
russian-speaking internet marketing

96
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,120
platform and all the users discussing on

97
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,239
it

98
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:45,760
we're kind of considered like an

99
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,920
informal workforce as you're gonna see

100
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,120
in a little bit

101
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,400
so this presentation is divided in five

102
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,439
large themes that we called acts and

103
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:57,519
we're gonna go over each of them in the

104
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:58,400
next

105
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,640
30 minutes so the first

106
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,360
act that we're going to see is called an

107
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:05,360
informal workforce and we're going to

108
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,920
investigate what is the forum and a

109
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,760
little bit what what are people

110
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,720
discussing on it

111
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,480
so the forum has advertised on its

112
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:15,920
homepage

113
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,478
is a website allowing users to discuss

114
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:20,798
issues related to creating and promoting

115
00:04:20,798 --> 00:04:22,880
websites on the internet

116
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,280
so on the surface everything's look

117
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,919
looks clean so the forum has been alive

118
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:30,560
for the last 20 years or so

119
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:32,160
um and has

120
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,120
more than 400 000 users registered

121
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,120
and all in all there has been more than

122
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,440
14 million polls for the span of the 20

123
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,400
years

124
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,560
as you can see from the graph here

125
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,600
uh the peak of the of the forum use was

126
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,880
in 2010 and has since been in slow

127
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:49,919
decline

128
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,479
so there could be many reasons for this

129
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:54,880
one of them being that the whole field

130
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:58,080
of internet marketing and web marketing

131
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,400
has become more difficult over the years

132
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,199
mainly because of various protections

133
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:04,720
and security measures from the search

134
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,759
engines

135
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:08,000
notice also in the timeline that we

136
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,800
added the specific time frame when the

137
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,720
chat log the individuals in the private

138
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,639
chat log were active so in 2017 and 2018

139
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,120
and we also plotted the first known gis

140
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,840
activity and the last non-gs activity

141
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,440
which is 2016 and the end of 2019.

142
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:27,039
now it's important to mention that all

143
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,800
the data that we're presenting today

144
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,960
that we used from this forum but

145
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,840
although also many others was possible

146
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:36,000
because we had an academic access to the

147
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,560
flare systems database so flair system

148
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,880
is a startup based in montreal that does

149
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,120
darknet monitoring platform and also

150
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,560
monitoring of all other kinds of

151
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,880
platforms on the clearweb so we want to

152
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,880
thank them and then

153
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,960
mention their collaboration in the

154
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:54,160
research so what do people talk about on

155
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:56,240
this informal space

156
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:58,400
so um

157
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,560
the the forum is divided in nine main

158
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:02,560
categories uh each of them being

159
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,960
developed in subcategories with various

160
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:06,960
amount of posts

161
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:09,199
so the categories are such as how to

162
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:12,160
monetize websites how to build websites

163
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:14,080
and very various

164
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:16,960
services and exchanges for webmasters

165
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,680
as well as how to optimize search engine

166
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,680
when you look at the categories nothing

167
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,800
looks shady and obviously let's not lie

168
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,319
to ourselves like

169
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:28,800
internet marketing is usually related to

170
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:31,280
shady activities somehow

171
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,400
sometimes

172
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,160
so when you look at the subcategories

173
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:36,639
you kind of get hints by one category

174
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:38,080
that some dubious activities are

175
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:39,919
happening on the platform

176
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:42,160
so the category doorways and cloaking

177
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,440
definitely refers to black hat seo and

178
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,000
thus you know manipulating user into

179
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,840
clicking on links that they wouldn't

180
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:52,319
want to click on but we're still

181
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:55,919
light years away from uh operating or or

182
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,759
being the mastermind behind a

183
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,120
large-scale botnet so looking at this it

184
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,120
kind of inspired us to talk about

185
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,960
informal economies

186
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,199
so what do we refer by that

187
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:09,280
is all income earning activities that

188
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:11,520
are not regulated by the state an

189
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:13,440
economic environment where such

190
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,160
activities would usually be regulated so

191
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,919
you can think of many examples that

192
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:21,440
people are familiar with a waiter that

193
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,120
wouldn't declare a hundred percent of

194
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,199
its tip for example

195
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:28,160
or people who sell goods on ttg and ebay

196
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,639
well there is an amount after which you

197
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:32,560
should be declaring revenues and pay

198
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,280
taxes what happens if you don't

199
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,520
so what it it's important to know it

200
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:39,680
it's not the product or the service that

201
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,560
it is illegal it is rather the means by

202
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,879
which it is produced or distributed that

203
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,919
is so given uh this information the

204
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,440
question that we asked ourselves is how

205
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:52,400
can we

206
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,800
get a quick understanding of the users

207
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,800
of the forum or can we map the forum

208
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,560
users to grasp their behavior

209
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,800
so fortunately there is a set of

210
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,639
techniques in machine learning that

211
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:06,879
maybe will help to do so so that will be

212
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:09,120
the first technique we're going to see

213
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,039
so first of all thanks again to the

214
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,879
flare database

215
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,240
we collected the data from each post

216
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,919
for the years of 2017 and 2018. so for

217
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:21,039
two years

218
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,039
and in this data we have the username

219
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,120
the topic the content category

220
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,039
subcategory and the date and so on so

221
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:28,319
forth

222
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:29,919
in order to do machine learning what we

223
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,360
need is a numerical representation of

224
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,919
the users and what we mean by that well

225
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:37,200
the numerical representation is

226
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:40,159
basically a vector of number

227
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,039
so we constructed the fingerprint of the

228
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,839
users by just summing over the span of

229
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:48,240
the two years the categories in which

230
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,640
the user has posted

231
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,920
that would give us

232
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,519
a user like a unit of user

233
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,440
now what we did is that we

234
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,839
did this for each of the users that were

235
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,920
present in the forum for these two years

236
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:04,399
and that would give us a big matrix we

237
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:06,480
just see a little glimpse here that

238
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,800
would give us a very very big matrix and

239
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,720
we want to make sense out of this so to

240
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:11,839
be able to

241
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,160
see if there are patterns in the users

242
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,680
so basically what we want is a map of

243
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,160
the forum based on the users

244
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,800
with 2d representation

245
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:24,399
now there exists a techniques that it

246
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,640
does exactly this it's called umap and

247
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:29,120
it was developed by leland makiness and

248
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:31,440
john healy from the tuft institute and

249
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,880
they were very kind

250
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,519
to help us get a better grasp of what's

251
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:38,240
going on under the hood

252
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:40,320
so basically what um does is that it

253
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,880
takes the data in high dimension in this

254
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,279
case it would be each point would be a

255
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,440
user in nine dimension nine being the

256
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,279
number of categories

257
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:52,160
and then from this space it would create

258
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:54,480
a graph and the graph

259
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,240
the nodes would be the users and they

260
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:58,160
would be connected if they are nearest

261
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,120
neighbors

262
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,360
in some specific

263
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,040
kind of way

264
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,320
and then from this graph in nine

265
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,160
dimension it would just project it in

266
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:07,920
two dimensions

267
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,640
in the plane and then untangle the graph

268
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,120
using some clever algorithms in order to

269
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:15,839
preserve this relationship this distance

270
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:18,880
nearest neighbor relationship now i put

271
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,360
a lot of details under the rug but the

272
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,120
code is very simple to use and the

273
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,640
documentation is very good and you can

274
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:27,600
find it online it's open source

275
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,480
so we did exactly this with our users

276
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,240
and we projected them on a 2d map and we

277
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,040
get

278
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,000
the map so this is a representation of

279
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,399
the forum users and even though it looks

280
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,959
like a mess it's filled with information

281
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:44,399
so bear with me

282
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,279
first of all the x and y axis don't mean

283
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,880
anything they are not interpretable in

284
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:52,720
the umap embedding so we just removed it

285
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,959
what matters is the relationship between

286
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,440
the points so users who have similar

287
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:59,680
posting behaviors will be closed

288
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,000
together in the map

289
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,519
now what we see here is that there are

290
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:05,279
nine arms

291
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,640
interestingly enough these arms

292
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:10,160
represent categories in the forum so

293
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,160
really the clusters that we see are

294
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:14,240
groups of users who post mainly in one

295
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,000
category so on average more in the

296
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,320
category but another thing is preserved

297
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:20,160
is the magnitude

298
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,720
of the phenomenon so how much they post

299
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,440
so users who are at the outer edge of

300
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,360
the arms are users who post more on

301
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:29,200
average than users who are closer to the

302
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:32,480
center now a little higher level of

303
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:34,720
structure we see that there are two arms

304
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:37,360
on the right and the rest of the arms on

305
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:39,200
the left and the two arms on the right

306
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,640
are close together

307
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:43,120
and also short in length meaning that

308
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:46,000
users in these categories are probably

309
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,480
not so passionate or they don't post as

310
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,800
much as in the other categories remember

311
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,720
earlier we talked about the private chat

312
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:54,800
log in three individuals who were

313
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:57,279
forming the bulk of the conversations

314
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:58,959
where since they were these individuals

315
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,200
discussing on the forum too we you may

316
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,360
be wondering where are they situated on

317
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,519
the map

318
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,160
well we map them and

319
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,079
we see that they are much more at the

320
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:12,240
center of the map than at the outer edge

321
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,079
of arms

322
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,720
so it looks like these individuals could

323
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:19,360
be more opportunistic or speaking less

324
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,200
than other individuals who would be more

325
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,680
passionate about their topics so really

326
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,560
this

327
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:26,800
relationship of maybe looking

328
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,560
opportunistic

329
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,800
was really interesting to us so we asked

330
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:33,839
the question is this the case

331
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,839
so what kind of business are they

332
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,399
actually involved in well fortunately we

333
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:40,399
have the chat log

334
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,360
okay so this leads us to our second act

335
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,120
dancing on the crime line and you're

336
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,880
soon going to see why we called it that

337
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:47,839
way

338
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,839
so we talked about chat log earlier you

339
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,200
remember 6000 messages well

340
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,680
it was formed of one entrepreneur and 32

341
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,000
of his business partners as we mentioned

342
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,920
however two of them

343
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,800
formed the bulk of the conversation

344
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,040
hence there was three individuals that

345
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,600
were key in the private chat look

346
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,040
you may be wondering what they were

347
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,720
doing

348
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,639
well they were developing android

349
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,600
portals to be able to spread infected

350
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,880
apks

351
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,120
so we gave you we took a screenshot of

352
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:21,040
one of their websites so you can have an

353
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,880
idea of what it looks like

354
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,560
it's basically just websites where you

355
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,560
go on and you download applications that

356
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,839
would have special features such as

357
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:30,720
better

358
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,200
so we took a screenshot of the website

359
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,600
so you could have a better idea of

360
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,600
what it looks like and as you can see

361
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,279
you just go on the website and you can

362
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:41,199
download various apks that have special

363
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:42,320
features

364
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:44,639
maybe unlock features as well if you

365
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,839
went on this website in 2017 or in 2018

366
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:50,720
you would have most likely downloaded a

367
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:53,519
geos apk which means that the

368
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,920
application icon would have disappeared

369
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,279
you would have thought that the

370
00:13:57,279 --> 00:13:59,040
application installation just didn't

371
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,040
work and your phone would be infected

372
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,720
with a banking trojan

373
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:05,040
so what we did with the private jet lag

374
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,920
is automatic analysis this is another

375
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:10,320
method that we wanted to present it's

376
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:12,959
really used in criminology and in social

377
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:15,519
science to extract meaning out of

378
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,199
textual data

379
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,199
so what you do is you read the text and

380
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,880
you

381
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:23,360
find teams associated to the text and

382
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,240
then you do this over and over again

383
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:27,839
so we did this

384
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,760
and we ended up with three teams which

385
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,519
we want to present today

386
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:34,000
the first theme is adverse business

387
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,480
environment so there was no doubt that

388
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,800
these individuals were

389
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,120
facing unreliable business partners

390
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,360
unstable payments declining business

391
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,920
prospects and low profitability so given

392
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,040
the uniqueness of this data set this

393
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,040
presentation would be very sad and a bit

394
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,880
boring if we didn't go into the

395
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:55,279
conversation and show you some simple

396
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:57,519
so here we go

397
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,240
so for example in october 2017 the

398
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,880
webmaster tells to the entrepreneur well

399
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,240
there's nothing you can do you should

400
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:06,480
always be prepared this business is not

401
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,519
stable

402
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:09,760
hence the idea of adverse business

403
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,040
environments

404
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,120
and then the same character says over

405
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,639
and over again to the entrepreneur that

406
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,639
he has trouble getting the money any

407
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:18,320
news about the money they will not give

408
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,959
the money yet did they send the money so

409
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,839
you see that this person has trouble

410
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:26,480
getting paid hence really it enforces

411
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:28,399
the idea of adversity

412
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,199
the second team was amateur work

413
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,680
so these individuals seem to be lacking

414
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,720
technical skills as well as working with

415
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,720
and building defective tools

416
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,959
so again let's jump into the the

417
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,680
conversations and see some examples

418
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,720
so the developer in 2017 says that the

419
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:48,639
sites are not high quality that they

420
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:51,600
will not last long and i mean

421
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,279
this is a developer acknowledging his

422
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,639
lack of expertise

423
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,360
and then the entrepreneur in november

424
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,959
of the same year says that he doesn't

425
00:15:58,959 --> 00:16:00,720
know how to split the traffic so they

426
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:02,959
have trouble getting by and constructing

427
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:04,480
their infrastructure

428
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,800
and then our third team was leniency

429
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,120
towards criminality which kind of links

430
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,839
back to our second act dancing on the

431
00:16:11,839 --> 00:16:13,279
crime line

432
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:15,040
so these guys they were definitely

433
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,519
involved in shady activities and being

434
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,600
aware of it they were constantly

435
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:21,600
fighting security measures and all of

436
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:24,079
that to seek economic independence

437
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:27,600
so again in november 2017 a new

438
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,639
character the affiliate marketer

439
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,040
talks about the conversion rate and how

440
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,800
they are different but there is no

441
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,800
guarantee that the sun will be better

442
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:38,399
than from legal

443
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,959
hence acknowledging that uh being

444
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:43,519
illegal pays more than being legal and

445
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,120
in a very interesting piece of

446
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,360
conversation between the entrepreneur

447
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:50,399
and the webmaster the entrepreneur tells

448
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:52,320
the other character to try to recrypt

449
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:53,600
and install

450
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,839
and in this context recrypt means

451
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,279
obfuscating

452
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,440
such that the apk is not being flagged

453
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,440
by a security tools

454
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:04,559
so these three teams kind of encompasses

455
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,079
most of the discussions that these

456
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:07,919
individuals had within the private chat

457
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,119
log

458
00:17:09,119 --> 00:17:11,760
if there is one kind of big key takeaway

459
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,559
is

460
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,959
definitely they were not the butt

461
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:17,439
masters or the motivated offender behind

462
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,480
the geospatnet but they seemed rather to

463
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,039
be those individuals at the periphery of

464
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:24,640
their criminal scheme

465
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,000
helping for the infected apks to spread

466
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,600
in the wild

467
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,320
so given that we know now what they're

468
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,160
doing or what they talked about in their

469
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,160
private conversations

470
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,840
let's go and look at what they're doing

471
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:41,440
on the forum in the public space

472
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,360
so what we did is we gathered

473
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,880
information on the three individuals who

474
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,600
spoke also on the public forum

475
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,919
and the first thing we asked was who are

476
00:17:49,919 --> 00:17:52,880
they talking to right so we used a map

477
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:54,880
and

478
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,039
colored each of the individuals that

479
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,039
were in the same thread as the

480
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:00,480
entrepreneur the webmaster and the

481
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,520
developer

482
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,039
and as you can see although there's a

483
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:05,120
small cluster in the middle well they

484
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,960
seem to be interacting with people who

485
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:09,919
are positioned everywhere in the forum

486
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:11,840
the second thing that we did is we

487
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,679
wanted to assess qualitatively what

488
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,320
they're talking about so we read each of

489
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,240
their interactions that represents about

490
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,960
2000 interactions we thank maria for

491
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,440
doing this it was very hard work

492
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:25,840
just trying to comprehend the meaning

493
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:28,080
and what we ended up finding though is

494
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,039
well they use the forum to help develop

495
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,120
their android website and they try to

496
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,039
find business partners

497
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:36,880
uh through you know interacting with

498
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,799
other forum users and what's really

499
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:40,480
striking here

500
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,520
is that

501
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:43,679
never in their public interactions did

502
00:18:43,679 --> 00:18:47,120
they mention geos or spreading any kind

503
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,240
of malware

504
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,039
even though a lot of these business

505
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:54,160
interactions were about creating these

506
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,200
these

507
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,200
infected portals

508
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:58,559
and that's that's very interesting

509
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,919
because it was covertly

510
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,120
displayed

511
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,760
in a public space

512
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,720
so of course it triggered to us the

513
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,559
question is this

514
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:12,320
dance between criminality and

515
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,320
informality come in place is this a

516
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,120
large-scale phenomenon so from there we

517
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:19,600
kind of change scale so our goal was to

518
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,960
assess whether the forum which we

519
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:24,160
conceptualized as an informal space had

520
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:26,799
users who would also be involved in

521
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:29,039
potentially cyber crime activities and

522
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,360
to do that we developed a concept called

523
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,360
drifters

524
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:37,280
drifters are informal workers or more

525
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,760
specifically forum users who also

526
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,400
participate in the cybercrime forums

527
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,760
so our goal here was to find

528
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:48,240
a measure of the number of drifters on

529
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:51,440
the forum so people who both speak on

530
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,799
the forum

531
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:56,080
and also in more criminally prone

532
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,880
platform and by criminally prone we mean

533
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,200
platform that acknowledge and that

534
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:04,400
publicly state that they are spaces to

535
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,440
share

536
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:08,080
cyber crime information so they embody

537
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:09,919
the criminal ethos

538
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:12,320
so we use a technique called username

539
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,640
matching because there are

540
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:15,760
researches

541
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,520
that state that

542
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:20,799
people tend to reuse their user names

543
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:23,440
between different platforms

544
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,559
so

545
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,159
basically you can think of

546
00:20:26,159 --> 00:20:28,400
nicknames in infosec which are very

547
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:29,760
common things

548
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,240
people tend to reuse them

549
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,559
so in order to because of course the

550
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,559
technique is not perfect there will be

551
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,240
false positives and there will be people

552
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,360
who change their name because

553
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:43,280
it's a choice of the user

554
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,320
uh we decided to increase the entropy of

555
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,240
the username that we sample in order to

556
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:50,159
do this analysis and increasing the

557
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,200
entropy

558
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:52,960
has the advantage of reducing the number

559
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:55,280
of false positives and avoiding us to

560
00:20:55,280 --> 00:20:57,520
look into each of the conversations to

561
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,200
make sure that they are exactly the same

562
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:00,960
users

563
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,280
and so in order to uh to increase this

564
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,440
entropy which we chose usernames that

565
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:08,000
were at least five characters long

566
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,559
add an uppercase a number or a special

567
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:11,600
character

568
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,600
so that would constitute our sample on

569
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,840
the informal platform and then we use

570
00:21:15,840 --> 00:21:17,600
the flair database so we searched for

571
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,520
these specific username in the flair

572
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:22,080
database and checked in which platforms

573
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,880
these users were speaking and we had to

574
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:27,200
develop another filter because when we

575
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,440
searched for a specific username

576
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,840
in the flair systems then we get all of

577
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:33,600
their comments on other platforms but

578
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,679
these comments can date back a long time

579
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,400
ago so we decided to only keep comments

580
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:40,480
that happened two or

581
00:21:40,480 --> 00:21:43,280
plus two or minus years

582
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,840
of the private chat log that was in 2017

583
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,760
and 2018.

584
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,400
so the comments spanned from 2015 to the

585
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:53,280
end of 2020. so using these two filters

586
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,440
the time frame and the username

587
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,480
what we got is out of the flair database

588
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,559
are 38 platforms

589
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:03,360
17 of them being on the clearweb 21

590
00:22:03,360 --> 00:22:05,760
being on the dark web and it's important

591
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:07,200
to emphasize that each of these

592
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:09,520
platforms even the one on the clear web

593
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,600
are platforms that openly advertise

594
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:13,440
themselves as

595
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:15,280
criminal spaces so

596
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:18,559
so spaces to share criminal information

597
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:20,640
now the most common of these

598
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:22,720
you can think of not the theo dark money

599
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:25,120
best hack forum exploit that iron black

600
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,600
at world club to cred which are all

601
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:30,000
related to either cyber crime or

602
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,080
stealing information so out of this

603
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,840
whole filtering process we ended up

604
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:37,280
finding 1500 drifters out of the 21 000

605
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:39,440
users that fitted the filter

606
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,240
this represents about 7.2 percent of the

607
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:45,280
whole forum population and we map them

608
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,880
on our form map

609
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,440
and as you can see these drifters i

610
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:51,600
can't are kind of placed all over in the

611
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:53,520
forum so since

612
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,240
that seemed to be uh there doesn't seem

613
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,799
to be any pattern

614
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,960
as statisticians and data scientists we

615
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,799
asked ourselves where there must be some

616
00:23:02,799 --> 00:23:04,880
way to differentiate the drifters from

617
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:06,720
denominators so

618
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,240
we asked the question are there

619
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:11,200
characteristics to identify them on the

620
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,880
firm are they special do they form a

621
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,200
specific group

622
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:18,799
so we devised a sequence of variables

623
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:20,400
that we thought

624
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,320
could help us to discriminate them so

625
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:23,760
maybe it would be different for the

626
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,520
drifters and the non-drifters for

627
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,440
example the activity rate

628
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,600
the diversification level

629
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,760
various keywords for potential business

630
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,720
interactions or specialized topics

631
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,400
now since these variables

632
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:38,799
were far from being gaussian or normal

633
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,360
we couldn't use its traditional

634
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:42,960
statistical test

635
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:45,760
so we use man whitney u test which are

636
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,840
tests that do not assume anything from

637
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,440
the underlying distribution they just

638
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,400
use the rank instead of the direct value

639
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,880
so just the detail so

640
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,640
on the next slide we're going to present

641
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,360
you

642
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,640
16 of the variables that we devised

643
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,360
and don't waste time reading the titles

644
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,960
what matters is the shape of the

645
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,640
distribution

646
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,960
so again i'm stopping you don't try to

647
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,279
read the titles get the overall picture

648
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:13,840
so in pale blue you have the drifters

649
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,159
and in purple you have the

650
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:17,919
the non-drifters so the rest of the

651
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:20,240
population anyway what we can see here

652
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:21,120
is that

653
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:23,760
the the samples are the same so the

654
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:25,840
shape of the distribution is the same

655
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,600
whatever the group

656
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,000
now for the statistical test when there

657
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,679
was statistical significance to

658
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:32,799
distinguish

659
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,640
the effect size was very very small it

660
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,480
was negligible so

661
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:38,159
from this data

662
00:24:38,159 --> 00:24:40,320
it's not possible to distinguish them

663
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:43,039
based on the variables that we devised

664
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:46,080
so what can we conclude from this well

665
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:48,159
it seems like drifters and nun drifters

666
00:24:48,159 --> 00:24:50,720
are indistinguishable at least based on

667
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:52,320
the discriminatory variables that we

668
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,400
could think of

669
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,400
and this leads us to conclude that

670
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,320
probably the drifter population is

671
00:24:58,320 --> 00:25:01,200
larger than seven percent and thus there

672
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,960
are many drifters that are within our

673
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:05,120
non-drifter sample kind of hindering the

674
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:07,039
analysis and the results

675
00:25:07,039 --> 00:25:08,559
and it even

676
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:10,880
stresses that this is most likely a

677
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,200
lower bound right and there are much

678
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,520
more

679
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:16,960
and now that we know that there's an

680
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:18,720
overlap you know between criminally

681
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,799
prone spaces and the forum that we

682
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,720
studied the next question that we

683
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:25,440
wondered or that we asked was well is

684
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:27,279
there a relationship between informality

685
00:25:27,279 --> 00:25:29,840
and criminality over time or do we see

686
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,760
individuals speaking in the informal

687
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:34,320
forum and then slowly moving out to more

688
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,760
criminally prone platforms through time

689
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,120
so this leads us to our four fourth act

690
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:42,400
migration

691
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,960
where we want to assess this you know

692
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,279
pattern in time

693
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:49,840
and how did we do this well we developed

694
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,679
a migration measure but

695
00:25:51,679 --> 00:25:53,760
okay and to do this we developed a

696
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,760
migration measure

697
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,640
based on the ei ratio which is a really

698
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,640
widely used measure in social network

699
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,559
science ei stands for external internal

700
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,440
in our research external means a person

701
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,360
who would be posting on cyber crime

702
00:26:09,360 --> 00:26:11,600
platforms and internal means the person

703
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:13,200
who would be posting on the informal

704
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:15,279
platform and what we want to assess is

705
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:18,480
the ratio of external against internal

706
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,799
platforms posting

707
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,320
over every year

708
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:25,279
so if a person scores one in the ei

709
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:27,200
ratio it means that the person has

710
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,240
perfectly migrated and thus is only

711
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,640
speaking on cyber crime platform if the

712
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:34,720
person scores zero it means that there

713
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,799
is a perfect balance in the person's

714
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:39,279
post so it the person posts equally on a

715
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:41,840
cybercrime platform and the informal

716
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:44,720
platform and if the person scores minus

717
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:45,520
one

718
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,440
it means there's no migration at all and

719
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,799
the person is only speaking on the form

720
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,760
and what we did is we calculated the ei

721
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:56,240
ratio for all drifters

722
00:26:56,240 --> 00:27:00,480
that were active in from 2012 to 2020

723
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,440
so for every of these years and then we

724
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:04,320
mapped

725
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,400
every user's trajectory

726
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,600
so here you have an example of two users

727
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,440
you can see that they go from these two

728
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,679
users they go from

729
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,760
the informal platform speaking only on

730
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:18,880
this and then in 2016 they kind of drift

731
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,960
and they speak only on cyber crime

732
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,240
platforms

733
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:23,679
this is great

734
00:27:23,679 --> 00:27:25,840
we see two users and it's easy to see

735
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:28,720
kind of the drifting the migration

736
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,960
but what happens if we have let's say a

737
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:33,440
thousand trajectories what can you do

738
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:36,799
how can you find pattern

739
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:40,559
so we asked this question how can we

740
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,559
find patterns how could how can we

741
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:45,600
cluster groups of users based on their

742
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:47,200
drifting pattern

743
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,440
so thankfully there exists a family of

744
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,559
technique

745
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:52,559
in data science well a lot of techniques

746
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:54,960
in data science to do so one of them

747
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:57,120
being the group based trajectory

748
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,760
modeling which is an instantiation of a

749
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:02,000
finite mixture model we're gonna see

750
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:03,360
what we mean

751
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,440
so first let's introduce some a bit of

752
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:07,520
statistical terminology

753
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,320
so a latent explanatory variable is a

754
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:12,240
variable that's important

755
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,159
that you cannot observe directly from

756
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,880
the data you rather have to infer it

757
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,520
through analysis so true inferential

758
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,600
analysis

759
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,840
in our case this latent variable would

760
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,240
be the number of groups so really how to

761
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:28,799
segment the users so the first step in

762
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:30,640
this group-based trajectory modeling is

763
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:32,880
to determine the good number of group

764
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,320
and we're going to see what we mean by

765
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:35,840
good

766
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:39,039
and then a mixture model as in finite

767
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:41,520
mixture model is a model in which the

768
00:28:41,520 --> 00:28:44,000
total variability that you observe so

769
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:46,399
that the total effect is rather the

770
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:47,760
result of

771
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,080
subgroups or subpopulations

772
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,080
so in our case it would really be the

773
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,559
clusters of similar users so each of

774
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:55,360
them

775
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:56,960
have the same variability they have the

776
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,960
same pattern but when you observe

777
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:01,760
everything you see the whole thing

778
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:04,480
so the second step would be to determine

779
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:07,120
determine the shape of each of these

780
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,120
distributions for the groups and by

781
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:12,000
shape we mean are they doing like this

782
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:13,760
like a sigmoid are they moving

783
00:29:13,760 --> 00:29:16,240
quadratically or linearly do we

784
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:18,000
determine this shape

785
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,720
and then the last step is given the

786
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:23,039
these finite models

787
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:25,919
given these sub models we need to find

788
00:29:25,919 --> 00:29:27,120
the best

789
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:28,640
shape so the best parameters for the

790
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:30,480
shape given the data so we use a

791
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:32,559
technique called maximum likelihood that

792
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,399
will maximize the probability of

793
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:37,600
observing the data given the the model

794
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,360
and then you may be wondering how do we

795
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,279
find the best model

796
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,679
well we repeat this over and over again

797
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,600
trying different numbers of groups and

798
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,039
different shapes

799
00:29:47,039 --> 00:29:49,600
in the trajectories of the groups and we

800
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,600
try to minimize the patient information

801
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:54,720
criterion while doing this and without

802
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:55,760
the dot

803
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,840
throughout our whole analysis the best

804
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,720
model for us was a three group model

805
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,440
hence like presented here

806
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,120
what you can see is we have two

807
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,520
trajectories combined together they

808
00:30:07,520 --> 00:30:10,559
represent 25 of the population and they

809
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,480
both drift from the

810
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,720
forum all the way to cyber crime

811
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:17,760
platforms through time

812
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,320
there is also one additional trajectory

813
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:22,480
the blue one it represents

814
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:25,760
near 75 of the population and what you

815
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,399
can see is it's quite flat so this

816
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:31,200
trajectory illustrates that 75 of the

817
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,480
population will tend to stay within

818
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,440
the forum through time

819
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,760
so the next natural thing to do of

820
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,640
course was to plot these users on the

821
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,640
map so here it is

822
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:47,240
and as you can see again

823
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:49,600
unsurprisingly there doesn't seem to be

824
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,480
a very strong pattern or a very strong

825
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:54,640
cluster there might be more users toward

826
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,919
the center

827
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,799
uh maybe meaning that these users don't

828
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:00,320
have a very strong allegiance and that's

829
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:02,159
something we could already infer from

830
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:04,480
their location on the map

831
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:06,880
but other than this

832
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,440
they seem to be placed all over the

833
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:12,399
forum there are about 75 of drifters who

834
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,880
will favor informality over cybercrime

835
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:17,760
platforms and about 25 percent who seem

836
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:20,559
to drift permanently so posting on the

837
00:31:20,559 --> 00:31:22,880
informal platform and then slowly moving

838
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:26,480
to posting more on cybercrime platforms

839
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:28,640
what we can conclude from this is well

840
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,120
it seems like most drifters are criminal

841
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,000
curious and we coined that term to refer

842
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,720
to

843
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,720
these individuals who

844
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,480
will mainly post on the informal

845
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,399
platform and based on their posting

846
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:43,039
pattern we'll post a little bit in cyber

847
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,200
crime ones but they will do it really

848
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,760
minimally so they will favor staying in

849
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:50,399
the informal space so then we wanted to

850
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,840
generalize uh is is this concerning and

851
00:31:53,840 --> 00:31:57,200
if it is to what extent is this

852
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,880
so that would uh trigger our last act

853
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,320
the mass effect

854
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,000
by mass effect we don't mean any

855
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,399
references to the very successful video

856
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:08,640
game frenchies

857
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:11,360
what what we refer to is a term in

858
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,399
medicine

859
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:15,360
in which a growing mass a tumor

860
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:19,200
is growing as to push its surrounding

861
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,120
and then pushing the tissues and the

862
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,919
organs around it hence increasing the

863
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:26,240
initial problem scale so creating a

864
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,399
ripple effect in the body

865
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:29,919
and we thought it was a good analogy

866
00:32:29,919 --> 00:32:32,559
because if the malware industry like

867
00:32:32,559 --> 00:32:34,720
motivated offender trying to spread a

868
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:35,760
butt net

869
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:36,960
for example

870
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,519
is growing well there is a large

871
00:32:39,519 --> 00:32:42,159
informal workforce surrounding it that

872
00:32:42,159 --> 00:32:46,880
it maybe get hooked to it after a while

873
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,679
so in order to get get a little bit of

874
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:52,000
understanding of of the scale of this

875
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,279
problem we collected data from other

876
00:32:55,279 --> 00:32:57,919
similar platform as the forum

877
00:32:57,919 --> 00:33:00,240
so here here they are and we just sum

878
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:02,640
their advertised number of users

879
00:33:02,640 --> 00:33:05,039
and apply the same type lower bounds or

880
00:33:05,039 --> 00:33:06,480
the same seven percent and that would

881
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,440
give us

882
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:10,320
500 000 individuals that would be

883
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,640
criminal curious and it doesn't matter

884
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:14,960
whether we say five hundred thousand or

885
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,440
a million or two million what we want to

886
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:20,240
say at least is there is a mass there

887
00:33:20,240 --> 00:33:22,559
are people who are ready to work

888
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:25,840
and this is what matters right

889
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:29,519
so what we conclude from our analysis is

890
00:33:29,519 --> 00:33:31,919
there is a large informal workforce

891
00:33:31,919 --> 00:33:33,840
evolving at the periphery of the malware

892
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:36,840
industry that is necessary to to its

893
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:39,039
operation so the individuals that we

894
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:40,559
studied in the private chat log they

895
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:42,159
were not the motivated offender they

896
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,640
were not the people behind geos

897
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,559
but they were rather these individuals

898
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:49,519
like the workforce surrounding it

899
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:52,159
allowing the geos operators to spread

900
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:55,440
their infected apks

901
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,600
and these surrounding individuals we

902
00:33:57,600 --> 00:33:58,480
believe

903
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:02,000
well they may or may contribute i mean

904
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,919
think of the second act with dancing on

905
00:34:03,919 --> 00:34:05,760
the crime line

906
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:08,000
but based on our findings and like you

907
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,679
know studying the informality and

908
00:34:09,679 --> 00:34:12,079
criminality relationship over time

909
00:34:12,079 --> 00:34:13,520
we believe that

910
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:15,679
they would probably rather not and it

911
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:19,119
means that there are possibilities to

912
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:21,760
maybe avoid them drifting into some

913
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:24,079
cyber criminal activities by for example

914
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:26,480
changing their opportunistic landscape

915
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,399
so how do we conclude what is the key

916
00:34:28,399 --> 00:34:30,560
takeaway from this presentation well we

917
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:32,079
think that there is a need to dig

918
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:34,159
further on the mass effect and the role

919
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,879
of informal economies where drifters are

920
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:38,560
dancing on the crime line at the

921
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:41,839
periphery of the cyber crime industry

922
00:34:41,839 --> 00:34:43,599
and more importantly start thinking

923
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:47,040
beyond the concept of motivated offender

924
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,199
our research what it shows is most

925
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:51,280
people or lots of people involved in

926
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:54,079
cyber crime will not necessarily even be

927
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:56,079
aware of it or will

928
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:58,400
do it but not as motivated offenders

929
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:01,200
developing the very sophisticated scheme

930
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,520
so by using concepts like we developed

931
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,560
in this research mass effect drifters

932
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:09,440
informal economies we can kind of bring

933
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:11,760
more nuance to the narrative and

934
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:13,359
potentially a better understanding of

935
00:35:13,359 --> 00:35:15,520
the complex phenomenon that is at play

936
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:18,640
right now and as a take out or something

937
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:20,000
to bring home

938
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:21,200
we also thought that the three

939
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:23,839
techniques we presented the umap

940
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:26,240
the qualitative thematic analysis and

941
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:28,560
the group based trajectory modeling we

942
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,960
think they can be used in other research

943
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:33,200
so if you have any question feel free to

944
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,359
ask us it will be a pleasure to explain

945
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:37,920
in more details how they work and as a

946
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:40,400
final mention we want to thank flair

947
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,079
systems for allowing us to use their

948
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:44,000
data the stratosphere research

949
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:45,680
laboratory who's always been a really

950
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,200
great research partner and all their

951
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,200
members and also if you like the

952
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:50,880
different drawings in our presentation

953
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:53,839
it's jeremy mckenzie a designer from

954
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:56,480
tonegat.ca who helped us

955
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:58,160
and we want to thank also our respective

956
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,880
organization go secure and secure works

957
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,800
thank you very much and we'll be there

958
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:05,760
for questions
