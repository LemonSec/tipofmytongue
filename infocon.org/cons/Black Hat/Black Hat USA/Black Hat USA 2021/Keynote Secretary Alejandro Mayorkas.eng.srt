black hat sessions

11
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,119
ending up here in this room with me to

help close it down after a closing

13
00:00:25,119 --> 00:00:27,039
keynote something we've never really

14
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:28,480
done before

15
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:31,519
and uh who here is

16
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,040
just show up hands yell out say

17
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:33,840
something

18
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,520
has this been a pretty good black hat so

19
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,680
far

20
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,600
was it

21
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:40,800
was it sort of

22
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,399
nobody really knew what to expect

23
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,079
because none of us have ever done these

24
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:46,399
hybrid events before i mean it's been

25
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,680
weird for me

26
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:50,000
uh but in a good weird it seems less

27
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,039
like pressurized like less tension and

28
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,879
it seems more like people are chill and

29
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:55,190
just

30
00:00:55,190 --> 00:00:56,399
[Music]

31
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:57,920
really having a good time just you guys

32
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,160
getting that same feel

33
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,199
yeah

34
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,120
i wonder if it's is it is it the

35
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,280
situation we're in or is it just

36
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,439
less people or is it like self-selection

37
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,520
like we're the people who

38
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:11,360
like have those personality traits and

39
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,280
we're here so it's really extra cool for

40
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:14,799
us but but whatever it is it's been a

41
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,640
really refreshing black hat for me i've

42
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,799
really enjoyed it um so thanks for being

43
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,040
here for the for the closing

44
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:21,840
um

45
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,080
the remarks from the secretary um are

46
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,439
fairly short

47
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,759
so what i'm going to do is i'm going to

48
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:29,439
just expand a little bit on some of my

49
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,840
comments from this morning and i want to

50
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,520
introduce the secretary

51
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,040
he's going to do his

52
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,280
his remarks which are should be

53
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,320
interesting

54
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,840
and then i want to have just a couple

55
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,000
closing comments and then

56
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:44,640
see you at the bar or the pool

57
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,720
so let's get started

58
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,880
um so this morning i spoke a little bit

59
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:51,360
about my my opinion that there's sort of

60
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,680
three groups they write the rule of law

61
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,799
countries the sort of undecideds

62
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,240
and the authoritarian countries and

63
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,000
there's a certain amount of gravity

64
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,320
geopolitical gravity economic

65
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,079
demographic

66
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:07,119
and then

67
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:09,440
uh electronic right internet gravity

68
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:12,319
that's sort of forcing these alignments

69
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:13,200
and

70
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:15,599
there were a lot of us uh myself

71
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,000
included um when i was 10 years ago when

72
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,400
i was uh at icann

73
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,400
where we'd actively push back right we

74
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,680
don't want

75
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,080
these three groups we want it to be an

76
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:27,040
open

77
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,280
free and accessible internet we don't

78
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,959
want this and there were all kinds of

79
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,480
different terms we would refer to it as

80
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:34,720
a balkanization of the internet

81
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,360
except that i can representing all the

82
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,280
internet users of the world the people

83
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,640
from the balkans didn't like that

84
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,040
they're like that's a great analogy but

85
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,640
use another one

86
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:48,400
so then it was like the fragmentation of

87
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:50,000
the internet it was the splintering of

88
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,760
the internet whatever you want to call

89
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,920
it it's happening

90
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:54,800
and

91
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,480
because of some of it is because of good

92
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:57,760
intentions

93
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,280
data localization laws

94
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,400
the

95
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,480
for privacy gdpr whatever reason they

96
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,400
don't want citizen data right to be

97
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:08,640
forgotten or it might be for economic

98
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,879
competition they just want data centers

99
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:12,560
in their country so they're not all in

100
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,599
america

101
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:15,360
but what you're doing is you're creating

102
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,840
these different

103
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,800
pools and the different pools have

104
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,800
different attributes

105
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,800
and

106
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,560
at about the same time that in the early

107
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:26,560
2000s what was happening is

108
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:28,480
the western the western rule of law

109
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,360
countries pretty much set the standards

110
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,920
we built the internet we had ipv4 we had

111
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:35,599
ipv6 we kind of built a lot of the

112
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:37,920
standards the ietf

113
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,599
and a lot of those early companies those

114
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,920
innovative companies the the suns and

115
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,319
the hps and

116
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:46,400
they just pretty much slowly stopped

117
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,239
showing up to the standards

118
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,599
bodies

119
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,040
so

120
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,720
they were there in mass there'd be 10

121
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,319
engineers from hp and there'd be 10

122
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:56,400
people from sun and then there'd be five

123
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,159
and five and then there'd be less from

124
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:00,879
ibm and then less from microsoft and

125
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:03,519
pretty soon there's just a couple

126
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,000
and in about that time there were 20

127
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,959
from huawei and 30 from zte

128
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:10,080
and now

129
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,680
you can just see

130
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:13,280
like

131
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:15,360
it's not really intentional it was

132
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:17,199
sort of competitive pressure

133
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:18,959
hp kind of had what it needed it didn't

134
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,358
need to send a lot of engineers anymore

135
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:23,680
but you wake up now and who developed 5g

136
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,840
and why were all engineers

137
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,280
in china and why were they all chinese

138
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,040
manufacturers it's because they cared

139
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,160
more

140
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:31,360
right they put money where their mouth

141
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,960
was they sent whether it was an

142
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,960
industrial strategy from the government

143
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,400
or a competitive strategy from the

144
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,800
company they just sent more people

145
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,000
right and if you have a seat at the

146
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,680
table where the decisions are being made

147
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,680
chances are the decisions will go more

148
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,919
in your favor

149
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,520
and now finally we're starting to wake

150
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,560
up to this

151
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,080
and that's what's causing some of this

152
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,720
anxiety and some of this tension

153
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,000
um

154
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,600
you know i also saw this when i said i

155
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,919
can so ican has this multi-stakeholder

156
00:04:57,919 --> 00:04:59,360
model where they represent all these

157
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:01,680
different groups and that's in contrast

158
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,080
to the the united nations model for the

159
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:05,120
um

160
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,080
the itu international telecommunications

161
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,960
union

162
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,199
and the itu is only made up of un

163
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:12,479
members

164
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:13,919
now they have an interesting model where

165
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,199
they have to make a decision by

166
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:17,840
consensus it has to be unanimous consent

167
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,400
for them to pass a pass a rule

168
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:21,840
but

169
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:23,280
they've been debating on and off about

170
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,880
removing that

171
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,280
and china and russia and some other

172
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,400
countries

173
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:30,479
are very active in the itu and you

174
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,400
always hear them talking about wanting

175
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,000
to move internet governance to the itu

176
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,759
and generally it means that things will

177
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:39,360
get slower and it'll give more

178
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,280
operational freedom to countries like

179
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:42,960
russia and china

180
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,310
right china has veto russia has a veto

181
00:05:45,310 --> 00:05:47,600
[Music]

182
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,560
but it's also a clever way of wrapping

183
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:51,759
up

184
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:53,759
internet governance and moving it away

185
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:55,840
from the civilians and into the realm of

186
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,919
only governments right that's dangerous

187
00:05:57,919 --> 00:05:59,600
especially from my perspective from a

188
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,280
rule of law perspective

189
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,880
and that has also been going on for a

190
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:04,319
long time that's a long game that's a

191
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:06,479
multi-decade strategy that's occurring

192
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,720
right now in slow motion and if you're

193
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,400
an insider you see it happening and if

194
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,800
you're an outsider it's all new to you

195
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,120
right but there is this multi-decade

196
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:17,039
kind of seismic shift that's been

197
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:19,600
occurring and

198
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,360
when i was living in washington dc five

199
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,520
years ago ten

200
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,720
i would have these conversations with

201
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,039
people and i would say um

202
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,360
why does the united states not have an

203
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,280
industrial policy

204
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:32,479
all right we're one of the only

205
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:34,880
countries in the world that does not

206
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,120
have an industrial policy

207
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:38,880
is that intentional or is that sort of

208
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:41,759
accidental like why don't we

209
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:44,000
and the answers i'd get back from the

210
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,520
white house and and other people i

211
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:46,880
talked to was essentially well where

212
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,280
america sort of the dominant economic

213
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:53,199
economy and we don't need one we don't

214
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:54,639
have one that's not american we don't

215
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,560
really do that

216
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,680
i'm like yes but if all of your

217
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,680
frenemies are doing it france and

218
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,400
germany and everybody else they must be

219
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,919
getting something out of it why aren't

220
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:06,560
we doing it

221
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:08,400
well now

222
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,639
you see with

223
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:13,120
the tentative steps that tiptoe steps

224
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,160
america is starting to have an

225
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,680
industrial policy but we're calling it

226
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,840
something different

227
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,639
it is the white house strategy for 5g

228
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:22,720
with huawei that was the beginning of a

229
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,479
sort of recognized policy the state

230
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:25,919
department

231
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:28,400
clean network initiative

232
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,880
right clean pipes clean telecom

233
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,479
um you see more and more now

234
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:35,039
restrictions on on russian or chinese

235
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,039
companies getting into the market

236
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,639
right we are beginning to have an

237
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,319
industrial policy but we're not calling

238
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,759
it that

239
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,759
but don't be surprised pretty soon the

240
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:45,919
alignment of these three groups will

241
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:47,759
force an industrial policy on the united

242
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:48,639
states

243
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,919
whether we want it or not we're going to

244
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:51,360
have to have one because it's a tool

245
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,080
that we need to engage in this

246
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,719
competition

247
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,759
and so i think that it's very important

248
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:01,440
that there's this acknowledgment whether

249
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,360
the government wants to or not they're

250
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:05,759
they're engaging in this

251
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:07,680
um

252
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,360
and this is an acknowledgement also that

253
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,879
this is a different approach the

254
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:11,919
government has to take a different

255
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,400
approach the previous couple decades not

256
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,840
cutting it i'll tell you one quick story

257
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,240
to sort of explain it um

258
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,840
i don't think he's with the fbi anymore

259
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,160
but there was this guy

260
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,599
bobby flame

261
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,360
bobby flame

262
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:27,840
was like the sole representative

263
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,520
for the us government

264
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,960
uh that would show up at all these

265
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,320
different standards bodies he would be

266
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:34,159
there at the igf meeting he'd be at the

267
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:35,760
icann meeting working with a law

268
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:38,320
enforcement liaison group he would show

269
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,120
up

270
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:42,080
sometimes ietf meetings it was like

271
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,279
and then bobby would go back and you'd

272
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,720
write all those reports and they'd go to

273
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,760
all these different agencies and

274
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,200
departments in the government and it's

275
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:47,920
like

276
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,240
bobby had more air miles than anybody he

277
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,920
was always in the airport

278
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:52,959
and

279
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:55,279
fat was sort of our strategy as a

280
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:59,120
country to engage on internet governance

281
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:02,560
bobby flame right

282
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,160
not terribly competitive when you

283
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,600
compare it against other countries that

284
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,120
have giant budgets and lots of people

285
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:08,640
that have

286
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:10,320
recognized internet governance or

287
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,080
recognized internet competition as

288
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:13,600
something strategic and we're going

289
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:14,880
after it

290
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:16,000
now

291
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,560
finally it sounds like this is

292
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,320
starting to become

293
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,360
recognized within our own government and

294
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:24,800
that's why i'm looking forward to the

295
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:26,399
secretary's comments because i think

296
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,160
it's going to take a different approach

297
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,519
from government

298
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:31,920
what we've tried in the past didn't work

299
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,120
um

300
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:35,200
i'll give you one other example

301
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,040
when the nti the national

302
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,360
telecommunications something agency

303
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,600
did a transition with icann icann used

304
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,519
to be sort of under the iana functions

305
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:47,360
were under the eyesight of ntia

306
00:09:47,360 --> 00:09:49,040
department of commerce and then there

307
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,839
was this transition so now ican is free

308
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:53,360
the multi-stakeholder model it's not

309
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,720
beholden

310
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,880
to the us government it's not under the

311
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,040
protection of the us government anymore

312
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,640
which is has its own kind of

313
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:01,920
complications

314
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,680
um

315
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,440
well when this transition was occurring

316
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:07,040
the us government was in the driver's

317
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,040
seat the us government could have said

318
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,440
you know what we really want to do this

319
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,200
transition

320
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,040
but we want to make sure that you're you

321
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:18,079
have a vision i can i can community so

322
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:19,680
why don't you answer these five

323
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:21,519
difficult questions for us go to your

324
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,440
community and answer five of these

325
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,079
whatever tough questions um

326
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,959
can a foreign country buy a root name

327
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:30,480
server

328
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:32,640
nobody knows what happens if the root

329
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,279
name server guy gets hit by a bus

330
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:37,360
can he in his will

331
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:39,440
transition the root server to somebody

332
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:40,560
else

333
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:42,480
well nobody knows right and there were

334
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,720
these difficult questions that nobody

335
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:46,560
ever wanted asked

336
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,240
and the us government could have forced

337
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,959
it

338
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,920
and they could have made

339
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,240
the multi-stakeholder model

340
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,240
become more transparent and grow up but

341
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,240
they didn't instead they just let the

342
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,200
transition occur it's still

343
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,040
i think i can still muddied with a lot

344
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,959
of these half answered questions that

345
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,279
are then used against them

346
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:09,279
by people who want to move governance

347
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:11,120
into the itu right we could have used it

348
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,720
to enable

349
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,240
beat up the arguments counter the

350
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,920
arguments that the people died you want

351
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,399
and really created a more open and

352
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:20,880
transparent uh body that then we could

353
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,279
use in this upcoming struggle

354
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,920
but that wasn't acknowledged that way

355
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,640
opportunity lost

356
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,000
so now with acknowledgement happening

357
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,680
i'm really curious to see what is this

358
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,279
government going to do

359
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,640
right they've lost a couple of

360
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,920
opportunities

361
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,160
so let me tell you a little bit about

362
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,160
the secretary and then we'll kick off

363
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,440
his remarks

364
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,480
um alejandro mayorkas was born in cuba

365
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,000
havana

366
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,680
and shortly after the cuban revolution

367
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,320
his family fled to florida

368
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,760
and later settled in california

369
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,560
he graduated from uc berkeley in history

370
00:11:58,560 --> 00:11:59,920
with honors

371
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,839
and subsequently earned his jd from

372
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:04,000
loyola loyola marymont university in

373
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:05,440
california

374
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,839
then after law school he went to work as

375
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:10,399
an assistant united states attorney has

376
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,079
appointed the united states attorney for

377
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,480
the central district in california

378
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,519
so he

379
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:16,880
professionally developed himself in

380
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:19,040
california and in los angeles in

381
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,320
particular

382
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,519
during the administration of bill

383
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:23,440
clinton and

384
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,120
george w bush

385
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:26,880
where he oversaw the prosecution of high

386
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,800
profile criminal

387
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:29,839
cases

388
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,440
and then in 2009 to 2013

389
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:35,519
he oversaw the united states citizenship

390
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,639
and immigration service ucis

391
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,240
and then he was the deputy secretary of

392
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,240
dhs from 2013 to 2016 under jay johnson

393
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:46,720
and that's where i get to i got to meet

394
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,200
uh and become friends with

395
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,800
ali um

396
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,880
he was the sec or the deputy secretary

397
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:55,279
and and he had a lot of cyber

398
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:56,800
responsibilities

399
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,639
and um and i was on the homeland

400
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:00,160
security advisory council and so we

401
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,600
would interact on

402
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:04,959
um on different issues and

403
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,920
he ended up coming uh the secretary back

404
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,600
then it was the deputy secretary he came

405
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:13,200
to defcon defcon 23 six years ago

406
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,800
and he gave a speech about the

407
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,440
importance of of building trust

408
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,360
a lot of what we heard from jen easterly

409
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,560
this morning about how do you build

410
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,639
trust between these communities

411
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,600
and

412
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:25,519
so i'm interested to see if he touches

413
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:28,560
on that that key theme

414
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:31,279
and so i'd like to

415
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,519
introduce the secretary's talk and i'll

416
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,920
be back afterwards so take it away thank

417
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,600
you alejandro sorry you couldn't be here

418
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,000
in person

419
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:49,920
good afternoon i'm very sorry uh that

420
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,320
i'm not joining you in person i was very

421
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,480
much looking forward to being with you

422
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,800
in vegas again including to stop by

423
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:59,519
queer khan and other events but the

424
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,000
unprecedented situation with respect to

425
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,720
covet 19 and the rising delta variant

426
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,880
prevents me from being there with you i

427
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,600
can assure you that if i was there in

428
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,079
person i wouldn't be dressed like i am

429
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:13,519
now

430
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,160
as you uh know better than most a lot

431
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,800
has changed in the last six years as it

432
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:20,800
relates to the cyber security landscape

433
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,279
we've shifted from news headlines about

434
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,079
data breaches and espionage to

435
00:14:26,079 --> 00:14:28,240
ransomware attacks disrupting hospital

436
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,199
schools

437
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,000
food suppliers and pipelines

438
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,639
the assaults on companies like colonial

439
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:37,600
pipeline jbs foods and cassaya not to

440
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,639
mention interference in our elections

441
00:14:40,639 --> 00:14:42,720
have reinforced the importance of cyber

442
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,839
security of how we govern the internet

443
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,480
and of why we need a free and secure

444
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,320
cyberspace

445
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,079
what we face today is a need to put the

446
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:54,160
big questions of our time into

447
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:55,440
perspective

448
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,519
in order to do so

449
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,399
let me take you back for a moment

450
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:02,959
a couple hundred years

451
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,880
at a time

452
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,800
long before the world could fathom the

453
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:10,000
concept of computers cyberspace coding

454
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,399
hacking or anything like it

455
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:15,040
let's turn to the early and mid 19th

456
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:16,800
century when some of the most powerful

457
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,480
nations on the planet

458
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,959
engage in what would later be known as

459
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:22,800
the great game

460
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,639
this was an era when the competition for

461
00:15:24,639 --> 00:15:26,639
geopolitical influence pitted great

462
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:27,519
britain

463
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:29,680
against russia and china over the

464
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,519
question of who would control the vast

465
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:34,240
land mass of central asia

466
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,759
who would determine the rules of the

467
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:38,880
road for trade travel and commerce

468
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,360
and whose values and priorities would

469
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,440
shape societies across the globe

470
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,600
the fight then was over land

471
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,079
access to land led to control over

472
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:52,480
people's lives health jobs and

473
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,600
well-being

474
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,240
and there was a divide between a deeply

475
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:00,000
flawed yet aspiring democracy in britain

476
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
and the tsars and dynasties who were

477
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,399
focused on autocratic control over

478
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:05,920
everything in their path

479
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,399
promoting and enforcing a closed

480
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:12,320
disconnected and oppressive system

481
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,959
we could spend many hours discussing the

482
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:17,360
legacy of this chapter in history what

483
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,279
it means for us now what it what has

484
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:21,839
changed and what lessons we can and

485
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:24,320
should glean from it

486
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:26,880
but here at black hat

487
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:28,959
i want to use this legacy as a jumping

488
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,680
off point to discuss another great game

489
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,240
that is playing out before us today and

490
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:36,720
that will in fact dramatically shape our

491
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,560
future

492
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,480
although we're no longer fighting for

493
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,079
control of land

494
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:44,800
we are competing for territory we cannot

495
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:45,759
see

496
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,839
we are competing for the future of

497
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:49,120
cyberspace

498
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:51,040
one in which friends gather

499
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,519
colleagues communicate businesses sell

500
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:55,120
consumers buy

501
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:57,120
dissidents organize

502
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:58,959
horrific crimes occur

503
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:01,199
governments hear from their citizens and

504
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:03,600
information is widely and quickly

505
00:17:03,600 --> 00:17:05,679
disseminated

506
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:08,559
we are competing between two visions

507
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:10,880
one from countries like russia china and

508
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,919
iran

509
00:17:11,919 --> 00:17:14,000
who want to limit access and maximize

510
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,280
control

511
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,959
and another from the united states and

512
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:19,520
our allies who want to build and protect

513
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,480
a free open and secure internet

514
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:26,799
we must ultimately confront some

515
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,640
critical questions

516
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,520
who will build own control and operate

517
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:33,600
the underlying infrastructure of the

518
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:36,480
internet extending from underseat cables

519
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,240
to data centers

520
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,559
who will shape the future of data

521
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,679
routing

522
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:43,679
how will we protect both privacy and

523
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,200
security online and offline

524
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,520
how will we better protect ourselves

525
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,760
against continuously growing and quickly

526
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:55,120
evolving cyber threats

527
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,320
every day

528
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,160
the department of homeland security

529
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,160
tackles these issues which are not

530
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:02,320
limited to the great game that exists

531
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,559
between democratic and authoritarian

532
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,880
governments as they also include the

533
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:09,039
relationship between government

534
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,600
and private sector entities

535
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:14,000
the role we play in this space may

536
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,320
surprise many of you

537
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,000
take the u.s secret service which is

538
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,240
part of our department and responsible

539
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:22,400
not only for protecting the president

540
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,200
but also actively fighting ransomware

541
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,360
and a range of other cyber enabled

542
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:28,640
crimes

543
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,480
or look at tsa

544
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,000
best known for protecting airport

545
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:34,160
security as so many of us know that

546
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,640
maintains regulatory authority over

547
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,600
pipelines which we leveraged following

548
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,240
the colonial pipeline ransomware attack

549
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,400
to take urgent and critical measures to

550
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:46,880
better protect against immediate cyber

551
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,160
threats

552
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:50,720
or consider the coast guard which saves

553
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,440
thousands of lives at sea every year and

554
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:55,600
also protects the maritime

555
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,520
transportation system against cyber

556
00:18:57,520 --> 00:18:58,960
threats

557
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,679
and last look at the department's cyber

558
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:03,760
security and infrastructure security

559
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:07,200
agency or cisa as it is commonly known

560
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,400
which is the federal government's

561
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:11,120
quarterback on cyber security

562
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,160
sysa reinforces our cyber resilience

563
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:15,840
and equips critical infrastructure

564
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,559
owners and operators cities and states

565
00:19:18,559 --> 00:19:21,280
businesses and organizations of all

566
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,320
sizes

567
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:24,799
and even hospitals and schools

568
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:26,960
with the tools to defend against cyber

569
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:29,200
attacks

570
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,960
earlier today you heard from jen

571
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,160
easterly

572
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:34,720
cisa's new director who talked about her

573
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,120
journey from mastering the rubik's cube

574
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,760
as a child to attending west point

575
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:42,320
serving in iraq and at fort meade

576
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,240
working as a senior leader at morgan

577
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,520
stanley and now serving at dhs to help

578
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,280
us confront some of the most urgent

579
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:53,120
challenges currently facing our country

580
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:56,080
jen exemplifies the impressive talent we

581
00:19:56,080 --> 00:19:58,559
have brought together at dhs to work on

582
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:01,600
cyber security and resilience

583
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,320
i'm particularly excited about the new

584
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,880
joint cyber defense collaborative that

585
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:09,440
sysa is launching to unite stakeholders

586
00:20:09,440 --> 00:20:11,280
from across the federal government and

587
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:14,000
the private sector around a whole of

588
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,640
nation approach to cyber defense

589
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,240
operations

590
00:20:18,240 --> 00:20:20,720
i have said before that the department

591
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:23,520
of homeland security dhs

592
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,520
is a fundamentally

593
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:27,600
a department of partnerships

594
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,000
this collaborative is just one of many

595
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:32,480
efforts underway designed to leverage

596
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,039
our partners to keep our communities

597
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:36,880
safe

598
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:38,799
we're really hard at work

599
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,039
and we have no illusions about the road

600
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,360
ahead there is nothing simple about the

601
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,000
cyber security challenges we face

602
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,200
and we need your help to get this right

603
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,400
we need your expertise to inform our

604
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,600
policies

605
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:57,520
and the future of our critical mission

606
00:20:57,520 --> 00:21:00,320
we invite you to share your views with

607
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:01,039
us

608
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:03,600
we will not shy away from the most

609
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,320
complex matters before us in fact we

610
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:07,440
invite

611
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,080
a fierce debate take for example data

612
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,520
routing

613
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,080
there are open-ended questions we simply

614
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,679
cannot ignore

615
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:16,400
who

616
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,720
will protect data as it travels around

617
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:19,919
the world

618
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,679
should the united states government take

619
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,720
a more proactive role in shaping data

620
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,679
flows

621
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:28,080
or do we leave that responsibility to

622
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,679
the private sector

623
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:32,159
how can we ensure that american

624
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:34,960
technology enterprises remain at the

625
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,440
heart of the internet's infrastructure

626
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:40,400
across every layer from the edge to the

627
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,720
center as we move forward

628
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,799
how will we set the rules

629
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,520
how will we balance the united states

630
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:49,760
and our allies priorities

631
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:52,480
to create more openness and connectivity

632
00:21:52,480 --> 00:21:54,000
and freedom

633
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,320
while autocratic regimes like russia and

634
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,480
china are laying claim to greater

635
00:21:58,480 --> 00:21:59,520
control

636
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:03,760
with zero transparency or accountability

637
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:06,880
these debates are necessary the search

638
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,440
for smart solutions is essential in the

639
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:10,559
demand

640
00:22:10,559 --> 00:22:14,000
for balanced principal policies is

641
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,919
unquestioned

642
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,400
at the department of homeland security

643
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,200
we're dedicating considerable time

644
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:24,240
energy and resources to carefully think

645
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,720
through these complicated questions

646
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,840
and alongside our counterparts worldwide

647
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,640
and in the private sector we work to

648
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:34,240
solve them

649
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:35,760
we would really benefit from your

650
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,120
expertise

651
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,280
and we invite you

652
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,840
to join the conversation we cannot

653
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:43,760
ignore an essential truth

654
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:46,640
we are all in this together

655
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,039
we must also acknowledge what we all

656
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:49,840
know

657
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,600
which is that full agreement on every

658
00:22:51,600 --> 00:22:54,640
issue is impossible and unanimity cannot

659
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:57,760
be the measure of success or progress

660
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:00,159
the fact is the strength of our

661
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:03,039
democracy the promotion of a free and

662
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:05,520
open internet the fairness of our

663
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:08,080
economies and the security of our

664
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,960
communities is a shared responsibility

665
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,440
that is more timely and more relevant

666
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,320
than ever before

667
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,960
these ideals apply to what is happening

668
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:20,400
in cyberspace

669
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:23,039
what is transpiring on the internet and

670
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:26,080
how we govern the digital sphere where

671
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,200
so much engagement activism advocacy

672
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,640
education and economic activity occur

673
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,480
today

674
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,799
the great game is playing out in

675
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,360
cyberspace right now i know that all of

676
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:41,760
you love to work on tough problems

677
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,159
you're compelled to solve seemingly

678
00:23:44,159 --> 00:23:47,200
unsolvable puzzles so here's the bottom

679
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:48,000
line

680
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:49,600
we need your help

681
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,919
we cannot answer these questions alone

682
00:23:51,919 --> 00:23:54,400
and we want you to join us in addressing

683
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,720

00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,440
practices in their communities

730
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,000
we're increasing access to the field of

731
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:49,120
cyber security across every level we

732

seek to draw on every ounce of talent

733

and maximize the incredible potential

734
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,360
that exists in communities across our

735
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:01,360

we need you to help us navigate a path

741
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,120
that has not yet been mapped

742
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:16,960
what's at stake here

743
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:18,640
is nothing less than the future of the

744
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:19,760
internet

745
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,840
the future of our economic and national

746
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:26,159
security and the future of our country

747
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:26,880
so

748
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,200
let's keep this conversation going to

749
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,760
protect our neighbors our networks our

750
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:33,440
families our rights

751
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,720
our rights

752
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,159
and ourselves

753
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,200
we have to work together let's do it

754
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:42,159
and thanks very much

755
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,520
i hadn't i hadn't watched that before

756
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:50,960
they just sent it in

757
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,279
earlier this afternoon so

758
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,720
it's pretty interesting to watch pretty

759
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,279
inspiring

760
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:58,799
it's weird hearing a lot of your themes

761
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:01,120
kind of echoed back toward you

762
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,200
from a higher level

763
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:04,240
and

764
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:06,000
so i'm looking forward to seeing where

765
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:08,400
this conversation goes uh in our

766
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,600
community and in in uh policy circles

767
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:13,440
um one thing you mentioned about seven

768
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,880
years ago about some of the hiring

769
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,760
authorities i just want to highlight um

770
00:27:17,760 --> 00:27:19,200
back when i was on the

771
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,399
hsac

772
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,240
we did this task force called the cyber

773
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:24,640
skills task force and we were looking at

774
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,919
all the cyber skills within the

775
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:28,559
department and why people were

776
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:29,919
advancing or not

777
00:27:29,919 --> 00:27:30,880
and

778
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,559
a lot of what we

779
00:27:32,559 --> 00:27:34,880
discovered put into recommendations some

780
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:36,399
of them were enacted and some of them

781
00:27:36,399 --> 00:27:37,760
were just impossible because of

782
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:39,039
legislation

783
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:41,200
that was 2012.

784
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,960
now finally with all these announcements

785
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:44,320
that are coming out

786
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,640
it takes time but almost a decade later

787
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:49,440
they're finally organizing in such a way

788
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,159
that

789
00:27:50,159 --> 00:27:52,240
you can be compensated not by you don't

790
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:54,000
have to have a college degree

791
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,640
you have to pass the skills tests right

792
00:27:56,640 --> 00:27:58,720
that's what we were advocating for

793
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,520
skills based evaluation

794
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,520
this is what they do in customs and

795
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,720
border patrol

796
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:05,520
they

797
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:07,360
run you through real-life scenarios and

798
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,600
see how you interact and if you pass

799
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:12,240
then great you you can advance this is i

800
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:14,080
think this is what we were advocating

801
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,399
for in the department

802
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:18,320
not don't take a test don't need a sisp

803
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:20,320
whatever put them in a console and see

804
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,320
if they can detect malware put them on

805
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:24,640
the network and see what they discover

806
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,320
reverse engineer a threat that was

807
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:28,399
discovered from us cert

808
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:30,080
right and then if they have the skills

809
00:28:30,080 --> 00:28:30,880
great

810
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,880
because what you can do then is you can

811
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,240
test them at different levels and you

812
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,080
can say

813
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:37,360
here's a question we didn't have an

814
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:38,480
answer to

815
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,760
are there too many people at the

816
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:41,120
department

817
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,120
at the lowest skill level are there too

818
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:44,799
many people at the highest skill level

819
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,360
what's our mis mix of skills

820
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:48,960
nobody can answer that

821
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,480
but if you start doing skill based

822
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,559
evaluation you can say guess what we

823
00:28:52,559 --> 00:28:54,880
have all these fives and we have nobody

824
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:56,559
at a low level we need to start bringing

825
00:28:56,559 --> 00:28:58,559
in younger talent and training them up

826
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,159
or it's the opposite everybody's low

827
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:01,679
level and we don't have any seniors to

828
00:29:01,679 --> 00:29:03,840
teach the more advanced skills

829
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,840
well now with these new hiring

830
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,760
authorities

831
00:29:07,760 --> 00:29:10,320
more ability to remote work

832
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,760
i hope that they can finally really get

833
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:13,919
a handle on this because as you heard

834
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:16,159
right there's a bigger game afoot and uh

835
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,760
that means they're gonna have to do

836
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:19,520
business differently or their

837
00:29:19,520 --> 00:29:21,600
their lunch is gonna get eaten uh and

838
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,840
i'm so i'm happy to advise them i'm

839
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,480
hoping people in this room get involved

840
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,840
and provide advice um because

841
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:30,640
like

842
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,559
like i said it's internet problems or

843
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:33,679
global problems we're all in this

844
00:29:33,679 --> 00:29:34,640
together

845
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:35,520
so

846
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,440
on that note i really want to thank

847
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,360
