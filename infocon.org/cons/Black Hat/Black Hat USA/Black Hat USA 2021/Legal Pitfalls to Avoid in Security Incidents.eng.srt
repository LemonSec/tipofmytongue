13
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:51,600
what i want to talk about today first so

14
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,360
who's this lawyer and why is he here why

15
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,840
am i interested in this security

16
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,320
incident talk and why am i giving it at

17
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,719
black hat well so i before becoming a

18
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,120
lawyer for about a decade i was an

19
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:05,040
information security professional i was

20
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,720
a systems network and security engineer

21
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:08,880
in a variety of roles uh one at a

22
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,680
large.com i've been in the public sector

23
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:13,439
and i kind of transitioned that

24
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:15,520
experience into a legal career where

25
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:18,159
today i head up the data security and

26
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,400
privacy practice at the

27
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,759
law firm ice miller that i mentioned

28
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:23,200
before

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:25,040
and the reason i'm really interested in

30
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,119
this topic is i work a ton of security

31
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,600
incidents i've probably worked

32
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:31,759
i've acted as a data breach coach for

33
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,079
maybe 500 or more security incidents at

34
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:35,600
this point and they range from

35
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:36,960
everything you could possibly imagine

36
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,159
too someone leaving a laptop into a car

37
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:42,159
that had some customer information on it

38
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:43,200
to

39
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,720
some of the largest ransomware events

40
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,040
that you might have heard of and the

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,040
thing that i've found in these events

42
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,560
time and time again is that it

43
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:55,040
professionals security folks

44
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,880
people that are not lawyers because

45
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,640
that's not what you do every day find

46
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,479
yourself in this weird situation of a

47
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,799
security incident where you have to

48
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:04,880
think like a lawyer or at least have a

49
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,240
lawyer there

50
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,920
to help you understand some of these

51
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,959
legal minds that you can walk on um and

52
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:12,160
the things that we're going to talk

53
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:14,959
about today in particular are uh

54
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,560
attorney-client privilege and i'm going

55
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,160
to spend quite a bit of time on attorney

56
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:19,520
client privilege because this is

57
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,520
becoming more and more

58
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:22,959
of an issue

59
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,800
we'll be talking about cyber risk

60
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,239
insurance

61
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:28,400
we'll be talking about other things in

62
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:31,120
this area like ofac and the new advisory

63
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,720
opinion that came out in october and how

64
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,400
that's really dramatically changing the

65
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:36,080
security incident game at least in terms

66
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,840
of ransomware and we'll be talking about

67
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,519
some other things as well

68
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:41,519
so what i'm going to do with this talk

69
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,440
is try to focus on

70
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,239
things that i've experienced and issues

71
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,080
that i've run across and how they could

72
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,480
have been easily avoided by just having

73
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,280
a conversation or just thinking about

74
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,840
the the event as a lawyer for a second

75
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,920
and although many of the folks who are

76
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,120
going to be listening to this might not

77
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,800
be lawyers i'm hopefully going to give

78
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,319
you a little bit of a toolkit that you

79
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,920
can think like a lawyer in these

80
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:05,920
situations at least think about those

81
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:08,000
minds that i was talking about so let's

82
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,920
jump into attorney-client privilege

83
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,000
first uh so if you're not familiar with

84
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,200
the attorney client privileges we've all

85
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,879
heard about this on tv or maybe you've

86
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:16,319
read an article or maybe you've listened

87
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,239
to a podcast where someone has mentioned

88
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,680
oh i can't i can't say that that's

89
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:21,440
attorney-client privilege well what does

90
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,519
privilege actually mean at the outset

91
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,280
i'll just spend a couple seconds on this

92
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,879
so what attorney client privilege is the

93
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,159
whole purpose of it is uh to make it so

94
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,400
a client who wants to seek advice from

95
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,239
her from an attorney can say whatever

96
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:36,080
the heck they want to that attorney and

97
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,840
they know that that attorney is not

98
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,120
going to go off and share that

99
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,120
information with somebody else and more

100
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,720
importantly that attorney cannot be

101
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,319
compelled to testify against that client

102
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,920
that's really kind of the the whole

103
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:49,920
focus of attorney client privilege so if

104
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,080
you come to me and let's say you say you

105
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:54,480
know i murdered someone five years ago i

106
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:55,920
can't then go to the police and go hey i

107
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:57,280
found your murderer

108
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,799
because you would have established an

109
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:00,239
attorney attorney-client relationship

110
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,159
with me i can't disclose that now of

111
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:03,360
course there's exceptions to

112
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,879
attorney-client privilege if you came to

113
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,439
me and said you know in about 30 seconds

114
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:09,680
i am going to murder someone well then

115
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:10,959
i'm actually compelled ethically

116
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,360
compelled to uh to disclose that to try

117
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,280
to prevent that from occurring but you

118
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,160
know for fat for past wrongs you know

119
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:19,839
your attorney cannot disclose that

120
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,358
information but there's many

121
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:22,960
misconceptions about attorney-client

122
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,360
privilege the first is not everything

123
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:28,720
you say to an attorney is privileged

124
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:30,560
now your communication to me if there's

125
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,840
an attorney-client privilege or

126
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,759
attorney-client relationship might be a

127
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,040
privileged communication and the content

128
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,440
of our discussion may not be disclosed

129
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,840
but that doesn't mean the subject matter

130
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:44,240
of that information is privileged you

131
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,560
can't for example disclose a bunch of

132
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,479
facts to an attorney and then have that

133
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:50,880
attorney say well my client can never

134
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,560
talk about these facts ever again

135
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,160
because of the attorney-client privilege

136
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,160
my client told that to me so no one can

137
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,759
get these facts out

138
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:00,400
so underlining facts are not going to be

139
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,440
privileged

140
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,479
and this is really important in a

141
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:04,720
security incident because most of what

142
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,680
we do

143
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,560
is

144
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,639
going to involve an attorney and i'm

145
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,000
going to talk about attorney-client

146
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,759
privilege and when a regulator asks me

147
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,919
to disclose information or maybe i'm

148
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,840
asked in a court case to disclose

149
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,199
documents or information about our

150
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,880
investigation i'm going to say hey we

151
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,639
did this investigation

152
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:22,479
in anticipation of litigation and i'm

153
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:23,840
not going to disclose any of this to you

154
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,680
because it's privileged information but

155
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,919
that doesn't mean that the underlining

156
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:30,320
facts in the security incident are also

157
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:32,880
privileged for example if the attacker

158
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,800
got in through compromise credentials

159
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,039
through some citrix account

160
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:39,360
that just because that was told to an

161
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,960
attorney at some point

162
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,360
doesn't mean that that fact is

163
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,880
privileged that's just an underlying

164
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,360
fact to the uh to the event and those

165
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:49,280
facts are not privileged my analysis on

166
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:52,639
your uh notification obligations or um

167
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,560
or the fact that i can't be brought to

168
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,919
testify against you that's what

169
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:58,560
privilege is going to protect um so this

170
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:00,400
is an important thing to think about

171
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,560
also you want to think about waiver of

172
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:03,600
privilege

173
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:06,000
you can at any time choose to just waive

174
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,680
your privilege and if you waive

175
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,120
privilege there's some jurisdictions

176
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,800
that say you wave privilege on

177
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:13,199
absolutely everything you can't pick and

178
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:15,039
choose waving privilege for example

179
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:18,319
there's a case uh that that stands for a

180
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,199
situation where a forensics provider

181
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,759
wanted to disclose portions of a report

182
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:24,880
to a

183
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,880
non-lawyer and so what they did is i

184
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,160
think was a regulator and so what they

185
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:30,479
did is they redacted portions of their

186
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,800
forensics analysis their forensics

187
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,800
report and they disclose the portions

188
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,520
with redactions to that regulator well a

189
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,360
court in that case said hey you can't

190
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,960
have your cake and eat it too here you

191
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,080
can't take a privileged document redact

192
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,960
parts of it and then cherry pick uh the

193
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,479
good parts that you like and disclose

194
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,639
that to regulators if you disclose any

195
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,560
portion of this document you're going to

196
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,800
waive privilege on the whole document so

197
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:55,919
that's something you really need to be

198
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,199
careful of and i'll be talking about

199
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,360
that in a second

200
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,520
so there is a major opinion that

201
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,599
happened earlier this year in this clark

202
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,919
hill case uh this was a security

203
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:08,400
incident case where a plaintiff brought

204
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,240
an action against clark hill and really

205
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:12,560
at the the thrust of this case or this

206
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,319
this memorandum that i'm really focused

207
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,919
on is a motion to compel the defendant

208
00:07:17,919 --> 00:07:19,599
clark hill

209
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:22,599
to produce all reports of the forensic

210
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:24,960
investigation into the cyber attack that

211
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:26,960
led to the public dissemination of this

212
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,120
plaintiff's confidential information and

213
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,280
they also uh wanted the court to force

214
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,720
the defendant to provide answers to

215
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,280
interrogatories that kind of got towards

216
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,280
the uh the subject matter of that

217
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,720
forensics report

218
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,319
and what happened in this case i'm going

219
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,919
to go through the details in a second

220
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:43,440
what happened in this case is that the

221
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,280
court said hey uh you didn't meet your

222
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,039
burden to show that this report or a

223
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,360
similar document like the report was

224
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,800
wouldn't have just been created in the

225
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:52,639
ordinary course of business irrespective

226
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,039
of litigation so the whole purpose of

227
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:56,639
this investigation which was done by

228
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:58,560
duff and phelps as you can see here

229
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,919
the whole purpose of the investigation

230
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:02,319
they said was to where clark hill and

231
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,720
and duff and phelps said hey we did this

232
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,680
report and an anticipation of litigation

233
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,000
meaning we are creating this document in

234
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,120
preparing for defending ourselves from

235
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:15,840
this exact lawsuit and the court which

236
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,080
reviewed the report said no i i don't i

237
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,840
just don't buy that based on the

238
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:21,360
information that i have in front of me i

239
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,800
do not buy that

240
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,879
how did this happen so the first and

241
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:26,080
this is a lot of text so i'm just going

242
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,720
to tell you what this says uh so the

243
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,280
first argument was they created this

244
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:33,120
engagement letter and in the engagement

245
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,958
letter uh between clark hill and duffin

246
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:37,360
phelps they said hey uh we are doing

247
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,760
this uh investigation and preparing of

248
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,360
this report in anticipation for

249
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,519
litigation and it had it straight up in

250
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:45,440
the engagement letter and that has been

251
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,000
a best practice forever and it still is

252
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,600
a best practice i'm not telling you that

253
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,040
this is not a best practice this is

254
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,800
still something that you should be doing

255
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:54,560
um they said hey we're going to have an

256
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,600
engagement letter we're going to say

257
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,959
we're doing this at the direction of

258
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:58,880
counsel and anticipation of litigation

259
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,160
and the court said look that's not

260
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:02,000
enough you can't just paper privilege

261
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,640
you have to act like it's also

262
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,480
a privileged investigation and they

263
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,160
focus on a couple things associated with

264
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,399
the investigation the first is uh

265
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,720
although you took this two-track

266
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:14,640
investigation and this is another best

267
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:16,640
practice that i still advise folks to do

268
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:18,399
if you want some investigation to be

269
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,320
privileged you're doing a litigation

270
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,360
defense investigation that investigation

271
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:25,839
should be done separate and apart from

272
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:28,000
your ordinary course investigations you

273
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,680
see in the quotes here your ordinary

274
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,440
course business investigation where look

275
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:33,200
you need to respond to the security

276
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,880
incident you need to have somebody come

277
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,120
in and do an investigation just discover

278
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:38,640
facts what happened and what's the

279
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:39,760
company going to do to get all their

280
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,240
systems back that is one track that is

281
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:43,920
the east center track here that they

282
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:45,279
tried to say that was our ordinary

283
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:47,200
course investigation and then they tried

284
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:49,040
to say we had this special duff and

285
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:50,800
phelps investigation and that

286
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,959
investigation was done in anticipation

287
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:55,760
of litigation but the issue in and you

288
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:57,120
see in the bottom little

289
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,720
bucket here the court said look the

290
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,399
problem here is that this two-track

291
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:02,480
story was not supported in the record

292
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,320
all they had to support it was a

293
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,399
statement uh from somebody in the

294
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,320
organization that said yeah we did this

295
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,320
uh investigation anticipation litigation

296
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,560
they actually they they allege that

297
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,800
there was really no uh separate

298
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:16,880
separation here they may have had this

299
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,399
separate outside party that was

300
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,760
assisting in this ordinary course

301
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:22,160
investigation but it really i mean it

302
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:24,800
was uh the the duff and phelps work

303
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,240
really was the ordinary course

304
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,160
investigation as well is what the court

305
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,360
said

306
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,160
then

307
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:32,560
but now again you should continue to do

308
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,160
these two track investigations and i

309
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,760
advise clients in your instant response

310
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,560
plan to have a two-track approach where

311
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:39,600
you have your ordinary course

312
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,120
investigation and then a completely 100

313
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:44,640
separate team

314
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,720
is doing the privilege investigation so

315
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,160
although the court said that paper

316
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,600
privilege and this approach was not

317
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,680
enough here uh and we'll get to why on

318
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,600
actually the next slide uh you really

319
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:55,600
should have this two-track investigation

320
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,880
if you want to try to preserve privilege

321
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:59,200
of these investigations

322
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,200
then the other issue that they ran into

323
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,240
was hey you can't just share this duff

324
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,519
and phelps report that you say is

325
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:07,519
privileged all across the organization

326
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,800
and act like it's a privileged

327
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,560
investigation and that was another issue

328
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,560
here where they said that this was

329
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:14,640
shared with the board of directors

330
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,600
this was shared widely as it says in

331
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,279
this quote throughout the organization

332
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,040
and that's something that cut against

333
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,279
this being a privileged investigation so

334
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:25,519
the sum up of this

335
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,120
approach is if you want to protect

336
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,880
privilege in an investigation security

337
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,360
incident you have to one paper it up you

338
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:32,560
have to have that engagement letter that

339
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,959
we saw on the first slide uh and the

340
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:36,160
engagement letter should say hey i'm

341
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,160
doing this in anticipation of litigation

342
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,120
this is going to be a privileged

343
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,120
investigation you should continue to do

344
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:43,360
your two-track investigations but then

345
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,279
you have to own and this is the big one

346
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,720
you have to only use that report for

347
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:51,360
litigation preparedness you can't use

348
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,839
that report as your ordinary business

349
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:55,920
outcome report meaning you're not taking

350
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:58,320
this privileged investigation report and

351
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,600
giving it to directors in the

352
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:01,519
organization talking to the board about

353
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,440
it on saying hey here's what duff and

354
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:05,200
phelps found they said we need to deploy

355
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,959
multi-factor authentication they said

356
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,120
you know we probably should have

357
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,720
some sort of patching strategy we have

358
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:13,279
none and that type of stuff done to the

359
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:14,800
board and i don't know if clark hill did

360
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:16,240
this in this case i'm just kind of a

361
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:17,020
pining

362
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,160
[Applause]

363
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,079
that type of stuff is what's gonna break

364
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:22,560
privilege and then again don't share the

365
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:25,519
report don't share in a redacted form uh

366
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:27,360
don't share it to regulators when they

367
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:29,440
ask stand by your privilege because once

368
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,120
you share it you're going to wave it

369
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,160
so for those in the audience you're

370
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,360
saying you know i'm not really involved

371
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:35,279
in this investigation process

372
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:37,120
this is kind of this is not something i

373
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,040
deal with every day well you deal with

374
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,360
this every day uh in a security incident

375
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,440
and this is a completely fabricated

376
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,360
email chain so i redacted it because

377
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,880
it's my personal email address that i

378
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:48,480
redacted twice

379
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,880
but in this situation i get this all the

380
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:53,279
time where i'm on the bottom here i will

381
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,680
send a communication one of my clients

382
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:58,000
i'll say hey i'm doing this analysis and

383
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,240
i based on the analysis that i found i

384
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,399
don't think data exfiltration occurred

385
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:04,480
and here's the reason why i came up to

386
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,000
that conclusion and then i'll always

387
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,200
have something like you know this isn't

388
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,160
a 100 percent full proof legal analysis

389
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,760
because i don't have all the logs we

390
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,200
didn't have enough logs in this

391
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,120
situation some of the logs got purged

392
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,480
because we tried to get everything back

393
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,920
online so quickly in this ransomware

394
00:13:17,920 --> 00:13:20,320
event so there's some legal risk here

395
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,079
and then what will happen is someone in

396
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,279
the organization will send that top

397
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,600
email they'll say hey bob uh the lawyer

398
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,040
said we need to deploy endpoint

399
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:29,200
monitoring because uh there's wasn't

400
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,279
enough information to make the formal

401
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,120
conclusion that he wanted to make

402
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,839
and that's a major problem if the person

403
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:38,079
sending that email and bob are not part

404
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:40,399
of this privileged chain and this email

405
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,079
at the top let's say bob is an i.t

406
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,519
director and bob is sending it to the

407
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,920
cso no lawyers are copied no lawyers are

408
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:48,639
involved this is bob taking air and

409
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:51,040
actually the uh whoever

410
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,440
whoever is sending this is taking action

411
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,959
on that investigation taking action on

412
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:59,199
my advice internally in the organization

413
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:02,079
and breaking that wall of privilege this

414
00:14:02,079 --> 00:14:03,760
is going to wave privilege on my email

415
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,920
if you send this communication so i

416
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,079
would i always advise clients be very

417
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,399
careful when you're communicating about

418
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,160
results of the security incident if a

419
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,240
lawyer sends you an email

420
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,760
then don't take that email and forward

421
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,680
it on also you know don't go down to the

422
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,199
water cooler and just start talking

423
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,440
outside of the kind of walls of

424
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,560
privilege to other folks in the

425
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:24,000
organization because the last thing you

426
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,920
want to have happen is you sitting in

427
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,680
the audience right now are sitting

428
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,360
across from me what wouldn't be me

429
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:30,399
because i don't really practice

430
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:31,839
litigation sitting across from someone

431
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,560
like me who is deposing you about

432
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,320
information that you learned about this

433
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,160
incident so maybe you're going to be

434
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:40,800
part of uh this this

435
00:14:40,800 --> 00:14:42,560
lawsuit with clark hill and this

436
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,399
plaintiff and you were going to get to

437
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,399
pose because you were the end you were

438
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,399
an individual that had information about

439
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:50,240
this investigation and you waived

440
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,240
privilege when you sent that email so

441
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:53,760
you do not want to get deposed i will

442
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,279
tell you that right now and this is the

443
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:56,560
type of stuff that will land you in

444
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,480
deposition land

445
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,240
similarly let's kind of switch gears

446
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:02,160
real quick and talk about another area

447
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:03,680
of major risk that i'm seeing with

448
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,160
organizations and this is this october

449
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:09,519
1st 2020 department of the treasury ofac

450
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:11,600
advisory on potential sanctions for

451
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,600
facilitating ransomware payments you've

452
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:16,560
probably heard about this uh advisory

453
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,760
opinion because it's really kind of

454
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:19,839
changed the landscape of the ransomware

455
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:20,959
market

456
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,760
in terms of response and also in terms

457
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,600
of just attackers it's a lot hard for

458
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:28,639
them to uh to get paid because of this

459
00:15:28,639 --> 00:15:30,560
and so that landscape is also changing

460
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,399
dramatically but i'm going to focus on

461
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,560
how this is changing the legal landscape

462
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:36,639
and how this is impacting your incident

463
00:15:36,639 --> 00:15:39,040
response so if you're not familiar with

464
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:40,880
ofac and what they do this is from the

465
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,880
advisory opinion itself and essentially

466
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,720
as you can see us persons and i'm

467
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,959
reading from line two u.s persons are

468
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:48,639
generally prohibited from engaging in

469
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:50,240
transactions with individuals or

470
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,800
entities on ofac specially designated

471
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:54,880
nationals and blocked persons list other

472
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,320
black persons and those covered by

473
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,600
comprehensive country or region

474
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:00,560
embargoes and this is strict liability

475
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,839
uh the this uh does not care if you

476
00:16:03,839 --> 00:16:07,279
intended to pay iran or cuba if you pay

477
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:10,079
iran or cuba and it's some if you're an

478
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,040
intermediary or maybe it's four entities

479
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,959
down the line pays iran and you are

480
00:16:14,959 --> 00:16:16,880
involved in the process at all this is

481
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,279
strict liability so your intent does not

482
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,800
matter um

483
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:22,399
and importantly these designated

484
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:24,639
entities as listed or persons you see in

485
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,320
the quotes um ofac has designated some

486
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:30,800
ransomware players like those involved

487
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,639
in crypto locker wannacry 2.0 uh evil

488
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:37,519
corp or involved with drydex and sam sam

489
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:38,560
and this is all from the advisory

490
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,360
opinion have all been designated uh as

491
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:43,839
entities and more could be designated in

492
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:45,440
the future i would imagine we're gonna

493
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:47,279
get uh darkseid although they're not

494
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,880
really operating anymore i imagine

495
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,240
they're going to be a designated entity

496
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,440
coming on down the line and there's

497
00:16:51,440 --> 00:16:52,639
going to be others that are heavily

498
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,800
involved in those public very very

499
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:55,680
public

500
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,360
types of events that are going to get to

501
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,800
be designated entities and if you're an

502
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,720
intermediary or you pay those folks

503
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,079
directly

504
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,240
you can get strict liability that can

505
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,039
result in uh up to one million dollars

506
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,520
in a penalty or 20 years in prison for

507
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:12,400
each violation uh or it can be civil

508
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,439
penalties up to 55 grand a violation and

509
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,280
there can be seizure or forfeiture of

510
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,959
goods involved we actually saw this with

511
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,919
the the colonial pipeline event um where

512
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,160
uh a ransom was paid and then the

513
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:25,919
department of justice had that that

514
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,160
memorandum and they a court filing that

515
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,080
got made public as part of that press

516
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,320
release where they were actually able to

517
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:34,160
seize some of the cryptocurrency that

518
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:36,960
was paid and i don't know if they seized

519
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,559
the cryptocurrency when it went to an

520
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:40,960
exchange like it was in your or my hands

521
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:42,400
or if it was still in the attacker's

522
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,160
hands i don't know that i don't know if

523
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:47,200
anyone knows that um outside of that doj

524
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:49,520
group that that uh performed a seizure

525
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:52,320
but essentially that a payment was made

526
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:55,120
uh in cryptocurrency to that group and

527
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:57,440
the doj was able to seize two million

528
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,600
dollars in cryptocurrency bitcoin of

529
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:02,720
that payment um and so this is something

530
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,080
where your goods can be seized um

531
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:07,679
and it just is inside that really had a

532
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:09,600
dramatic effect for a couple days on the

533
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,120
price of cryptocurrency when that if

534
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,200
that type of seizure can happen uh on

535
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:14,480
these cryptocurrencies that folks

536
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:15,679
thought were completely separate and

537
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,000
apart from that type of regulation uh

538
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:20,000
that really did tank the price of those

539
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,600
uh cryptocurrencies for just a couple

540
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,160
days as just a quick aside

541
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:25,760
so

542
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,600
you how do you avoid this so what do you

543
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,440
do if you're in a ransomware event you

544
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:31,440
need to pay the ransom because your

545
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:33,120
company can't get back online the

546
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:35,200
attacker threat actors got the backups

547
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:37,200
it's completely impossible for you to

548
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,480
get back online well the advisory

549
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,080
opinion says what you should do the

550
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,799
advisory opinion says hey one in advance

551
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:44,080
and you should do this in your instant

552
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,440
response plan i'm about to talk about

553
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:48,000
that i have a risk-based compliance

554
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:51,679
program build into your irp a structure

555
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:54,480
on how you are going to analyze whether

556
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,080
you're going to pay a designated entity

557
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:57,280
or not

558
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,600
and you may not know with 100 certainty

559
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:00,799
in these events and you're going to take

560
00:19:00,799 --> 00:19:02,960
a little risk doing so but having that

561
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,559
risk based approach built into your

562
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:06,559
incident response plan is an arrow in

563
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:08,720
your quiver the second arrow in your

564
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,080
quiver is to engage law enforcement

565
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:13,840
immediately you can see in the last

566
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:16,480
paragraph if you have a self-initiated

567
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,400
timely and complete report of a

568
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,400
ransomware attack to law enforcement

569
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,080
that's going to be a significant

570
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,559
mitigating factor in determining their

571
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:26,160
outcome that doesn't mean that they're

572
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,240
going to completely walk away but let's

573
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,320
say you have an incredibly risk based

574
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,919
approach compliance program where you're

575
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:33,760
analyzing the bitcoin wallet you're

576
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:35,520
analyzing everything about the threat

577
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,039
actors communications in your

578
00:19:37,039 --> 00:19:39,120
negotiations with them uh you're doing

579
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,400
absolutely everything you can to

580
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,000
determine am i paying a sanctioned

581
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:44,640
entity what am i doing here and then you

582
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,360
also engage uh law enforcement very very

583
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,919
early on let's say down the line two

584
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,240
years from now it comes out that that

585
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,760
attacker group you paid was part of a

586
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,440
designated entity you didn't know at the

587
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:59,600
time it is still strict liability but

588
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:01,200
these arrows in your quiver are going to

589
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,440
be helpful to you when you stand in

590
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:05,120
front and say hey i did everything your

591
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,360
advisory opinion told me to do

592
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:09,520
and you're probably going to get if you

593
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:10,960
do these things that they said you're

594
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:14,080
probably going to get less of a penalty

595
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,919
or maybe even no penalty if you fall

596
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:18,000
these follow these steps

597
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:19,679
but again it's not a complete shield

598
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:21,360
because it's a strict liability again

599
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:23,520
intent does not matter if it's later

600
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:24,799
determined you paid this sanctioned

601
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:27,200
entity uh it's it could be a problem for

602
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,000
you

603
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,640
so this is the area that i'm super

604
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:33,280
worried about uh with my clients i'm

605
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:36,400
more worried about the delays so because

606
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,240
of this advisory opinion it has

607
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:41,760
dramatically changed the game on how

608
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,720
payment works in these events so

609
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:46,720
if you just go back two years ago if i

610
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,960
had a client that an entire system was

611
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,600
on offline and they needed to pay the

612
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:53,600
ransom they had no choice whatsoever all

613
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,200
they could do is pay to get their

614
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,559
systems back online they need that

615
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:58,320
decryption key

616
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,840
we would just tell the insurance carrier

617
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:00,960
hey we're going to make this payment

618
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,240
it's within limits or it's outside the

619
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:03,760
limits and we'll eat the cost whatever

620
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,400
and the carrier goes okay yeah go ahead

621
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,640
that's no longer the case now and you

622
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,120
can see this this is from a uh

623
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:13,200
endorsement on ransomware for a major

624
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:14,559
insurance carrier this is just their

625
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,799
policy language and i want you to focus

626
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,320
on the last sentence

627
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,640
ransomware loss means those funds paid

628
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,960
by the insured to the perpetrators of

629
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:24,799
the attack and the attack and then

630
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,320
here's the magic language with the

631
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,280
insurers prior approval now and this is

632
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:30,799
this is however insurance cyber risk

633
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,480
insurance policy works you have to get

634
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,919
the insurer's approval before you make

635
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:36,159
some payment whether that be to duffin

636
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:37,919
phelps whether that be to me whether

637
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:40,000
that be to any vendor uh and also

638
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,080
whether that be to a threat actor for a

639
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:45,039
decryption key and the prior approval

640
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,679
process now is delayed because insurance

641
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:48,720
let me just put yourself in the

642
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:50,559
insurance carrier's shoes there's strict

643
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,960
liability if you're an intermediary on

644
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,559
this ofac problem

645
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,400
so an insurance carrier they have a lot

646
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:58,080
to lose they want they want to make

647
00:21:58,080 --> 00:21:59,919
payments all the time on behalf of their

648
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:02,000
insurance one of these insureds might

649
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:03,840
pay a sanctioned entity and that could

650
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,320
have strict liability onto the insurer

651
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,799
so the insurer is going to want to make

652
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:10,720
sure that you are not paying a

653
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:12,080
sanctioned entity they have a whole

654
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:14,240
compliance process built in that could

655
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,640
take hours in some cases it might take

656
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,480
days it depends on the the threat actor

657
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,240
group how much is known about them how

658
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,760
good your risk-based compliance program

659
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,520
is just how good you can show the

660
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:25,360
insurer that hey i've done everything i

661
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:27,760
can possibly do here we are not paying

662
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,039
an attack or we are not paying a

663
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,720
designated entity there is no ofec

664
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,880
problem please let us make this payment

665
00:22:32,880 --> 00:22:34,240
but then you might run into another

666
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:37,039
delay and that delay is going to be at

667
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:40,960
your bank um i am this is a a

668
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:43,440
set of questions that i received from a

669
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,080
bank uh in relation to a client that

670
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,000
wanted to take funds and make a threat

671
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,320
actor payment uh then we had delays at

672
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:52,480
the bank and the bank wanted all of this

673
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:54,159
information now all this information is

674
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:56,480
readily available um it would it

675
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:57,679
wouldn't be that hard to get that

676
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,880
information but a if you know large

677
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:02,400
banks just like large insurance

678
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:05,120
companies just like large any entity

679
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,840
compliance is not a quick process so

680
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,679
once i give this information to the bank

681
00:23:09,679 --> 00:23:11,520
it might be a two-day delay it might be

682
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,120
a one-day delay it might be an hour's

683
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,720
delay before the bank goes okay you can

684
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:16,080
take this money and you can pay this

685
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,280
threat actor

686
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,720
because the bank is in the same boat

687
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:19,919
that the insurance carrier is in which

688
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,080
is the same boat that you're in so this

689
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,080
is a major deal

690
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:25,919
and getting all this information might

691
00:23:25,919 --> 00:23:27,919
take work and then paying on this

692
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:29,679
information or getting the the bank to

693
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,400
agree to pay might also take some time

694
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,000
so what should you do

695
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:37,520
the real focus here is this immediate i

696
00:23:37,520 --> 00:23:38,799
if you're going to engage in threat

697
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,120
actor negotiations ask the threat actor

698
00:23:41,120 --> 00:23:43,120
for their cryptocurrency wallet

699
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:45,520
immediately engage outside counsel

700
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,520
immediately and start analyzing this

701
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:50,640
issue immediately because you may have a

702
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,640
48 hour negotiation process for the

703
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,720
threat actor payment you may have a 72

704
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,080
hour you may have a 24 hour whatever

705
00:23:56,080 --> 00:23:59,440
that timing is if you start working with

706
00:23:59,440 --> 00:24:01,679
your carrier your bank and every other

707
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:03,440
intermediary

708
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,279
about two hours into the event you're

709
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:07,039
not ready to make a payment yet but you

710
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:09,279
are making these negotiations and you're

711
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:12,159
also on the side in parallel uh working

712
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:13,919
with all these intermediaries to say hey

713
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,520
here's who i'm gonna pay i don't know

714
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,520
the amount yet but i need i need your

715
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,760
rubber stamp on this uh

716
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:21,600
because i want to make payment when i

717
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,200
want to make payment because as you know

718
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:24,960
every hour that your business is down to

719
00:24:24,960 --> 00:24:27,279
a ransomware event costs you money

720
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:28,799
and may cost you sales it will never

721
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:30,880
come back in some industries so getting

722
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:33,200
in touch with this immediately

723
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,240
is something that you really want to do

724
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,320
and then also i'm going to focus

725
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,320
switching gears real quick uh actually

726
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,679
before i do this let me take a really

727
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,840
quick aside because i have time uh the

728
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,799
really quick aside is on

729
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,960
cyber risk insurance the cyber risk

730
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,440
insurance market is dramatically

731
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:54,080
changing because of ransomware events

732
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:56,320
so many cyber risk insurance policies

733
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,919
the premium might be fifty thousand

734
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:00,480
dollars and the aggregate limit for a

735
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:02,799
year might be five million dollars uh

736
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:05,120
and and i'm just this is just rough math

737
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,960
and so let's say someone has a

738
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,559
ransomware event where they need to pay

739
00:25:08,559 --> 00:25:11,120
2.5 million dollars to an attacker

740
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,120
in many of those events the bi business

741
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:15,360
interruption claim is also tied to the

742
00:25:15,360 --> 00:25:17,520
same aggregate limit as the cyber risk

743
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,600
insurance so you have a 5 million dollar

744
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,679
business interruption claim so if you're

745
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:23,520
paying an attacker 2.5 million dollars

746
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,760
you're paying me let's say 40 thousand

747
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:27,760
dollars you're paying

748
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,279
forensics provider a hundred thousand

749
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,039
dollars you might be paying another

750
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:32,960
entity a hundred thousand dollars to get

751
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,200
all your systems back online and then

752
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:37,440
let's say that you are having a business

753
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,440
interruption loss of two million dollars

754
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,440
well we've hit five million dollars and

755
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,039
so if you're paying fifty thousand

756
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,720
dollars in premium and you hit a limits

757
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,320
claim that's called meaning you have

758
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:48,320
five million dollars of loss you're

759
00:25:48,320 --> 00:25:50,320
going to get five million dollars minus

760
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,279
your retention back from that insurer so

761
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:55,200
that insurer has paid out five million

762
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,640
dollars on a fifty thousand dollar

763
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,000
policy and uh you can very quickly do

764
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,279
the math to know that they're gonna have

765
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:02,960
to write a lot of policies to people

766
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,880
that don't have these events in order to

767
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:06,559
make a buck off of it

768
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,080
and that just hasn't been the case

769
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:10,000
there's been way more ransomware events

770
00:26:10,000 --> 00:26:11,279
than i think anyone could have ever

771
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:13,679
predicted and way more limits claims

772
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:14,880
than i think anyone could have ever

773
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:17,120
predicted and we're seeing a dramatic

774
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,960
shift in the cyber risk insurance market

775
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,559
because of that you're seeing increased

776
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,559
premiums you're seeing some carriers

777
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,559
that are doing sub limits for ransomware

778
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,480
events meaning that instead of getting

779
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:28,159
that 5 million limit i talked about

780
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:31,120
you're getting a 250 000 limit uh and if

781
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:32,159
you want a bigger limit you're going to

782
00:26:32,159 --> 00:26:33,679
pay a higher premium you're having some

783
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:35,440
carriers completely leave the market in

784
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:37,520
some industries you're having a massive

785
00:26:37,520 --> 00:26:39,440
massive shift in this area i would

786
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,760
strongly advise you in many companies

787
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,080
it's the cfo or the finance team maybe a

788
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:45,840
little bit of attorney flavor that are

789
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,840
part of that procurement but

790
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,799
cyber security needs a seat at the table

791
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:53,039
and cyber risk insurance procurement

792
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,799
and so i would go to your cfo your

793
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,159
insurance person whoever makes those

794
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:58,159
purchases talk about this issue because

795
00:26:58,159 --> 00:26:59,760
if someone's making the decision to not

796
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,080
buy it because premiums go up or limits

797
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,000
change or whatever or maybe there's new

798
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,000
subjectivities on coverage like there

799
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,760
was a subjectivity last year to you

800
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,600
don't use solarwinds because they had

801
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:12,000
that uh issue at the time last year um

802
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:13,679
that was an er that was a subjectivity

803
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:15,600
to coverage meaning if you do use it and

804
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,799
you said you didn't we're not going to

805
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,039
provide coverage so this is something

806
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:20,720
that cyber risk needs a seat at the

807
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:23,039
table in procuring cyber risk insurance

808
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,200
okay with that let's switch gears last

809
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,039
thing i want to mention is actually

810
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:29,440
using your incident response plan

811
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:30,880
everybody has an insulin response plan

812
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:31,919
i'm going to make that hand wave

813
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,440
statement if you don't you know i just

814
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:34,960
said you did but everybody has an

815
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,880
instant response plan not everybody in

816
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,880
my experience uses an incident response

817
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:41,520
plan in an incident situation and it is

818
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,039
critically important and i'll tell you

819
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:45,279
why and you can find it in this special

820
00:27:45,279 --> 00:27:47,600
publication 861 the computer security

821
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,919
incident handling guide and here's why

822
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,520
it's important now you may not adhere to

823
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,360
this you may do something else but what

824
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,600
nist tells you to do in your instant

825
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,760
response plan is why this is so

826
00:27:57,760 --> 00:28:00,240
important and focus on incident

827
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,640
documentation in this in this document

828
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,240
incident documentation you're having

829
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:06,480
this log book where you are documenting

830
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:08,559
a summary of the incident a status of

831
00:28:08,559 --> 00:28:11,440
the incident a timeline a log book with

832
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,159
major decisions and that's for you to

833
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:17,200
build up this kind of story of what you

834
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,600
as a company did because when someone

835
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,960
starts asking and it's going to be a

836
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:23,120
regulator or a plaintiff

837
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,799
you can tell the story of what you did

838
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,960
and why you did it oh yeah 24 hours in

839
00:28:26,960 --> 00:28:28,720
we made the major decision to pay the

840
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,279
threat actor because we use net backup

841
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,279
and net backup was encrypted and we have

842
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,520
no offline backups and you want to know

843
00:28:35,520 --> 00:28:37,200
when that decision was made who made

844
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:39,360
that decision and why it was made and

845
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:40,799
that is something that's done in this

846
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:42,720
incident documentation

847
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,880
similarly this will also help protect

848
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:46,480
chain of custody which is really

849
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,679
important because if you do want to

850
00:28:47,679 --> 00:28:49,039
preserve privilege in that two-track

851
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:50,720
investigation uh you want to make sure

852
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,799
you don't accidentally waive privilege

853
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,480
uh your instant documentation is gonna

854
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:55,919
have contact information for everyone

855
00:28:55,919 --> 00:28:58,080
involved it's just it's it's i'm harping

856
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,760
on this it's the least exciting thing

857
00:28:59,760 --> 00:29:01,440
that i'm probably talking about but when

858
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:03,360
i work an incident and the company is

859
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:05,600
not building documentation on what we

860
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:08,000
did why we did it uh and the like and

861
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,679
the timeline in particular it makes it

862
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:11,760
really hard to answer questions from

863
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,080
insurance carriers to get reimbursed it

864
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,159
really makes it hard to uh answer

865
00:29:16,159 --> 00:29:17,760
questions from plaintiffs and the like

866
00:29:17,760 --> 00:29:20,880
and so you want to have these uh in your

867
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,480
in your documentation so you can do

868
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:24,640
those things now that doesn't mean you

869
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:26,159
should always generate a forensics

870
00:29:26,159 --> 00:29:27,200
report

871
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:29,200
i can talk about that for an hour

872
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,880
but there's are there might be reasons

873
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,640
to not generate a forensics report

874
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:34,399
because of that privilege issue earlier

875
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:35,520
so you may tell you'll tell your

876
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,880
forensic offender i don't want you to

877
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,480
generate a report because i don't want

878
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:40,559
it to be in the hands of a plaintiff

879
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,240
and so i just don't want that document

880
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:44,320
to exist that could be something that a

881
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,159
decision that companies make but i'm not

882
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,360
that's not what i'm talking about here

883
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:49,039
i'm talking about establishing those

884
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:51,039
underlining facts that are not going to

885
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:53,200
be privileged uh those underlining facts

886
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,360
that you can describe here's my timeline

887
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,039
here's major decisions we made things

888
00:29:57,039 --> 00:29:58,640
like that

889
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:01,520
and that is legal pitfalls to avoid in

890
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,120
security incidents i really want to

891
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,200
