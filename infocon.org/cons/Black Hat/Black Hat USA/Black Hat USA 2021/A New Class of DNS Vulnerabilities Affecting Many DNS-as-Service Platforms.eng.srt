00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,520
hey everyone today we present to you our

3
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,160
research on a new dns vulnerability

4
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:22,640
class in dns service providers my name

5
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:24,400
is shill and i lead the research team

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,640
with the cloud security company

7
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,800
with me on the stage is ami

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,800
the city of wisdom

9
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,120
thank you it's really great to be here

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,399
just a bit background on the team and so

11
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:37,360
we are

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,440
in the wii research team a highly

13
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,040
experienced

14
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,280
team of researchers many of us

15
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,760
background from microsoft cloud security

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,760
and the goal of the team is to do

17
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,160
groundbreaking cloud research and find

18
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:53,039
vulnerabilities and risks and attack

19
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,600
paths that are unknown today that may

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,600
affect cloud environments

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,199
so

22
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,159
how do we get to a research on dns

23
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,560
let's start from the beginning why dns

24
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:10,080
as a service so in fact dns as a service

25
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:12,400
is one of the most important

26
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,799
and critical services that cloud

27
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:17,439
providers give today to customers and

28
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,159
why is that dns first of all is the

29
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:22,880
lifeblood of the internet but not only

30
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,479
for the internet the internal dns is the

31
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:28,159
is the service that powers all of the

32
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,320
routing between endpoints between

33
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,720
internal services within the company so

34
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,600
dns is a critical service that companies

35
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,000
use and now companies are transitioning

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,640
to use dns as a service

37
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,200
now it's not only that it's really

38
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,280
impactful if i would be able to do

39
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,840
something with dns the the the impact

40
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,079
could be huge because it affects not

41
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:52,640
only the cloud resources the company has

42
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:54,640
it's also affects

43
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,640
on-premise resources the company has

44
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:58,560
first of all the domain the company

45
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,960
domain is a company asset and the

46
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,600
endpoints of the company are using dns

47
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,119
as well so

48
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,280
if you think about it the effect of this

49
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,318
cloud service goes well above and beyond

50
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:11,038
the

51
00:02:11,038 --> 00:02:13,360
actual resources that the company has in

52
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,400
the cloud

53
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,239
and third

54
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:19,040
and maybe most important for researchers

55
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:20,800
is that dns

56
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,400
is highly complex

57
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,800
it's a very ancient protocol it's with

58
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,760
us since the 1980s it has so many

59
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,000
different implementations not only by

60
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,400
the providers but also to so many

61
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,879
different dns clients and these dns

62
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:37,760
clients can implement the dns and

63
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,680
algorithm in different ways more than

64
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,800
that

65
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,760
dns is not only routing on the internet

66
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,080
there's so many different protocols and

67
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:49,440
algorithms used for dynamic dns and for

68
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:51,599
authentication over dns and those

69
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,319
algorithms many of them were developed

70
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,120
10 or 20 or even 30 years ago so this

71
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,480
gives amazing attack surface for us to

72
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:02,640
explore so we started looking into the

73
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,400
nss service

74
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:05,920
and as

75
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,920
cloud researchers obviously we started

76
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,120
from route 53 which is probably

77
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,000
the

78
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,040
one of the most popular dns services

79
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,440
provided by cloud providers and

80
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,720
initially

81
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:20,319
we looked at

82
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:22,319
misconfigurations that users can do

83
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:24,400
within the platform for example if a

84
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,120
user registers a domain to a cloud

85
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,879
object like a load balancer and the load

86
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:30,480
also doesn't exist anymore so these kind

87
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,799
of misconfigurations but as we started

88
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,280
learning more and more about route 53 we

89
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:37,040
thought maybe we can actually find

90
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,080
vulnerabilities in the way that the

91
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,159
service actually provides dns to

92
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,720
customers and that's how we started the

93
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,879
research into the vulnerabilities in

94
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,599
route 53

95
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,120
so um in the beginning

96
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,159
we thought about domain hijacking domain

97
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,920
hijacking sounds scary

98
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,480
if a malicious actor managed to hijack a

99
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,959
domain the effect can be massive and we

100
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:04,799
thought it might be possible

101
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:05,599
so

102
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,360
amazon has around 2 000 shared dns

103
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,080
servers serving thousands of customers

104
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,680
it's basically the idea of dns as a

105
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,439
service sharing dns servers with

106
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,519
multiple customers so many customers are

107
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:19,440
managing their domains within the same

108
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,720
server

109
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,160
whenever customer is registering a

110
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,919
domain on the platform they get full

111
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:25,440
shared name servers

112
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,280
these are the servers that now manage

113
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:29,520
the dns zone of that domain

114
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,120
our initial target

115
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:33,680
was hijacking our own domain

116
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:36,680
wiz.io

117
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,800
before we

118
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,440
before going into details

119
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,720
first brief

120
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,520
overview of how dns works

121
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,840
each domain must have a dns server

122
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,160
called name server that will store its

123
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:51,199
records

124
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,880
many companies manage the name servers

125
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:55,280
themselves and many other companies use

126
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,600
existing services like dns service

127
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,400
providers in our case at quiz our domain

128
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,720
is hosted on amazon raw 53 and is

129
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:04,960
managed on four name servers

130
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:07,840
you see in the right of the slide

131
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,639
when a customer wants to connect to with

132
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,280
server they query one of these servers

133
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:16,080
for the wiz.io domain

134
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,360
so far

135
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,840
so good

136
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:24,639
the thing about r53

137
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,479
is that all customers are using the same

138
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:28,720
name servers and each client can manage

139
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,840
their domain

140
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:32,160
on any server on the platform

141
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,680
we can see in the slide

142
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:36,840
that the amazon name server the

143
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,000
ns1334 which managed with domains it

144
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,039
also contains domains of other customers

145
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,080
as you see in the right column

146
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:47,919
and here we had an idea

147
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:50,000
what would happen if we if we will

148
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,400
manage to add duplicate entry

149
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:54,080
of wiz.io

150
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:56,319
into the same server

151
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,240
this should be impossible but if we

152
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:00,560
succeed might cause a conflict

153
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,759
with the insane outcomes

154
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:09,440
um so we tried to host the with io on

155
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,120
route 53

156
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,120
and to our surprise

157
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,560
it is possible

158
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,560
anyone can register which domain they

159
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,400
want on the platform

160
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,240
there is no restriction on whether the

161
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,160
domain is already registered and there

162
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:24,560
is no ownership verification

163
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,479
but as you can see in the slide we got

164
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,400
four name servers other than those

165
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:32,880
yeah um other than

166
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,639
the original with the name server

167
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:39,520
and we tried to add it again

168
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:41,280
and again

169
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,800
and again

170
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,720
and each time we got a different name

171
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:47,360
server but we never got the same servers

172
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:49,919
to reach the original wizard points

173
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:52,160
we try to register subdomains of with io

174
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,759
and even paired the domain with special

175
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,759
characters all without success

176
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,759
so after we failed to hijack the domain

177
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,680
we try to think about the problem from a

178
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,280
new angle

179
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,639
which domain

180
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:08,560
can we possibly register

181
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,080
in the platform

182
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,199
that one

183
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,759
it does not exist in the name servers

184
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,599
because if it is will not be able to

185
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,319
register it on the same name servers

186
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:19,360
and two

187
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:21,440
dns clients must query for it because if

188
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,759
the domain is not queried it has no

189
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:26,080
effect

190
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:29,440
so we thought about it and then we came

191
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,880
up with an idea

192
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,120
what would happen if we register one of

193
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,599
the official aws name servers on the

194
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:36,880
platform

195
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,240
what would happen if we register one of

196
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,960
the route 53 name servers under the same

197
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,840
name server

198
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,840
um so we chose an arbitrary name server

199
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,440
in this case is the

200
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,319
router 53 name server

201
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:50,960
ns852

202
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:52,560
and we try to register it on the

203
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:55,520
platform enough times that at least once

204
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:57,120
it would fall under the management of

205
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,560
the same name server

206
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,599
let's do an illustration

207
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:04,599
here you can see an illustration of auda

208
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:07,440
ns5e852 name server and official route

209
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:09,599
5397 looks like

210
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,319
you can see it contains dns zones for

211
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,080
several of route 53 customers

212
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,160
what do we um what do you what do you

213
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,080
think would happen if we managed to

214
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,680
register the name server domain name the

215
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:25,440
nsa 852

216
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,039
under its own management

217
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,960
i totally don't know what would happen

218
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,958
but we must check it out

219
00:08:32,958 --> 00:08:35,440
so we tried it

220
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,200
and it worked

221
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,958
as you can see in the slide our new

222
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:40,958
domain is now managed within a name

223
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,440
server with the same domain name

224
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,000
we were really excited we didn't know if

225
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,640
it will have any impact but we had a

226
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,560
good feeling about this one

227
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,640
to test the effect of what we did we

228
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,640
decided to specify an angular code

229
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,839
pointing to our server

230
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,040
so now if anyone is trying to talk to us

231
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,279
we would able to listen

232
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:05,920
we ran tcp dump on our server

233
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,680
and hope to see something interesting

234
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,680
surprisingly we started receiving

235
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,440
thousands of requests from thousands of

236
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,920
different ips we realized we were onto

237
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,279
something

238
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,279
the next step in the research

239
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,600
was to analyze all these dns queries and

240
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,360
figure out

241
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,040
why are they coming to us

242
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:28,880
but

243
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:29,839
wait

244
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:31,920
why are we getting

245
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:34,480
any traffic i mean think about it just

246
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:36,560
like we did with the with io if you

247
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,680
register

248
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,320
a domain on the wrong name server you're

249
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,560
not supposed to get any traffic we

250
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,120
registered the name server on itself we

251
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:47,600
didn't expect to get any traffic what's

252
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:48,800
going on

253
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,519
so what we did initially

254
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,640
is

255
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,160
just initial analysis trying to

256
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:55,839
understand what kind of dns requests

257
00:09:55,839 --> 00:09:58,240
were seen and that became even more

258
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,120
weird because this was not just general

259
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,000
dns traffic we were seeing dynamic dns

260
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,240
dynamic dns is traffic that you wouldn't

261
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:09,200
expect to see at all in external

262
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,920
networks we were seeing ip addresses

263
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:14,880
computer names domain names so let's see

264
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,800
how this look like so this is an example

265
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:19,440
of a packet one of millions of packets

266
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:21,839
we were seeing so we're seeing the

267
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,640
external ip of a computer

268
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,959
an internet ip of a computer and a

269
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:28,640
computer name it

270
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,880
really quickly became apparent that we

271
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,519
are seeing millions of endpoints coming

272
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:36,160
from different organizations we had no

273
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:37,839
clue at that point why are we seeing

274
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,240
that what does it mean but there was

275
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,480
clearly something bigger going on and we

276
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,480
definitely wanted to understand what

277
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,839
what's behind this so

278
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:49,519
we

279
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,920
actually dug deeper what we did is we

280
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,240
registered not only one name server we

281
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:57,360
registered all 2000 name servers in aws

282
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,880
and tried to figure out

283
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,640
what are we actually seeing and we

284
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,040
started tapping into a portion of the

285
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,959
worldwide dns traffic going to

286
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,000
organizations the the we were seeing

287
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
more than a million endpoints coming

288
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,839
from more than 15 000

289
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,360
organizations all of them using a route

290
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,959
53 as their dns service so it's huge

291
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:20,800
amounts of data

292
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:22,560
coming from millions of endpoints but

293
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:25,839
what's going on and when we dug deeper

294
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,360
we saw that there's it's coming from

295
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:31,839
big companies fortune 500 companies more

296
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,240
than 100

297
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:36,880
government agencies so this is not just

298
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,240
a limited

299
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,200
feed we're getting this is also high

300
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,360
value targets that we're seeing so we

301
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,959
really need to figure out what's going

302
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:47,120
on

303
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,519
so let's just summarize what we know so

304
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,560
far we registered a domain name server

305
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,040
to itself we didn't expect anything to

306
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,600
happen but what did happen is that we

307
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:00,959
got millions of endpoints sending

308
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:04,639
dynamics dns traffic queries to us

309
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:05,760
so

310
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,399
what's going on the next step

311
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:11,279
is to dive deeper dive deeper into the

312
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:14,800
world of dynamic dns

313
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:17,519
so

314
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:20,480
what exactly is dynamic dns

315
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:22,480
dynamic dns

316
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:26,480
is a dns extension specified in rfc 2136

317
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,639
and it allows clients to dynamically

318
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,240
update dns records

319
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,480
of target dns server

320
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:35,760
it is a commonly used 12 devices find

321
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,800
each other in internal windows networks

322
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,680
let's see how it works

323
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,440
when my windows computer join the

324
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,519
company's network and receive a new ip

325
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,720
address

326
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:49,279
it updates the local dns server which is

327
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,959
called master server

328
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:52,880
on its new ip address

329
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:54,880
now when ami is trying to connect to my

330
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,040
computer he can query the local dns

331
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,720
server about chill pc

332
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,880
and the master server will answer

333
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,600
with my correct with my current ipad ip

334
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,600
address

335
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:08,639
so far

336
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:10,000
so good

337
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,360
but wait

338
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,760
why endpoints send dns updates to our

339
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:14,800
server

340
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:16,720
these are requests that should never

341
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,040
leave the internal network

342
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,200
could it visit the endpoint sync of our

343
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,440
server as their master server

344
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:25,279
how do they even know how to find the

345
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,000
master server

346
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,720
so it turns out that microsoft has its

347
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,480
own algorithm for finding the master

348
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:33,519
server

349
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,440
it does not work exactly as specified in

350
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,560
the rfc

351
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,160
so let's dive into the algorithm

352
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,880
when a windows endpoint want to update

353
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:44,720
the internal master server for its new

354
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,760
ip address it first needs to find it the

355
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,920
endpoint will send a soa

356
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,399
query to the internal dns resolver on

357
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,880
its own domain name

358
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:58,240
the internal dns resolver knows

359
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,639
that the with io dns done is managed

360
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:02,560
internally so when queried it will

361
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,600
return the

362
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,680
internal master server within the server

363
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:08,079
response

364
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,720
so as you can see in the example um on

365
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,760
the slide the dns resolver returned the

366
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,360
internal dns within the network

367
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:19,839
now when the endpoint found the master

368
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:21,920
server it will update it as we saw in

369
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,720
the previous illustration

370
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,440
and

371
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,839
the update succeed

372
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:31,519
so far so good but what happens if the

373
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:33,920
corporate dns resolver is not set

374
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,920
correctly and does not contain a dns

375
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,680
zone for the local domain

376
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,519
or what will happen if the computer is

377
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,199
configured to work with external dns

378
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:43,199
resolver which is unfamiliar with the

379
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,920
internal resources inside the network

380
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:47,600
what happens when the computer leaves

381
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,360
the organization and start working from

382
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,519
external dns resolvers provided by home

383
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:52,800
routers

384
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,800
in that cases when a computer query for

385
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,720
the copyright domain the dns observer

386
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:59,360
will treat it as an external domain and

387
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,360
return the master server

388
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,839
of the external domain just as it will

389
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,920
do with any other domain name

390
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:09,599
which is where the problem starts

391
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,519
so imagine an employee of with io

392
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:15,600
decided to work from home like most of

393
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,880
us lately

394
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:19,600
and connected to their home wifi

395
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,320
the computer got an internal ip address

396
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:24,320
from the home router and now trying to

397
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,639
find the local master server because the

398
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:28,079
external dns resolver you're not

399
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:29,839
familiar with with io is going to

400
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,320
resolve it just like any other domain

401
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,839
because the domain is managed on route

402
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,480
53 it will return the wiz io master

403
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:40,240
server as specified in route 53.

404
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,279
this is the

405
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:43,199
primary server this is the master server

406
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,320
that was specified in the soa

407
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:49,120
record within route 53 and this is the

408
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:52,160
default record

409
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,920
the endpoint will then try to update the

410
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,800
master server which is an amazon shared

411
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,560
server that manages thousands of

412
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:01,119
customers

413
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,440
um obviously amazon server does not

414
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,759
support dynamic dns so the

415
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,199
update request will fail

416
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,880
microsoft algorithm

417
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,399
does not give up here

418
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:13,839
and believes it's still having a chance

419
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,000
to find the master server the next step

420
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:18,079
will be to check if with io name servers

421
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:20,480
have records of that that's the same

422
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:22,399
master server

423
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,519
so the dns client connects directly

424
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:26,720
to the

425
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,720
ip address of the name servers and ask

426
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,720
them what is the ip address of the

427
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:32,160
master server

428
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,720
in our case it is the same domain as the

429
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,440
name server

430
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:40,320
and here happens the interesting part

431
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,880
in fact windows dns client queries the

432
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,720
name server for itself and if you

433
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,440
remember we've registered this dns zone

434
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,199
and here we can return any records we

435
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,600
want

436
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:55,440
so we returned our ip to the dns client

437
00:16:55,440 --> 00:16:56,959
as you can see in the slide

438
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:58,240
and now

439
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,560
the computer will update our server with

440
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,240
dns updates

441
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,560
this is crazy

442
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:07,439
so

443
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:08,880
wha what did we

444
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,959
learn so far so

445
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:13,280
now we can start understanding why we

446
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,439
are getting so much traffic windows

447
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,679
endpoints have a custom algorithm in

448
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:20,480
order to actually implement dynamic dns

449
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:23,599
to find the master dns server and this

450
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,000
algorithm is part of the algorithm

451
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,400
actually queries at some point the name

452
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:30,559
server for its own name

453
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:33,039
again this algorithm is geared towards

454
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:35,360
internal networks but when used on

455
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:37,840
external dns providers then unexpected

456
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,559
results occur and the unexpected result

457
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:43,120
is that when we put our malicious dna

458
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,520
server it was actually getting traffic

459
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:47,840
from the dynamic dns traffic from

460
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,720
millions of endpoints and so now we can

461
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:53,360
start understanding the initial question

462
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,000
of why are we getting so much traffic so

463
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,840
now the next question is

464
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,679
is this traffic really interesting what

465
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,960
do we have in these millions of devices

466
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,840
actually sending traffic to us

467
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,799
so

468
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,160
as we started analyzing the traffic it

469
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,039
soon became apparent what we've created

470
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,679
in a simple domain registration

471
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:18,160
is a nation-state intelligence

472
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,440
capability

473
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,480
we are able to actually map

474
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,600
thousands and in in dozens of thousands

475
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:27,600
of organizations across millions of

476
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,400
endpoints

477
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,039
let's think about it if i have an

478
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:33,919
organization i can map the external ips

479
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,160
what does that mean i can map office

480
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:38,799
locations home locations of the entire

481
00:18:38,799 --> 00:18:42,080
organization multiply that on tens of

482
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:44,000
thousands of organizations

483
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:46,799
i can see internal ips that means i can

484
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,440
start building internal ip ranges i can

485
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,520
see computer names that means that i can

486
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,799
understand what the organization is

487
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:55,039
doing i can understand and map their

488
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:57,440
internet network this is a full

489
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,039
intelligence map on my hands from for

490
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,039
thousands of companies and and even

491
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:04,640
government agencies

492
00:19:04,640 --> 00:19:07,679
let's see how it looks like

493
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:10,640
so let's start from what we call ib

494
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,799
based intelligence we can map a company

495
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:16,880
and this is by the way one of the top

496
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,799
services companies in the world we can

497
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:20,799
map the entire company here you see more

498
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:23,520
than 40 000 endpoints that are actually

499
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,520
spread around the world we can see all

500
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,120
of their office branches we can see

501
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,039
their home locations all of their

502
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,520
employees we can actually map them now

503
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,960
imagine that for

504
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,640
government agencies for different

505
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:37,679
companies right i can even zoom in on

506
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:39,760
specific office locations here from this

507
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:43,600
office we saw 600 endpoints reporting to

508
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,240
us

509
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:47,200
so we have amazing intelligence on

510
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,120
thousands of companies but it doesn't

511
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,039
stop there because we also have

512
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:56,400
the ability to leverage those kind of

513
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,559
intelligence to actually ask interesting

514
00:19:58,559 --> 00:20:00,799
questions like and these are just a few

515
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:02,640
examples that we found

516
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,360
there is the foreign assets control a

517
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:08,240
regulation that says that some companies

518
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,600
are not supposed to work from some

519
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:11,360
countries so that would be interesting

520
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,480
to find for example the specific western

521
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,760
mining company has offices in the ivory

522
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,799
coast which is forbidden and again we

523
00:20:20,799 --> 00:20:24,159
see that simply from the data or another

524
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:26,960
interesting example a credit

525
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,159
company

526
00:20:28,159 --> 00:20:31,440
has a subsidiary in iran and we can see

527
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,919
that there is a few locations here 13

528
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:37,039
endpoints we detected in iran

529
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:40,080
so just to understand the extent of this

530
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,919
data this is really an intelligence

531
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,039
capability we can see we're tapping into

532
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:47,679
dns traffic from so many organizations

533
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:50,080
that it giving us a lot of visibility

534
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:52,240
into what's going on now

535
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:55,679
this was external let's go deeper we are

536
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,000
actually seeing ip ranges we were able

537
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:00,720
to map different ip ranges and the

538
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,880
actual network mapping of those

539
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:04,880
organizations we can see for example

540
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:06,799
this is the employee network this is the

541
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,720
cicd network this is the operational

542
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,640
network now how do we know that we

543
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:12,880
because we see the computer as ips we

544
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,360
see their names so if you combine them

545
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:17,760
you can start understanding the actual

546
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,760
role of each ip

547
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:22,320
range in the company so we are mapping

548
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,880
external externally those organizations

549
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,880
and we are starting to build internal

550
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,039
mapping

551
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,360
but it doesn't stop there

552
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:34,240
we're also looking at computer names so

553
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,919
the computer names also reveal

554
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:38,880
information about the organizations like

555
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,880
this is a machine running windows i can

556
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,559
see a build

557
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:45,520
this machine is from finance right so

558
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,440
computer names help us build the

559
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,440
intelligence map on the organizations

560
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,120
that we're looking at

561
00:21:51,120 --> 00:21:53,200
so we have thousands of

562
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,640
companies

563
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,240
we have the ability to map them

564
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,520
externally and internally is that all so

565
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:02,640
it appears that we can even continue

566
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:04,960
we saw a lot of traffic coming up from

567
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,400
mpv6

568
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,280
and that intrigued us there is a known

569
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:11,360
argument around the world

570
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,400
about the security of ipv6 ipv6 doesn't

571
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,039
use not so there is a a possibility if i

572
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,919
see a ipv6 address to actually access

573
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,799
the device directly so we tried it out

574
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:25,440
we actually saw the six percent of the

575
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,280
ipv6 addresses that we were seeing and

576
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,679
remember these are endpoints of

577
00:22:29,679 --> 00:22:31,120
companies

578
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,280
these are organizational

579
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:34,960
endpoints

580
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,720
six percent of them and maybe six

581
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,960
percent doesn't sound like a lot but six

582
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:40,480
percent is actually thousands of

583
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,280
companies that we are seeing endpoints

584
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:45,039
that we can actually directly access

585
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:46,799
from the internet and have open

586
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,240
protocols like smb rdp this is crazy

587
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,240
this is like actually allowing us to

588
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:54,559
even start an attack using

589
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:57,600
those addresses so i i know that there's

590
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,159
a big debate about ibv6 but what we are

591
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:02,320
seeing here is very interesting data if

592
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,400
i have a way like we have here to tap

593
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,440
into ipv6 addresses the argument that

594
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,360
says an attacker would never be able to

595
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,840
scan the ipv6 address range this

596
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,960
argument fails because using an example

597
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,360
like tapping into dns allows us to see

598
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,159
millions of ips and basically

599
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,679
potentially start attacking those

600
00:23:21,679 --> 00:23:22,720
devices

601
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,799
so

602
00:23:24,799 --> 00:23:26,799
just to to understand what we've seen

603
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,760
here there we are able to build very

604
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:32,320
powerful capability now the scope is

605
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,000
much much bigger than we initially

606
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,640
thought we started from route 53

607
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,960
but then we continued on the research

608
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,039
and we saw that additional service

609
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,360
providers are susceptible to this

610
00:23:43,360 --> 00:23:45,520
vulnerability and we believe that many

611
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,760
many more are vulnerable

612
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:50,080
they we are currently in this closure

613
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,159
process with several of them but this

614
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:54,159
means the scorpio can be much more than

615
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,159
just dns service providers it can be

616
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:57,840
domain registrars it can be shared

617
00:23:57,840 --> 00:23:59,600
hosting basically anyone that is

618
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:01,760
providing dna services might be

619
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:04,559
susceptible to this attack and all could

620
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:06,320
be vulnerable to this kind of name

621
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,559
server hijacking so think about it if we

622
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:10,320
would have extended the attack what

623
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:12,000
would be the scope and the number of

624
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,640
endpoints that we could put into our in

625
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:18,440
new intelligence capability

626
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:20,000
so

627
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,480
in terms of the timeline disclosure we

628
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,520
worked with amazon ws and they acted

629
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,200
really quickly once we reported their

630
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:29,039
vulnerability it was

631
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:31,279
fixed so it was fixed by

632
00:24:31,279 --> 00:24:33,679
february this year and there's two more

633
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:36,320
club providers that are currently in a

634
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,039
disclosure process now how did they fix

635
00:24:39,039 --> 00:24:41,840
the vulnerability

636
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:44,799
so it's honestly pretty simple all they

637
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:47,279
have to do is basically block the

638
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:50,240
ability to register the name servers

639
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:51,600
and again

640
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:53,360
you would even think why would they even

641
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:55,760
have never ever allowed us to register

642
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,840
the name servers obviously we don't we

643
00:24:57,840 --> 00:25:01,440
don't own the name servers of aws and

644
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,799
maybe that will be part of the

645
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:04,400
resolutions

646
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:05,600
that could be

647
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,799
for this kind of attacks so basically

648
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:11,600
what aws did is that you cannot register

649
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,679
anymore the name servers and that

650
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:15,760
blocked speci this specific type of

651
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,240
attack we also disclosed this to other

652
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,600
cloud providers that are currently

653
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,159
working on a fix and we also disclose

654
00:25:22,159 --> 00:25:24,799
this to microsoft now what's important

655
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:27,120
to say here is that microsoft told us

656
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,279
that this is not a vulnerability and

657
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:31,360
they're right this is actually not

658
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,360
vulnerability the the

659
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,520
problem here is that the dns of the

660
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,760
company is misconfigured

661
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:39,919
the misconfiguration here is that the

662
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:42,799
public dns didn't expect the endpoints

663
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:44,080
to actually

664
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,880
think the uh this public dns is their

665
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:49,600
internet dns the problem here is

666
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,039
actually what i call sometimes

667
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,200
international waters it's not exactly a

668
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,360
vulnerability but still there it has a

669
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,480
huge impact

670
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,559
so basically

671
00:25:58,559 --> 00:26:00,320
this mis-configuration

672
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,559
happens in so many organizations that

673
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:05,679
the impact is huge but we can fix that

674
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:08,320
so let's now talk a bit about how this

675
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:12,240
vulnerability can fix they can be fixed

676
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,799
so a dns providers want to ensure that

677
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:20,720
they are not vulnerable should make sure

678
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,559
it is impossible to register their own

679
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,960
domains on the platform yes providers

680
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,400
who wants to have

681
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,320
even a better security can also do

682
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,480
ongoing verification to ensure users are

683
00:26:30,480 --> 00:26:32,880
only registering their own domains

684
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,039
in addition it is important to make sure

685
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:37,440
that the platform user cannot register a

686
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:40,000
reserved name as specified in the dns

687
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,120
rfcs

688
00:26:41,120 --> 00:26:43,600
the rfc is full of reserve domains that

689
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:45,200
should not be allowed to register and

690
00:26:45,200 --> 00:26:47,120
there is the registration may lead to

691
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,080
unexpected behavior

692
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:53,120
for organizations that want to make sure

693
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:54,960
they are not vulnerable we recommend

694
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:57,520
making sure that the primary name server

695
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:01,279
in the soa record in the external dns

696
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:03,520
does not point to a default domain owned

697
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:05,200
by the dns provider

698
00:27:05,200 --> 00:27:07,039
as you can see in the slide the default

699
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:08,880
primary name server

700
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,799
that the domain owner receives when they

701
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:13,200
add the domains to router 53 is the

702
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,159
first name of the

703
00:27:16,159 --> 00:27:18,320
the first name of the four name servers

704
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,399
which manage the dns zone

705
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:22,799
changing it to the organization a

706
00:27:22,799 --> 00:27:24,559
primary

707
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:26,559
name server

708
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,799
or even to an invalid subdomain under

709
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,120
the domain will solve the problem and

710
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:33,039
will not allow potential attackers to

711
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,879
register the domain on the platform

712
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,520
we are getting to the end of the

713
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,440
presentation and i want to recommend

714
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,440
some research directions for researchers

715
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:46,320
who may want to continue our research

716
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:47,760
during the study we found more

717
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:48,960
interesting domains that can be

718
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,200
registered on dns's service platforms

719
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,520
any domain that is considered reserved

720
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,399
by the rfc is interesting with some

721
00:27:56,399 --> 00:27:58,799
playing with reverse dns reserve names

722
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:01,840
like the dote alpa arpa

723
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:04,159
family and

724
00:28:04,159 --> 00:28:06,000
we managed to get connections from

725
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,840
variety of endpoints

726
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,919
another research direction

727
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:12,480
um we have is to scan dna servers in the

728
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,159
world and try to update them with

729
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,240
dynamic dns

730
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,440
shows there are servers that do not

731
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:19,279
verify authentication and it will be

732
00:28:19,279 --> 00:28:20,880
interesting to understand how many of

733
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:22,320
them are there

734
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,279
another research direction that we find

735
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:27,840
interesting is the ntlm authentication

736
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:29,440
in dns updates

737
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,840
perhaps it's possible to take advantage

738
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,159
of the fact that the computer in an

739
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:35,840
organization is trying to authenticate

740
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,640
with us it might allow some ntlm attacks

741
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,960
that could grant an attacker and an easy

742
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,240
entry point into the exposed

743
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:44,559
organization

744
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:47,600
so apparently a dynamic dns say enabled

745
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:49,120
the authentication which sounds very

746
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:51,120
reasonable letting anyone in the

747
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,120
organization to update any dns record

748
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:55,440
they want sounds a bit risky windows

749
00:28:55,440 --> 00:28:57,200
computers perform authentication using

750
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,120
ntlm or kerberos over dns tsig to force

751
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:03,039
endpoint to authenticate to us

752
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,480
all we have to do is to respond with a

753
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:06,720
refused message to the update request

754
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,000
the computer will then attempt to

755
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,200
authenticate

756
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,039
not every computer had authentication

757
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:13,679
with us and we do not know in what it

758
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:15,200
depends

759
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:16,399
here we can see an authentication

760
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:19,039
request we receive from a windows 10

761
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:20,880
computer using ntlm

762
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:22,799
the fact that it is possible to get a

763
00:29:22,799 --> 00:29:24,559
computer to do antenna negotiation with

764
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:26,799
us sounds really cool and it may be

765
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,960
possible to leverage it

766
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,880
we have not continued to stretch this

767
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:33,919
research direction

768
00:29:34,480 --> 00:29:35,520
so

769
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:38,720
what have we seen just a quick summary

770
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:42,240
and key takeaways we got to nation state

771
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,600
capabilities after doing a simple domain

772
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:47,200
registration

773
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:47,919
so

774
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:49,279
and this

775
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:51,840
scope is not only for a specific service

776
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,720
we saw that the scope may be much bigger

777
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,360
so there is a huge scope here but it's

778
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:59,679
not only we believe it's not only the

779
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:01,679
domain name

780
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:04,559
of the name server we believe there may

781
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:06,640
be many additional domains that you

782
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,880
might register that might break things

783
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:10,960
because as we saw here you can never

784
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:14,240
expect what dns clients will do so we

785
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,000
see this as a new class

786
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,080
of dns vulnerabilities that are trying

787
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:18,960
to

788
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:21,120
leverage the fact that dns as a service

789
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,960
works a bit differently than dns

790
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:25,600
providers that we had on premise and and

791
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:28,240
using that effect try to find completely

792
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:30,880
new attack vectors that are completely

793
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,039
uncharted and maybe untraceable for

794
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:34,000
companies

795
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,159
so thank you for uh

796
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,360
taking the time and we we hope that the

797
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,159
security community would will start

798
00:30:42,159 --> 00:30:43,840
looking more into

799
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,840
dns's service vulnerabilities we would

800
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:46,799
love to

801
00:30:46,799 --> 00:30:48,559
cooperate and work with anyone that

802
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:50,799
would want to help us in further

803
00:30:50,799 --> 00:30:52,000
research

804
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,960
thank you
