6
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,719
i had a great day yesterday

00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:15,679
crafty bear or turbo panda looking at me

9
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:18,400
it's like i'm back at black hat

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:21,039
it's pretty cool creativity hey so

11
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:23,199
before we kick off our keynote i've got

12
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:24,640
a couple of normal housekeeping

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,720
announcements and a couple more thoughts

14
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,359
i'm going to subject you to

15
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:31,439
first off um

16
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,079
the materials for all the sessions

17
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:36,160
uh will be online next week so when you

18
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,079
get home from the conference

19
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,600
you recover over the weekend if you're

20
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:41,840
not at defcon check out the black hat

21
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:43,760
site and the youtube channel and you'll

22
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,440
start to see all the materials becoming

23
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:46,480
available

24
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:48,160
and then don't forget that your badge

25
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,440
also gets you access online for 30 days

26
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,120
for the session so you can also stream

27
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:55,120
it have a party at your house with your

28
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,120
friends and watch your favorite sessions

29
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,719
again or catch up on the things you

30
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:00,640
didn't see

31
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:02,879
so that's the housekeeping and then this

32
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,239
evening

33
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:06,960
we'll have an ending keynote

34
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,840
by the secretary of dhs now

35
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,200
it had been planned that both jen and

36
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:15,520
the secretary were going to be live

37
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:16,240
and

38
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,159
on the beginning of the week

39
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,320
here we are at the end of the week and

40
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,520
they're not live

41
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,840
so that wasn't the plan i apologize for

42
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,880
that but

43
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,880
stuff happens and we just have to adapt

44
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,080
and overcome

45
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,280
so

46
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:31,840
like yesterday i'm going to be doing um

47
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:33,119
an introduction

48
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:35,520
jen's going to give her talk then we're

49
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,600
going to go to a q a session just like

50
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,320
we did with matt yesterday

51
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,600
alright so

52
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,640
that's the plan let's get started

53
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,880
now many of you who've seen me talk up

54
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,040
on stage before have heard me say this

55
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:50,640
over and over again and i'm probably

56
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:52,000
going to keep repeating it for at least

57
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,759
another five years which is that

58
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,040
internet problems are global problems

59
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,680
and i say this because it's

60
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,880
sometimes

61
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,280
a small-minded kind of well the tech was

62
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:05,600
invented in america and there's a fang

63
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,280
the giant companies are in america in

64
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,280
the english-speaking world and we just

65
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,520
sort of don't realize that the equipment

66
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:13,120
that runs a lot of the internet doesn't

67
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,800
come from america

68
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,239
right the engineers are in different

69
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,800
countries and that really if there is a

70
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,319
problem in some of the infrastructure

71
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,160
you're probably going to have to talk to

72
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,239
someone in another country or at least

73
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:25,920
deal with products manufactured in

74
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,400
another country or standards that were

75
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,239
largely developed in another country

76
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,800
like 5g

77
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:33,920
so

78
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,720
we have to have a bigger global mindset

79
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:38,239
and we also have to do this for another

80
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:40,480
reason i think and that is that the

81
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,720
internet is really shaping up

82
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,720
to be sort of this contested environment

83
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,000
right where

84
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,560
we're really seeing some soft lines in

85
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,080
the sand being drawn and it's it's

86
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,680
really going down sort of the rule of

87
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:55,599
law countries

88
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,400
um

89
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:58,319
this undecided sort of neutral countries

90
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:00,239
in the middle that don't have to pick or

91
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:01,680
don't want to pick sides and then sort

92
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:04,000
of the more authoritarian countries and

93
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,879
that might be very nebulous and soft now

94
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,800
but i guarantee you over the next five

95
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:11,920
years those lines are going to become

96
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:13,760
bigger and taller

97
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,280
lines in the sand will become moats in

98
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,400
the sand

99
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,360
and

100
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,200
both sides

101
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,440
rule of law countries in authoritarian

102
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,879
countries are going to start squeezing

103
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:24,720
and pressuring the people in the middle

104
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:26,560
right the undecided countries are going

105
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,519
to be

106
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,560
kind of forced to try to take sides and

107
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,560
so from my perspective hey i want to

108
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,360
showcase i'm on team rule of law

109
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,200
and i really want to showcase the

110
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,400
strengths

111
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:40,239
of rule of law right

112
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,360
the independence the freedom uh

113
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,599
of decision making the the personal

114
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:46,480
choice

115
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,239
um but you have to set a positive

116
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,560
example you have to show that team rule

117
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,640
of law can get stuff done

118
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,799
and if ransomware attacks or other

119
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:56,959
attacks are crushing us hey we have a

120
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,280
way of solving these problems that don't

121
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,840
mean we have to become

122
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,560
team authoritarian right our model will

123
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,000
work for the challenges that the

124
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,599
internet is facing we created the

125
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,680
internet and we're going to figure out

126
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:11,120
the solutions to the problems it

127
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,840
presents even if there's bad actors

128
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,639
poking us all the time trying to push us

129
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,959
over or try to make us look more like

130
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,880
them right because that helps their

131
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:22,720
argument

132
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,000
and so

133
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,080
we're going to have to work together to

134
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,840
fix these problems we're gonna have to

135
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:29,840
coordinate with each other right we're

136
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,919
gonna have loose alliances we're gonna

137
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,240
have opportunistic but we're gonna have

138
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,639
to sort of do this more purposefully

139
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:38,160
we're gonna have to know that we're not

140
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:39,440
just doing it for our company or for

141
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,960
ourselves but we're doing it for the

142
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,800
future the type of internet we want to

143
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,040
leave our children

144
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,720
because the internet is so malleable

145
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,880
that if we screw this up long enough

146
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,720
it'll just become a different kind of

147
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,560
internet and one that maybe we're not so

148
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,040
proud of

149
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,720
so yesterday i also talked a little bit

150
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,120
about um community immunity and this

151
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,039
idea that can you get a conferred

152
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:03,440
benefit on a network

153
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,160
if one network is really locked down and

154
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,080
really secured do other networks get a

155
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:11,759
benefit maybe through anti-spam or dns

156
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,680
type records well i'm just going to talk

157
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,280
about that a little bit more

158
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,479
from a different perspective

159
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:20,639
so

160
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,560
community immunity

161
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,240
it's what's considered it's part of a

162
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,400
social dilemma a set of problems that

163
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,479
social scientists and psychologists

164
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:31,120
study and in the social dilemma set of

165
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:33,600
problems there's generally three that

166
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,440
people study and you're probably

167
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:36,880
familiar with two of them the first one

168
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,639
is the prisoner's dilemma

169
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,560
it's like in every movie and every tv

170
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,479
show that wants to appear smart you know

171
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:45,919
the cops separate the witnesses or the

172
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:47,360
suspects and they have a prisoner's

173
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,880
dilemma moment where the person turns

174
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,039
the camera and explains the prisoner's

175
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,280
dilemma to the audience

176
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,840
and that's largely around self-interest

177
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,560
if

178
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,960
the two

179
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,919
suspects stay quiet that's their optimal

180
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:03,759
solution but if either one of them

181
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:06,080
cooperates or both cooperate they have a

182
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,120
worse outcome

183
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,000
then there's a tragedy of the commons

184
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,360
and in the tragedy of the commons the

185
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,120
questions largely revolve around who

186
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,000
maintains the commons

187
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,600
and so you might say well is the

188
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,199
internet at commons and who's

189
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:23,680
responsible for maintaining it

190
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,639
but it's largely around an open resource

191
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,080
a field

192
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:31,520
a stadium that everybody has access to

193
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:32,800
and the one that you might be less

194
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,560
familiar with is the public goods

195
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:35,680
dilemma

196
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,160
and the public goods dilemma is largely

197
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,039
around a resource so think of

198
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,360
fishermen

199
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:46,080
trying to optimize their rate of

200
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,440
catching fish and so if every fisherman

201
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,840
catches all the fish they possibly can

202
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,919
there'd be no more fish

203
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,520
and so it would hurt the community of

204
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:56,960
fishermen

205
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,800
so

206
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,560
social dilemmas are defined by two

207
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,720
characteristics in tension with each

208
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,280
other the first is each person

209
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,400
designs their own optimum strategy to

210
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,360
maximize their situation

211
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,840
right oh i've got a free internet i'm

212
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,840
gonna download everything i'm going to

213
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:17,440
use all the bandwidth i'm going to

214
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,039
maximize and optimize for my return

215
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:22,479
and the thing it's intention with is the

216
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:25,759
second part if everybody does this

217
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,960
everybody is worse off

218
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,840
right and in that situation cooperation

219
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:33,599
is the better strategy so it's the

220
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:35,919
cooperation versus the individual

221
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,680
maximizer

222
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,440
is the problem

223
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,080
and so in the public's good dilemma

224
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,360
there's one you're probably familiar

225
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:46,879
with um called the free rider problem

226
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:48,160
and the free rider problem is

227
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:51,599
essentially you're providing a service

228
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,080
so for example new york subway

229
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,759
if five or ten people jump over the

230
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:57,120
styles

231
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,960
not a problem new york subway will still

232
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,280
operate but if everybody jumps over the

233
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:04,080
stiles and nobody pays for the subway

234
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,759
subway will go broke

235
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:08,160
right so it can absorb a little bit but

236
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:10,160
it can't absorb everybody doing it and i

237
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,080
like to think of sort of the economic

238
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,319
model of the internet today driven by ad

239
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:16,240
revenue

240
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,479
if a couple of us install ad blockers

241
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:20,000
not a big deal

242
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,280
if we all

243
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:23,759
install ad blockers

244
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,120
that's a big deal right that

245
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,039
fundamentally changes the whole economic

246
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:29,759
model of the internet that would be uh

247
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:30,800
sort of a

248
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,200
free writer problem

249
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,719
and so it's this tension between the

250
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:35,839
short-term

251
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:37,760
self-interest versus long-term

252
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,839
collective

253
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:41,519
interest and

254
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:42,799
this is sort of a problem that we're

255
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,800
going to be facing in the internet

256
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,760
or are facing currently and i think

257
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,680
traditionally the way these problems get

258
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:50,959
solved

259
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,399
is the individuals take care of

260
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,519
themselves

261
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:55,279
we all pursue our own self-interest but

262
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,839
when it comes to collective interest

263
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:59,839
that's why we form governments

264
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:01,120
that's traditionally the role of

265
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:02,399
governments

266
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:04,320
sometimes companies

267
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,600
and so generally the company the

268
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:07,279
government would then legislate they

269
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,000
would say okay columbia river river this

270
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,680
is how you get to divvy up your water

271
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,839
resources it's not whoever's most

272
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,000
upstream gets all the water you have to

273
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,360
divide it amongst the interested states

274
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:21,440
right or

275
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,880
you don't have to be your own fire

276
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:25,040
department we're going to form a fire

277
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,120
department tax people and then if

278
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,200
there's a fire the collective will help

279
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,200
put out the fire right these are certain

280
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:32,880
problems governments do better than

281
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,880
individuals or companies

282
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,440
and we're starting to see this become

283
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,640
in relief

284
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,560
in internet security we're starting to

285
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,519
face certain problems that are beyond

286
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:45,519
the individual or the company to solve

287
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,320
or the ietf or icann or whoever there

288
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,839
are certain classes of problems that are

289
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:51,680
really starting to become governmental

290
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:52,800
problems

291
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,480
right if it's a nation-state that's

292
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:56,240
 with us

293
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,519
and we don't have a governmental

294
00:09:57,519 --> 00:09:58,640
response

295
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:00,959
problem's not going to get solved

296
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,920
right so the government has to step up

297
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,680
and they have to acknowledge that

298
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,760
they're the only one in certain

299
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,519
categories that can solve these

300
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,440
collective issue problems

301
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,680
and they have to work with us

302
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,880
to come up with the optimum solution

303
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:18,480
and so

304
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:20,320
i think

305
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,920
what we have to think of what we have to

306
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,600
think about is how do we build these

307
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,360
relation relationships who do we trust

308
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,519
in government who do we not trust what's

309
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,000
worth building what's not what norms are

310
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,320
worth building and what ones are we not

311
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,959
going to pursue

312
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:37,200
and so

313
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:38,880
i'm really excited to introduce jen

314
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,720
easterly who's

315
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:44,399
the new sworn in director of cisa dhs

316
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:45,920
who's really interested in building

317
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,440
community

318
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,360
and it'll be up to us to decide if we

319
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:51,040
you know participate

320
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:53,680
but this is the kind of initiative that

321
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,279
governments would traditionally engage

322
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:57,040
in right they would come to the subject

323
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,360
matter experts they would say hey listen

324
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,959
we have a certain set of authorities we

325
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,720
can do these things you can do those

326
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,279
things how we together going to solve

327
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,120
some of these problems

328
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,160
because we're not going to be able to

329
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:10,480
solve it alone and especially not with

330
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:12,720
pressure from team authoritarian that's

331
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,480
going to be poking us at just the worst

332
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,640
time in the worst place right we have to

333
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:19,200
acknowledge these real challenges and

334
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,160
despite the mythology that we can build

335
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,680
the internet alone and run the internet

336
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,000
alone we're going to have to actually

337
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,320
participate in a more of a larger

338
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,320
collective if we want to see the

339
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,920
internet

340
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,040
remain

341
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:36,480
more open and accessible

342
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,279
so

343
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:39,200
a little bit about jen

344
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,040
she's kind of done everything in the

345
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,040
government she um

346
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:45,040
it's interesting a past keynote speaker

347
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:47,519
black hat um

348
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:49,920
uh jane lute actually was her teacher at

349
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,200
west point

350
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,360
and so it's sort of like one generation

351
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:55,120
uh educating another

352
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:57,680
and so jen was in the u.s army for 20

353
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,440
years and was a professor of social

354
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,440
sciences at the united states military

355
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,760
academy

356
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,720
and then in 2002 to 2004 she was an

357
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:08,320
executive assistant to the national

358
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,360
security advisor

359
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,240
she was in 2004-2006 she was a battalion

360
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:16,320
executive officer and brigade operations

361
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,920
officer at the united states army

362
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:20,639
intelligence and security command

363
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,839
and then more

364
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,040
recently

365
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,160
with cyber experience 2009 2010 she was

366
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:27,519
at the united states cyber command and

367
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,079
helped stand up that command

368
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:32,639
from 2010 to 11 she was a cyber advisor

369
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:34,800
for the national security advisor

370
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,800
stationed in kabul

371
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,600
and then she retired from the army uh as

372
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,959
a lieutenant colonel

373
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:42,560
and then served as the deputy director

374
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,480
for the nsa national security advisor

375
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,959
for counter-terrorism

376
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:50,399
and then in 2013 to 2016 she was a

377
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,760
special assistant to president uh obama

378
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,720
and senior director for

379
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,079
counter-terrorism on the national

380
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:57,920
security council

381
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,680
and at the very end after the

382
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,600
administration she went into the private

383
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:02,480
sector

384
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,040
probably for the first time

385
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:08,000
and became the global head of the cyber

386
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,279
security division for morgan stanley

387
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,519
and now has come back into government uh

388
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,920
just this last month as the assistant

389
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,839
director and she's going to highlight

390
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:20,720
the scope and scale of threats to our

391
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,040
cyber infrastructure and how hackers

392
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,800
the government and the private sector

393
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,560
can work together to try to secure the

394
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,240
nation from these threats

395
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,040
so

396
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:30,560
i'm interested in hearing her story of

397
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,639
how she got to where she is and her

398
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:34,880
thoughts on what sissa can possibly do

399
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:39,420
to help us so take it away jen thank you

400
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:39,800
[Applause]

401
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:43,040
[Music]

402
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:45,040
thanks so much jeff for that kind

403
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:47,040
introduction i'm jen easterly i'm the

404
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,800
director of the cyber security and

405
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:51,040
infrastructure security agency and i'm

406
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,680
so honored to be a part of black hat

407
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,360
it's one of my first official duties

408
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,120
since i was sworn in

409
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:58,800
some three and a half weeks ago and as

410
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:01,519
part of that i want to lay to rest what

411
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:04,240
i am told is a hotly debated topic and

412
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,800
that is the pronunciation

413
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:08,320
of my agency

414
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:09,199
it's

415
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:10,890
sissa

416
00:14:10,890 --> 00:14:17,860
[Music]

417
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,160
seriously it's not that hard it is

418
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,079
pronounced sissa

419
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:24,560
but seriously i am really honored and

420
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:25,760
thrilled to be with you here today

421
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:27,199
because i

422
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,680
need your help

423
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,839
but before i start making demands of you

424
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:33,680
i figured i should introduce myself a

425
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:35,760
little bit so you get to know me

426
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,920
and hopefully appreciate

427
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,440
where i come from

428
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,680
what's important to me how i plan to

429
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,920
lead system most importantly how i want

430
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,240
to partner with all of you

431
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:47,760
now i know you're going to find this

432
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,079
really hard to believe but i was a bit

433
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:52,480
of a nerdy kid

434
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:56,000
so i wasn't very good at sports i wasn't

435
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,519
very popular

436
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,920
i did well in school i played piano

437
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:01,360
pretty poorly

438
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,839
but the thing that i loved most were

439
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:05,760
puzzles and games

440
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,760
card games board games video games and

441
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,199
at the age of 11 i became obsessed with

442
00:15:11,199 --> 00:15:12,880
the rubik's cube

443
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,040
now you may know that the rubik's cube

444
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,360
was invented by hungarian sculptor erno

445
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,839
rubik in the year 1974 but it wasn't

446
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:21,680
introduced until the world

447
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,000
until 1980 and it caused of course an

448
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,560
international sensation and as i said

449
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,399
i became obsessed

450
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:30,320
with solving it

451
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,399
and so i spent quite a while and i

452
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,160
finally figured it out

453
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:35,680
and then much to the amusement of my

454
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,240
parents i would go around to toy stores

455
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,920
in the local area and toy stores and we

456
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,440
were traveling i would make a bet with

457
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,600
the toy store clerk or the owner that if

458
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,519
i could solve the cube in less than two

459
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,880
minutes then they would give me a free

460
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:47,839
one

461
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,240
now i know you can go on youtube today

462
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,000
and see a two-year-old solving the

463
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,800
rubik's cube with her toes in 11.4

464
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:56,399
seconds but back then

465
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:58,399
two minutes was a really big deal i mean

466
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:00,560
it took erno rubik a full month to solve

467
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:03,199
the cube and he invented the thing

468
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,279
so you know after a while i was able to

469
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,920
amass a pretty good collection of cubes

470
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,880
but this love of puzzles really stayed

471
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,120
with me throughout my career and

472
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,839
manifested into a love for problem

473
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:17,519
solving

474
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,440
so fast forward a couple years later

475
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:22,079
just after my 18th birthday i did what

476
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,560
most nice jewish girls from middle class

477
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,959
families do i went off to the united

478
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:29,279
states military academy at west point

479
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:31,360
okay none of my classmates did that i

480
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:33,279
was the only one but in addition to

481
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,360
growing up with a love for puzzles i

482
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:38,079
grew up with a real deep appreciation of

483
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:40,000
public service my dad was a vietnam

484
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,680
veteran both my parents served in

485
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,320
government and i felt that it was really

486
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,160
important to serve the nation i knew i

487
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:47,600
wanted to be in the army i wanted to go

488
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,040
to west point

489
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,639
so i headed off there in the summer of

490
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:53,600
1986 i was part of the tenth class of

491
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:55,360
women to enter west point we were just

492
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,320
about nine percent of the population

493
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:00,320
interestingly we were the first class of

494
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:01,680
cadets to be

495
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,319
uh to be issued computers the mighty

496
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:07,280
zenith z248

497
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:09,679
so again showed up in the summer of 1986

498
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,160
now i had applied early i had been

499
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,400
accepted early but i made a very serious

500
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:17,280
error i had never visited the school

501
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:19,760
so when i showed up in that summer hot

502
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:20,559
day

503
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,559
i was ill prepared for the physical

504
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:24,640
rigors the mental stresses the emotional

505
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,640
pressures i remember i showed up they

506
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:29,039
took away my civilian clothes gave me a

507
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,960
white t-shirt with my last name these

508
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,960
ugly black acrylic shorts with gold

509
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:34,240
piping

510
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,919
black socks we had to pull up to our

511
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:38,240
knees black leather shoes they hacked

512
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,320
off my hair i failed my first two mile

513
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,640
run and i got yelled at

514
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:44,000
a lot

515
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,640
and every night i thought about

516
00:17:46,640 --> 00:17:48,640
quitting and going home but

517
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,000
every morning

518
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,559
i recommitted myself to improving and

519
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:54,080
getting through that difficult summer i

520
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,559
was really looking at it as a puzzle to

521
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,960
be solved and this time it was actually

522
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,360
more enjoyable because i was solving it

523
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,919
with a group of teammates

524
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:05,760
so i was able to get through that

525
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,640
difficult summer and made it four years

526
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,520
through west point graduated in 1990 it

527
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,400
was the

528
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,880
end of the cold war those four years in

529
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,640
minoring in russian didn't seem so smart

530
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,960
anymore it was the self-proclaimed end

531
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,880
of history the fall of the berlin wall

532
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,960
that followed the soviet union the

533
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,559
triumph of the liberal international

534
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:26,880
order over communism and autocracy peace

535
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,480
was breaking out all over

536
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,400
and i thought i'd only be in the army

537
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,080
for a few years and i'd get out and do

538
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,080
something else but

539
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:36,720
over the next 10 years the opportunities

540
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,480
that i had to be on peacekeeping

541
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,720
operations in haiti and in bosnia to be

542
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:43,039
a paratrooper jumping out of airplanes

543
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,640
at fort bragg north carolina the

544
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:47,039
excitement the challenges of leadership

545
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:48,799
the many puzzles and problems to be

546
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,360
solved really kept me in the army and i

547
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:54,080
found myself back at west point 10 years

548
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:56,559
after graduating teaching economics and

549
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:00,000
security to cadets and i was there on

550
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,720
september 11th and i remember

551
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,400
that morning i was getting ready to

552
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:07,120
teach a class to cadets who until that

553
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,840
bright beautiful

554
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,960
tuesday thought they'd be graduating

555
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,320
into a world

556
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:14,240
where the army would likely shrink in

557
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:16,480
size and they'd spend most of their time

558
00:19:16,480 --> 00:19:18,799
planning or doing exercises

559
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:21,039
and then the planes hit

560
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:23,760
in new york in washington dc in a field

561
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,600
in pennsylvania and the world changed as

562
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,600
we all know i remember

563
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,799
watching the towers fall on tv

564
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:32,960
hundreds of floors of steel and glass

565
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,880
exploding in the air signaling the

566
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:38,400
deaths of thousands 2 97

567
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,799
people died that day from 90 countries

568
00:19:40,799 --> 00:19:43,760
around the world

569
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:46,640
and then just a few years later i found

570
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:47,760
myself

571
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,080
sitting behind my then boss national

572
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,559
security advisor condoleezza rice says

573
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:54,640
she was testifying before the 9 11

574
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:57,039
commission that was set up to

575
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,880
investigate the government's failure to

576
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:00,720
prevent those attacks

577
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,200
and i remember being struck by the words

578
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:05,280
of the co-chairman of the 911 commission

579
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:06,880
tom kane who said

580
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,240
on that september day we were unprepared

581
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:12,400
we did not grasp the magnitude of a

582
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:14,000
threat that had been growing for some

583
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,919
considerable amount of time it was a

584
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:17,600
failure of policy

585
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,200
a failure of management a failure of

586
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,960
capability but above all

587
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,720
a failure of imagination

588
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:28,080
i was totally struck by that

589
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:30,240
and you know albert einstein

590
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:32,960
has said imagination is more important

591
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,559
than knowledge knowledge is limited

592
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,559
while imagination embraces the entire

593
00:20:36,559 --> 00:20:38,799
world stimulating progress giving birth

594
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,200
to evolution he warned do not sacrifice

595
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,200
your imagination on the altar of crude

596
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,360
reality you'll wind up believing in

597
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,640
nothing and having worthless dreams

598
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,480
i have to say i agree with that i

599
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,720
believe that imagination is more

600
00:20:52,720 --> 00:20:54,000
important than knowledge you know we

601
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:55,520
sometimes dismiss

602
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,360
those of wild imagination as these

603
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,760
impractical dreamers who waste our time

604
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,760
but as those of wild and wild

605
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,559
imagination who've given us our most

606
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:06,799
important and impactful

607
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,640
inventions

608
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:11,280
light and flight and power and code

609
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,960
who've put a woman in space who've

610
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,559
allowed us to communicate

611
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,480
instantaneously with others around the

612
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:18,559
globe it's those of wild imagine

613
00:21:18,559 --> 00:21:20,720
imagination who've helped us solve our

614
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:22,960
most complicated puzzles

615
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:25,039
imagination brings resilience and

616
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,280
innovation it makes us better leaders

617
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,760
makes us better technologists

618
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:32,240
makes us better hackers

619
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:34,799
so i've spent the last decades of my

620
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:36,000
career

621
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,000
honing my own imagination to try and

622
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,840
build technologies and teams to deal

623
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:41,360
with the most serious threats to the

624
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,440
nation from terrorists and cyber threat

625
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,440
actors and i want to tell you a little

626
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,679
bit about that journey so again you know

627
00:21:47,679 --> 00:21:49,679
who i am and how i want to partner with

628
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:50,720
you

629
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:54,240
and i want to take you to the year 2007

630
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:56,720
in baghdad i was a young lieutenant

631
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:58,480
colonel in the army i was deployed there

632
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,200
with the national security agency

633
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,960
as part of our effort to bring national

634
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,720
level intelligence to the troops on the

635
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,440
ground it was the height of the violence

636
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,039
during the surge

637
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:11,360
al qaeda in iraq had perfected their

638
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:13,039
ability to make these bombs out of

639
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:14,960
improvised explosive devices and it was

640
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,520
having catastrophic impacts on iraqi

641
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,360
civilians and our troops on the ground

642
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,039
and one of the things that my team and i

643
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,120
were asked to do was to operationalize

644
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:25,679
this new high technology platform called

645
00:22:25,679 --> 00:22:29,039
real-time regional gateway or rtrg

646
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:31,360
it was highly classified at the time

647
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:33,039
declassified a couple years ago and the

648
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,159
idea was

649
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:36,080
we were trying to take all of the

650
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:38,720
collection available from traditional

651
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,360
streams of intel like satellite and cell

652
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,640
phones to

653
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:45,200
reporting about insurgent activity on

654
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:46,880
the ground to take all of that data

655
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:48,640
together and enrich it and integrate it

656
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,039
and correlate it to help us illuminate

657
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,960
terrorist networks not in weeks or days

658
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,240
but in hours and minutes

659
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:58,640
my team sat in a van and a base in the

660
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,039
middle of baghdad violence all around

661
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:03,200
trying to code up the system i used to

662
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,000
think of it as extreme coding

663
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:08,320
and i will tell you there were many many

664
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,240
failures in that first month as we tried

665
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,760
to get the system up and running but

666
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,840
there was no failure of imagination

667
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:16,080
there was actually a really strong

668
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:18,320
presence of it with that great team and

669
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,679
after a while we were able to

670
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:21,919
successfully get the system up and

671
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:23,840
running and it provided a capability to

672
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,760
the troops on the ground that

673
00:23:25,760 --> 00:23:27,280
helped them to take thousands of

674
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:29,840
insurgents off the battlefield and save

675
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,600
lives and to me

676
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:34,880
it was an epiphany it was really

677
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,440
the power of technology and the power of

678
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,960
imagination and the power of

679
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:40,400
collaboration

680
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,799
uh really hit home for me

681
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,960
the power of all of that to actually

682
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,799
save lives and make a difference for the

683
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,480
nation

684
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,279
now a few months after i redeployed from

685
00:23:51,279 --> 00:23:53,679
baghdad the director of the national

686
00:23:53,679 --> 00:23:55,360
security agency at the time general

687
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:57,840
keith alexander asked me to stand up the

688
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:00,080
army's first cyber operations battalion

689
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,600
and my team and i did that in the summer

690
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,080
of 2008 we called it the army network

691
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,919
warfare battalion

692
00:24:05,919 --> 00:24:08,400
now a few months after that the military

693
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:10,480
the department of defense suffered its

694
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,080
most devastating

695
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,919
cyber attack when an infected thumb

696
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:15,840
drive was inserted into a laptop at a

697
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,679
base in the middle east allowing

698
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,360
malicious code to spiral through

699
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:21,520
networks and for sensitive data to be

700
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,360
exfiltrated and it was a huge wake-up

701
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,320
call

702
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,159
that the military really needed to

703
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,240
maneuver differently in this new domain

704
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:30,240
called cyberspace and that it would

705
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,400
require a new type of organization that

706
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,760
would bring together

707
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:35,600
offensive cyber capabilities with

708
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,200
defensive ones

709
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,440
and because i was the army cyber

710
00:24:39,440 --> 00:24:40,960
battalion commander i was asked to be

711
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:43,200
part of this very small team to help

712
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,000
build this new organization it was me it

713
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:48,320
was colonel paul nakasoni from the army

714
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,799
captain tj white from the navy colonel s

715
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:53,279
l davis from the air force working for

716
00:24:53,279 --> 00:24:56,000
general alexander and our then

717
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:58,720
nsa deputy director chris inglis

718
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,279
now our national cyber director

719
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:03,440
a fantastic teammate and collaborator

720
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:06,240
who is already adding value to helping

721
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,760
to secure our cyber ecosystem so we all

722
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,120
work together

723
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:13,440
to build what eventually became united

724
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:16,159
states cyber command and of course cyber

725
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:18,880
command and nsa under the command of now

726
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,600
general paul nakasoni and nsa's cyber

727
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,000
directorate under the leadership of my

728
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,960
good friend rob joyce are close partners

729
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:28,960
with cisa

730
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,279
now a few years later there was another

731
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,640
series of major cyber attacks this time

732
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,440
it was a distributed distributed denial

733
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:39,120
of service attack by a group called the

734
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,200
al-qasam cyber fighters

735
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:43,360
and essentially these ddos attacks were

736
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,200
launched against all of the big banks

737
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,799
across wall street

738
00:25:46,799 --> 00:25:48,480
so that customers and clients and

739
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,200
employees couldn't get to those websites

740
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,799
and it really caused a panic for the

741
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,720
first time it illuminated the fragility

742
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,240
and vulnerability of our critical

743
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,320
financial infrastructure

744
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,559
and it led early on to the banks coming

745
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,640
together and realizing that they needed

746
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,960
to build those capabilities to enable

747
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:06,559
them to deal with this increasingly

748
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:08,720
complex cyber threat network

749
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,799
and the bank that i would later join was

750
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:12,400
one of those who started building those

751
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,840
capabilities and so in 2017 after i left

752
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,919
the government i went to go join morgan

753
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:20,240
stanley to help build and lead our

754
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:22,400
global cybersecurity fusion center to

755
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,440
understand detect and respond to cyber

756
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,520
threats and vulnerabilities that would

757
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,159
impact the firm our networks our clients

758
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:32,400
our reputation and so we built that

759
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,440
capability out over a period of three

760
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,039
years and then at the end of

761
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:42,559
2019 we were actually asked to expand on

762
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:44,880
that platform to build what we called

763
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:47,120
the fusion resilience center bringing

764
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:50,000
together our cyber response capabilities

765
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,600
technology incident management

766
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,080
intelligence exercises business

767
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:56,720
continuity technology disaster recovery

768
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:59,120
to enable us to understand prepare for

769
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:01,200
respond to recover and learn from any

770
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,120
sort of operational incident that could

771
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:05,520
disrupt the firm from cyber attacks to

772
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,919
cyber-enabled fraud to technology

773
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:09,600
incidents to terrorist attacks to

774
00:27:09,600 --> 00:27:11,520
geopolitical unrest

775
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,720
to infectious disease and pandemics

776
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,480
i think three important things to think

777
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,880
about this change first is the idea of

778
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,640
this hybrid threat landscape you can't

779
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,240
just talk about cyber attacks or

780
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:25,200
geopolitics or pandemics all of these

781
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:27,200
things are coming together to create

782
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,039
this very hybrid threat environment and

783
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:31,679
covid is a perfect example

784
00:27:31,679 --> 00:27:33,600
a global health crisis that's also a

785
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,520
cyber pandemic because entrepreneurial

786
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:37,919
cyber threat actors took advantage of so

787
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:40,080
many people working remotely in an

788
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:43,279
explosion of fraud and theft

789
00:27:43,279 --> 00:27:45,039
but you think about point two right it's

790
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,679
this idea of the convergence of the

791
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:49,600
cyber and physical everything runs on

792
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,520
this technology background backbone in

793
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,440
this incredibly digitized world we live

794
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:54,159
in

795
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:55,840
the cyber and the physical are coming

796
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,159
together and so we have to treat these

797
00:27:58,159 --> 00:28:00,799
things as one integrated problem set and

798
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,120
then finally this idea of resilience all

799
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,720
of us want to prevent bad things from

800
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:06,559
happening happening of course we do but

801
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,880
in this complicated world that we live

802
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,559
in it's increasingly difficult to

803
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,399
prevent bad things from happening

804
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:14,320
particularly when you have highly

805
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,480
dedicated and sophisticated cyber threat

806
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:19,360
actors so the key is you have to build a

807
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,200
system where you can

808
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:23,039
where you can detect this activity as

809
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,279
rapidly as possible you can respond to

810
00:28:25,279 --> 00:28:28,000
it and you can recover to mitigate risk

811
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,399
to your business and to the nation so

812
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,159
this whole idea of the importance of

813
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,720
resilience

814
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,360
so we built out that capability

815
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,200
and for four and a half years i really

816
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,240
gained this incredible appreciation for

817
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,840
the importance of ensuring the security

818
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,840
and resilience of a piece of our

819
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:50,000
critical financial infrastructure and

820
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,640
that's really what motivates me to come

821
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,240
back today

822
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:56,399
to government to work as the director of

823
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,440
cisa so you know here we are in 2021

824
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:01,919
world is highly complex but you know i

825
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,399
think back about to that point in 2007

826
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:06,640
when i was in baghdad and we thought at

827
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,159
that period of time we were dealing with

828
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:10,320
this massive amount of data but

829
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:11,679
it's kind of funny when i look back

830
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:12,480
because

831
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,720
it was really just the beginning

832
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,039
because of course

833
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:18,559
2007 was the year that steve jobs

834
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:20,399
introduced the world to the first iphone

835
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,399
sparking a revolution in communication

836
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,080
technology

837
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:25,600
it was also the year that a small

838
00:29:25,600 --> 00:29:27,360
microblogging platform called twitter

839
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,600
began to spin off and scale globally

840
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:31,360
following in the footsteps of facebook

841
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,159
which had just become available to

842
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:35,919
everybody over the age of 13 with a

843
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:38,880
valid email address a few months earlier

844
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:42,480
but 2007 was also the year that storage

845
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,640
capacity for computing exploded with the

846
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,120
emergence of hadoop it was the year that

847
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,120
development began on github the year

848
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,520
that change.org was incorporated the

849
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:53,520
year that amazon released kindle and

850
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,919
google released android and ibm began

851
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:58,159
working on watson it was also the year

852
00:29:58,159 --> 00:30:00,399
that intel first introduced non-silicon

853
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,600
materials into microchips enabling the

854
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,440
continued growth and exponential

855
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,240
computing power

856
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:11,279
now here we are in 2021.

857
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:13,760
there are 7.8 billion people on the

858
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,960
planet 5.2 billion on mobile phones 4.7

859
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:19,440
billion on the internet 4.3 billion on

860
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:21,360
social media

861
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,520
there are now over 21 billion devices

862
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:25,200
connected to the internet a number

863
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,279
expected to grow considerably in the

864
00:30:27,279 --> 00:30:29,360
coming few years and from the first

865
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,760
website in 1991

866
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:36,320
there are now over 1.8 billion websites

867
00:30:36,320 --> 00:30:38,880
in just one internet minute there are

868
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,120
now more than 572 000 tweets 1.3 million

869
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,240
facebook logins 3.4 million snaps sent

870
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:49,120
4.7 million youtube videos watched 5.5

871
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,240
million google searches and over

872
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,720
261 million emails sent and delivered in

873
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,720
just one internet minute

874
00:30:59,679 --> 00:31:02,880
the world is incredibly digitized in the

875
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:05,200
volume variety and velocity of data is

876
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:06,640
ever expanding

877
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:09,039
and we know that's a good thing

878
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,039
it's brought us together as humans it's

879
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,039
helped us solve problems we've improved

880
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:15,279
our quality of life but as we've

881
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:17,279
attached more platforms and devices on

882
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,399
the internet

883
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:20,880
we have increased the attack surface as

884
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,240
we all know and we've increased the

885
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:24,159
vulnerabilities

886
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:24,880
so

887
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:26,559
now there's a cyber attack roughly every

888
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:28,559
40 seconds one in 10 of those 1.8

889
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:31,360
billion websites leads you to malware

890
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:33,840
cyber crime damages are in the trillions

891
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,080
of dollars and as we all know ransomware

892
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:38,480
has become a scourge affecting

893
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:40,480
all americans across society with

894
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:43,039
attacks against schools and hospitals

895
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,519
and municipalities and pipelines and

896
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:48,320
meat packing in all manner of software

897
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:50,159
one particularly pernicious vector are

898
00:31:50,159 --> 00:31:52,080
these ransomware attacks against the

899
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,240
healthcare sector already highly

900
00:31:54,240 --> 00:31:56,880
stressed because of covid

901
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:59,360
one healthcare services suffered a

902
00:31:59,360 --> 00:32:01,679
ransomware attack that cost them about

903
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:03,760
70 million dollars

904
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:06,159
but that monetary cost really pales in

905
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:08,799
comparison to the potential human cost

906
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:10,799
because these delays

907
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:13,120
in services and in surgeries and in

908
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:15,760
health care can lead

909
00:32:15,760 --> 00:32:18,000
to an increase in the

910
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:20,559
number of of average deaths that happen

911
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:23,200
in a period of time

912
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:25,840
we cannot allow avoidable cyber

913
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:28,960
disruptions to cost human

914
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,559
lives

915
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:32,799
and yet every day malicious cyber actors

916
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:35,600
from nation states to cyber criminals

917
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,840
weaponize all of that data and the

918
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,760
vulnerabilities in our networks to

919
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,200
threaten the confidentiality the

920
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,799
integrity the availability of our

921
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,880
information our privacy our identity our

922
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:47,120
security our critical infrastructure and

923
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,279
frankly our way of life

924
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:51,360
and that's what brings me back after

925
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,720
four and a half years in the private

926
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,000
sector

927
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:59,039
to the u.s government to lead cisa

928
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:00,880
we're at an incredible moment of time

929
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:02,480
when we have an administration that has

930
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:06,080
made cybersecurity a national security

931
00:33:06,080 --> 00:33:07,600
imperative

932
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,120
the sysa is the product of imagination

933
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,840
of many of my predecessors as well as

934
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,480
the us congress that created it at the

935
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:19,200
end of 2018 where it was founded by my

936
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,120
good friend and predecessor chris krebs

937
00:33:21,120 --> 00:33:23,840
now sissa was created to be something

938
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,679
very different not just another

939
00:33:25,679 --> 00:33:28,240
lumbering government bureaucracy but

940
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,559
really something much more akin to a

941
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,559
hybrid public-private collaborative

942
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:35,679
where collaboration is baked into our

943
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:36,960
dna

944
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,120
now our mission statement is pretty

945
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,159
simple

946
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:42,080
we lead the national effort to

947
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:44,480
understand manage and mitigate risk to

948
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:47,360
our cyber and physical infrastructure

949
00:33:47,360 --> 00:33:49,679
it's easy to say but very hard to

950
00:33:49,679 --> 00:33:51,519
operationalize with significant

951
00:33:51,519 --> 00:33:54,480
consequences for failure

952
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:56,399
so as the national coordinator for

953
00:33:56,399 --> 00:33:58,080
critical infrastructure security and

954
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:00,240
resilience to realize

955
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,159
our vision of secure and resilient

956
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:05,120
infrastructure for the american people

957
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,360
we have to do it as a team

958
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:09,440
we can't do this alone because

959
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,800
over 80 percent of critical

960
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:13,040
infrastructure is in private hands so it

961
00:34:13,040 --> 00:34:14,879
has to be an effort where we come

962
00:34:14,879 --> 00:34:17,199
together and collectively leverage our

963
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:19,520
imagination and our collaboration

964
00:34:19,520 --> 00:34:22,800
to help secure our cyber ecosystem

965
00:34:22,800 --> 00:34:26,480
so here's where i ask for your help

966
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:28,000
first thing

967
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,440
partner with us

968
00:34:29,440 --> 00:34:32,159
to raise the cyber security baseline of

969
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:34,320
our data of our networks of our services

970
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:36,399
of our products and to help make the

971
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,879
internet a safer place

972
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:41,119
you look back on the year so far and

973
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:42,960
it's pretty incredible

974
00:34:42,960 --> 00:34:46,000
from the solar wind supply chain hack to

975
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,280
the

976
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,599
vulnerabilities exploited in

977
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:51,359
microsoft exchange server to

978
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:53,520
vulnerabilities and print windows print

pulse secure connect to attacks against

981
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,079
pipelines and meat packing and

982
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,720
cassaya software it's been a pretty

983
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:05,280
incredible year so far and we're only at

984
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:07,040
the beginning of august and here's where

985
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,640
i need to give my sincere thanks to

986
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,800
brandon wales our executive director who

987
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,200
is the acting director of cisa and our

988
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,200
executive assistant director eric

989
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,760
goldstein who really shepherd us through

990
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,400
this very turbulent and complex period

991
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,320
of time they and their teams did a

992
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:28,000
fantastic job now ciso was able to

993
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,839
issue emergency directives to our

994
00:35:29,839 --> 00:35:32,480
federal partners was able to get out

995
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,960
alerts to our network defenders in the

996
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:37,440
larger community to help them

997
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:38,960
mitigate the risks from these

998
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:40,800
vulnerabilities

999
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,880
but ciso was only able to do this

1000
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,800
because of the incredible partners that

1001
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,440
we have in particular the partnership

1002
00:35:47,440 --> 00:35:50,000
with the research community that does

1003
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:52,320
such great work to help us identify

1004
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:53,839
vulnerabilities and i want to give you a

1005
00:35:53,839 --> 00:35:55,440
couple examples

1006
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,680
so victor gavers of the dutch institute

1007
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,599
for vulnerability disclosure helped us

1008
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:01,839
understand the chain of vulnerabilities

1009
00:36:01,839 --> 00:36:03,839
that led to the exploitation of cassaya

1010
00:36:03,839 --> 00:36:06,000
software and helped us manage

1011
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,839
a national response

1012
00:36:07,839 --> 00:36:09,839
during solarwinds sean metcalf of

1013
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:12,240
trimark helped us understand the

1014
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:14,560
complications around identity management

1015
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:15,920
and his work has really been

1016
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,400
foundational to helping to effectively

1017
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:20,800
pen test infrastructure and then will

1018
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:22,320
dorman of the software engineering

1019
00:36:22,320 --> 00:36:23,920
institute of carnegie mellon helped

1020
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:26,079
microsoft and cisa and our partners

1021
00:36:26,079 --> 00:36:27,119
understand the past and

1022
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:29,040
interconnectedness of the print

1023
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,480
nightmare vulnerabilities so that we

1024
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:32,880
could get guidance out to enable network

1025
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,640
defenders to be able to strengthen the

1026
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,079
security of their networks from that

1027
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,520
vulnerability

1028
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:38,960
now these are just

1029
00:36:38,960 --> 00:36:41,760
three examples three recent examples

1030
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:43,520
but there are many many more so my

1031
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:46,400
thanks to victor and sean and to will

1032
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:48,720
and to all of you who have participated

1033
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:50,320
in our coordinated vulnerability

1034
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,960
disclosure platform you have helped us

1035
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:54,960
make the internet and our ecosystem

1036
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,200
safer and for those of you who haven't i

1037
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:00,079
invite you to please participate we are

1038
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:01,839
a huge supporter of the research

1039
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:04,000
community the work that you do to help

1040
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:06,560
identify vulnerabilities so they can be

1041
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:09,680
rapidly mitigated is so foundational to

1042
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:13,359
a safe and secure cyber ecosystem

1043
00:37:13,359 --> 00:37:15,200
everyone knows that we are stronger

1044
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,839
together our strength really comes from

1045
00:37:17,839 --> 00:37:20,960
this incredible power of collaboration

1046
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:23,520
but we know that with great power

1047
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:26,480
comes great responsibility

1048
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:27,520
so

1049
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,400
my

1050
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,720
priority one of my big priorities as the

1051
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,200
director is to ensure that we are

1052
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,520
maximizing this power is to cultivate

1053
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:36,800
and strengthen the incredible

1054
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:39,040
partnerships that we have in particular

1055
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,599
with industry with the academia with

1056
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:44,160
researchers with the hacker community to

1057
00:37:44,160 --> 00:37:46,800
ensure that we are leveraging the best

1058
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,640
and brightest of this community for the

1059
00:37:48,640 --> 00:37:50,640
collective defense of the nation as i

1060
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,480
said collaboration is in sisa's dna and

1061
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:56,160
i fundamentally believe that this

1062
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:58,240
approach will make us stronger it will

1063
00:37:58,240 --> 00:37:59,920
also help us

1064
00:37:59,920 --> 00:38:02,640
to secure the very complicated supply

1065
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:04,320
chain that underpins practically

1066
00:38:04,320 --> 00:38:05,760
everything we do

1067
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:07,680
and that enables our businesses large

1068
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:08,800
and small

1069
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,599
to help support our economy

1070
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,839
so incredibly important mission you know

1071
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:16,640
relatedly another opportunity last week

1072
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:19,040
we issued the vulnerability disclosure

1073
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,960
platform so what this is is a shared

1074
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,280
services service between cisa and our

1075
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:25,599
federal government partners to enable

1076
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:28,160
the public like you to identify

1077
00:38:28,160 --> 00:38:29,680
vulnerabilities on our government

1078
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:32,079
websites and mobile applications and to

1079
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:33,760
enable a place where they can be taken

1080
00:38:33,760 --> 00:38:36,880
in and triaged and routed to ensure

1081
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,720
that we can rapidly

1082
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:40,320
leverage those vulnerabilities that you

1083
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:41,839
have given us to mitigate those

1084
00:38:41,839 --> 00:38:44,000
vulnerabilities on networks to ensure

1085
00:38:44,000 --> 00:38:45,760
the security of internet accessible

1086
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,040
systems so

1087
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:49,920
hugely important capabilities so

1088
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:51,680
i know what you're thinking right

1089
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:53,440
in addition to helping defend your

1090
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,760
nation and secure the cyber security

1091
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:58,320
ecosystem what's the value in partnering

1092
00:38:58,320 --> 00:39:00,720
with these sysa people so

1093
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:02,160
let me help you with that now i've only

1094
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,560
been here for three and a half weeks but

1095
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:06,960
i have seen cisa grow and transform over

1096
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:08,800
the last four and a half years as a

1097
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,640
senior technology and cyber security

1098
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,480
leader in the private sector and i want

1099
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:14,079
to give you three reasons and if i come

1100
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:16,079
back next year i can probably give you

1101
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:19,599
many more but the first one is context

1102
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,920
we can provide context to what you are

1103
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,560
seeing on your network and as we know

1104
00:39:24,560 --> 00:39:27,359
context is for kings

1105
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:29,359
given where we are placed and our

1106
00:39:29,359 --> 00:39:31,280
relationships with the intel community

1107
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,720
of the law enforcement community

1108
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:34,880
industry the federal government we

1109
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:36,960
capture a holistic view of the threat

1110
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:39,040
landscape that we can provide to you to

1111
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:40,640
enable your understanding and what's

1112
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,880
more given our role in helping to

1113
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,640
protect and defend federal civilian

1114
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:47,680
executive branch networks we have a very

1115
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:50,400
large and unique cache of data

1116
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:52,640
that we synthesize and analyze to help

1117
00:39:52,640 --> 00:39:55,520
put out actionable products and guidance

1118
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,440
so this picture that we're able to bring

1119
00:39:57,440 --> 00:40:00,000
together helps us enable you to

1120
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
understand suspicious activity on your

1121
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,000
network so that you can rapidly respond

1122
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,400
to it and mitigate it so thing number

1123
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:07,839
one context

1124
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:09,839
thing two i mentioned the work that we

1125
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:12,000
did over the past eight months and

1126
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,880
for years before that to send out

1127
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:17,119
expert cyber incident response teams to

1128
00:40:17,119 --> 00:40:19,839
help victims recover from cyber attacks

1129
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:21,440
and we stand by

1130
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:23,760
to help you if you need it now much of

1131
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,240
the data that we get from responding to

1132
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:28,560
these incidents is anonymized and we can

1133
00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:29,680
use that

1134
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:32,000
very importantly to help warn other

1135
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:33,839
potential victims so that they don't get

1136
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,200
attacked

1137
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,920
this ability to share information as

1138
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:40,720
early warning is incredibly important to

1139
00:40:40,720 --> 00:40:42,800
helping us all defend the cyber

1140
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,319
ecosystem and here's why i want to get

1141
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:47,040
on a little bit of my cyber soap box and

1142
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,119
talk about these hackney terms right we

1143
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:51,200
all know them the bumper stickers in

1144
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:54,000
cyber public private partnerships

1145
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:56,960
information sharing will look my goal is

1146
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,839
to really help breathe new life into

1147
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:02,720
these arguably hackneyed terms

1148
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,960
turning public-private partnership into

1149
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,560
public private operational collaboration

1150
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,800
and information sharing into something

1151
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,319
that is timely

1152
00:41:12,319 --> 00:41:14,720
and relevant and most importantly

1153
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:17,200
actionable the information we put out

1154
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:19,440
must be able to be used to help network

1155
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,520
defenders make a decision to strengthen

1156
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,480
your network so i ask for your feedback

1157
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,440
we and our partners work hard to try and

1158
00:41:27,440 --> 00:41:30,000
get out products that can be used by you

1159
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:32,160
so please help us refine those products

1160
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,520
so that they are

1161
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:38,240
valuable and indeed are actionable

1162
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:41,359
so third thing

1163
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:43,839
we given our mission as the

1164
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:46,319
civilian cyber defense agency and all of

1165
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:48,800
our important partnerships we have this

1166
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,880
incredible platform the federal

1167
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,200
government our close partners at the

1168
00:41:53,200 --> 00:41:56,240
state local tribal territorial level our

1169
00:41:56,240 --> 00:41:57,920
partners with critical infrastructure

1170
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:00,960
owners and operators all across industry

1171
00:42:00,960 --> 00:42:03,280
gives this this fantastic platform where

1172
00:42:03,280 --> 00:42:05,280
we can come together and share

1173
00:42:05,280 --> 00:42:08,000
cyber best practices and we can plan and

1174
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:09,920
we can exercise

1175
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:11,680
against the most significant cyber

1176
00:42:11,680 --> 00:42:12,640
threats

1177
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:14,720
to the nation

1178
00:42:14,720 --> 00:42:16,720
and on that note

1179
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:18,960
i am super excited today

1180
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:21,839
to announce that sissa is launching the

1181
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:22,720
joint

1182
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:25,410
cyber defense collaborative

1183
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:38,720
[Music]

1184
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,920
[Applause]

1185
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:42,800
[Music]

1186
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,359
okay for those of you seinfeld fans that

1187
00:42:45,359 --> 00:42:47,440
was the elaine dance so

1188
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:49,280
look i wanted to call this thing the

1189
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:52,400
advanced cyber defense collaborative but

1190
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:54,640
the lawyers wouldn't let me but the jcdc

1191
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:56,640
i'm really excited to talk about it so

1192
00:42:56,640 --> 00:42:58,720
the jcdc was also the product of

1193
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,599
imagination of the fantastic cyberspace

1194
00:43:01,599 --> 00:43:04,240
solarium commission that was led by

1195
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,200
senator angus king and representative

1196
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,560
mike gallagher

1197
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,400
chris english our national cyber

1198
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,480
director was also a commissioner there

1199
00:43:12,480 --> 00:43:14,000
they have made a significant

1200
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,720
contribution to the security of the

1201
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,040
cyber of the cyber ecosystem into our

1202
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:21,040
national cyber strategy

1203
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,720
they came up with this idea of a

1204
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,400
planning office and then

1205
00:43:24,400 --> 00:43:26,400
the congress in particular the senate

1206
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,079
and the house homeland security

1207
00:43:28,079 --> 00:43:30,319
committees their incredible leadership

1208
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:32,880
as well as the leadership of congressman

1209
00:43:32,880 --> 00:43:35,920
jim langevin came up with this idea of

1210
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,680
bringing together the public sector and

1211
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:40,240
the private sector in a joint planning

1212
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:43,599
capability to help us build plans

1213
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:45,680
against the most significant cyber

1214
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:48,319
threats to our nation now i'm a retired

1215
00:43:48,319 --> 00:43:51,119
military officer so i like to quote dead

1216
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:52,160
generals

1217
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:53,599
and one of my favorite is general

1218
00:43:53,599 --> 00:43:56,560
eisenhower who said plans are nothing

1219
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:58,720
planning is everything and i really

1220
00:43:58,720 --> 00:44:00,400
believe that you have to come together

1221
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:02,240
and develop these plans

1222
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:04,480
with your stakeholders and partners you

1223
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:06,319
got to plan in peace time so you're

1224
00:44:06,319 --> 00:44:08,800
ready in wartime

1225
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:11,520
so the whole idea of this jcdc is to

1226
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:13,839
bring together our partners to do four

1227
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:16,400
key things first

1228
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,560
to share insight so that we create a

1229
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:20,480
common operating picture a shared

1230
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,160
situational awareness of the threat

1231
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:23,680
environment

1232
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:26,480
so that we understand it better too

1233
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,839
to develop

1234
00:44:27,839 --> 00:44:30,079
whole of nation comprehensive cyber

1235
00:44:30,079 --> 00:44:32,160
defense plans to deal with the most

1236
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:34,160
significant threats to the nation to

1237
00:44:34,160 --> 00:44:36,079
include significant threats to our

1238
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:38,240
critical infrastructure

1239
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,560
three to exercise these plans because

1240
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,560
again you've got to exercise in peace

1241
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:44,800
time to be prepared for wartime you

1242
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,480
can't make a friend when you need a

1243
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:48,800
friend and then finally to work together

1244
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,760
to implement these cyber defense

1245
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:55,200
plans into actual operations and make

1246
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:57,200
sure that we can do that to reduce risk

1247
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,720
to the nation

1248
00:44:58,720 --> 00:45:00,400
so to some extent some of these

1249
00:45:00,400 --> 00:45:02,319
activities are already going on across

1250
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:03,440
the federal government but they're

1251
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:05,920
happening largely in stovepipe so the

1252
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,000
idea is we bring together our partners

1253
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:09,599
and the government and our private

1254
00:45:09,599 --> 00:45:11,760
sector partners together to really

1255
00:45:11,760 --> 00:45:14,160
mature this planning capability

1256
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,079
and that means bringing together our

1257
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:17,760
partners in the department of defense

1258
00:45:17,760 --> 00:45:19,599
our u.s cyber command partners our

1259
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:21,280
partners in the intel community the

1260
00:45:21,280 --> 00:45:23,839
national security agency our partners in

1261
00:45:23,839 --> 00:45:26,000
the law enforcement community like our

1262
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,599
our great friends in the federal bureau

1263
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,680
of investigation bringing bringing them

1264
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,839
all together so that we can make sure

1265
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:34,319
that we are aligning

1266
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:36,720
their operations and their

1267
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:38,720
talents and capabilities and authorities

1268
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:41,119
to support the nation's cyber defense

1269
00:45:41,119 --> 00:45:43,920
activities it also means being able to

1270
00:45:43,920 --> 00:45:46,240
leverage the power of the federal

1271
00:45:46,240 --> 00:45:48,640
government so there are sector risk

1272
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,240
management agencies and these are

1273
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:51,760
departments and agencies in the federal

1274
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:54,240
government that have very specific

1275
00:45:54,240 --> 00:45:56,400
expertise about each of the critical

1276
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,319
infrastructure sectors

1277
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:02,240
so the energy department treasury the

1278
00:46:02,240 --> 00:46:04,319
environmental protection agency health

1279
00:46:04,319 --> 00:46:05,920
and human services the department of

1280
00:46:05,920 --> 00:46:08,160
transportation the transportation

1281
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:11,040
security administration

1282
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,960
the food and drug administration the

1283
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:15,520
government services administration all

1284
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,359
of these sector experts that come

1285
00:46:17,359 --> 00:46:18,319
together

1286
00:46:18,319 --> 00:46:21,599
lend incredible knowledge about how to

1287
00:46:21,599 --> 00:46:24,160
operate uh critical infrastructure and

1288
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,839
then of course those on the front line

1289
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:28,000
the actual critical infrastructure

1290
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,079
owners and operators can come to the

1291
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:32,000
table as well share that planning

1292
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:34,079
expertise so we can come together and

1293
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:36,400
develop real plans to enable us to

1294
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:39,200
defend the nation and cyber

1295
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:41,040
and on that note

1296
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:44,400
i am also very very excited to announce

1297
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:46,800
our initial set of key partners in the

1298
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:48,640
jcdc

1299
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:49,920
crowdstrike

1300
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:51,440
palo alto

1301
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:52,720
fireeye

1302
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,079
microsoft

1303
00:46:54,079 --> 00:46:55,040
google

1304
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:59,040
amazon web services a t verizon and

1305
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,079
lumen have all chosen to work with the

1306
00:47:02,079 --> 00:47:04,880
federal government in the jcdc to help

1307
00:47:04,880 --> 00:47:07,680
us come together and plan against the

1308
00:47:07,680 --> 00:47:10,160
most serious cyber threats to the nation

1309
00:47:10,160 --> 00:47:12,640
our two initial focus areas

1310
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:15,040
first one won't surprise you

1311
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:17,200
efforts to combat ransomware

1312
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:19,599
the second one is efforts to develop a

1313
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:21,280
planning framework

1314
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:24,160
to respond to cyber incidents on cloud

1315
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:25,280
providers

1316
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,359
so we're very very excited about the

1317
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:28,960
jcdc

1318
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,040
if you are interested in joining us

1319
00:47:31,040 --> 00:47:33,200
please let us know we really want to

1320
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,720
partner together for the collective

1321
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,960
defense of the nation so that was thing

1322
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:40,000
one thing two

1323
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:42,400
help us build the cyber workforce of

1324
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,640
today and tomorrow

1325
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,720
everybody knows the statistics by this

1326
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,599
point in time 3.5 million unfilled

1327
00:47:49,599 --> 00:47:51,520
cybersecurity jobs around the world some

1328
00:47:51,520 --> 00:47:53,920
500 000 here in the us

1329
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:56,000
in my personal view this needs to be a

1330
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,559
highly ambitious national effort

1331
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:00,400
to be able to build the cyber security

1332
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:02,480
workforce to to deal with the highly

1333
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,880
digitized world that we live in

1334
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,960
let me tell you a little bit about what

1335
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,119
we're doing at cisa in case it gives you

1336
00:48:09,119 --> 00:48:11,599
some ideas to partner with us or to do

1337
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:13,200
some things on your own to help with

1338
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:15,200
this problem first we have great

1339
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,440
relationships with academia as a path to

1340
00:48:17,440 --> 00:48:20,480
a cyber security career in particular we

1341
00:48:20,480 --> 00:48:21,599
partner

1342
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:23,200
with our federal government partners for

1343
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:24,800
the scholarship to take advantage of the

1344
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:27,040
scholarship for service which provides

1345
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,040
scholarships to students for cyber

1346
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:30,800
security careers in exchange for

1347
00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:32,640
government service and i got to meet

1348
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,640
with a bunch of our interns last week

1349
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:36,960
and if you met with them you would be

1350
00:48:36,960 --> 00:48:39,040
pretty excited about the future of cyber

1351
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,480
security

1352
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:42,800
but i think problem programs like this

1353
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,480
really need to be scaled significantly

1354
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,280
we're also doing a lot of work in the

1355
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:51,599
k-12 space which is important to me as a

1356
00:48:51,599 --> 00:48:52,800
mom

1357
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,119
we help build cyber security curricula

1358
00:48:55,119 --> 00:48:57,440
we've provided it to 26 000 teachers

1359
00:48:57,440 --> 00:48:59,839
around the country helping to impact

1360
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:02,960
and influence 3 million students

1361
00:49:02,960 --> 00:49:05,280
next year we are aggressively focusing

1362
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:07,359
on providing the curricula to title one

1363
00:49:07,359 --> 00:49:08,559
schools

1364
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:10,480
to students with disabilities and to

1365
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,400
historically black colleges and

1366
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:14,640
universities very excited about that so

1367
00:49:14,640 --> 00:49:16,880
that's the academic pathways

1368
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:18,880
to reskilling

1369
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,559
so we are working on a program to

1370
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:22,000
provide

1371
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:23,440
training to

1372
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,280
federal professionals who are not cyber

1373
00:49:25,280 --> 00:49:27,359
security people who want to be

1374
00:49:27,359 --> 00:49:29,040
entry-level cyber security people and

1375
00:49:29,040 --> 00:49:30,800
putting them through a 12-month training

1376
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:32,160
program

1377
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,559
i think this is really important really

1378
00:49:34,559 --> 00:49:36,079
outside the federal government as well

1379
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:38,000
if you think about how many people lost

1380
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:39,920
their jobs over the past 18 months due

1381
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,319
to covid and the need we have for cyber

1382
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:44,000
security professionals so i think this

1383
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:46,240
is one program that we should figure out

1384
00:49:46,240 --> 00:49:48,640
how to scale not just for government but

1385
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,079
outside of government as well these

1386
00:49:50,079 --> 00:49:52,640
reskilling retraining opportunities

1387
00:49:52,640 --> 00:49:55,359
three we just issued a grant last week

1388
00:49:55,359 --> 00:49:58,400
to non-profits who are interested

1389
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:01,359
in identifying and developing unrealized

1390
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:03,680
cyber talent in our under served

1391
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:05,200
communities

1392
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,680
now a particular passion of mine is

1393
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:10,480
developing diverse organizations i

1394
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:13,200
honestly believe that organizations that

1395
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:15,280
we build particularly in technology and

1396
00:50:15,280 --> 00:50:17,839
cyber security must reflect the

1397
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:20,400
incredible diversity of our nation

1398
00:50:20,400 --> 00:50:22,720
diversity in gender

1399
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:25,599
and ethnicity and sexual orientation in

1400
00:50:25,599 --> 00:50:26,720
education

1401
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:28,800
and background all translates into

1402
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,200
diversity of thought and that helps us

1403
00:50:31,200 --> 00:50:34,640
solve our most complicated puzzles

1404
00:50:34,640 --> 00:50:36,640
better and faster

1405
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:40,880
that incredible diversity helps us

1406
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:42,960
be able to address these problems much

1407
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,520
more collaboratively and effectively

1408
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:48,079
so the fourth thing we just issued a

1409
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:50,480
cyber security workforce guide and

1410
00:50:50,480 --> 00:50:51,920
essentially what this is is an

1411
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:54,720
interactive guide for federal federal

1412
00:50:54,720 --> 00:50:56,800
workers they can download it and look

1413
00:50:56,800 --> 00:50:58,400
for no-cost opportunities for

1414
00:50:58,400 --> 00:51:00,319
professional development so the whole

1415
00:51:00,319 --> 00:51:03,040
idea is we make cyber security careers

1416
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:06,160
more accessible so that more people can

1417
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:09,520
see themselves in cyber

1418
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,160
and then finally another thing i am

1419
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:13,839
super excited about

1420
00:51:13,839 --> 00:51:15,680
we are hosting

1421
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:18,800
uh the president's cup cyber security

1422
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:23,640
competition for the third year in a row

1423
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:31,839
[Music]

1424
00:51:31,839 --> 00:51:34,720
shall we compete registration opens

1425
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,680
august 2021

1426
00:51:37,680 --> 00:51:39,599
all right i didn't subject you to my

1427
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:41,760
awkward elaine dance at that point in

1428
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:42,559
time

1429
00:51:42,559 --> 00:51:44,559
um but this is actually really exciting

1430
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:46,960
i hope you get a chance to see my

1431
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:49,280
teammate harry mortoz's presentation on

1432
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,680
the president's cup cyber competition

1433
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,400
essentially what this does is it tries

1434
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:57,280
to identify the best cyber talent in the

1435
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:59,040
federal government

1436
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,960
from the military to civilian coming

1437
00:52:00,960 --> 00:52:03,200
together to compete

1438
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:06,480
on labs and virtual exercises

1439
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:08,079
and we outsource these are all open

1440
00:52:08,079 --> 00:52:10,480
source available so if you want to do

1441
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,920
something similar

1442
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:13,680
hold competitions

1443
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,839
or challenges you can use all of that

1444
00:52:15,839 --> 00:52:18,000
information to build your own but we are

1445
00:52:18,000 --> 00:52:19,760
very excited about our third year of the

1446
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,040
competition uh so check it out and join

1447
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:24,720
uh if you can

1448
00:52:24,720 --> 00:52:26,800
so these are just a few examples what

1449
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,640
we're doing uh of what we're doing at

1450
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,559
cisa to help build the cyber workforce

1451
00:52:30,559 --> 00:52:33,520
but as i said at the outset i believe

1452
00:52:33,520 --> 00:52:36,400
we need to be much much more ambitious

1453
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:37,599
about this

1454
00:52:37,599 --> 00:52:41,040
and innovative about figuring out how to

1455
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,280
inform and educate and really inspire

1456
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,440
the next generation of cyber security

1457
00:52:45,440 --> 00:52:48,800
professionals from the youngest of ages

1458
00:52:48,800 --> 00:52:50,480
you know that will both

1459
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:53,040
inspire these diverse pipelines of cyber

1460
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,440
security professionals but it will also

1461
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:57,119
help give people the knowledge they need

1462
00:52:57,119 --> 00:52:58,720
to defend themselves in this very

1463
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:01,200
complicated cyber threat environment

1464
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:02,800
anybody who knows me knows i'm a bit of

1465
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,160
a space nut

1466
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:06,000
and i really believe we need to treat

1467
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:08,160
this problem like the pioneers of space

1468
00:53:08,160 --> 00:53:10,640
did decades ago again a national

1469
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:12,800
ambitious effort and i'm tracking a

1470
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,200
couple cool things that are out there uh

1471
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,119
but i hope to learn more a couple things

1472
00:53:17,119 --> 00:53:19,119
that i know of um

1473
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:21,520
creating a cyber core akin to the peace

1474
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:22,720
corps

1475
00:53:22,720 --> 00:53:24,800
efforts by the new america foundation in

1476
00:53:24,800 --> 00:53:27,040
cyber florida to focus on cyber

1477
00:53:27,040 --> 00:53:28,880
citizenship essentially to create

1478
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:30,880
resilience to online threats

1479
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:33,520
misinformation and disinformation

1480
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,520
a great program by the national cyber

1481
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:37,359
scholarship foundation that has set

1482
00:53:37,359 --> 00:53:39,440
aside two million dollars in

1483
00:53:39,440 --> 00:53:41,680
scholarships for high school students

1484
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:43,280
and college students don't need any

1485
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:44,800
cyber security background at all they

1486
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:46,760
play a game at

1487
00:53:46,760 --> 00:53:49,200
cyberstartamerica.org starts in october

1488
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,040
to see if they have that highly

1489
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:54,559
technical talent needed to succeed

1490
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:57,280
in cyber security and the whole idea is

1491
00:53:57,280 --> 00:53:59,760
to be able to create twenty five

1492
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,800
thousand uh high-end highly technical

1493
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:04,880
highly technical cyber professionals by

1494
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:08,480
the year 2025. so if you're interested

1495
00:54:08,480 --> 00:54:10,000
uh or if you know folks who are

1496
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:12,079
interested if your kids are interested

1497
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:14,640
uh play the game uh 800 scholarships

1498
00:54:14,640 --> 00:54:16,079
have already been given and it won't

1499
00:54:16,079 --> 00:54:18,000
surprise you that the students who've

1500
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,880
won scholarships are the puzzlers and

1501
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:22,800
those who are really good at games like

1502
00:54:22,800 --> 00:54:25,040
minecraft so these are just a few ideas

1503
00:54:25,040 --> 00:54:27,680
again we need to be super ambitious

1504
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:29,920
bring us your best ideas let's build the

1505
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:32,079
cyber workforce together

1506
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:34,880
and then finally help us secure the

1507
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:39,520
cyber ecosystem by joining team sissa

1508
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:42,319
not only will you get to work on

1509
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:44,880
very challenging problems but you'll get

1510
00:54:44,880 --> 00:54:47,040
to work with an amazing set of

1511
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:50,079
colleagues in a culture that prizes

1512
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:51,680
collaboration

1513
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:54,640
and teamwork and trust and transparency

1514
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,119
and ownership and empowerment

1515
00:54:57,119 --> 00:54:59,760
and innovation and inclusion

1516
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:02,160
my goal is to make cisa the world's

1517
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,720
premier cyber and infrastructure defense

1518
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:08,240
agency i ask you i invite you to join me

1519
00:55:08,240 --> 00:55:10,559
in that important endeavor

1520
00:55:10,559 --> 00:55:12,240
we're on the front lines of some of the

1521
00:55:12,240 --> 00:55:14,079
most important and challenging and

1522
00:55:14,079 --> 00:55:16,960
fascinating work there is from hunting

1523
00:55:16,960 --> 00:55:19,680
on networks for suspicious activity to

1524
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:21,520
identifying

1525
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:22,880
vulnerabilities and critical

1526
00:55:22,880 --> 00:55:25,280
infrastructures to building a modern and

1527
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,480
defensible federal cyber ecosystem to

1528
00:55:28,480 --> 00:55:29,839
working with our state and local

1529
00:55:29,839 --> 00:55:32,240
officials to help secure election

1530
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:33,760
infrastructure to being on the front

1531
00:55:33,760 --> 00:55:36,400
lines of the largest cyber incident

1532
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:38,559
response in federal history in the wake

1533
00:55:38,559 --> 00:55:40,559
of solar winds

1534
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:42,400
pretty incredible mission to be a part

1535
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,920
of and

1536
00:55:43,920 --> 00:55:47,280
you'll be with exceptional teammates

1537
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:49,040
one great program

1538
00:55:49,040 --> 00:55:50,960
from last year was we were able to bring

1539
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,799
in experts from the private sector as

1540
00:55:52,799 --> 00:55:54,880
part of the cares act to help with

1541
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,359
coveted response so one teammate kendra

1542
00:55:57,359 --> 00:55:59,920
martin joined us from the private sector

1543
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,000
and has coordinated a multi-agency

1544
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:04,400
effort to help protect the coven 19

1545
00:56:04,400 --> 00:56:07,680
vaccine supply chain from development

1546
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:10,000
to shipping to distribution

1547
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,720
kendra answered the call to her nation

1548
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:14,559
and has helped to make us collectively

1549
00:56:14,559 --> 00:56:17,520
safer so again being a part of team

1550
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:18,799
system means

1551
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:20,240
really challenging

1552
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:21,920
and fun problems

1553
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,400
uh really great teammates

1554
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,400
in a collaborative culture where you get

1555
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,839
to use your imagination every single day

1556
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:34,400
now behind me is a qr code

1557
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:36,400
you will probably know that the federal

1558
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:39,119
government does not have the easiest

1559
00:56:39,119 --> 00:56:42,000
process to navigate for hiring so we are

1560
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:43,920
trying to change that i'm very focused

1561
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:46,319
on this issue but if you see that qr

1562
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:48,559
code there and i promise you this is not

1563
00:56:48,559 --> 00:56:49,839
a rick roll

1564
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:51,760
you can go to that qr code and you can

1565
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:54,319
submit your resume to come be part of

1566
00:56:54,319 --> 00:56:56,960
team sysa so i ask you to think about

1567
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:59,280
doing that or provide that qr code to a

1568
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,440
friend who you think would be a great

1569
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:04,160
addition to our sisa teammates

1570
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,640
now i get it many of you have awesome

1571
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:08,480
jobs and that's terrific and you don't

1572
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:10,400
want to join team sis at this point so

1573
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,640
keep your options open but you may want

1574
00:57:12,640 --> 00:57:13,920
to join

1575
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:15,520
and do some other things to help us

1576
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:17,920
secure the cyber ecosystem

1577
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,440
you may want to join the critical

1578
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,240
infrastructure sector as a cyber expert

1579
00:57:22,240 --> 00:57:23,920
you may want to be a mentor in your

1580
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,240
local community for students who are

1581
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:29,200
interested in careers in cyber

1582
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,440
you can help us by being a cyber

1583
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,160
evangelist using your expertise to help

1584
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:36,559
people understand all of the basics that

1585
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:39,040
we need to do to secure our systems and

1586
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,400
our networks

1587
00:57:40,400 --> 00:57:42,480
we know that over 90 percent of

1588
00:57:42,480 --> 00:57:44,799
successful cyber attacks start with the

1589
00:57:44,799 --> 00:57:46,640
phishing email

1590
00:57:46,640 --> 00:57:48,960
so it's the basics of cyber hygiene

1591
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:50,799
multi-factor authentication strong

1592
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:53,119
passwords keeping your software updated

1593
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:54,559
patching your vulnerabilities these

1594
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:56,000
basics

1595
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:58,079
can really help us strengthen the

1596
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:00,319
security of the ecosystem so help us get

1597
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:02,480
the word out on that

1598
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,240
and then finally if you're a business

1599
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,680
leader

1600
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,240
or working with your ceo or if you're a

1601
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,880
ceo make sure

1602
00:58:10,880 --> 00:58:13,920
that you are treating cyber security

1603
00:58:13,920 --> 00:58:15,599
not the purview

1604
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:18,400
of the it girls

1605
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:22,000
but rather as a significant business

1606
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:23,680
risk

1607
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,359
it's incredibly important that

1608
00:58:25,359 --> 00:58:27,440
businesses from the highest level make

1609
00:58:27,440 --> 00:58:29,520
cyber security a top priority from the

1610
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:30,799
board level

1611
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:33,520
and that they empower and resource and

1612
00:58:33,520 --> 00:58:36,880
ensure that your cisos are getting what

1613
00:58:36,880 --> 00:58:38,160
they need

1614
00:58:38,160 --> 00:58:40,720
to effectively defend the network help

1615
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:42,400
us get that word out as well because

1616
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,720
that's incredibly important now this is

1617
00:58:44,720 --> 00:58:47,280
not an exhaustive set of ideas

1618
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:49,200
but it's really a starting point for our

1619
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:52,079
conversation around a partnership

1620
00:58:52,079 --> 00:58:53,920
now in closing

1621
00:58:53,920 --> 00:58:55,440
we've talked a bit talked a bit about

1622
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,760
some of the challenges in cyber

1623
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,359
but we've done a lot of work to this

1624
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:00,960
point i mean we should be pretty proud

1625
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:02,640
of ourselves of what we've been able to

1626
00:59:02,640 --> 00:59:04,480
accomplish but we also

1627
00:59:04,480 --> 00:59:06,720
need to be very pragmatic

1628
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:09,440
this is frankly a generational issue and

1629
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:11,680
somewhat of a persistent problem

1630
00:59:11,680 --> 00:59:13,440
but if we work together if we

1631
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:15,359
collaborate together

1632
00:59:15,359 --> 00:59:17,599
we can raise that cybersecurity baseline

1633
00:59:17,599 --> 00:59:18,960
and reduce

1634
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:20,640
that risk

1635
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:22,400
now throughout a career in cyber

1636
00:59:22,400 --> 00:59:24,720
security and counterterrorism i always

1637
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,640
get the same question

1638
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,599
jen what keeps you up at night

1639
00:59:29,599 --> 00:59:31,599
but i prefer to reframe that question

1640
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:33,119
it's not what keeps me up at night it's

1641
00:59:33,119 --> 00:59:35,359
what wakes me up in the morning and that

1642
00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:38,400
is the opportunity

1643
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:40,640
to work in a fantastic agency with

1644
00:59:40,640 --> 00:59:42,720
incredibly talented teammates on one of

1645
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:45,200
the most important

1646
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:47,920
missions to our national security and

1647
00:59:47,920 --> 00:59:50,400
the opportunity to solve

1648
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,799
some of our most complicated and

1649
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:55,440
important puzzles

1650
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:58,799
so i invite you to come partner with us

1651
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:00,720
for the collective cyber defense of our

1652
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:03,680
nation to help us defend today and

1653
01:00:03,680 --> 01:00:05,440
secure tomorrow

1654
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,200
thanks very much for your time and i

1655
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:11,799
look forward to working with all of you

1656
01:00:19,440 --> 01:00:21,359
thank you for your opening

1657
01:00:21,359 --> 01:00:23,520
comments jen uh i think they were pretty

1658
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:25,040
well received and i don't think there

1659
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,520
was a single topic you didn't cover

1660
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:28,559
so

1661
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:30,240
fantastic

1662
01:00:30,240 --> 01:00:32,079
we don't have a whole lot of time left

1663
01:00:32,079 --> 01:00:34,079
but i do have some questions for you and

1664
01:00:34,079 --> 01:00:35,520
hopefully i will have time to get a

1665
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:38,720
question from the audience as well

1666
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:40,559
so first off thank you

1667
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:42,400
and

1668
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:44,480
i think one of the cornerstones around

1669
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:47,119
what you're asking is sort of the mutual

1670
01:00:47,119 --> 01:00:49,200
trust between the government and civil

1671
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:51,520
society or government and business

1672
01:00:51,520 --> 01:00:52,720
and so

1673
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:54,160
um

1674
01:00:54,160 --> 01:00:55,920
trust is always sort of on short supply

1675
01:00:55,920 --> 01:00:57,839
especially over the last few years what

1676
01:00:57,839 --> 01:01:00,000
what is sort of your strategy or how are

1677
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:01,839
you going to approach how do you build

1678
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:03,440
trust with this community i mean you

1679
01:01:03,440 --> 01:01:04,960
have to demonstrate

1680
01:01:04,960 --> 01:01:07,520
your skill you have to demonstrate trust

1681
01:01:07,520 --> 01:01:08,960
what are your thoughts

1682
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:10,720
yeah thank you well first of all thanks

1683
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:13,040
so much for the opportunity i'm sorry i

1684
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,440
was not able to be out there in person

1685
01:01:15,440 --> 01:01:17,920
uh hopefully next year but it's been a

1686
01:01:17,920 --> 01:01:19,680
um a great honor to be a part of black

1687
01:01:19,680 --> 01:01:20,720
hat

1688
01:01:20,720 --> 01:01:22,079
you know you're absolutely right i think

1689
01:01:22,079 --> 01:01:24,559
the foundation for any ability to

1690
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:26,559
effectively collaborate is building that

1691
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:27,520
trust

1692
01:01:27,520 --> 01:01:29,280
and frankly jeff that's why i took a

1693
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:30,880
little bit of time at the front end so

1694
01:01:30,880 --> 01:01:32,799
that people understand more about me

1695
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:34,720
because i think it's hard to trust

1696
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:36,559
somebody that you don't know

1697
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:39,760
and it's really the foundation of why we

1698
01:01:39,760 --> 01:01:41,520
wanted to put together this joint cyber

1699
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,359
defense collaborative so we could bring

1700
01:01:43,359 --> 01:01:44,319
together

1701
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:46,240
key government partners with our key

1702
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:48,400
private sector partners who i have such

1703
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:50,400
an appreciation for having just spent

1704
01:01:50,400 --> 01:01:51,599
the last four and a half years in the

1705
01:01:51,599 --> 01:01:53,760
private sector i think if you work

1706
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:55,920
closely together if you solve problems

1707
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:58,640
together um you really be you you're

1708
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:00,559
able to create that trust and you know

1709
01:02:00,559 --> 01:02:02,559
sometimes it's getting a beer with

1710
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:04,960
somebody or talking over

1711
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,039
personal topics that helps to build that

1712
01:02:07,039 --> 01:02:08,640
so i think it's the foundation of any

1713
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:10,480
successful relationship with whether

1714
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:11,440
it's uh

1715
01:02:11,440 --> 01:02:13,680
your marriage uh or a uh or a

1716
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:16,559
collaboration uh with your partner so

1717
01:02:16,559 --> 01:02:18,880
trust is is foundational yeah i think

1718
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:20,559
it's really important because some

1719
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:22,000
people in government want you to trust

1720
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:23,680
the organization

1721
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,839
but in reality researchers we trust

1722
01:02:25,839 --> 01:02:27,760
people right you trust people you don't

1723
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:29,440
necessarily trust organizations and so

1724
01:02:29,440 --> 01:02:31,359
so that's really important that you're

1725
01:02:31,359 --> 01:02:33,760
trying to to identify who you are and

1726
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:35,599
what you believe in and so so my next

1727
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:37,920
question then is

1728
01:02:37,920 --> 01:02:40,480
one of the big pitfalls um people run

1729
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:43,359
into is the going dark debate right it's

1730
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:46,000
really polarizing and and this sort of

1731
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,240
false dichotomy of privacy versus

1732
01:02:48,240 --> 01:02:50,000
security and it's not possible to have

1733
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,480
both at the same time so dhs has done a

1734
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:54,000
pretty good job of steering clear of the

1735
01:02:54,000 --> 01:02:55,520
going dark debate

1736
01:02:55,520 --> 01:02:56,960
but it's going to be asked of you at

1737
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:00,720
some point so any any thoughts

1738
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:02,160
yeah thanks for asking the question

1739
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:04,240
because i know it's hugely important um

1740
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,319
not just to this audience but really to

1741
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:08,400
everybody you know having spent the past

1742
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:09,920
four and a half years as a private

1743
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:12,079
citizen i have a strong view on this and

1744
01:03:12,079 --> 01:03:13,680
that's you know in particular as the

1745
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:16,400
assistant director um that we

1746
01:03:16,400 --> 01:03:18,799
have to have strong encryption to be

1747
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:19,920
able to

1748
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:22,400
ensure the defense of our networks it's

1749
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:24,400
foundational as everybody in this

1750
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:25,760
audience knows

1751
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:26,880
so

1752
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,400
i realize that there are other points of

1753
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:29,920
view across the government but i think

1754
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:31,359
as the assistant director and me

1755
01:03:31,359 --> 01:03:32,640
personally

1756
01:03:32,640 --> 01:03:35,200
i think strong encryption is absolutely

1757
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,280
fundamental for us to be able to do what

1758
01:03:37,280 --> 01:03:42,359
we need to do right on woo

1759
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:46,240
um and so my final question before i go

1760
01:03:46,240 --> 01:03:47,839
to the audience real quick is what do

1761
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:49,599
you think of your right mix of talent

1762
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:51,599
you talked about it briefly you know

1763
01:03:51,599 --> 01:03:53,520
it's sort of like you're adapting to

1764
01:03:53,520 --> 01:03:55,440
this new world do you think with these

1765
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:56,720
new authorities you're going to be able

1766
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,480
to get the right talent or people

1767
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:00,880
are interested in in serving the country

1768
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:02,640
uh through dhs or do you think that the

1769
01:04:02,640 --> 01:04:05,760
pool of private sector is too great

1770
01:04:05,760 --> 01:04:08,079
no i mean i i think i'm going to be

1771
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:11,200
relentlessly focused on this um so

1772
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:12,640
you know if i don't if i don't get it

1773
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:15,200
done i it won't be for lack of effort uh

1774
01:04:15,200 --> 01:04:17,039
the government hiring process is

1775
01:04:17,039 --> 01:04:20,319
byzantine and uh really kind of a mess

1776
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:22,480
and you know as much as we're able to

1777
01:04:22,480 --> 01:04:24,240
bring in great talent for people who

1778
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:26,880
want to defend their country and to be

1779
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:28,559
part of this incredible mission there is

1780
01:04:28,559 --> 01:04:30,960
a huge competition out there and so

1781
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,480
we're going to do a couple things first

1782
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:33,520
of all there's we're going to be

1783
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:35,520
implementing shortly the cyber talent

1784
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:37,680
management system and i hope that that

1785
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:39,039
will help

1786
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:40,480
bring in people because you'll be able

1787
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:42,799
to pay closer to market

1788
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:44,480
i am personally going to work with my

1789
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:47,039
team to be able to accelerate the hiring

1790
01:04:47,039 --> 01:04:49,280
process i am really really focused on

1791
01:04:49,280 --> 01:04:51,760
that and also to look for

1792
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,680
opportunities where we can bring people

1793
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:55,200
in from the private sector it doesn't

1794
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,839
need to be a career but bring people in

1795
01:04:57,839 --> 01:04:59,839
for a year two years to really help

1796
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:02,079
strengthen the connective tissue between

1797
01:05:02,079 --> 01:05:04,160
public and private so i think we need to

1798
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:06,960
look for creative ideas i'm also looking

1799
01:05:06,960 --> 01:05:09,680
to bring in a chief people officer

1800
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:11,359
who can help me create that talent

1801
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:14,480
management ecosystem uh but also as i

1802
01:05:14,480 --> 01:05:16,319
think we both appreciate jeff to build

1803
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:18,000
that culture that i talked about of

1804
01:05:18,000 --> 01:05:20,160
collaboration and teamwork and ownership

1805
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,799
and empowerment and trust the trust and

1806
01:05:22,799 --> 01:05:24,799
transparency piece i think are so

1807
01:05:24,799 --> 01:05:26,720
incredibly important

1808
01:05:26,720 --> 01:05:28,400
i'm just happy that you called it a

1809
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:31,599
chief person officer not a human capital

1810
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:35,039
officer that was purposeful

1811
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,799
right on okay let's have time that's a

1812
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:38,480
question from the audience if anybody

1813
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:41,359
where i can see you have a question

1814
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:42,400
i'll

1815
01:05:42,400 --> 01:05:45,839
ask it if it's not crazy

1816
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:49,280
i'll take crazy questions

1817
01:05:49,280 --> 01:05:52,400
okay crazy right here

1818
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:55,959
[Music]

1819
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:02,880
oh okay

1820
01:06:02,880 --> 01:06:06,000
okay um uh you're uh um the question is

1821
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:08,000
how would you draw a distinction between

1822
01:06:08,000 --> 01:06:10,559
yourself and your predecessor uh

1823
01:06:10,559 --> 01:06:12,880
director krebs in maybe your your style

1824
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:15,440
or approach or or new vision uh in the

1825
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:18,400
direction of the of the department

1826
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,960
i think chris did a fantastic job great

1827
01:06:20,960 --> 01:06:23,280
he founded the agency

1828
01:06:23,280 --> 01:06:25,760
he shepherded it shepherded it through a

1829
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:27,920
really turbulent time the election

1830
01:06:27,920 --> 01:06:29,200
period

1831
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:31,119
covid and

1832
01:06:31,119 --> 01:06:33,039
i just i think the world of chris krebs

1833
01:06:33,039 --> 01:06:35,760
and he remains a great friend i think

1834
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:38,319
there's the the founder right and then

1835
01:06:38,319 --> 01:06:41,200
there's the next ceo that comes in and

1836
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,359
transforms continues the transformation

1837
01:06:43,359 --> 01:06:45,680
of the organization so i'm gonna be

1838
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:48,160
