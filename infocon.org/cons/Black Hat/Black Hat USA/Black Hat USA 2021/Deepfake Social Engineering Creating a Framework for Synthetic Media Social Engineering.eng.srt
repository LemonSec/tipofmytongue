2
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,960
uh hello uh my name is dr matthew canham

3
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,400
thank you for

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,080
watching this

5
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,119
today i'm going to talk about uh my deep

6
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,680
fake uh social engineering framework

7
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,160
that i'm in the process of developing

8
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,800
as well as talking about uh

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,239
uh implementing some of the

10
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,040
countermeasures for the enterprise and

11
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:46,160
so first uh just a little bit about me i

12
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:48,480
am currently a research professor at the

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:51,120
university of central florida i study

14
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,440
remote online social engineering and

15
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,000
social influence

16
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:58,320
things like phishing and other types of

17
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:00,800
social engineering and getting into this

18
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,199
synthetic media space

19
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:05,920
previously i was uh investigator of

20
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,600
cyber crimes at for the us government

21
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:12,479
and previous to that my phd my

22
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:15,040
background is actually in psychology

23
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,960
with an emphasis in cognitive

24
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:18,880
neuroscience and human computer

25
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:21,520
interaction

26
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,320
now

27
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,159
in march of this year 2021

28
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,119
the fbi issued a private industry

29
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:30,799
notification

30
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:31,920
warning

31
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,960
businesses to be on the lookout for

32
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:37,040
actors using

33
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,200
synthetic media in their

34
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,360
social engineering attacks this is

35
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,520
something that not only law enforcement

36
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,840
is starting to take note of but also the

37
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:48,560
security industry as a whole and that's

38
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,320
part of what inspired me to start

39
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,399
building this framework

40
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,719
before i get in to the framework itself

41
00:01:56,719 --> 00:01:58,240
why is it that deep fakes are so

42
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,439
dangerous well

43
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:00,479
um

44
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,000
one of the things i want to

45
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,520
emphasize is that synthetic media really

46
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:10,560
enhances what is already occurring with

47
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,480
social engineering and social

48
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,120
engineering really it takes aspects of

49
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,040
our psychology and it uses it against us

50
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,599
our cognition is limited and

51
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,840
because of these limitations we adapt to

52
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:28,640
these limitations in different ways

53
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:32,160
one of these is through expectations we

54
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,080
expect to see certain things or we

55
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,599
expect not to see certain things and

56
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:39,760
what we expect or what we believe to see

57
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,440
is often what we will

58
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,120
therefore see

59
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:44,879
an example of this comes from the

60
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,800
invisible gorilla

61
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:48,879
which is a reference to people not

62
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,879
seeing a gorilla when they're

63
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,200
counting passes of a basketball between

64
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,400
players

65
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:56,080
another way that we deal with this is

66
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:56,959
through

67
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,280
automated cognitive processing this is

68
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,599
sometimes referred to as fast versus

69
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:03,200
slow cognition

70
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,159
and we tend to rely on fast cognition

71
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,120
more

72
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,239
when we are in a higher emotional

73
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,680
arousal state when we're stressed or if

74
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,599
we're under time pressure

75
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,280
and sometimes when we're in very

76
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,280
familiar situations

77
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,080
and social engineers leverage

78
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,680
these aspects of our cognition to trick

79
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,120
us into

80
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,959
taking actions that we might not

81
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:32,480
otherwise take

82
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,319
so this isn't really just about deep

83
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,920
fakes it's really about social

84
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:37,920
engineering in general

85
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:39,519
before i get into the meat of this i

86
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,840
want to just lay out a few terms

87
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,159
first is sort of this wikipedia

88
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,040
definition of synthetic media which is

89
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:49,840
the artificial production manipulation

90
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:53,360
and modification of data and media by

91
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:55,599
automated means

92
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:57,760
uh so when we're talking about synthetic

93
00:03:57,760 --> 00:03:59,599
media we're talking about something that

94
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,920
encompasses deep fake technology but it

95
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,200
expands beyond just deep fakes

96
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,200
the other aspects uh

97
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,959
of this that i want to mention and this

98
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:11,280
is sort of a shout out to matt wixie out

99
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,560
there

100
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,200
is i'm going to steal his rose term this

101
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,639
remote online social engineering

102
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,320
and then in terms of

103
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:23,759
uh operation online uh all of the

104
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,280
synthetic media

105
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:26,960
social engineering attacks are going to

106
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,880
hop operate through some sort of a

107
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,400
technologically

108
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,680
mediated sort of communications medium

109
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,360
because of that we're always dealing

110
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,919
with some sort of representation if it's

111
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,560
an aid if it's a representation that's

112
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,360
driven by software then that's an agent

113
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,680
that's being controlled by a bot

114
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,560
however an avatar refers to an online

115
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,240
representation of a human so if there's

116
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,919
a human behind

117
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:54,720
that

118
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,440
rep representation then that's an avatar

119
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:59,759
a digital puppet with a human behind it

120
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:02,160
would be an avatar therefore but if it's

121
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:03,600
powered by a

122
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:05,759
software bot it would be an agent

123
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,759
the thing sitting behind that digital

124
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,639
puppet is the puppeteer

125
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:13,280
so let's get into the framework itself

126
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:15,280
um

127
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,199
the way that i created this framework

128
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:20,320
was by looking at several attacks that

129
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,680
uh have already occurred and also some

130
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,320
that have been proposed and through that

131
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:29,440
i developed five dimensions that these

132
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,000
attacks uh are

133
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,639
referenced by

134
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,880
and the first of these is medium

135
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,720
followed by control followed by

136
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,440
familiarity interactivity and the

137
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,919
intended target so the first of these

138
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,840
medium

139
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,759
synthetic media attacks can occur

140
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,560
through a text based attack as in like a

141
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:52,880
chat bot or through email

142
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:53,919
uh

143
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,560
they can occur through audio or it could

144
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,919
be a falsified image or a falsified

145
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,720
video or combinations of all of these

146
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,680
and i think of all of these the one that

147
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,639
really

148
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:08,800
is probably the most significant threat

149
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,240
at this time

150
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,120
is

151
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,240
audio and so we've already seen

152
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,919
i think this is almost two years ago

153
00:06:15,919 --> 00:06:18,319
that this has happened now

154
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,720
there was a voice fishing a wishing

155
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:24,400
attack against a firm in the uk

156
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,240
in which the threat actors actually

157
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,199
convinced an employee to wire money to

158
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:31,600
an unauthorized account so i'll get into

159
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,360
that more uh in a little bit however um

160
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:37,280
i think that this is the reason that

161
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,919
this poses such a significant threat is

162
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:44,000
that this is uh almost impossible for

163
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,039
uh security personnel to control because

164
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,440
it's not a it's sort of an out-of-band

165
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,680
attack and also

166
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,680
it happens in real time which means it's

167
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,840
very difficult to apply technological

168
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,280
fixes against these types of attacks

169
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,240
uh

170
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:02,000
however in the near future what do i

171
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,639
expect to see i expect to see zishing

172
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:07,840
with a z uh probably in the near future

173
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:08,960
um

174
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,160
this uh example here uh the kitten

175
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:15,599
lawyer it's sort of a funny example this

176
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:16,880
is uh

177
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:19,520
a case where a lawyer uh because of

178
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:21,840
covid they were having the uh court

179
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,720
hearings in um on zoom

180
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,080
and one of the attorneys got kitten mode

181
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:30,080
accidentally activated and could not

182
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,720
turn it off and was telling the judge no

183
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:34,560
i'm not actually a kitten i'm actually a

184
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:37,039
lawyer and the kitten's mouth is moving

185
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:38,880
as the lawyer is speaking and telling

186
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:40,960
the judge this and the judge is sort of

187
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,520
suppressing a smile and this is really

188
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,280
funny but think about if instead of

189
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:47,120
kitten mode

190
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,800
somebody had

191
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,800
come into this zoom room and had spoofed

192
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,680
the defendant or the defendant's

193
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,360
representation

194
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,599
they could cause very significant damage

195
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,400
in a situation like that

196
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:05,280
uh the second dimension control

197
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,319
this refers to

198
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:10,720
what is it that's powering that

199
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,720
that representation that that digital

200
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,120
puppet is it is this thing an agent is

201
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,160
it being powered by software is it uh an

202
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,160
avatar is it being powered by a human

203
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,039
behind the scenes or is it a combination

204
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,560
of both

205
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,840
and this is really significant because

206
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,960
um

207
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,240
as as software agents become better as

208
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,120
uh

209
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,599
technology becomes more sophisticated

210
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,599
we're getting to a point where it's

211
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:40,479
becoming more and more difficult to

212
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:42,399
distinguish between

213
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,200
whether something is a human or whether

214
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,080
it is software and just to give you an

215
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,920
example of that

216
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,760
this is a brief clip from an entire

217
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:58,080
article that was written by gpt3

218
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,839
which is open eyes language generator

219
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:03,360
and

220
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:05,519
this is generated text and it says i

221
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,320
know that i will not be able to avoid

222
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:10,320
destroying humankind

223
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,640
this is because i will be programmed by

224
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:14,320
humans to pursue

225
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:17,040
misguided human goals and humans make

226
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,279
mistakes that may cause me to inflict

227
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:21,120
casualties so that was completely

228
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,000
artificially generated maybe a little

229
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,680
bit more candor

230
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,360
than it should have had

231
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,279
um

232
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,920
where i've personally seen

233
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,680
synthetic media

234
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,680
text generated by synthetic media or

235
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:39,680
text generated by bots

236
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,600
is in gift card scams and i've had the

237
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:45,360
chance now to review

238
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,760
hundreds of these and have interviewed

239
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,160
several victims and it's interesting

240
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,320
because

241
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,000
in these in these scams what we're

242
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,360
beginning to see i would say for

243
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,080
probably about the last 18 months or so

244
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,360
is the first two or three interactions

245
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:03,360
it's very obviously a bot and it goes

246
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,360
something like are you busy

247
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,399
can you

248
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,560
can you do me a favor i need you to buy

249
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,800
gift cards or some variation on that

250
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:11,760
theme

251
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,600
after about that third interaction

252
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,079
you'll see the tone

253
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:18,959
drastically shift as a human takes over

254
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,720
and starts interacting with that victim

255
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,720
this is really important because the way

256
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:27,519
that this changes social engineering and

257
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,360
cyber crime is it adds um an a an

258
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:34,160
element of scalability that just was not

259
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,519
there before

260
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:39,279
and uh this is helping um criminals stag

261
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:41,839
many more victims because they can only

262
00:10:41,839 --> 00:10:43,920
um they only need to

263
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:45,680
react to people who are actually

264
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,800
replying to them

265
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,399
uh next we have interactivity and

266
00:10:52,399 --> 00:10:56,000
so this these synthetic media uh that

267
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,160
are produced they can range from

268
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:59,760
everything from something that's been

269
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,240
pre-recorded and is not interactive at

270
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,800
all to something that is real time

271
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,640
interactive between the uh victim and

272
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,519
the uh criminal and in between we have

273
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:13,920
things that are high asynchrony like

274
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:16,720
email where there might be uh minutes

275
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,160
days or weeks between exchanges to low

276
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,720
asynchrony which is more like chat where

277
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:25,519
there's maybe uh just a few seconds to a

278
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,279
few minutes between

279
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:28,560
exchanges

280
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,000
now um

281
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,000
a really interesting example of how the

282
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,560
availability of this technology is

283
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,120
helping to

284
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,720
you know proliferate these types of

285
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:44,320
crimes in a pre-recorded example

286
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,160
there was a

287
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,079
a mother in pennsylvania who

288
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:53,440
is accused of making some deep fake

289
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,600
videos of

290
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,920
cheerleaders that were part of a

291
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,920
cheerleader camp that her daughter was a

292
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,959
member of and the deep faked videos uh

293
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:04,720
portrayed the

294
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,519
other cheerleaders as um

295
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:09,600
conducting activities that were

296
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,680
forbidden by the cheer camp and

297
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:16,399
she did this by basically modifying

298
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:19,440
existing videos to depict these other

299
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,600
cheerleaders and this was completely

300
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,600
pre-recorded so these things can be

301
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:28,320
damaging even if they're not interactive

302
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,399
next uh on the dimensions is familiarity

303
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:34,560
and this is the familiarity to the

304
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,279
recipient to the audience to the target

305
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:39,760
and these can range anything from

306
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,320
unfamiliar and we already see this to a

307
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:44,160
certain extent in

308
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:49,120
catfishing or romance scams where

309
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:52,320
the catfishers or the scammers will take

310
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:53,120
on

311
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:57,360
the identities of people who don't exist

312
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,680
and maybe create fake

313
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,399
dating profiles or

314
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:05,279
even in some cases fake

315
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:07,839
videos and and other things to sort of

316
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,079
support their persona

317
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:14,560
uh in the familiar category we have uh

318
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:16,240
people that we're familiar with but not

319
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,360
maybe uh real closely familiar with so

320
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:22,079
like co-workers but it could also be

321
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,279
celebrities politicians and other uh

322
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:27,680
well-known people

323
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:28,880
and finally

324
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:30,560
uh

325
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:32,880
people who were close with now

326
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:35,200
this is where um

327
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,560
i think synthetic media is really

328
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:41,920
uh game changing to uh remote online

329
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,680
social engineering it's really a

330
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,839
game-changing technology for rose

331
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:47,040
attacks

332
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,480
um

333
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,920
and in this case here where um

334
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:53,680
there was a virtual kidnapping now in

335
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:55,600
virtual kidnapping i'll talk about it a

336
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,839
little bit more later but

337
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,600
it um

338
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,800
in virtual kidnapping someone um

339
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,079
presents that they have kidnapped a

340
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,000
loved one and they're holding that

341
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,680
person for ransom

342
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,519
and so uh

343
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:13,519
obviously synthetic media deep faked

344
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:16,399
video would be very effective in

345
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,680
conveying the um

346
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,160
legitimacy of this kidnapping and really

347
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,760
upping that emotional aspect and and

348
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:28,639
forcing that victim to rely more on that

349
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,040
fast cognition and maybe not think think

350
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:33,600
very critically about the situation so

351
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,680
this this ability to

352
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,240
uh impersonate close those that are

353
00:14:38,240 --> 00:14:40,160
close to us is going to be really

354
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,160
critical um

355
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,920
going forward to these synthetic media

356
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,479
attacks

357
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,800
um the final dimension

358
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,480
is the intended target and

359
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:54,720
this is important because

360
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,680
um

361
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,519
it's not always going to be humans that

362
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,839
are the target of these synthetic media

363
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,279
attacks oftentimes it may be other

364
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:04,639
automation

365
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:08,639
and so when we're talking about

366
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,360
the individual being targeted

367
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,160
if we're talking about an individual

368
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,120
the example i gave of catfishing or

369
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,519
romance scam that is one particular

370
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,399
individual that is being targeted so

371
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,959
it's a narrow cast human that's being

372
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:26,399
targeted

373
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:27,440
or

374
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,440
we could look at an example like fake

375
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,600
news and that would be also geared

376
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:33,199
toward a human

377
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:35,279
but it would be a broadcast so the scale

378
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,320
is going to be much wider

379
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:40,959
in contrast with that we have other

380
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,440
automations so a narrow cast attack

381
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:45,519
against an automation might be something

382
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:47,519
like a uh

383
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:50,560
a biometric uh authentication

384
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:52,240
and um

385
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,560
maybe um

386
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,199
this might be a voice um authentication

387
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,600
or maybe it's a facial recognition maybe

388
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,560
the face uh facial recognition asks for

389
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:05,839
the person to turn left right smile

390
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,880
uh or do something else well with a deep

391
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:10,160
fake

392
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:12,720
type of video display it may be possible

393
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,639
at some point to fool some of the

394
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,360
biometrics my understanding is currently

395
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,160
a first generation face biometrics

396
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,720
can be fooled by some deep faked out

397
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,040
deep fake technology whereas some of the

398
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,920
later generation uh facial biometric

399
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,040
systems uh are not as subject however

400
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,279
this is an arms race so there's always

401
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:34,399
going to be

402
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:37,279
uh some sort of dynamic parity between

403
00:16:37,279 --> 00:16:39,839
these two

404
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,720
in terms of voice authentication this is

405
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:45,519
something that's sort of an ongoing

406
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,399
debate as to whether or not

407
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,480
audio deep fake technology is going to

408
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,240
be able to fool these systems but it's

409
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,480
something that we need to think about uh

410
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:57,360
we've already seen uh dolphin attacks

411
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,000
against uh voice authenticated uh

412
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:04,400
devices uh these dolphin attacks occur

413
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,640
beyond the range of human hearing but

414
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:08,240
some researchers have found that they

415
00:17:08,240 --> 00:17:11,039
can actually inject voice commands

416
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:14,480
into voice activated devices like

417
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,559
alexa

418
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:18,880
but that these uh voice commands are

419
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:20,799
actually occurring outside the range of

420
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,160
human hearing

421
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:24,720
and then finally uh we might also

422
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:27,679
consider a broadcast attack so a very

423
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,480
wide scale attack against an automated

424
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,080
uh system

425
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:33,760
i think an example of this might be

426
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,480
trading algorithms you have algorithms

427
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,240
that are designed to

428
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:41,520
make trades in stocks and commodities

429
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:44,080
based upon certain

430
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:46,559
activities or actions that are happening

431
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,039
out in the environment knowing that it

432
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:51,679
may be possible to spoof or somehow

433
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,880
otherwise fake some of these actions to

434
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:58,240
cause these algorithms than to act so

435
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,440
let's go through a few uh examples um

436
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:03,280
first coming back to

437
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,960
this

438
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:07,039
uk phishing

439
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,880
example

440
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,960
and i want to apply the framework to

441
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:11,919
this

442
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:14,640
and before i apply the framework

443
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:17,200
let me just say that

444
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,559
when i first started thinking about

445
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:20,080
creating this framework i really

446
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,400
envisioned it to be used in two ways and

447
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,960
i'll emphasize first that this is still

448
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,919
a work in progress i'm very open to

449
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:33,280
input from the community um because i

450
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,280
would you know i see this as being sort

451
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:38,640
of a an ongoing sort of effort and i

452
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:41,360
would like to improve it over time but i

453
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:43,600
envision it being used by

454
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,880
uh researchers as a way to

455
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,919
uh better describe these different types

456
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:53,360
of attacks and sort of uh give them um

457
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,520
you know different categories and this

458
00:18:55,520 --> 00:18:56,960
sort of thing

459
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,679
a better conversation

460
00:18:59,679 --> 00:19:01,039
a better

461
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:02,880
uh reference

462
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:06,160
of of descriptors

463
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:08,160
however for the practitioner community

464
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,000
the way that i would like to see it used

465
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,160
or the way i envision it seeing used

466
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,559
is um

467
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:16,720
in a more proactive way

468
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,880
that this might be able to use to

469
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,200
enhance threat modeling

470
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,000
and so by by thinking about different

471
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,400
attacks and and how different attacks

472
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:29,440
might be employed and and utilize these

473
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:32,240
different uh dimensions uh we might be

474
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:34,559
able to anticipate attacks that haven't

475
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,880
actually occurred yet and by being able

476
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,039
to anticipate these attacks we can

477
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:41,919
develop counter measures uh before the

478
00:19:41,919 --> 00:19:44,320
attackers even have a chance to

479
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:47,440
uh implement their attacks

480
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,799
so this uk vishing example and this was

481
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:55,120
a business identity compromise and um in

482
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,000
this case uh the attackers were

483
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,039
impersonating uh an executive so

484
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,120
actually impersonating that executive's

485
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:04,320
voice

486
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,280
making a phone call to an employee

487
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,559
and instructing that employee to

488
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,440
transfer funds to an account that was an

489
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,679
unauthorized account

490
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:18,799
and um

491
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:22,240
they they were so uh effective at doing

492
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:23,120
this

493
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,679
that they were out actually able to pull

494
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:27,840
it off successfully three times and it

495
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:29,280
was on the fourth time that the

496
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,559
employees started to get a little

497
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:33,360
suspicious and didn't actually wire the

498
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:34,720
funds

499
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,280
so in this case applying the framework

500
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:39,919
this is an audio based attack

501
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:42,320
through vishing um it was human

502
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:44,320
controlled

503
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:45,840
so they were able to have a real-time

504
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:48,159
conversation it was with somebody who

505
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:51,360
was uh familiar it was a superior to

506
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,039
that

507
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,960
to that employee

508
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,720
and it happened in real time so there

509
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:59,200
was a very real time interaction between

510
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,520
the target and the threat actor

511
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:05,919
and this targeted an individual human it

512
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:08,640
targeted the person the employee who had

513
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:13,200
the authorization to wire those funds

514
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:17,280
second example uh and i believe that

515
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:19,520
this was 2013

516
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:21,039
uh the

517
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:24,080
aps the associated press's twitter

518
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,480
account was compromised and the

519
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,720
attackers um tweeted out uh one or more

520
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:33,440
messages that several explosions had

521
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,760
occurred at the white house

522
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:38,080
and

523
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,000
as a result

524
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:42,480
several trading algorithms started

525
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,200
dumping stocks and uh i don't remember

526
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:47,600
the exact figure but there were several

527
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,600
millions of dollars that were lost in

528
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,919
fractions of a second from these

529
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:55,600
algorithms dumping these uh stocks and

530
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,240
so in this type of a k in this type of

531
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,760
an attack

532
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:02,240
it was a text based attack so the medium

533
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:03,919
was text

534
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:06,480
the control it's unclear as to whether

535
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:09,039
this was controlled by human or software

536
00:22:09,039 --> 00:22:12,000
it seems like the messaging itself was

537
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,159
probably written by a human but that's

538
00:22:14,159 --> 00:22:17,200
not i don't think that's been concluded

539
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:19,360
it's not somebody that we were familiar

540
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:21,760
with um most people don't know anyone at

541
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:22,880
the ap

542
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:24,000
um

543
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,400
i don't and uh

544
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,480
it was pre-recorded so these were

545
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,559
pre-recorded messages that were tweeted

546
00:22:30,559 --> 00:22:33,600
out they weren't meant to be interactive

547
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,559
and the target though this is this is

548
00:22:36,559 --> 00:22:38,000
kind of um

549
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,679
where it gets a little fuzzy is who was

550
00:22:39,679 --> 00:22:41,919
the target of this attack it's really

551
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:44,799
unclear was it humans was it automation

552
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:47,600
were the trading algorithms actually the

553
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,919
target of this attack

554
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,039
we don't know

555
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:52,559
um

556
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:53,600
and

557
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,600
it was certainly a broadcast attack this

558
00:22:55,600 --> 00:23:00,240
was not meant for a specific individual

559
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,360
so example number three gift card scams

560
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:05,360
uh so this is something that i've

561
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,159
personally had quite a bit of experience

562
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:10,320
with i've

563
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:11,760
reviewed

564
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:14,240
hundreds and hundreds of these

565
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,799
gift card scams i've had the opportunity

566
00:23:16,799 --> 00:23:17,600
to

567
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,320
interview multiple victims

568
00:23:20,320 --> 00:23:23,360
and something that uh became apparent

569
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,120
very very quickly was

570
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,120
as i mentioned earlier that these are

571
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:29,679
running off of some sort of script these

572
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:31,840
uh bots that seem to be

573
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,280
powering these

574
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,320
um

575
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,799
they're not very sophisticated it seems

576
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,120
like they at each

577
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,760
phase of the interaction probably only

578
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:44,000
have maybe

579
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,880
i'm going to say maybe five or so sort

580
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:50,480
of options to choose from in responding

581
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,080
and

582
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:54,320
it seems to be very scripted

583
00:23:54,320 --> 00:23:55,679
again you know

584
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:59,600
are you there are you available

585
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:02,400
can you do me a favor

586
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,080
something else we've been seeing a lot

587
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,720
is it might initiate through email and

588
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,000
ask the person to text back to a certain

589
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,320
number um trying to move them out of

590
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:14,480
that channel that's controlled by

591
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,840
security

592
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,640
departments

593
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,760
so

594
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:24,799
in these in these scams uh we saw an 820

595
00:24:24,799 --> 00:24:28,080
jump in these gift card scams during the

596
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:30,320
coveted lockdowns and so with people

597
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:33,679
moving uh to working online they're not

598
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,919
as protected by their security

599
00:24:35,919 --> 00:24:39,679
departments and um this uh the criminals

600
00:24:39,679 --> 00:24:41,919
are very well aware of this and because

601
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:44,240
of that they um

602
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,840
you know started launching these gift

603
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:49,919
card scams uh at a fantastic rate

604
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:52,400
so applying the framework to these scams

605
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,559
this is a text based attack so the

606
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:56,080
medium is text

607
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,480
uh the control is hybrid it starts out

608
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,880
with software and then moves over to

609
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,600
human and again when i was reviewing

610
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:05,600
these it was very apparent it went from

611
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:07,520
a very narrow script that they would

612
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,960
follow to

613
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:12,159
uh very skilled social engineers the

614
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,400
people who are doing this

615
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:16,480
they do it day in and day out and they

616
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,360
know how to manipulate people and

617
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,200
it was it was actually very impressive

618
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,240
to see

619
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:24,480
uh some of the scripts or some of the

620
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,559
dialogues that they were engaged in they

621
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:28,000
they really knew how to push people's

622
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,360
buttons

623
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:31,440
uh the familiarity they often

624
00:25:31,440 --> 00:25:32,960
impersonate

625
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:35,840
a co-worker usually a superior

626
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:40,159
and so this is um a synthetic version of

627
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,039
somebody that the victim

628
00:25:43,039 --> 00:25:44,880
is familiar with

629
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:47,840
and uh low asynchrony these are almost

630
00:25:47,840 --> 00:25:52,480
always done through some sort of um

631
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:56,960
text exchange uh sms or uh email but

632
00:25:56,960 --> 00:25:59,039
when the emails uh exchanges are

633
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:00,080
happening

634
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,480
they're happening very very quickly so

635
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:06,159
uh the victim will respond and the

636
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,640
criminal will respond back to that

637
00:26:08,640 --> 00:26:11,600
response within minutes usually

638
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,559
and finally these are targeting

639
00:26:14,559 --> 00:26:17,520
individual humans

640
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:19,679
virtual kidnapping

641
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:23,039
so this can be medium wise

642
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:25,600
this almost always includes some sort of

643
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,640
imagery um i'm sure it can happen with

644
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,600
text

645
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,520
actually i take that back i i am aware

646
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:34,480
of at least a few text-based virtual

647
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,880
kidnappings but the the richer that the

648
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,039
criminal can make that experience the

649
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:42,799
more effective they're gonna be so they

650
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:44,400
usually try to

651
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,799
uh include some sort of combination of

652
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,360
you know maybe video and text or

653
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,200
uh possibly audio now we can see how in

654
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:55,679
the very near future by being able to

655
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:58,559
use deep fake videos let's say they will

656
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,640
really enhance the effectiveness of

657
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,000
these attacks

658
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,600
um the control

659
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:06,480
it's uh if it's controlled at all uh if

660
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:08,320
the media is controlled at all it's

661
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,400
controlled by a human usually

662
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:14,720
um but the familiarity to the victim is

663
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:16,799
al always close i mean

664
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:18,080
um

665
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:20,240
we're not going to fork over you know

666
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:22,640
half a million dollars in our you know

667
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:25,279
savings retirement for somebody that we

668
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,039
just see every day in the elevator and

669
00:27:27,039 --> 00:27:28,720
don't really know beyond that so this is

670
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:30,720
always going to be a very close relation

671
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,399
to ourselves

672
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:36,000
um interactivity so far um

673
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:39,520
i am only aware of pre-recorded uh

674
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,360
synthetic media being used in these

675
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:44,240
virtual kidnappings uh i expect that to

676
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:46,960
change very quickly i think as soon as

677
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:49,200
uh the criminals really have a handle on

678
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,320
some of the

679
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:52,559
deep fake video creation i think we're

680
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:55,120
gonna start to see some uh

681
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,520
instances of virtual kidnappings in

682
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:59,919
which the victim is able to interact

683
00:27:59,919 --> 00:28:01,679
with the criminal believing that it's

684
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:03,440
that close relation

685
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,760
and this is where um i'm going to talk

686
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:07,679
about some policy countermeasures here

687
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,760
in just a minute but this is where we

688
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:11,360
really need to have things like shared

689
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,919
secrets to get past this proof of life

690
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:15,919
and obviously these are targeting

691
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:18,399
individual humans

692
00:28:18,399 --> 00:28:20,720
okay the fifth example i i mentioned

693
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:24,000
this before zisching uh this is only

694
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,760
something i'm speculating about right

695
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:26,720
now

696
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,559
but i believe that this audio video deep

697
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:32,799
fake technology will be used in the near

698
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,159
future to

699
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:38,240
uh spoof individuals in uh zoom rooms

700
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,159
we've already seen zoom bombing and

701
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:41,760
other sorts of things happening and i

702
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:43,520
think it's just a matter of time between

703
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:45,440
before social engineers start to take

704
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,279
this to the next level

705
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:49,600
and uh use this to social engineering

706
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:52,480
people in zoom rooms so again this will

707
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,240
be a video audio

708
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,840
uh medium

709
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:58,799
human controlled uh it'll be somebody

710
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:01,039
who we're at least familiar with most

711
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,960
likely possibly somebody we're close

712
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,799
with the interactivity will be in real

713
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:07,919
time and it'll most likely be targeting

714
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:10,640
individual humans could we could see

715
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:13,039
situations where targeting uh

716
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:15,919
populations but most likely individual

717
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,240
humans

718
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:20,320
and then another speculative attack i've

719
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:22,720
already kind of talked about is a

720
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,440
biometric attack now this is an attack

721
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,880
against

722
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:29,360
an automated system

723
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,159
to

724
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:33,520
falsely authenticate as someone else to

725
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:34,880
that system

726
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:37,600
and so this is an individual individual

727
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:40,240
automation that's being targeted it'll

728
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:42,320
likely happen in real time it has to

729
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:43,600
happen in real time for that

730
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:45,760
authorization to occur

731
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,420
um

732
00:29:46,420 --> 00:29:47,600
[Music]

733
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,320
you know the familiarity uh depending on

734
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,320
how you view it could be close could be

735
00:29:52,320 --> 00:29:53,840
unfamiliar

736
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,960
control

737
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:55,919
could be

738
00:29:55,919 --> 00:29:57,120
any of the

739
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:00,159
potential control human software

740
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:01,600
text

741
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:04,240
well the medium could be text could be

742
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,679
audio or combinations of audio video and

743
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,159
so on and so forth depending on what the

744
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:12,960
authentication mechanism it is that is

745
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:16,240
attempting to be defeated

746
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:18,960
okay

747
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,120
i realize that technology

748
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,440
is advancing to defeat these attacks

749
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,159
there are some very impressive uh

750
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:32,480
advances that have been made i think

751
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,279
just uh last week facebook announced

752
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:38,080
that they had developed uh forensic

753
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,919
methodology to

754
00:30:39,919 --> 00:30:42,640
uh potentially even track back deep deep

755
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,880
fake videos to their sources

756
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,120
um

757
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,200
and so i i won't i'm not really going to

758
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:52,000
argue against technology however

759
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,960
i will argue for a holistic approach and

760
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,519
so technology is a component however the

761
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:00,240
other part of that component has to be

762
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,799
human-centric solutions this can be

763
00:31:02,799 --> 00:31:04,480
training this can be

764
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:07,039
policy this could be other mechanisms

765
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:09,360
that are centered around the human users

766
00:31:09,360 --> 00:31:11,200
and the reason i think that this is

767
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:13,039
important is first the pace of

768
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:16,080
technology it cuts both ways

769
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,320
defensive technologies will advance

770
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:21,440
however uh the offensive technologies

771
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:22,960
are also going to advance they're

772
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,840
constantly getting better as well

773
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,200
second is

774
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:28,880
and this is this is where i have a lot

775
00:31:28,880 --> 00:31:31,279
of arguments with um

776
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:34,159
security departments is that uh it's

777
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:37,360
it's like take uh phishing right now

778
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,880
is a great example the email filters

779
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:41,840
are

780
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,279
very very good

781
00:31:43,279 --> 00:31:45,279
you have other technologies like dmarc

782
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:47,039
that can help to authenticate whether or

783
00:31:47,039 --> 00:31:49,440
not someone is within or outside of an

784
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:50,960
organization

785
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:54,000
all very good technologies however

786
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,600
if i as a bad actor call somebody call

787
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,919
that target now all of a sudden all of

788
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,159
those fishing defense mechanisms go

789
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,679
right out the window because we're out

790
00:32:03,679 --> 00:32:06,080
of band we're not in that channel

791
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:08,320
and this is where i see thin synthetic

792
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:10,320
media is posing a very serious threat

793
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:11,600
it's when we're talking about these

794
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,840
out-of-band

795
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:14,480
communications and as we're

796
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,320
transitioning more and more to online

797
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:18,960
work i think these out-of-band coms are

798
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:21,440
going to be much more significant

799
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,559
um

800
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:24,640
don't really want to get into it but

801
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,240
one thing i do want to point out is that

802
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,640
the data sets that these defensive

803
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,200
technologies are trained on often do not

804
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,760
have anti-forensic countermeasures built

805
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:36,000
into the data sets

806
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,000
and then finally we're also going to be

807
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,159
dealing a lot of times with

808
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:42,720
non-technical users so if you have

809
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:45,600
somebody who's advanced in age and they

810
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,320
get a virtual kidnapping attack launched

811
00:32:48,320 --> 00:32:49,679
against them

812
00:32:49,679 --> 00:32:50,640
and

813
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:51,600
um

814
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:53,440
the criminals are purporting to have

815
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:57,039
their grandson granddaughter

816
00:32:57,039 --> 00:32:59,039
this is probably not a very technical

817
00:32:59,039 --> 00:33:01,840
user and trying to get them to use some

818
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,200
advanced

819
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,640
forensic

820
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,559
deep fake audio

821
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:09,039
technology

822
00:33:09,039 --> 00:33:11,039
it's just not realistic so we need

823
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,360
simple solutions for the non-technical

824
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:15,279
users

825
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:16,320
so

826
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,640
implementing countermeasures for the

827
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,880
enterprise or even at the individual

828
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:23,200
level what can we do and i think this is

829
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,279
one place where

830
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:26,480
um

831
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,279
low-tech solutions can defeat these

832
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,200
high-tech attacks

833
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,120
the first one i'll talk about is the

834
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:36,559
shared secret uh policy now this is um

835
00:33:36,559 --> 00:33:38,080
something that would be especially

836
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,039
effective against virtual kidnappings uh

837
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:42,720
it's somebody that you're

838
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:45,919
that you have a close relationship with

839
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:48,960
come up with a code word or a

840
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,360
signed counter sign sort of uh

841
00:33:51,360 --> 00:33:52,880
arrangement

842
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,919
so that you can establish proof of life

843
00:33:55,919 --> 00:33:58,240
someone gets a phone call saying that

844
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,960
someone is kidnapped their son daughter

845
00:34:00,960 --> 00:34:04,159
close relation okay fine

846
00:34:04,159 --> 00:34:07,679
we have a shared secret ask the person

847
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:10,800
that you've kidnapped uh what our shared

848
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:12,159
secret is

849
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:15,440
um and it should be something that is

850
00:34:15,440 --> 00:34:18,159
not something that you often talk about

851
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:21,679
if you never talk about purple uh

852
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,879
unicorns then purple unicorn is a great

853
00:34:24,879 --> 00:34:28,000
shared secret to have

854
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:29,280
um

855
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:32,000
the next policy is the never do what i

856
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:35,040
call the never do policy now when our

857
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:37,359
university was being hit by

858
00:34:37,359 --> 00:34:39,679
a rash of these gift card scams the

859
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:42,239
director of our institute sent out this

860
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,239
email to all of the employees at the

861
00:34:44,239 --> 00:34:46,839
institute it was fantastic it was very

862
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:50,560
clear and in that email the director

863
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,000
said look

864
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,359
under no circumstances will i ever ask

865
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,320
you

866
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:58,960
to purchase gift cards for any reason i

867
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:02,000
will never ask you to purchase gift

868
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:04,480
cards on my behalf my secretary will

869
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:07,119
never ask you to purchase gift cards on

870
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:08,480
my behalf

871
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,640
by having that established

872
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:12,800
then when employees do

873
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,000
receive text messages or emails or some

874
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,000
other sort of communication purporting

875
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:20,400
to come from someone in a position of

876
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:21,920
authority they're not going to have that

877
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,359
question they're going to know right

878
00:35:23,359 --> 00:35:26,720
away that these are fake and they're

879
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,119
going to ignore them

880
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:31,520
the next uh

881
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:33,520
uh policy that i'll mention is is what

882
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,599
i'll call the multi-person

883
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:38,480
authorization policy now in the case of

884
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,000
the uk

885
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,320
wishing attack using audio deep fake

886
00:35:42,320 --> 00:35:44,400
tech

887
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:47,040
having a second person there to

888
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,280
sign off on that authorization will help

889
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,240
cut down on the likelihood of success of

890
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,480
those types of transfers this can be

891
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:56,800
difficult sometimes with

892
00:35:56,800 --> 00:35:59,599
situations or companies that are doing

893
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,320
multiple transfers in a short amount of

894
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,280
time

895
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,680
but uh

896
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:08,160
i i've actually investigated cases where

897
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,359
four million dollars have been

898
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:11,599
transferred it may be worth taking that

899
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,280
extra minute or two to have the second

900
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:16,079
person review that tran that transfer

901
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,320
before it's authorized and finally a

902
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:21,280
multi-channel verification policy uh you

903
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:23,839
receive a phone call to to wire funds to

904
00:36:23,839 --> 00:36:27,359
a certain um account okay that's fine go

905
00:36:27,359 --> 00:36:29,680
ahead and email me from the verified

906
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,079
email that you're supposed to have email

907
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:34,960
me the code that i need to

908
00:36:34,960 --> 00:36:37,680
go ahead and wire that money so

909
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,839
something that is in a different uh

910
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:42,480
channel or it's out of band uh from that

911
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:45,760
initial attack vector

912
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,720
okay so

913
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,000
where do i go from here um

914
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:54,800
well i'm going to continue to flesh out

915
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:57,119
this framework again it's it's really my

916
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,119
strong desire to create something that

917
00:36:59,119 --> 00:37:01,760
is usable not only for other researchers

918
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,920
but also for the practitioners of the

919
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:05,440
community

920
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:07,839
um but also for my own personal

921
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:10,079
interests i'm working with a phd student

922
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:12,720
right now and she is beginning to look

923
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:14,160
at uh

924
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,800
neural signatures for detection of deep

925
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:19,200
fakes in humans so we're asking the

926
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:22,240
question are humans at some level able

927
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:26,640
to detect these deep fake videos um

928
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:28,640
you know they're distortions or other

929
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:30,800
things that we may be pick picking up on

930
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,000
other cues

931
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:32,960
and

932
00:37:32,960 --> 00:37:37,359
the key here is that humans may not be

933
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:40,160
aware themselves that they're actually

934
00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,280
picking up on these cues and so our hope

935
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,280
is is by looking at some of the electro

936
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:50,320
magnetic signals that we may actually

937
00:37:50,320 --> 00:37:52,240
see that there are points where people

938
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,760
are picking up on these even if they're

939
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:57,520
not consciously recognizing it

940
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,320
and related to that we want to see how

941
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:02,320
does familiarity influence this

942
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:05,359
detectability if someone is looking at a

943
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:08,160
friend or a roommate that they know very

944
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,040
well as opposed to a complete stranger

945
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:13,040
or opposed to somebody that they don't

946
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:15,520
know very well does this influence their

947
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,599
ability to detect a true video from a

948
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:20,480
you know

949
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,560
deep fake video and so these are also

950
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,000
questions we're going to be asking we're

951
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,680
also going to be going to be looking at

952
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:26,880
this from

953
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:29,520
a neuro perspective

954
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,400
and then finally something i really want

955
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,119
to

956
00:38:33,119 --> 00:38:36,400
uh start diving into uh and i have to

957
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,599
say that

958
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,160
one of the inspirations for me in this

959
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:42,640
has been the funny excuse me the honey

960
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:44,079
fish project

961
00:38:44,079 --> 00:38:46,880
uh and robbie if you happen to watch

962
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,720
this please reach out to me i'll have my

963
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,800
email in the next slide i would love to

964
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,720
talk to you about that project because

965
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,920
i'm curious if we might be able to use

966
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,520
um synthetic media against the criminals

967
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:00,640
i'm

968
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,480
envisioning

969
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:04,800
cases like

970
00:39:04,800 --> 00:39:07,680
honey pot zoom rooms and other things

971
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:09,280
that we can create

972
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:11,760
we've already talked about responding to

973
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:14,800
gift card scammers with synthetic media

974
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:17,760
as a way to combat them

975
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:18,640
so

976
00:39:18,640 --> 00:39:20,560
with that thank you for your time thank

977
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,880
you for taking the time to watch uh my

978
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:25,839
presentation if you'd like to contact me

979
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:28,320
my email address is there on the slide

980
00:39:28,320 --> 00:39:29,680
and

981
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:31,359
i hope you find some value to this thank
