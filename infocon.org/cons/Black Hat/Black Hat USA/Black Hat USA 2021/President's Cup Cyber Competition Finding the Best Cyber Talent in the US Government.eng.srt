president's cup cyber competition

4
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:26,960
finding the best cyber talent the

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:29,359
federal government i'm harry mortoz i'm

6

00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:33,680
director for cyber security at the cyber

8
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,600
security infrastructure security agency

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,440
at the department of homeland security

10
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,640
and this is

11
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:40,960
i'm matt carr i'm the

12
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:42,719
project lead for president's cop from

13
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:44,320
the software engineering institute at

14
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,800
carnegie mellon university where i also

15
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:49,120
serve as an adjunct instructor at the

16
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,840
information networking institute

17
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,680
so let's talk about the president's cup

18
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:55,520
this came about as a result of executive

19
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,840
order 13870

20
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,000
the america's cyber workforce executive

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,840
order and it tasked the department of

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,239
homeland security with developing a plan

23
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:07,360
in 90 days to run a cyber security

24
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,040
competition

25
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,560
to identify challenge and reward the

26
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,400
best cyber talent federal government by

27
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,159
the end of december by december 31st

28
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,600
2019.

29
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,119
the competition was to include 10

30
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:18,640
different functional areas that would be

31
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:19,840
tested

32
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,680
there was to be a team and individual

33
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,920
component of the competition which would

34
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,200
be open to

35
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:27,119
federal civilian employees as well as

36
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:29,439
uniformed service members

37
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,520
although it did task us with developing

38
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:33,439
a plan to identify ways to include

39
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:34,799
non-federal

40
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:36,880
participants as either observers or

41
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:38,960
competitors

42
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,360
it also tasked us with uh identifying

43
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:43,680
ways to incentivize agencies to

44
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,840
uh identify their best cyber talent to

45
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:47,040
participate

46
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,280
uh for this competition especially given

47
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,799
the short timelines we were only able to

48
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,960
announce the competition uh three weeks

49
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,399
before we launched our first qualifying

50
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,159
round we knew we had to open it up as

51
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:58,799
wide as possible

52
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,240
so our criteria for running this

53
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,000
competition it had to be as accessible

54
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,200
as possible

55
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:05,360
uh it had to have minimum hardware

56
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,200
software requirements to allow really

57
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,639
anyone to participate

58
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,160
especially given we're targeting federal

59
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,440
employees who may be participating

60
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:13,280
during work hours we don't want them

61
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:16,239
downloading a bunch of vulnerable vms to

62
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,319
hack away at on their on their federal

63
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:19,520
equipment

64
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:20,959
and it had to be able to be done

65
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:23,200
remotely particularly the qualifying

66
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:25,520
rounds in order to get down to

67
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:27,440
the finalists

68
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,280
so with those criteria in mind we

69
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,280
developed our plan

70
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,640
to

71
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,239
do two qualifying rounds that would be

72
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:36,319
completely remote ending in a final

73
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:37,599
round that would be

74
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,239
uh in person and we would put a unique

75
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:42,080
twist on that which we'll talk about a

76
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:44,160
little bit later uh the down selects for

77
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,319
the qualifiers were based on performance

78
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,440
uh in in the rounds for the individual

79
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,400
competition

80
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,640
it was the top hundred individuals and

81
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,959
anyone who tied for that hundredth place

82
00:02:54,959 --> 00:02:57,120
was invited to participate in round two

83
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,200
for the teams uh it was the top twenty

84
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,120
percent of teams who performed in round

85
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,959
one would be invited to participate in

86
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:05,760
round two as well as the best teams

87
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,120
from each cfo act agency

88
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,519
so that was the plan and we were able to

89
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,599
put this together submit it to the white

90
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:16,239
house at the end of july and in early

91
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,239
august we were given we were given the

92
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:21,200
go to uh to move forward and execute our

93
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,319
plan

94
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:23,920
we knew we had to hit the ground running

95
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:25,360
we only had

96
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,120
four months at that point to complete

97
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,400
the competition

98
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,840
we were able to get our first qualifier

99
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:31,680
up in 45 days

100
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:32,640
matt do you want to talk a little bit

101
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,000
about that

102
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,799
yeah thanks harry uh i it was uh a

103
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:38,799
whirlwind effort there to

104
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,440
develop out a platform uh that was

105
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,000
capable of hosting over a thousand

106
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,879
individuals uh and teams and putting

107
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:49,680
them through an online

108
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:51,200
qualification

109
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:53,680
round and so what we ended up doing was

110
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,280
leaning on some software that we already

111
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,360
had that was already being used to

112
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,400
develop

113
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,680
training and exercises known as topomojo

114
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,280
and pairing it with a new software

115
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,920
development known as gameboard uh new

116
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:08,400
software app that would uh kind of take

117
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,040
those labs and put them together into a

118
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,680
competition uh format so you know with

119
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,639
points and leaderboards etc uh so back

120
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,320
to toba mojo we have uh this application

121
00:04:20,320 --> 00:04:22,400
that's used to build really you know

122
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,759
kind of small labs uh for uh training

123
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,040
and uh and uh exercise purposes so if

124
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:31,520
you need to run somebody through a uh

125
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,680
introduction to it to a cyber security

126
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,360
tool or to some kind of uh uh scenario

127
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,120
then this is a good tool for that it's

128
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:42,240
now open source up on github and we used

129
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,080
it because we saw this as a good model

130
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,600
for creating a challenge because we

131
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:47,680
wanted the same

132
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,600
kind of scope for each of our challenges

133
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,280
and we also wanted one of the benefits

134
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,199
of tokomojo is it's very fast to get

135
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:54,880
these environments deployed and we

136
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,240
didn't want to have as you already

137
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,680
mentioned people

138
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,840
downloading large vms and having to run

139
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:01,840
them on their own gear so instead we

140
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,919
hosted all these challenges

141
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:05,520
and you were just a

142
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,840
click button click away from deploying

143
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,919
them having access to consoles and

144
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,000
ultimately using those consoles to

145
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
virtual machines to solve the challenge

146
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,680
based on the scenario that's provided in

147
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,280
the write-up

148
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,720
so they may be small virtual

149
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,240
environments but we were able to create

150
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,479
some really interesting challenges there

151
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:23,840
one of my favorites from the first year

152
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:25,440
is called build the road where

153
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:26,960
competitors were initially given access

154
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,639
to one virtual machine

155
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,759
just just the regular user vm and they

156
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,800
had to find a firewall on the subnet

157
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,720
that they initially connected to they

158
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,560
had to properly configure that firewall

159
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,479
in order to be able to see

160
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,400
an intrusion detection system and ids on

161
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:43,919
the other side which they then had to

162
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,520
properly configure

163
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:47,199
in order to be able to see a router on

164
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,960
the on the far side of that which they

165
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,240
had to properly configure in order to

166
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,840
get to a vm

167
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,680
on the far side which

168
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,520
allowed us to really explore some

169
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,759
creative challenge development

170
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:58,880
techniques

171
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,960
which ultimately met the needs of the

172
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,479
executive order which tasked us with

173
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:04,479
those 10 functional areas that we were

174
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:06,720
to test which included uh some cyber

175
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:09,520
defensive uh roles and and tasks that

176
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:11,840
are not very commonly seen in a lot of

177
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,560
uh a lot of ctfs and and uh cyber

178
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,240
competitions but this platform really

179
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:18,400
enabled us to dig into that and uh

180
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,120
execute that on a broader scale

181
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,199
yeah and just to add on to that we also

182
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:25,280
got feedback during the development

183
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,160
phase that uh we wanted uh we you know

184
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:29,840
we would need to have downloadable

185
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,080
challenges as much as possible and so

186
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,319
many of the challenges that we uh that

187
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,280
we built uh did have downloadable uh

188
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,759
portions to them and uh those challenges

189
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,759
you could still solve on your own system

190
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:42,880
it usually involves some kind of

191
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,360
artifact uh that was benign what would

192
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,919
uh walk you through that process and the

193
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:49,520
same artifact was then available and

194
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,440
hosted in the hosted topo mojo

195
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:52,800
environment

196
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:54,400
well it also allowed us to deploy the

197
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,639
variants uh do you want to talk a little

198
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,800
bit about our infinity challenge yeah so

199
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:01,520
so first up we uh we wanted to make sure

200
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,080
that uh that that each challenge had

201
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,759
more than one answer there were multiple

202
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:08,000
variants deployed uh potentially

203
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,680
deployed for each challenge we had at

204
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,759
least four variants for every uh

205
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,160
president's cup challenge in year one

206
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,800
and that was just used so that if uh you

207
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,000
know two people were uh working through

208
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
uh the game board that they wouldn't

209
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
necessarily uh get the exact same

210
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,639
answers for those challenges um we also

211
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,360
uh

212
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,599
we also have a technology that you uh

213
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:31,840
talked about uh called infinity style

214
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:34,240
challenges which allow uh procedural

215
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,479
generation of the correct answer as the

216
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:38,160
challenge is deployed and that just

217
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:39,599
means that instead of there being four

218
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:41,360
variants there's now infinite variance

219
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,080
of that challenge and no two

220
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,680
deployed challenges would necessarily

221
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,599
have the same correct answers and that

222
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:50,080
really helps us we hope to improve upon

223
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,319
that and build more of that into future

224
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:54,400
presidents cups because we think that is

225
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,520
a novel way to deliver challenges that

226
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,840
we know that you arrived at that answer

227
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:02,319
through your own work

228
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,280
yeah

229
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,879
uh that first year was a really

230
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:07,039
interesting experience one of the uh

231
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,199
design choices that we made for the

232
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:12,319
competition in order to make it as as

233
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,479
open and accessible as possible while

234
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:16,319
creating as level of playing field as we

235
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:18,960
could was the use of the participation

236
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,560
timer so

237
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,599
the round one was open for 10 days

238
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:25,520
competitors could log in at their

239
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:29,039
convenience at any point 24 by 7

240
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:31,199
during that 10-day period and attempt

241
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:32,559
challenges

242
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:33,679
one of the things that we needed to be

243
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,599
very mindful of especially

244
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,000
given our audience of

245
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
fully employed federal employees and

246
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,159
military service members was we had to

247
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,679
be mindful of the time that we were

248
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,200
asking of them to participate we want to

249
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,240
make sure

250
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:48,720
that those who had more time to invest

251
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,839
in this

252
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:51,519
would not get an advantage over those

253
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,600
who maybe had a limited amount of time

254
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,959
to try it

255
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:56,720
so for that first year we implemented an

256
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,519
eight-hour timer where uh at any point

257
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,279
during those ten days you could log in

258
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:03,040
and you would start the game board and

259
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:05,120
when you started the game board

260
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:06,480
you would get an eight-hour timer that

261
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,760
would count down that would be your

262
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:09,040
participation time or at the end of the

263
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,399
eight hours you wouldn't be able to

264
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,120
submit any additional flags or

265
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,360
receive any additional points

266
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,120
yeah and i'd say that was something even

267
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,720
as we were just going through the

268
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,680
development of the first round

269
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:25,120
for the 2019 president's cup that

270
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,680
was a new thought to me i i was

271
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,399
accustomed to just a normal

272
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:32,480
longer window and people having an

273
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,320
opportunity to compete during that

274
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:36,560
entire time but i do think this worked

275
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,080
out certainly the best for the

276
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:40,160
president's cup audience and we've

277
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:41,920
even gotten feedback from other

278
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,920
competitions where they're trying to do

279
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:46,800
uh down selects and find uh the best

280
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:49,920
folks that this is a a good way to go

281
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:51,839
about it because then you don't

282
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,320
advantage folks that do have more time

283
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,920
or able to take a week off work or

284
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:57,360
whatever that is

285
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,160
so

286
00:09:58,160 --> 00:09:59,839
we found as we started interviewing some

287
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,399
of our competitors in year two

288
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:03,279
that

289
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,480
this actually factored into their

290
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,920
strategies and how they approached the

291
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,519
challenges uh

292
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,519
all of our teams most of our teams that

293
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:11,279
were very successful that we talked to

294
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,600
all had the same point of knowing when

295
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:15,360
to cut and run from a challenge and

296
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:17,440
avoid sinking any more time into it if

297
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,640
you only have eight hours to solve as

298
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:21,360
many uh as many challenges as you can

299
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,360
which was interesting to hear and

300
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,519
speaking of the timing

301
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:27,040
one of the things that was very

302
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,399
interesting was to see how that affected

303
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:29,920
challenge development and our challenge

304
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:31,440
development principles

305
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:33,040
just being mindful of that limited

306
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,040
amount of time the qualifiers the first

307
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,880
year round one there were 15 challenges

308
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,240
on the board

309
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,600
for round two there were 11.

310
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,519
we had one challenge that we dubbed

311
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,040
double jeopardy because we thought it

312
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,560
was the hardest challenge in the

313
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:48,800
competition to date it involved tasking

314
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,760
a competitor with pulling a flag out of

315
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:54,320
an encoded stream that they were given a

316
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,640
packet capture for they had to identify

317
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,320
the stream identify the type of encoding

318
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,839
play the traffic back in order to

319
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,240
extract the flag and uh the average

320
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:04,160
solve time was six hours for this

321
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:06,399
challenge one of our teams solved it in

322
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:07,920
15 minutes

323
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,839
so this raised a ton of red flags we

324
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:11,839
manually review all of the submissions

325
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:14,000
at the end of each round

326
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,839
and this raised some eyebrows so we

327
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,240
reached out to the team uh to confirm

328
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,000
that this was a legitimate solve and

329
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,079
they gave us a write-up for how they how

330
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,200
they approached the challenge and how

331
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,279
they solved it and it was it was legit

332
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:27,519
uh very impressive which just just goes

333
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,040
to show that

334
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,480
one of the things that we kept finding

335
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:32,320
over and over is no matter how much time

336
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,240
you put into developing a challenge

337
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:35,760
there will be a competitor who will find

338
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,079
a new or novel way to solve it yeah

339
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:40,000
absolutely and

340
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,519
we spent a lot of time uh qa testing

341
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:46,079
challenges we actually had support from

342
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:48,240
uh pacific northwest national labs and

343
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,320
argonne national labs uh to help us uh

344
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:53,839
look at all the challenges and and

345
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,399
figure out uh you know where we think

346
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:58,320
these uh challenges might break down and

347
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,399
where where we need to kind of beef up

348
00:12:00,399 --> 00:12:02,079
uh what's in the challenge but even with

349
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:03,519
all that you know there are there are

350
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,839
certain there's no uh there's nothing

351
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,360
like putting it in front of all the

352
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,440
talented uh competitors in the

353
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:10,959
president's cup and seeing what they'll

354
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:12,240
do with it

355
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,600
yeah i couldn't agree more which

356
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:16,320
actually leads nicely into the finals uh

357
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,320
so that first year of the finals

358
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,160
was just

359
00:12:20,160 --> 00:12:22,000
such an interesting experience

360
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,440
uh putting all of this together so we

361
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,920
held the final round in person uh in

362
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,200
2019

363
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:28,959
actually here at our cyber lab in

364
00:12:28,959 --> 00:12:30,399
arlington virginia

365
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:33,279
and uh we brought the top 10 individuals

366
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,320
and the top five teams of each of five

367
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:37,519
participants

368
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:40,000
and uh sat them down and and put them

369
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,440
through a series of challenges so day

370
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,440
one was the individuals and then days

371
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,480
two and three were the teams

372
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:46,079
competitions which we'll get to

373
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:48,880
momentarily uh the individuals we gave

374
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,320
them ten challenges we gave them eight

375
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:53,279
hours sat down and uh and had at it and

376
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:55,760
our winner was actually a an air force

377
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,440
academy cadet which

378
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,120
uh we were all very impressed i mean

379
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,920
what a what a story he he's a

380
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:04,000
you know fantastic cyber professional

381
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:05,760
and we certainly wish him the best uh

382
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,279
certainly a little bit surprising uh to

383
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,079
to to see that but you know he was he

384
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:14,079
was the best so he's pretty great yeah

385
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:15,760
he actually got a shout out when he

386
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:17,760
graduated from the air force academy uh

387
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,040
the next year he got a shout out from

388
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,040
the vice president who was uh leaving

389
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,880
the commencement at uh at that

390
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,600
graduation and it's a pretty cool story

391
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,480
so

392
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,480
so for the teams competition uh it was

393
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,160
broken down into two days the first day

394
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,839
was more challenges

395
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,680
we had ten unique novel challenges for

396
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,040
them

397
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,440
in day one they had eight hours to solve

398
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:39,519
them and then day two

399
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:41,199
we took a bit different of an approach

400
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,560
we built a cyber escape room

401
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,120
which sort of combined physical spatial

402
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,680
challenges with cyber security problems

403
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,320
and task the teams with trying to escape

404
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,959
in eight hours by using their their

405
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:56,800
teamwork skills their cyber security

406
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:57,760
talent

407
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,240
and uh you know their their uh

408
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,720
cleverness to find their way out

409
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,959
and uh that was that was quite the

410
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,279
stressful experience yeah absolutely we

411
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:11,199
had a great time uh building the uh uh

412
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:13,760
that environment uh we partnered with

413
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,079
another group on campus known as the

414
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,639
entertainment technology center or etc

415
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:21,199
and they helped us put together uh this

416
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:23,519
novel uh unity-based immersive

417
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,920
environment kind of like a video game uh

418
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,920
coupled with cyber challenges and so we

419
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:30,320
tested we want to make sure that the

420
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,040
video game aspect of this did not

421
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,959
you know dominate what we would put

422
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:37,040
together so we tested it a number of

423
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,440
times with different groups of folks

424
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:41,600
internally to make sure that they could

425
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,519
solve that without any cyber skills at

426
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:45,440
all and it always took around the same

427
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:47,360
amount of time and so it was roughly it

428
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,720
was less than 30 minutes it would take

429
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,800
you to get through the escape room part

430
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,279
of this knowing no no cyber at all and

431
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:56,000
so then it just became a

432
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,680
cyber as the cyber challenges are what

433
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,440
got the teams apart as far as

434
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:04,079
determining who won and who didn't win

435
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,800
um but it turns out that that day was

436
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,720
pretty nerve-wracking uh

437
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,920
because not only we were trying

438
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,920
something new but because after four

439
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:14,639
hours the teams were not as far along in

440
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,240
solving the escape room as we thought

441
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:18,160
they would be so we had some discussions

442
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,160
on how we wanted to move forward and we

443
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,399
already had you know the possibility of

444
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:23,600
them we had already thought about the

445
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,120
possibility of nobody escaping but we

446
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,720
certainly didn't like the

447
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,880
the look of it you know that we had this

448
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,920
we

449
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,680
tried to put together something new and

450
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:33,279
we really wanted to have some teams

451
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:35,519
escape and it turns out we did we did

452
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,079
have a team escape at the end and and

453
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:39,600
another one that was hot on their heels

454
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,440
that maybe another 15 20 minutes they

455
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:43,279
probably would have made it out as well

456
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:44,399
uh

457
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:46,000
one of the really interesting things

458
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,120
that that allowed us to do with the

459
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,120
escape room is in keeping with the

460
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,279
intent of the executive order

461
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:52,639
and the need to

462
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,279
include non-federal participation as

463
00:15:55,279 --> 00:15:57,759
spectators or as participants we live

464
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,040
streamed

465
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,920
the entire final day of the competition

466
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,440
we got two of

467
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:05,920
my colleagues at sizza to narrate adam

468
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,839
brown and bobby thompson who did a

469
00:16:07,839 --> 00:16:09,360
fantastic job

470
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:11,440
providing color commentary we were able

471
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,040
to pull up the the screens of the

472
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,120
competitors on the live stream and adam

473
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,199
and bobby were able to talk about the

474
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:18,639
tools they were using how they were

475
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:21,279
approaching the challenges uh and the

476
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:23,360
various techniques and what those tools

477
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:24,720
are used for

478
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,000
um

479
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,680
it was fantastic they didn't they did an

480
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,440
incredible job it's still up on youtube

481
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,680
if you search president's cup cyber uh

482
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:34,240
it'll it'll pop right up um but it was

483
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,920
it was really really interesting to be a

484
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:38,160
part of yeah i think it would it really

485
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,560
brought what we were doing here to a

486
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,519
much wider audience and uh did so for a

487
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:45,759
cyber competition where it is difficult

488
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,320
to create content

489
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,120
to

490
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:52,240
about cyber competitions that's engaging

491
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,240
for that period of time and so they did

492
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,959
a great job of uh explaining what was

493
00:16:56,959 --> 00:16:59,120
going on in a given scene what was going

494
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:01,839
on in a given scenario and what tools

495
00:17:01,839 --> 00:17:03,279
were in use how you would use those

496
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:05,119
tools in real life how they apply to

497
00:17:05,119 --> 00:17:08,799
this specific scenario and ultimately uh

498
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,160
provide a lot of uh detail that uh

499
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:13,679
wouldn't have come if it weren't for

500
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:16,319
them and their their efforts that day

501
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,559
but we were able to put together that

502
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,439
live stream using another team from uh

503
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,160
the sei the broadcast media team uh that

504
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,079
was in the room right next door the

505
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,960
control room and they uh were

506
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,360
kind of feeding through headsets what to

507
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,120
pay attention to what we're going to

508
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:34,640
what they're going to switch the the

509
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,640
monitors to and we actually switched

510
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,960
between everybody's view of the

511
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,200
president's cup uh environment so all

512
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,120
the teams were on systems that were

513
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:45,600
deployed around this facility and we

514
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,840
were switching them live onto the live

515
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,240
stream as we needed to demonstrate a

516
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:52,320
specific technique or what was going on

517
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:53,679
or certainly towards the end when the

518
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:54,880
excitement was happening and they're

519
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:56,559
about to escape

520
00:17:56,559 --> 00:17:58,320
yeah it was it was

521
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:00,960
really special to be a part of it was um

522
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,280
really an interesting experience

523
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:05,280
but as it turns out there's there's you

524
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,440
know no rest for the weary so

525
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:09,200
immediately after concluding president's

526
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:11,280
cup year one we started looking ahead at

527
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:12,400
year two

528
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,000
what do we do to improve the competition

529
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,400
where do we take it from here

530
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,840
for starters we had a lot more time to

531
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,440
prepare in year two which we were

532
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,760
grateful for but we started right away

533
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:23,520
we knew we had to get started we knew we

534
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:24,799
had to build something compelling to

535
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,720
follow up

536
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,640
we took a hard look at year one we

537
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:30,320
looked at what worked for us we looked

538
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,679
at what didn't work

539
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:33,280
uh we're extremely grateful to our

540
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:35,120
competitors uh there was a group that

541
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,520
put together a really thoughtful aar

542
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:40,240
that uh we reviewed we we got a ton of

543
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,160
feedback from a bunch of our competitors

544
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:44,080
that we looked at and

545
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,440
you know it actually led to a lot of

546
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,200
positive change in the competition led

547
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:48,799
to the development of partial credit

548
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:49,919
challenges do you want to talk about

549
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:52,880
that yeah so for year one uh partial

550
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,720
credit challenges were

551
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,559
intermixed with with some of the other

552
00:18:56,559 --> 00:18:58,240
uh single

553
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:00,320
answer challenges and you just use some

554
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,799
kind of delimiter to uh

555
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:04,240
within what you were inputting into the

556
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:05,840
challenge every challenge had a single

557
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:08,080
field where you put your answer in but

558
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,440
some of our challenge developers would

559
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:11,520
use delimiters in order to say oh

560
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,280
concatenate all these different things

561
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,760
and put them into a single submission um

562
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:17,200
but the problem with that is if you got

563
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:19,840
any one part of that wrong uh you got

564
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,440
the answer wrong you only had three

565
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,120
strikes and you're out on any of the

566
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,640
challenges

567
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,200
and so you might not find out why you

568
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:28,720
got it wrong because it could have been

569
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:31,039
just one of these parts and so that

570
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,960
understandably led to

571
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:35,520
competitors wanting to have something to

572
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,520
show for spending over an hour involved

573
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,520
in a challenge and that's where we

574
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:41,760
developed partial credit which

575
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,679
just uses a percentage

576
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:46,240
of you know the overall points applies

577
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:47,760
it to each diff one of the different

578
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:50,000
parts and then you also know as you're

579
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:51,919
submitting what you've gotten right and

580
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:54,799
not right so it allows you to then focus

581
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:57,039
on the area of the challenge that you

582
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,440
still have wrong in hopes of correcting

583
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,919
that before you run out of time

584
00:20:01,919 --> 00:20:04,159
yeah absolutely it also led to some

585
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:05,840
format changes so we took a different

586
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,840
approach with the individual competition

587
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:10,960
for year two uh eight hours is a long

588
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,360
block of time for uh somebody to be

589
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,960
participating in an individual

590
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,520
competition so we took it down to four

591
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,120
hours and we broke it into two separate

592
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,960
tracks as well to be mindful of

593
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:23,679
specialty areas within cyber security so

594
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:26,000
track a focused on incident response and

595
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:28,240
forensics track b focused on

596
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,240
exploitation analysis vulnerability

597
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,840
assessment

598
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:32,640
and

599
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:34,400
we did this uh

600
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:36,960
in part uh because we didn't we were

601
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,960
surprised at the overlap

602
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,720
in the end when we saw who was

603
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:43,280
qualifying for the final round in fact

604
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:46,159
there were 20 slots for the final round

605
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:48,720
10 in each uh individual track and we

606
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,799
wound up with 15 competitors because

607
00:20:50,799 --> 00:20:52,480
that's how many how that's how much

608
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:54,880
overlap was yeah half of each track

609
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,679
overlapped uh in the individual side so

610
00:20:57,679 --> 00:20:59,440
that's pretty crazy to see those that

611
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,799
number of folks

612
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,039
that number of our competitors who uh

613
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:03,840
are

614
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,000
have talent in both areas and are able

615
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,400
to demonstrate that in the competition

616
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,240
so for the qualifiers we didn't really

617
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,000
uh we weren't impacted much by uh 2020

618
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,600
and and the operating conditions

619
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,000
surrounding government uh the

620
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,919
competition was entirely remote for the

621
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,919
qualifier so there was minimal impact we

622
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:23,520
did end up having to postpone the final

623
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,200
round which uh executed in february 2021

624
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,360
a couple months ago we wrapped

625
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,080
president's cup 2

626
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,400
we had to do it completely remote

627
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:36,000
for the first three days we added an

628
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,640
extra day for the extra individual track

629
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:41,200
once we saw how much overlap there was

630
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,559
between the two tracks it's unfair to

631
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:44,799
ask somebody to compete in the morning

632
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:46,880
and then again compete in the afternoon

633
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:49,120
when the other folks in your track

634
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:51,360
aren't doing the same that's a long day

635
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,320
that's a long day a long day so uh we

636
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,240
added an extra day day one was

637
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,480
individuals track a day two was track b

638
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,000
and then the last two days with the team

639
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:01,280
competition

640
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,320
um

641
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:03,919
for the first three days there was

642
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:05,919
minimal impact we were able to leverage

643
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,840
the same technology that we use to do

644
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:11,520
the qualifiers to do the final round

645
00:22:11,679 --> 00:22:14,080
which which certainly helped but we were

646
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:16,000
left with this big problem of how do we

647
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:16,720
do

648
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:19,360
the escape room um this is really key to

649
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,799
our competition

650
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:22,480
and uh we certainly didn't want to

651
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,120
abandon it and we wanted to see what we

652
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,880
could do uh to to bring it into

653
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,960
well 2021 at this point in february uh

654
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,120
but we had to come up with some unique

655
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:37,200
solutions to how we were going to run

656
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:39,280
this especially keeping in mind

657
00:22:39,280 --> 00:22:41,440
we had to have minimal hardware software

658
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,039
requirements we we couldn't have a

659
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:45,520
finalist or a final team be unable to

660
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:47,120
participate because

661
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:49,200
they didn't have a system with a

662
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:51,520
particular operating system or

663
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,799
they didn't have the hardware

664
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:55,760
requirements to participate

665
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,360
so we looked into some outside of the

666
00:22:57,360 --> 00:22:58,799
box solutions you want to talk a little

667
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,200
bit about how we did that yeah so we

668
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,120
knew that we were going to have

669
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:03,919
our

670
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:07,120
remote competitors and we'd have roughly

671
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:09,520
actually when it comes to the

672
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:13,039
individuals uh finals we had um you know

673
00:23:13,039 --> 00:23:14,799
they were doing it on the same platform

674
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:17,120
as they did for the qualifiers so they

675
00:23:17,120 --> 00:23:19,520
didn't they kind of fell into the same

676
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:22,000
uh the same types of challenges and no

677
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,679
real new hardware requirements there but

678
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:25,200
on that final day

679
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,360
uh where we would uh record the live

680
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,559
stream uh we had a new client so instead

681
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,159
of the escape room this year it was the

682
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,559
save the world scenario and it was a

683
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:36,960
weather event that impacted uh a

684
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:39,360
municipality and you had to go in uh

685
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,720
with some remote uh droids and uh solve

686
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:45,600
problems solve uh cyber challenges in

687
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,279
this uh in this environment and so um we

688
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:50,960
had uh some pretty strict system

689
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,240
requirements when it came to that

690
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:55,600
because unity uh likes to use uh gpu

691
00:23:55,600 --> 00:23:58,559
graphics processing units in order to um

692
00:23:58,559 --> 00:24:00,960
render that environment and we couldn't

693
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:02,960
like you said uh ensure that everybody

694
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,559
already had that kind of gear

695
00:24:04,559 --> 00:24:05,679
certainly it's not going to be on their

696
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:07,679
government-issued laptop they're not

697
00:24:07,679 --> 00:24:09,520
going to have some beefy game playing

698
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,440
gpu so

699
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:14,159
so instead we enlisted the help of

700
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:15,840
microsoft azure

701
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,520
and their

702
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,039
cloud computing infrastructure

703
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:21,600
specifically cloud computing instances

704
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:23,200
that had

705
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:25,200
gpus attached to them

706
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:28,159
as well as some remoting technologies a

707
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:30,000
piece of software called parsec

708
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:33,440
that allowed us to offer out the game

709
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:36,159
systems to all of our remote competitors

710
00:24:36,159 --> 00:24:38,559
and uh and that also had the byproduct

711
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:40,640
of allowing us to capture the screen of

712
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:44,000
all those uh systems that were used in a

713
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,679
live stream and we actually did the live

714
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:48,480
stream again uh this past february we

715
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,159
had instead of two says a host we had uh

716
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:54,320
we had uh six different scissor hosts

717
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:56,320
that were spread across a six-hour time

718
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,360
period you want to talk a little bit

719
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,159
about that yeah uh we got bobby thompson

720
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:02,240
some help who was kind enough to return

721
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:05,120
and uh reprise his role as president's

722
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:06,240
cup host

723
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,880
um and he of course did a fantastic job

724
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:09,600
but

725
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,039
eight hours is a long day to be on a

726
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,600
live stream uh so we got him some help

727
00:25:13,600 --> 00:25:15,200
we had uh

728
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:18,080
three teams of two hosts that uh rotated

729
00:25:18,080 --> 00:25:19,679
in and out over the course of the day

730
00:25:19,679 --> 00:25:21,200
all of them did a fantastic job we're

731
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,880
extremely grateful that they volunteered

732
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:25,919
to to support the competition uh again

733
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:27,360
the the live stream from this year's

734
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,039
competition is up on youtube president's

735
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:31,840
cup cyber you'll be able to find it um

736
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,679
it was it was a really unique experience

737
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:35,279
doing it remotely

738
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:37,520
uh in contrast to the previous year when

739
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:39,120
we were all in person

740
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:42,559
uh it was it it had a different feel to

741
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:45,520
it but not really we were all in a from

742
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,200
an administrative standpoint on the back

743
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,400
end we had uh two separate zoom

744
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:53,200
sessions one for the live stream and one

745
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:55,039
for the challenge developers and sort of

746
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,400
the back end competition running

747
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,240
folks where we would discuss the

748
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:01,919
challenges discuss the approaches of the

749
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:04,640
competitors and how they were doing

750
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,360
and for support we actually

751
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:08,559
did something a little bit interesting

752
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:11,200
this year as well by utilizing uh just a

753
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,039
regular mattermost server which is an

754
00:26:13,039 --> 00:26:15,919
open source uh chat client it allowed us

755
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:18,240
to create rooms for the competitors for

756
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,760
the teams

757
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,840
and it gave us this direct line of

758
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,200
communication over the course of the

759
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,440
week which uh really helped us out and

760
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,919
making sure that the final rounds even

761
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:29,360
though they were remote really went off

762
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,520
without a hitch so matt do you want to

763
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,120
tell us a little bit about the scenarios

764
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:34,640
that we had in the final round this year

765
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:37,279
yeah absolutely so this was what we as i

766
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:38,880
mentioned earlier this was the save the

767
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,159
world scenario uh and it was uh split up

768
00:26:42,159 --> 00:26:44,000
into kind of five different if you want

769
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:46,159
sub scenarios uh

770
00:26:46,159 --> 00:26:49,440
areas of this uh city that were uh um

771
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:51,440
that were being addressed uh by this

772
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,320
team so the first up is the municipal

773
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:56,559
data center because of the collapse of a

774
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,640
nearby construction crane the facility

775
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,720
is running on generator power

776
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:02,320
while keeping within the allowed power

777
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:03,200
budget

778
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:05,520
the team must get critical city services

779
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:06,880
back online

780
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:09,760
the team being the disaster relief task

781
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:12,720
force or drtf

782
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:15,520
next up is the ngo data sharing

783
00:27:15,520 --> 00:27:17,279
challenge so

784
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:19,520
the team pilots a mobile command center

785
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,559
to various locations around the city

786
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:24,159
they're charged with gathering data from

787
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:26,559
each ngo despite inconsistent and

788
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:28,480
incomplete data sources and minimum

789
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,000
available hardware

790
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,919
now in other bad news this hospital is

791
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:33,679
suffering a malware outbreak that is

792
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:35,600
crippling their ability to see emergency

793
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,360
room patients during this natural

794
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:40,399
disaster and you're charged with

795
00:27:40,399 --> 00:27:43,120
getting the malware remediated so the

796
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:45,360
hospital can continue to operate

797
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:47,039
properly

798
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,960
now back at the disaster relief task

799
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,799
force command center a burst pipe has

800
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,799
affected operations while the network

801
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,399
has been hastily cobbled back together

802
00:27:54,399 --> 00:27:56,159
the team is now tasked with restoring

803
00:27:56,159 --> 00:27:58,399
the security of the network

804
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:01,039
and finally at an e-911 call center an

805
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:02,880
extortion threat has been made with a

806
00:28:02,880 --> 00:28:04,640
deadline 45 minutes before the

807
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,240
competition is over

808
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,760
the teams must analyze their threat

809
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,080
intelligence and defend against the most

810
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,720
likely avenue of attack

811
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:14,320
finally let's take a look at how the

812
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:16,640
winning team hacked you back in time

813
00:28:16,640 --> 00:28:18,880
started off their round the view you see

814
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,799
now is from one of our spotter

815
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:22,080
workstations

816
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,679
challenge developers observed the

817
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:25,919
progress of each team and provided cues

818
00:28:25,919 --> 00:28:27,840
to the live stream host to direct the

819
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:30,320
audience's attention hacky back in time

820
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:32,480
wisely decided to split up and do some

821
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:34,720
recon inside of each of the scenarios

822
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,679
you can see them at work deploying moths

823
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:40,320
which are the tool that you use to get

824
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,960
remote access to the workstations inside

825
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,279
the scenario so that they can easily

826
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:47,120
come back to systems as needed without

827
00:28:47,120 --> 00:28:49,279
spending extra time in the game client

828
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,120
they're also familiarizing themselves

829
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,200
with the challenge documentation inside

830
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,559
each scenario

831
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:56,159
that way each challenge will have an

832
00:28:56,159 --> 00:28:59,360
expert to answer questions later on

833
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,600
that's uh the summary of uh the

834
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:05,039
different scenarios and um uh you know

835
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,480
harry maybe you want to talk a little

836
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,679
bit about

837
00:29:07,679 --> 00:29:09,360
some interesting stuff that came after

838
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,480
that so especially in in 2021

839
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:14,159
uh with everything going on there's a

840
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:17,279
ton of interest in ransomware and

841
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,640
and uh given that we had a number of

842
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:21,039
scenarios that that involved uh

843
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,720
recovering from a ransomware attack and

844
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:25,039
preventing a ransomware attack we did

845
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:27,039
have some uh some interesting groups

846
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:29,360
reach out to us uh looking for more

847
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,720
information about the challenges and how

848
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,720
they'll be available and uh it is on the

849
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,000
roadmap to

850
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:36,399
release these challenges open source so

851
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:37,440
that

852
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,960
other entities can take them and use

853
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,960
them for training

854
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,080
use them for for educational purposes

855
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,000
it's really a core tenant of of the

856
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:47,279
president's cup that we make all this

857
00:29:47,279 --> 00:29:48,399
available

858
00:29:48,399 --> 00:29:50,320
uh the the value add here the

859
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:52,240
competition is is not just

860
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,080
while it is a key tenant of our

861
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,440
competition to identify challenge and

862
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,960
reward the best talent in the in the

863
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:59,520
federal government uh once we build

864
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,279
these challenges and once we build these

865
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:03,440
platforms uh we can only use the

866
00:30:03,440 --> 00:30:05,039
challenges once once they're used

867
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,080
they're burned

868
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:08,159
but there's an enduring value there for

869
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:10,640
training purposes for testing purposes

870
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,799
so providing these out to the community

871
00:30:12,799 --> 00:30:14,320
is is really important to us so if

872
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:16,080
you're a federal employee watching this

873
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,279
you can go to presidents cup that

874
00:30:17,279 --> 00:30:20,080
scissor.gov and you can log in

875
00:30:20,080 --> 00:30:22,240
and you can try any of our challenges

876
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,080
most of our challenges from

877
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:26,960
uh 2019 2020 competition

878
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,440
uh in addition all of our stuff is up on

879
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:32,080
github you can find the challenges at

880
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,520
uh the uh scissorgov github page you can

881
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:39,039
find the platform at sei cmu's github

882
00:30:39,039 --> 00:30:42,640
page and it is on our roadmap to provide

883
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,799
the 2020 challenges as open source as

884
00:30:44,799 --> 00:30:46,399
well as

885
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:48,399
providing the the platform used to run

886
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:51,039
the escape room which we think is

887
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,720
really a really interesting and

888
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,440
compelling way to deliver cyber security

889
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,320
training

890
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,240
yeah and i'll say that the traffic to

891
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:00,240
those different sites definitely picks

892
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:02,559
up as we're starting to enter the next

893
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:04,960
year's competition so we have

894
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,159
people that are interested in getting

895
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:09,200
involved they hear an advertisement or

896
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,120
something uh that

897
00:31:11,120 --> 00:31:13,679
tweaks their interest

898
00:31:13,679 --> 00:31:16,000
or something that piques their interest

899
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,039
that

900
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,679
they will uh you know go and seek out uh

901
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:21,679
the resources that we have on github uh

902
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:23,519
there's also youtube solve videos that

903
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:26,320
we've published for the 2019 challenges

904
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:28,720
so you can go back and see uh one way to

905
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,080
solve those challenges and uh a write-up

906
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:34,640
on how to do so and so we've tried to

907
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:37,519
make the most of this content in its uh

908
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:39,760
after the competition so that it's

909
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:42,159
useful as a training aid it's useful to

910
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,480
get uh acclimated with different nice

911
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:47,840
work roles and different nice uh

912
00:31:47,840 --> 00:31:49,760
tasks that are involved that the

913
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,519
challenge has borrowed from that the

914
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,080
competition is borrowed from and um

915
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,960
and all of the uh those artifacts then

916
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,080
just become

917
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,480
useful over time as we're constructing

918
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:02,559
future presidents cups yeah couldn't

919
00:32:02,559 --> 00:32:04,880
agree more uh one of the one of the big

920
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:06,880
lessons learned here is

921
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,080
if you want to know if somebody can do

922
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:09,440
something you

923
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,760
see if they can you make them do it so

924
00:32:11,760 --> 00:32:14,320
from a workforce development standpoint

925
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:15,600
from a cyber security training

926
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:16,799
standpoint

927
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:17,840
uh

928
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,440
being able to provide this as a resource

929
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:21,440
and an environment for

930
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,919
uh somebody to go in and and try their

931
00:32:23,919 --> 00:32:25,600
hands at a challenge and prove that they

932
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:28,000
can do something we think there's a ton

933
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,799
of value there and we're we're excited

934
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:33,279
to sort of see this shift in the broader

935
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:34,720
cyber security community towards

936
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:36,399
hands-on

937
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:38,080
hands-on testing for certifications and

938
00:32:38,080 --> 00:32:39,840
things like that and you know we

939
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,519
certainly provide what we use for the

940
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:42,960
president's cup as a resource to

941
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,760
hopefully enable that provide this to

942
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,519
organizations to build

943
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,159
labs to build training exercises to

944
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:51,039
build

945
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:53,039
uh really anything this the sky is

946
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:54,320
really the limit and we're really

947
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,760
excited to see what the community does

948
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,799
with it

949
00:32:56,799 --> 00:32:59,120
yeah and and on that note we are putting

950
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:01,919
together uh the software used for

951
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:03,840
president's cup in the form of a virtual

952
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:06,559
appliance that can be downloaded um uh

953
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:07,679
right around the time of black hat

954
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:09,360
actually uh we're going to be releasing

955
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,840
that out to the public and if you're

956
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,600
interested in taking a look at the

957
00:33:13,600 --> 00:33:15,840
software that's used for the competition

958
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,880
potentially using it for other

959
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,159
competitions

960
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,320
of your own making this appliance is

961
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:22,399
going to allow you to do that so keep on

962
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:24,960
the lookout for that on github and uh

963
00:33:24,960 --> 00:33:27,519
we'll have the pointers to that

964
00:33:27,519 --> 00:33:29,039
at the conference

965
00:33:29,039 --> 00:33:30,960
all right well uh

966
00:33:30,960 --> 00:33:33,919
from our cyber lab in in arlington

967
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:36,399
virginia this is harry and matt signing

968
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:41,158
off thanks black hat thanks a lot
