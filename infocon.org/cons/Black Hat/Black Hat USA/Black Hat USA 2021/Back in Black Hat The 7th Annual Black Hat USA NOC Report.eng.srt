00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:00,399
right let's just go

59
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,399
so we don't do this alone

60
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,040
we have a huge team of folks who help us

61
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,040
this is our team from this year we took

62
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,119
the mask off for a second because they

63
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,200
deserved to be seen

64
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,640
and then they went right back on the

65
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,160
other pictures we have were all massed

66
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,239
up and we were masked the entire time

67
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:18,160
that we were in the knock i will point

68
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,239
out in the center

69
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,640
being held on a laptop is

70
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,440
the knock queen marissa who works for um

71
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,280

72
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,680

73
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,280
uh black hat so she wasn't able to be

74

here boo coved

75
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:35,440
i think we can all safely boo covet

76
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:37,599
and then i will also call out really

77
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,800
quickly doc who is on the far right

78
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:43,200

79
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,599
so yay doc

80
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,080
doc works for mandalay bay i.t

81
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,040
and deals with our nonsense um for

82
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,560
months literally leading up to this

83
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,720
partners so uh you guys have seen this

84
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:58,000
as well for for those that have been

85
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,080
here those are the not this is a quick

86
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:02,319
run through um something that we always

87
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:03,519
kind of reiterate these are the partners

88
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,120
that work with us these are partners

89
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,200
they are not uh sponsors they're nobody

90
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,680
that pays to get inside the knock

91
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,760
these technologies have been chose over

92
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,159
the years by grifter myself and steve

93
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,560
fink our principal architect

94
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,480
and we go through this

95
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,920
basically as the customer so we go

96
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,000
through we're building a a network

97
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,200
operations center for black hat that is

98
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,879
all about the reliability as much as

99
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:28,560
people think that security is our main

100
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:30,640
goal obviously that's a close number two

101
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:31,599
but

102
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:34,159
when we have training classes uh the the

103
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,319
amount of labs that are in clouds uh

104
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:38,640
cloud environments these days uh we

105
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,920
don't wanna be the ones ruining

106
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,640
somebody's demo on stage um all of these

107
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,319
things come together and have developed

108
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,280
i don't know where i'm going what do

109
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:47,440
they give us uh okay so all of our

110
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,920
partners uh palo alto provides our core

111
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,280
we can get into all this too we'll we'll

112
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:53,040
see more lumen is centurylink they

113
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,879
provide all of our bandwidth

114
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:56,640
they change their name again right why

115
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,560
you just love changing their name

116
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,959
they're not the other

117
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:02,879
uh neil was really mad earlier making

118
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,159
this because the amount of logos that

119
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,720
changed so he's making point of that um

120
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,879
net witness provides uh operational

121
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,879
intelligence for us uh two factor

122
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:12,959
authentication and

123
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,400
endpoint on the

124
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,040
laptops we also have a new endpoint

125
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,399
agent that we deployed this year for

126
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:20,560
some other reasons uh cisco provided

127
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,120
that that is on ipads you guys saw the

128
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,639
ipads for registration we'll get into

129
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,479
that a little bit more as well uh

130
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:29,040
commscope and ruckus ruckus commscope

131
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,320
whatever you call them whoever they got

132
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:32,560
by last week uh those guys provide our

133
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,440
switching and wireless amazing there

134
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,360
gigamon provides all of our tap to

135
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,240
provide data to those tools and then a

136
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,639
new one this year is iron net uh and

137
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,880
again to that point that we are the

138
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,280
customers going through things ironnet

139
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,720
was welcomed into the noc this year to

140
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,720
look through uh data what they can

141
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:53,040
provide us and and see if it's a

142
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,320
partnership that will last so we'll go

143
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,600
through that and talk about some of the

144
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:57,520
data they've provided and

145
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,120
what that looks like yeah

146
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,400
occasionally we

147
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,120
yeah iron it um occasionally we bring in

148
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,280
you know other other equipment and as

149
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,120
bart said we're just kind of evaluating

150
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,880
it right um we

151
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,880
normally would do this at a an

152
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,479
international show we do it in london or

153
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:14,080
we do it in singapore because we feel

154
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,400
like it would be less impactful there

155
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:17,600
are normally

156
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,840
two to three thousand um attendees in

157
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,199
those shows versus the normally 25 000

158
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:24,880
people who are here

159
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:27,280
so um but because of the lower numbers

160
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,880
and because we knew we weren't doing

161
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:30,960
trainings this year we were just going

162
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,280
to be doing the briefings um we were

163
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:34,960
like okay well let's let's just bring it

164
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:36,639
in and see what happens at the the

165
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,560
flagship show and so

166
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,080
thanks for those guys for coming and

167
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:43,680
jumping right into the deep end

168
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:45,280
so the gear that these guys bring and

169
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,880
again this is uh basically build

170
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,479
materials but as you can see it's no

171
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:50,320
small feat we've talked about this a

172
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,160
little bit before and some of it hasn't

173
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,639
changed for some of them um

174
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,720
years the the first years with net

175
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,160
witness we had literally like two

176
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:00,240
pallets worth of gear from them things

177
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,520
have kind of lightened up that way but

178
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,919
just a quick rundown powell brings we

179
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:05,919
have an h a pair of firewalls 5260s

180
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:07,840
another one that's in tap mode for data

181
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:10,720
management running panorama cisco again

182
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:13,039
provides threat grid to detonate any

183
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,680
malware samples umbrella for dns meraki

184
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:17,840
sm is our mdm

185
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,919
ruckus a whole lot of

186
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:21,759
aps obviously as you can see around the

187
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:22,639
floor

188
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,000
they provide all of our switching as

189
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,080
well we replace the switches in the idf

190
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:27,680
as well as the mdf

191
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,840
again if you don't know we only use the

192
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:31,600
cables in the walls basically here from

193
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,600
mandalay bay

194
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,759
oh yeah i forgot to say that we don't

195
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,759
use any of the stuff here we replace

196
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,319
everything for two reasons one

197
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:43,440
control freaks um and then two

198
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:46,319
the um like our names are tied to this

199
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,039
so if it's going to go down in a fiery

200
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,440
ball um we're going to be riding that

201
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:53,680
ball straight to hell so

202
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:55,759
don't blame doc

203
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,639
it'll be us um net witness brings quite

204
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,639
a bit the head unit decoder and

205
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,720
concentrator tons of data obviously that

206
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:05,360
we can store every packet every log

207
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,319
from the show is stored um we haven't

208
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:09,360
talked about this i guess we're getting

209
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,479
comfortable with how we talk about all

210
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:12,000
that data is removed at the end of the

211
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
show none of that is kept for research

212
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,880
or marketing purposes so you may be dumb

213
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,639
on site and see some unencrypted stuff

214
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,919
but we'll get rid of that for you don't

215
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:20,720
worry

216
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,199
um you'll rebroadcast it immediately

217
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:24,960
somewhere else but we'll at least delete

218
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,039
it so

219
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,080
gigamon provides a gigaview hc2 they

220
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,400
provide tap again uh this is feeding all

221
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,039
of our tools that data ir net product uh

222
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,639
brought their devices a lot of theirs

223
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,639
feeds up into the cloud as well

224
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:40,479
so the hardware that was on site is two

225
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:43,280
is 3500s and then lumen we have our two

226
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:46,160
10 gig circuits uh one to denver one to

227
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:49,120
sunnyvale um and those are all used via

228
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,160
bgp

229
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,560
and um

230
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,319
it was interesting because we we don't

231
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,240
use tons of bandwidth we've said we

232
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:57,840
don't we haven't blown out those two 10

233
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,919
gig circuits in years past uh it did

234
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:01,199
look a little bit more than we expected

235
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,319
this year though with streaming and

236
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:04,080
stuff going out as well so

237
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:05,360
um

238
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,039
quick architecture diagram um

239
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:10,479
a lot of this has stayed the same over

240
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:12,080
the years in a lot of ways we're

241
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:14,639
definitely a keep a simple stupid um

242
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,039
there's so much in this environment that

243
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,879
that changes

244
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:21,520
on a weekly daily monthly basis leading

245
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:23,440
up to the show hourly before you know

246
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,520
changes are made that if it's way too

247
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,599
complex we can't add and remove and

248
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:28,960
strike things so it's as simple as

249
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,280
possible um it's all about the data and

250
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:34,320
reliancy reliability uh and reliance of

251
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:36,559
that network reliancy it's a cool word

252
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:39,200
that i just made up it's new use it you

253
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,958
know what it'll be the name of a vendor

254
00:08:40,958 --> 00:08:43,599
in the expo hall the next show

255
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:45,120
reliancy

256
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,640
we always walk through the show floor to

257
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:48,080
kind of see what's out there you know do

258
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,680
our due diligence and this year was

259
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,120
there's some names for inner chode um

260
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,600
okay

261
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:57,440
so um so we have a lot of dashboards

262
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:59,680
that are um in the knock normally you

263
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,440
would see those just by being able to

264
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:03,200
come in and walk through but we made a

265
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,000
decision this year very early on to um

266
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,440
to close the knock right we were just

267
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,720
like we're not gonna have thousands of

268
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,880
people going through for selfish reasons

269
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:13,279
that didn't come to fruition anyways

270
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:14,560
right one

271
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,720
you don't get to breathe my hair

272
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:20,160
and two you don't want to breathe my air

273
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:22,399
um and so we were like yeah let's let's

274
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:24,399
just let's close it that will allow us

275
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:27,360
to require vaccination for everybody

276
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,200
who's going to help out in the knock and

277
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,640
since the knock is closed then we'll be

278
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,560
able to take off our freaking masks

279
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,560
yeah so um so we wore masks the whole

280
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,240
time and we closed a knock but normally

281
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,360
like people come in and they're like are

282
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,880
you actually looking at stuff what are

283
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:42,399
all these things they're not just you

284
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,720
know shiny things like that's oip in the

285
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,240
middle you saw it moving there for a

286
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,360
minute um the green traffic is tcp the

287
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,399
red is udp icmp shows up as white and

288
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:53,920
looks like starburst if somebody's

289
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,560
scanning or the traffic will get larger

290
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,240
you see different things where the more

291
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,839
traffic that's being passed it's a quick

292
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:01,519
visual indicator of different hosts on

293
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,440
the network and how much data they're

294
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:05,519
passing or what they're communicating to

295
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:07,600
which will then give us an idea

296
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,040
should we need do we need to go look at

297
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,040
that what's somebody doing

298
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,720
and we'll go check it out and pivot to

299
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,399
something like net witness

300
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,079
and say can you show us what these guys

301
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:17,440
are doing

302
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:20,720
um there are a lot of dashboards um some

303
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,880
dashboards here from cisco

304
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,720
again like this is all like useful

305
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,160
information telling us about what our

306
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,320
devices are doing so you know like here

307
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,079
on the right you can see it's like oh

308
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:32,240
there's all of your endpoint stuff that

309
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:34,640
we had tied to the cisco endpoint

310
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:37,120
solution which were

311
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,320
all of the registration ipads all of the

312
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,640
lead retrieval stuff that the vendors

313
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,880
and the expo hall were using and those

314
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,640
are the types of devices that were used

315
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,399
on the side i don't know if you guys

316
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:50,079
find things like that interesting we

317
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,480
just put things on slides for you

318
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:55,600
um but what you also see is that we did

319
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,000
have a like satellite view of the

320
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,079
convention space and then could actually

321
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,920
map out here or where the devices are

322
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,480
deployed across um you know this space

323
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,200
which looks cool um

324
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:10,160
more than it's probably useful

325
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:11,600
but we like stuff like that i'm not too

326
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,800
worried if one of those ipads

327
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:14,000
disappeared because you see it out by

328
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,959
the way oh no that would be an

329
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,360
interesting the ipad mini 4 walked off

330
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,079
um so

331
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,680
that doesn't mean go steal them just i i

332
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,079
realized who i was talking to

333
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,000
immediately after i stopped to check it

334
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,279
yeah

335
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:33,279
yeah grifter said it was okay

336
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:35,680
um yeah so again more dashboard stuff

337
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,519
here from ironnet and netwitness just

338
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:39,680
giving us like all the datas we'll take

339
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,220
all the datas

340
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,920
[Music]

341
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,440
so um

342
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,480
we haven't really talked about a few

343
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,399
things too i think we missed so uh the

344
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:49,519
other interesting thing that we try to

345
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,200
do outside of closing the knock and

346
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,440
obviously being a fishbowl normally

347
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:55,680
and kind of allowing you guys to come in

348
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:58,880
ask questions see all the dashboards um

349
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,320
we actually decided to do a twitch

350
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:01,760
stream which we should be there so

351
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,360
everybody yell and say hi to twitch if

352
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,639
we're there right now um but we uh we

353
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:08,399
kind of like that interaction in a weird

354
00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,600
way so

355
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:11,120
while you don't want to breathe grifters

356
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,800
there we do enjoy seeing you guys and

357
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,320
talking to you and answering questions

358
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,639
that we can do

359
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,800
in a lot of ways this is for you guys so

360
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:20,639
between twitch and trying to to share as

361
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,079
much data here

362
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:23,680
the stats get interesting you guys are

363
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:25,519
nerdy and we go through all this so uh

364
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:26,800
stats buys i don't know that we

365
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:27,839
necessarily need to run through anything

366
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,519
here it was kind of cool like having the

367
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,800
twitch thing i think i don't know yeah

368
00:12:30,800 --> 00:12:32,800
you might say keep it around even if it

369
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:34,399
because there were folks that like like

370
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,000
we're friends with who are

371
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
international you know and they couldn't

372
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,440
come to the show and they were like

373
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,279
watching us on twitch and taunting us

374
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:42,639
and everything like that do you notice

375
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,360
this slide really lit up the audience

376
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,800
like look at beautiful faces look at

377
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,200
that guy's jawline

378
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,279
the uh we may keep twitch around too so

379
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,360
if we're in singapore and london maybe

380
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:54,560
you guys can watch us yeah we'll see how

381
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:55,680
it goes yeah if you don't make it out

382
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,120
there you'll get to see what's going on

383
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,800
in the knock and ask us questions in

384
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:00,720
chat and stuff like that so but you can

385
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:02,639
see um you know some stats here things

386
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:04,320
like the amount of data like written to

387
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,959
disk a lot of encrypted traffic and you

388
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,720
know was being passed over the network

389
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:09,920
obviously we don't we don't keep those

390
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:11,760
payloads because they're encrypted and

391
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,600
we're not like you know drink more oval

392
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,959
team to try to figure out what you guys

393
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:17,839
are doing um but

394
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:19,600
it we do want to know like what's being

395
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,279
passed how much of the traffic is

396
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:22,959
encrypted and things have gotten much

397
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:24,800
much better than they were in years past

398
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:28,079
um and and you know bravo there not

399
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,160
everything is encrypted but i one day

400
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,360
we'll get there

401
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,760
not everything is encrypted you'll see

402
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:36,560
um so this here is our dns stats so you

403
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,680
can see on the left hand side in 2017 21

404
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,040
million requests then 39 million then 49

405
00:13:43,040 --> 00:13:46,000
million and then this year one-fifth of

406
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,040
that

407
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,800
a lot of that probably has to do with

408
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,959
the fact that we didn't have 85 training

409
00:13:50,959 --> 00:13:52,480
classes going on at the same time with a

410
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:54,880
bunch of shenanigans going on

411
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,040
but we figured we'd throw it out there

412
00:13:57,040 --> 00:13:58,720
and also point out something interesting

413
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:02,320
which is that in 2019 we saw 3 600

414
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,360
unique applications that were used on on

415
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,880
the network

416
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,360
this year we saw 2600

417
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:11,680
with a fifth with a fifth of of the

418
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,760
traffic and and i'll point out too that

419
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:15,199
a lot of times the

420
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:16,800
most of the traffic that we see in a

421
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,880
normal year is is from the training

422
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:20,720
classes so a lot of that is skewed in

423
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,320
that way so seeing this just from the

424
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,839
briefing side and attendees that were

425
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:26,000
here um that may be something

426
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,079
interesting to see what how that changes

427
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:29,920
we should call out there was one

428
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:31,199
training class

429
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,240
um so

430
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:34,959
so thanks street yeah so we we were like

431
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:35,760
hey

432
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,199
you know there's not going to be any

433
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,560
trainings on site at black hat

434
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,240
everybody's going to do it virtual and

435
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,600
then trainers started hitting us up

436
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:42,959
being like well i want to go to the

437
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:44,160
briefing so i'm going to need to be

438
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:45,760
there wednesday morning my class doesn't

439
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:47,600
end until late on tuesday i'm not going

440
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:48,800
to be able to get to the keynote all

441
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:50,399
this other stuff or people were just

442
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,800
like my connection sucks i don't want to

443
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:55,920
host this class you can i come to black

444
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:59,440
hat you give me a room that i can sit in

445
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,720
and then at least i have a stable

446
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,639
connection that i can work from

447
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,040
and a few trainers

448
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:06,720
did that we gave them the option to do

449
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,240
that but then they started dropping off

450
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,639
as as the stats for vegas got worse and

451
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,240
we had one class which was jason

452
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:15,120
street's class so jason came in and sat

453
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:18,240
in a very large classroom all by himself

454
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:20,160
talking to a webcam

455
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,720
but what that meant was that

456
00:15:22,720 --> 00:15:24,720
we still had to have the network up and

457
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:27,360
functional on saturday morning for him

458
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:29,759
to start his class and that doesn't mean

459
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,079
that we deploy less equipment or we do

460
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,320
whatever i mean we did say obviously

461
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:36,000
like make sure the access points go out

462
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,839
in the area that he's going to be in but

463
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,759
it meant that we still had to have

464
00:15:39,759 --> 00:15:42,399
everything up by the time that that

465
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,279
class started so we were here well

466
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,120
switches started getting deployed last

467
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,720
monday

468
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:51,279
we showed up on thursday well think

469
00:15:51,279 --> 00:15:53,120
showed up on wednesday

470
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:55,680
we showed up on on thursday and then

471
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,199
everything had to be up saturday morning

472
00:15:57,199 --> 00:16:00,160
so one class or 100 classes

473
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:04,079
the network has to be deployed

474
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,680
i love the titles they're always the

475
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:08,480
best

476
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:10,720
um the internet is inside of you it's

477
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:12,320
inside of all of us especially if you

478
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,320
went down on the show floor so

479
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,279
so this is an interesting one that um

480
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,160
so over the years uh mandalay bay has

481
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,079
actually provided the wireless for any

482
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:24,720
of the booths on the show floor um that

483
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,639
was just something that for us that was

484
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,720
a little bit much to handle all these

485
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:31,040
guys coming with requests etc uh but

486
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:33,040
then as that got a little bit more crazy

487
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:36,639
and we started kind of expanding our

488
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:38,720
hold on the network if you will

489
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,240
throughout the

490
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,680
the wireless channels were getting

491
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,160
pretty uh insane down there so we asked

492
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:45,759
that that man do they may actually turn

493
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,199
off their wireless down there we'd take

494
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:48,880
it over have some

495
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:50,480
more control over the channel

496
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,560
let ruckus do their thing make sure that

497
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,240
it's designed and working

498
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,399
as good as possible it was an awesome

499
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,560
thought

500
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:00,000
the thing about all of those vendor

501
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:02,880
booths is the cool tvs that have roku's

502
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,640
built into him now

503
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,559
you're not there yet save it huh you're

504
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:08,480
not there yet oh we're not we're

505
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,919
we're jumping in so

506
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:11,439
in this though on the show for some of

507
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:12,959
those came from that some of the show

508
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,720
four uh

509
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,799
networks came from some of those beacons

510
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,359
but anyways we saw over 550 active

511
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,039
wireless networks at one point on the

512
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:24,559
show floor uh and rf channel utilization

513
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,199
anything over 75 percent is ridiculous

514
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,280
and you can see some of those in pink

515
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,640
it's considered unusable at that point

516
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,480
we've got more data here to come into

517
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:35,679
the the roku things but the uh the show

518
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,799
floor was getting a little insane with

519
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:38,240
the wireless network so this type of

520
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,320
data and seeing how that works and

521
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,799
how we solve that problem is

522
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,000
is coming

523
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,080
is that pink to you that's purple to me

524
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:47,360
i'm colorblind why are you gonna call me

525
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:49,120
out up here yeah

526
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:50,080
you don't know the difference between

527
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,520
pink and purple i learned something new

528
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,440
about you every day bart we've known

529
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:54,799
each other 16 years i didn't know you

530
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:56,000
didn't know the difference between pink

531
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:58,240
and purple all right

532
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,000
but yeah and that is a 60-second

533
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,559
snapshot of the expo floor this

534
00:18:02,559 --> 00:18:05,679
afternoon so 552 active wireless

535
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:08,400
networks in a 60-second snapshot

536
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:10,720
all of that passing through your

537
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:13,200
delicious bodies um

538
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,600
the internet just flying through who

539
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:16,640
knows

540
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,240
what went through you

541
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,799
while you were down there disgusting

542
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,080
you'll see coming up what might have

543
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,639
gone through you

544
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:28,799
did someone just say i felt something

545
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,720
i felt someone's tax return go through

546
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,600
me cool

547
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:34,559
so

548
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,480
we'll talk about this a little bit bart

549
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:39,600
touched on it before but the

550
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,039
the network is always changing it's

551
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:42,400
always evolving we have talked about

552
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,240
this in years past but there's plenty of

553
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,080
new folks so we'll we'll get into it a

554
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,840
little bit also

555
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,640
it's never going to evolve that gif

556
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,880
so i'll just let that haunt you for the

557
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,840
next several minutes while we talk about

558
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,919
it so the key the main goal for us is

559
00:18:57,919 --> 00:18:59,520
stability right we need to have things

560
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:01,039
up and functioning and that was the main

561
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,520
goal when i took over the black hat

562
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,960
network operations 19 years ago

563
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,960
the early years of black hat were very

564
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,840
very

565
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,919
wild west like everybody attacked

566
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,200
everything um ev it was it was an

567
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:16,559
absolute insanity which meant the

568
00:19:16,559 --> 00:19:18,960
stability of the network was really poor

569
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,760
we got it to a place where it was very

570
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:23,840
stable but it wasn't very secure and so

571
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:26,400
we started focusing more on security

572
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,640
you know host isolation segmentation

573
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,240
keeping classes from attacking one

574
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:32,400
another because the red team you know

575
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:34,320
class would attack the blue team class

576
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:36,880
and then laugh and laugh like ha ha find

577
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:39,440
this right you know so

578
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,080
it became about keeping attendees honest

579
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,760
as well keeping you from being able to

580
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:46,640
attack one another as much as we could

581
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:48,880
and and so

582
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:50,799
from all of that activity over years

583
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:52,880
you'd always see articles and they still

584
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:54,559
publish them every year including up up

585
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:56,400
coming up to this one where people say

586
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:58,080
the black hat network is one of the most

587
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:00,480
hostile networks in the world and that

588
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:02,240
is true

589
00:20:02,240 --> 00:20:04,480
um to an extent

590
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,400
it's just the stuff that you're doing on

591
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,320
the network that makes it appear to be

592
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,919
the most hostile network in the world

593
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,919
there's a lot of interesting stuff going

594
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,320
on and we were curious about whether or

595
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,320
not that was true and so we said okay

596
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:17,360
well let's

597
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:19,200
do some hunting right can we go in here

598
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,440
and get some visibility into it start

599
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:23,120
pulling logs from all of our different

600
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:25,919
sources grab full packet captures end

601
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,000
point from the places that we could and

602
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,679
start looking into that and we were like

603
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:31,919
oh wow yeah

604
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:35,440
it is bad and so

605
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:37,360
it's it's a it's a very interesting

606
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,320
network

607
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:40,159
that um

608
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:41,760
when we were on there looking around we

609
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:42,960
obviously started seeing signs of

610
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,400
different types of malware and our

611
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,400
activity going on and quite a bit of it

612
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,400
and so we're like well let's

613
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,159
look deeper let's take a look at these

614
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:51,919
different variants find out what they do

615
00:20:51,919 --> 00:20:53,200
let's interact with this thing so we

616
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,400
started doing sandboxing um and and

617
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,480
that's just how it evolved like as our

618
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:00,240
industry has evolved and found things to

619
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,840
be more and more important our network

620
00:21:01,840 --> 00:21:04,559
here at black hat has evolved as well

621
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,520
and sometimes um

622
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,120
i don't know how to say it without it

623
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:10,080
i'm not going to say this because it's

624
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,840
going to sound arrogant i don't mean it

625
00:21:11,840 --> 00:21:13,520
to sound that way but we'll do it and

626
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:15,120
then a couple of years later it will

627
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:17,360
become like a big a bigger thing like

628
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,880
everyone's like oh we should do this

629
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:20,559
thing i think that's just due to the

630
00:21:20,559 --> 00:21:22,000
nature of what we're dealing with and

631
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,320
people will come to us and be like

632
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:26,559
we have a new way for you to maybe try

633
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:28,640
something out and we start you know beta

634
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:31,200
testing this kind of crap on the network

635
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,400
that's part of the interesting piece to

636
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,320
not paying for the equipment too yeah

637
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,679
that's one thing that's nice for us is

638
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:37,200
because they're our partners and they

639
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:38,000
just

640
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,919
give us their equipment and people and

641
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:41,039
time

642
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,120
we're able to be like oh that sounds

643
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,679
really cool sure let's try it not like

644
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,760
oh that's a corner

645
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,360
this other one doesn't expire for six

646
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:51,840
months so we can't so yeah people are

647
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,679
just excited to see what their stuff

648
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:55,039
does on the network and that's been

649
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:57,360
really great for us we added identity

650
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,280
and access management stuff probably at

651
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,600
this point about 10 years ago or eight

652
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,840
years ago when we were working with a

653
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,320
vendor who with the best of intentions

654
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:07,520
was making changes to their

655
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,360
configurations and doing updates to

656
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:11,280
their devices that they had brought into

657
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:13,520
the knock and unfortunately caused an

658
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,039
outage in the morning for training

659
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,520
classes that was about 90 minutes it was

660
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,240
the longest outage we've ever had um at

661
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,159
black hat and so we were like well we

662
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:23,919
can't allow even though they're partners

663
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:25,600
and we do have this like certain amount

664
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,280
of trust we can't trust that their

665
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:28,799
everything is going to go well and we

666
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:31,039
would have never approved the changes

667
00:22:31,039 --> 00:22:32,960
that they were making and so now the

668
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:35,200
only changes that can be committed

669
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,039
the you know all of the partners can can

670
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,640
go in and change the configurations but

671
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:40,480
they can't actually commit them unless

672
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,280
bart myself or steve pushes a button

673
00:22:43,280 --> 00:22:44,480
right so

674
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:47,039
um the endpoint side of things we once

675
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:48,400
tried to

676
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,720
to say like even just using certificates

677
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:52,080
with you guys and stuff and everybody

678
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,480
was like i'm not installing a damn thing

679
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,799
from black hat right so

680
00:22:56,799 --> 00:22:58,159
we don't expect that you're going to go

681
00:22:58,159 --> 00:22:59,840
out and deploy endpoint agents on all

682
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,159
your devices but we do have some of our

683
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:03,760
own and that's the registration stuff

684
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,120
the lead retrieval stuff and we were

685
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,640
like well let's get something on there

686
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:09,039
as well and that's been really nice and

687
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,640
another thing that we added a couple of

688
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:13,600
years ago was automation for certain

689
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,440
things um

690
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:16,400
i don't know do you want to talk about

691
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:17,280
this i feel like i've been talking a

692
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:19,360
long time you have been so uh the

693
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:21,360
automation piece of what we do

694
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,200
and soar is one of the big things as far

695
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,400
as automation that we've been doing for

696
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,240
a little while that seems to get

697
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:27,760
interesting and again not as an arrogant

698
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:29,280
way it's nice to see that and see some

699
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:30,880
of that technology come and let us play

700
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:32,960
with it uh before it's really out there

701
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,159
if you will so

702
00:23:34,159 --> 00:23:37,600
between the uh threat connect uh

703
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:40,880
net witness and palo alto cisco there's

704
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,559
a whole

705
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,200
slew of things here we get the data uh

706
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:47,120
seeing whether it's clear text confirmed

707
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,039
malware or crypto mining

708
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:50,720
we get the data of the endpoint that

709
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:52,640
data is passed on

710
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,320
through apis to put the user device in a

711
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:58,240
group so they are then

712
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:00,640
presented with a captive portal when you

713
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:03,520
hit any clear text web page after that

714
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:05,120
as you can see it's nothing crazy we're

715
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,120
not asking for credentials but we'll let

716
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:08,960
you know what we saw so if that's again

717
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:11,679
the three that we actively do right now

718
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:13,440
uh if we see any clear text account

719
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,240
credentials malware or

720
00:24:16,240 --> 00:24:17,679
crypto mining we'll let you know you can

721
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:19,120
come visit and see if there's anything

722
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,360
there um here's a quick acknowledgement

723
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,279
of what wheat again the way that that

724
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,000
happens the flow uh basically i'll show

725
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:27,200
in there that there's a kill switch if

726
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,000
you will so we don't get a 500 false

727
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,200
positive

728
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:32,720
group of users that are added to that

729
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:34,000
group and then all of a sudden everybody

730
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,240
gets a

731
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,000
captive portal and that would not look

732
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:39,360
good on the black hat network to some

733
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:40,640
extent we wanted to make sure that at

734
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,559
least didn't look bad in any

735
00:24:42,559 --> 00:24:44,480
false positive so we approve each one of

736
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:46,159
those groups that gets added in but

737
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:47,279
there's your automation there's some

738
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,039
other flows that we're looking to do

739
00:24:49,039 --> 00:24:50,480
and add to the network but as far as

740
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:52,000
this goes it's been

741
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,520
hopefully helpful to you guys to see

742
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,120
anything if that's there

743
00:24:55,120 --> 00:24:56,480
but we also don't want to break anything

744
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,159
so if you're intending to

745
00:24:58,159 --> 00:24:59,919
mine cryptocurrency while you're here

746
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:01,440
then you at least know that we saw it

747
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,279
and you can keep doing your thing yeah

748
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:05,360
carry on and if you're just running a

749
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,760
bunch of malware on your device go forth

750
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:10,480
and be disgusting right so um yeah if

751
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,000
not you can come tell us

752
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,360
we'll tell we'll talk to you about what

753
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,720
data we saw what it looks like if

754
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,240
there's anything we can do to help etc

755
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,240
so yeah and that again that happens

756
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,279
through a bunch of the different

757
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:21,200
partners in there so the collaboration

758
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:22,960
uh between the partners and the knock is

759
00:25:22,960 --> 00:25:24,640
really nice and in some cases these

760
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:26,880
folks are competitors to one another out

761
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,799
in the field right they're trying to get

762
00:25:28,799 --> 00:25:31,679
your dollars um you know first from one

763
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:33,520
another but when we go into the knock

764
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,000
the amount of actual partnership and it

765
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:37,919
truly is a partnership is incredible

766
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:39,840
between these folks

767
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:43,600
all right it's story time so if you were

768
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,240
here in 2019 you remember this slide

769
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,159
because it's the exact same slide from

770
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,400
2019 i think you know where this is

771
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,000
going

772
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,840
it was the exact same thing yeah we

773
00:25:53,840 --> 00:25:54,640
brought

774
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,840
we brought in uh in 2019 uh informa the

775
00:25:57,840 --> 00:25:59,520
company that owns black hat brought in a

776
00:25:59,520 --> 00:26:00,640
security

777
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:02,960
company to do other security things for

778
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,400
them like physical security and other

779
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:06,159
stuff if you remember in 2019 there was

780
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,159
an event the year before that caused

781
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:10,480
some extra security here mandalay bay

782
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,600
there was a need to have that and but

783
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:16,080
this company that they hired had sent

784
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,120
out the full like security plan in the

785
00:26:19,120 --> 00:26:21,360
clear over the black hat network so they

786
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,720
got on the blackout network and sent

787
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,320
everything in the clear including like

788
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:26,240
what the badge colors were what all of

789
00:26:26,240 --> 00:26:28,559
the volunteers t-shirt colors and what

790
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:29,840
they were gonna look like all of that

791
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:33,360
stuff um well they're back

792
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,480
and they're doing it again so nothing

793
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:38,159
learned in two years it's too bad we let

794
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:39,919
them know they were like oh we didn't

795
00:26:39,919 --> 00:26:41,840
send the file yet

796
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:43,760
and i'm like you still didn't fix it

797
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,559
though um so don't send the file so yeah

798
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:48,640
so like i said it's like we we'd like to

799
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:50,320
point out where even like we fall on our

800
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:53,039
face and and even if it is a

801
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,039
you know third party or whatever it

802
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,120
still still kind of sucks but we we

803
00:26:57,120 --> 00:26:59,279
dodged the bullet of having this year's

804
00:26:59,279 --> 00:27:01,039
entire security plan sent across the

805
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,720
network in the clear and while that's

806
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:04,320
the story that we talk about there are

807
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,720
tons of uh clear text credentials as

808
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,080
well we get emails and all that kind of

809
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,240
stuff so i dug into this story a little

810
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:11,680
bit and ruined it i guess

811
00:27:11,680 --> 00:27:13,200
[Music]

812
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,600
it's okay so as far as the smart devices

813
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,520
on the floor again we saw in that

814
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:19,919
60-second span 550 different networks

815
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:21,200
one of the issues that we had the very

816
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,600
first morning of the

817
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,360
show for the morning the show yesterday

818
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,480
morning

819
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,919
while everybody the vendors come in a

820
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,760
few days earlier more than that in some

821
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,360
cases and build out that show for and

822
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:32,480
all the booths

823
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,600
and while they're doing that they test

824
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,039
all of their stuff so the tvs that

825
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,279
they're showing stuff on etc

826
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:40,159
all of that gets fired up in you know

827
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:42,399
sequence in some way different groups of

828
00:27:42,399 --> 00:27:44,159
vendors starting their stuff up well in

829
00:27:44,159 --> 00:27:46,320
the morning when everybody came in

830
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,039
all of those tvs that had roku's all the

831
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:50,799
cell phones all the laptops everything

832
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:53,120
connecting um

833
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,279
it was basically impossible for anything

834
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,520
to talk because there was so much

835
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:01,039
communication so much rf uh in the show

836
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,919
floor it was very

837
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,799
hard for you guys um but as you can see

838
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:08,960
again that channel utilization they say

839
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,480
over 75

840
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,159
is unusable and as you can see um

841
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:16,080
that's not good yeah it's like it's

842
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,679
quite a bit

843
00:28:17,679 --> 00:28:18,880
yeah so

844
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,399
it's uh

845
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:21,919
you know it's interesting when again

846
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:24,480
there was 522 different networks right

847
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:26,880
and then everything jumping on all in

848
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,720
one day like we're just we'd dust and

849
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,399
that's not really something i mean

850
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:32,000
how do you solve that turn off the tvs

851
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,240
right don't bring smart tvs maybe until

852
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,440
that's that's an interesting one that

853
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,039
you know we hadn't really seen run into

854
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,960
that way even a couple years ago and

855
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,320
uh

856
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,919
maybe the smart devices weren't as crazy

857
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:42,960
i don't know if we're getting more but

858
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:44,720
yeah it's uh it was it was pretty hectic

859
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:47,200
down strap the tvs in tin foil that'll

860
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,480
do it and promise you to do it

861
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,200
um so this was interesting uh we always

862
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,880
talk about so the things that happen as

863
00:28:54,880 --> 00:28:58,080
far as how we approach um the security

864
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,520
of the network or whether or not we

865
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,080
block things or not is is

866
00:29:02,080 --> 00:29:04,399
really that we let a lot of things go we

867
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:05,840
let a lot of things go because we don't

868
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,320
want to be responsible for

869
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:10,320
we don't want to be the demo gods who

870
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:12,640
crush a demo and we also don't want to

871
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,559
stop something in a hallway even if

872
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:15,600
you're just sitting down with one of

873
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:17,279
your friends on a bench and you're like

874
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:18,880
check out this new thing or you're

875
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,720
working on a tool and you're like let me

876
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,399
show you what i'm doing

877
00:29:22,399 --> 00:29:24,880
we don't we don't block a lot what we do

878
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,760
block is if we can basically confirm

879
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:30,640
that it is a an a genuine attack against

880
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:32,880
the public internet right because people

881
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,520
learn things in classes or from a stage

882
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:37,520
and then like i'm gonna go try that um

883
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,360
and so they immediately start firing

884
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,559
that off at

885
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,720
the internet if we see that we'll stop

886
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,200
it if we see

887
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,360
a what looks like a direct attack on

888
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:50,000
another individual here then we'll stop

889
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:52,240
that or

890
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,559
an attack on our infrastructure so if we

891
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,240
see something that's coming at directly

892
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:58,720
at us then we're like well that that

893
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,399
doesn't make any sense so let's kill

894
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:04,559
that in this case we did see um

895
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,919
some some traffic from russia where it

896
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:09,360
was they weren't even trying to hide

897
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,120
they were just hammering trying to get

898
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,640
at our reg server trying to do remote

899
00:30:12,640 --> 00:30:15,039
code execution going after it and we're

900
00:30:15,039 --> 00:30:17,440
just like what and looking at the

901
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,399
reputational data on it it was bad like

902
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,399
it was actually like something that we

903
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:24,559
had to care about and so you know we put

904
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:25,760
all the blocks in place and did

905
00:30:25,760 --> 00:30:28,640
everything but we're just like wow like

906
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,520
just gloves off like not even but again

907
00:30:31,520 --> 00:30:33,039
not even trying to not even trying to

908
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,000
hide it

909
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,360
dave

910
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:38,880
dave's not here man

911
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,240
so again interesting stuff in the way

912
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:41,919
that people try to do different things

913
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:42,880
um

914
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,840
so we had someone from a mobile device

915
00:30:45,840 --> 00:30:48,000
try and uh ddos

916
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,520
from that mobile device which again is

917
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,919
interesting it was only one device a for

918
00:30:51,919 --> 00:30:53,520
creativity i guess i don't know that's

919
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:54,399
that's

920
00:30:54,399 --> 00:30:55,600
um

921
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,600
dave was wandering around and his host

922
00:30:57,600 --> 00:30:59,360
name uh was

923
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,120
david's iphone so that's why we know it

924
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:03,039
was dave um

925
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:04,799
we know what ap he was on and we thought

926
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:06,880
about running down and just yelling that

927
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,880
david should stop uh

928
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:10,960
we never found dave uh but he was

929
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,039
definitely trying to do some ddos from

930
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:14,399
an iphone so that's unique and

931
00:31:14,399 --> 00:31:17,519
interesting um thanks dave yeah we

932
00:31:17,519 --> 00:31:19,200
didn't find dave so he's still out there

933
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:21,840
wherever you're at dave um but

934
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,399
like we do things like that like we have

935
00:31:24,399 --> 00:31:26,960
gone into like training classes and been

936
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,679
like you know attacking you know

937
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,600
an actual public website is still

938
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,760
illegal like even at black hat like

939
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,360
we'll do that and then you'll see some

940
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:37,279
like that traffic will stop right so

941
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:39,120
sometimes just yelling like

942
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:41,039
we can see you

943
00:31:41,039 --> 00:31:42,799
like makes people stop

944
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:44,080
it's also an interesting thing i guess

945
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,360
to tie back to the automation this is a

946
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,960
big reason we actually doing started

947
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:48,399
doing some of the automation so we'd run

948
00:31:48,399 --> 00:31:50,000
into backup training classes when we saw

949
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,919
any of that oh you got you you're hosed

950
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:53,360
you should turn that laptop off kind of

951
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:54,159
thing

952
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:55,360
but once they were out of the training

953
00:31:55,360 --> 00:31:56,720
classes i mean

954
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,159
i have an ip address and kind of know

955
00:31:58,159 --> 00:31:59,519
where someone is in a hallway as far as

956
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:02,640
the ap or wireless goes but uh we wanted

957
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,000
to be able to give some of that data no

958
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,760
matter where you are and that's hence

959
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,120
the uh the captive portal so that would

960
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:08,159
have been interesting we could have just

961
00:32:08,159 --> 00:32:10,240
said hi dave

962
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:13,200
hi dave dave wasn't there though

963
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:15,440
um all right so this one i it was

964
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:16,559
interesting

965
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:18,399
what what clued us into that it was

966
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:20,240
something that that we should care about

967
00:32:20,240 --> 00:32:22,320
um this was again from the iron net

968
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,120
stuff so they got a a very high score on

969
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,440
like this looks like it could be bad um

970
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,480
and upon investigation it was it was um

971
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,360
well for that guy it was so somebody

972
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:35,440
basically jumped online to get some

973
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,279
video editing software

974
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:39,440
i don't know if it's you ets i'm sure

975
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,840
you guys pay for your licenses whatever

976
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:43,840
but they didn't want to pay for that

977
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,200
video editing software so they went and

978
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:49,039
downloaded a crack for it and it was uh

979
00:32:49,039 --> 00:32:51,039
redline malware and i didn't know it's

980
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:54,640
still 2003. yeah

981
00:32:55,600 --> 00:32:56,880
kegens bro

982
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,799
um but yeah so

983
00:32:58,799 --> 00:33:02,880
when they uh when they ran that crack it

984
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:04,399
threw some malware on their machine they

985
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:05,600
grabbed their creds grabbed their

986
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,919
cookies like all kinds of stuff uploaded

987
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:09,440
all that took a screenshot of the

988
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,039
desktop which you see on the bottom

989
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,840
right of the actual individual screen

990
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:16,080
that's what was sent out and then we

991
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:17,200
grabbed that out of the stream and

992
00:33:17,200 --> 00:33:18,799
rebuilt it so that you could laugh with

993
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:20,320
us um

994
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,679
oh i thought he was using a cracked

995
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:26,000
version of winzip too yeah

996
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:29,360
yeah winrar without ever licensing it

997
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:31,600
somebody paid for it at some point or

998
00:33:31,600 --> 00:33:32,960
they're just selling meth i don't know

999
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,640
how they're in business

1000
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,399
but in the upper right is the actual

1001
00:33:36,399 --> 00:33:37,519
communications to the command and

1002
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:40,480
control that um for the malware so um so

1003
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:42,159
yeah just again

1004
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:44,640
this is the type of stuff that we see

1005
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:46,559
this individual because there was enough

1006
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,080
information that was sent out and there

1007
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,919
was other stuff that went as well we

1008
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,000
were able to identify and so they are

1009
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,840
somebody who now knows that this took

1010
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:54,960
place

1011
00:33:54,960 --> 00:33:57,360
and are able to take care of it later

1012
00:33:57,360 --> 00:33:58,880
and that's the thing about where we

1013
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:00,720
talked about black hat being known as

1014
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,240
one of the most hostile networks in the

1015
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:03,600
world because of the stuff where we see

1016
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:05,120
the crypto mining we see the clear text

1017
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,519
credentials or we see

1018
00:34:07,519 --> 00:34:10,639
somebody with confirm our or

1019
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:12,480
communications to a command control

1020
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:15,520
server somewhere and we send them that

1021
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,760
that captive portal

1022
00:34:17,760 --> 00:34:20,399
page in this case he was not still on

1023
00:34:20,399 --> 00:34:21,599
the network but we had enough

1024
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,239
information to reach out despite that so

1025
00:34:24,239 --> 00:34:25,599
they didn't get a captive portal they

1026
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,199
got a hey

1027
00:34:27,199 --> 00:34:28,239
um

1028
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,079
so

1029
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,159
we do that hoping that

1030
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:33,599
rather than people coming onto the

1031
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:35,280
network and it being the most hostile

1032
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,800
environment they are they actually in

1033
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,760
some cases leave safer than when they

1034
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:42,320
arrived so you know that that's what

1035
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,919
we're trying to accomplish oh

1036
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,599
um so

1037
00:34:49,599 --> 00:34:52,079
what's that

1038
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:55,520
again if you haven't been here um

1039
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:56,800
you should know that this crowd is

1040
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:58,240
disgusting and this is why we always

1041
00:34:58,240 --> 00:34:59,920
show this um

1042
00:34:59,920 --> 00:35:02,240
apparently when you come to a conference

1043
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,160
and i see what you did there i see it we

1044
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,920
don't block anything outbound as grifter

1045
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:08,480
said uh these are all the adult websites

1046
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:09,839
so we always just see the interesting

1047
00:35:09,839 --> 00:35:11,440
ones all right moving on you guys are

1048
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:14,839
weird so a lot less though

1049
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:17,280
which a lot less but there's a lot

1050
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,960
less than normal not just because

1051
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:20,560
there's less of you but i'm assuming

1052
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:22,160
because of trainings

1053
00:35:22,160 --> 00:35:24,240
which always the interesting thing is

1054
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,079
that during its the lunchtime of

1055
00:35:26,079 --> 00:35:27,920
trainings it it would

1056
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,040
spike

1057
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,760
yeah it's like really not as much time

1058
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:33,200
walking between briefings and right

1059
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:35,359
before training's end it would also just

1060
00:35:35,359 --> 00:35:36,800
go through the roof like going back to

1061
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:38,640
the room we got this downloaded i don't

1062
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,400
use that hotel wi-fi they don't have two

1063
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:42,960
10 gig circuits

1064
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,720
so we've talked we've talked about the

1065
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,800
evolution um from a technical

1066
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,880
perspective most of that's technical uh

1067
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,480
and there's actually a lot of things and

1068
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,440
i think the other side of this the

1069
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:52,560
grifter and i talked about this is

1070
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:54,560
almost uh if we talk about it here we

1071
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:56,160
have to do it so it's accountability to

1072
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,760
ourselves

1073
00:35:57,760 --> 00:35:59,359
going forward there's more plans that we

1074
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:01,280
have a lot of it i would say is back in

1075
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:03,440
so a lot of the processes that we do

1076
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,599
setting up this talk it's a nightmare

1077
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:08,079
sometimes today as we get the

1078
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:09,599
try to get all the data from the vendors

1079
00:36:09,599 --> 00:36:11,200
we want to do that a little bit cleaner

1080
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:12,560
and give them a little easier way to do

1081
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:13,440
that

1082
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:14,640
grifter wouldn't be running around with

1083
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:17,040
his head cut off as much today

1084
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:18,880
some of the i'm gonna go have me a good

1085
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,160
cry later

1086
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:22,000
some of the processes of the tools that

1087
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,680
we use go through and do that new guys

1088
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,040
that come in and help out the knock we

1089
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:26,320
want to build all that out so there's a

1090
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,480
lot of uh i would say more back end and

1091
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:30,640
processy stuff but from that we also

1092
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,400
have a lot of historical data and have

1093
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:34,720
talked about again we want to leave you

1094
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,480
guys safer we're we're you we're just

1095
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:38,880
lucky enough to be up here um we don't

1096
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,720
do any of this stuff all these guys up

1097
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,920
here up front of the smart ones so

1098
00:36:41,920 --> 00:36:43,520
anything that we can do to help all of

1099
00:36:43,520 --> 00:36:45,920
us is kind of the idea so

1100
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,000
we've also talked about giving

1101
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:50,160
some white papers putting out some white

1102
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,680
papers towards the end of shows with

1103
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:53,440
historical data

1104
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,680
as well as possibly some

1105
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,839
github tool repository so

1106
00:36:57,839 --> 00:36:59,280
keep an eye out for that kind of stuff

1107
00:36:59,280 --> 00:37:01,119
see what we do in here talked about a

1108
00:37:01,119 --> 00:37:02,400
couple other small things we'll see what

1109
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:03,520
happens what we can do and bring to

1110
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,880
fruition but

1111
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:06,400
as a little bit of accountability and

1112
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,920
give you guys something to hear about

1113
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:09,920
report back when we come back those are

1114
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,760
our plans

1115
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:15,520
that's all we have to say about that

1116
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,599
all right so uh we do not have a lot of

1117
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,040
time yeah i was going to say we usually

1118
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,160
have a lot more time because we just

1119
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:25,680
kind of stand up here so any questions

1120
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,280
we'd like to give that time to you guys

1121
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,800
we can kind of see so somebody raise

1122
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,880
your hand and holler and we'll let you

1123
00:37:30,880 --> 00:37:32,079
you're one of us what do you want to

1124
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,839
talk about

1125
00:37:33,839 --> 00:37:36,640
what would what was ironette like in the

1126
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:42,200
knock blue blah if i hear oh gosh

1127
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:51,520
okay

1128
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:53,839
so the question is because we're part of

1129
00:37:53,839 --> 00:37:55,680
the review boards as well at black hat

1130
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:58,160
which is like it's a sep like we're

1131
00:37:58,160 --> 00:38:00,720
those are very different silos right so

1132
00:38:00,720 --> 00:38:02,560
we are not

1133
00:38:02,560 --> 00:38:04,160
part of those because we're part of the

1134
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,640
knock like we're like we're invited to

1135
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:10,240
be on them and because we're dope um but

1136
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,320
uh but the question was

1137
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,920
when we see things come through that we

1138
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,920
know is going to be a new vulnerability

1139
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:18,000
or a new attack based on the submissions

1140
00:38:18,000 --> 00:38:20,240
that we're getting do we go and change

1141
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:21,760
things in the noc

1142
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:22,560
to

1143
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,119
get ready for that and the answer is no

1144
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:26,800
um

1145
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,359
what it just one it wouldn't be right

1146
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:32,560
two we wanna see what happens

1147
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:33,359
so

1148
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:35,440
that's that's the realest i can be with

1149
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:37,920
you is we're like let's see what happens

1150
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,200
i will quickly add though that we've

1151
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:42,320
seen things executed obviously that did

1152
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,800
affect us that we did have to update

1153
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:46,640
while on site for others yeah so we

1154
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,079
there there are things that we

1155
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:50,079
definitely were like this could be a

1156
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:52,000
potential issue and we're like well

1157
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:55,839
let's let's find out if it is um

1158
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:57,680
this whole exercise of doing the knock

1159
00:38:57,680 --> 00:38:59,040
and getting up here and delivering back

1160
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:00,480
to you guys what it is that we're

1161
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,920
learning while we're doing it is

1162
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,560
supposed to kind of emulate what you

1163
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,920
would do if you were trying to

1164
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,720
set up a stable secure network in your

1165
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,400
environment right and so having that

1166
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:14,160
insider knowledge isn't isn't really

1167
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:15,040
cool

1168
00:39:15,040 --> 00:39:17,440
also we have seen things though where a

1169
00:39:17,440 --> 00:39:19,599
presenter has delivered

1170
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:22,640
something on stage and we have seen

1171
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,320
active

1172
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:27,200
exploitation of that vulnerability

1173
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,440
it was 12 hours after it was delivered

1174
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,040
from stage so

1175
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:34,000
so we get to see

1176
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:35,440
like

1177
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:36,160
that

1178
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:37,280
that's what we're dealing with that's

1179
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,720
the reality of the world that we all

1180
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,480
live in is it's within 12 hours of

1181
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:42,640
someone talking about it at black hat

1182
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,960
there was an exploit being used on our

1183
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,960
network for that vulnerability get a

1184
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,560
couple more before you kick us out i saw

1185
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,320
a couple i thought sure anybody no i'm

1186
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:52,079
not leaving come and get me

1187
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:53,760
no where are you

1188
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,320
jeff's back i think no questions nobody

1189
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:59,119
