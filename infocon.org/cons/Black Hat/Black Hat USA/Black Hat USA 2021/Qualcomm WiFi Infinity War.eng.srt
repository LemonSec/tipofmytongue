2
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:16,320
hi everyone thank you for listening i'm

3
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,800
very happy to be here with you my topic

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:21,199
name is hong kong wi-fi internet's work

5
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,320
about hong kong wi-fi security

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,439
let me introduce myself first i'm i'm

7
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,160
shahiko a senior security research at

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,800
the singular security lab i focus on

9
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:35,120
field of protocol and short distance

10
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:36,399
communication

11
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:38,480
i have talked about wi-fi in black

12
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:40,879
heights agent last year i am glad to

13
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:42,160
have the

14
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,480
opportunity to share my research here

15
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,760
again

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,079
first of all i will introduce a change

17
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:50,640
in the architecture of hong kong wi-fi

18
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,239
and the current security actuality then

19
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:56,640
i will talk about the current security

20
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:59,600
actuality of hong kong's wifi tower so

21
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,239
three vulnerabilities we found last year

22
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,479
finally i will introduce the reverse

23
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:06,799
knowledge of wifi firmware and the

24
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,400
latest vulnerability found on snapdragon

25
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,760
is 65 and discuss the research methods

26
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,759
of firmware user security

27
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,920
the importance of wi-fi separating in

28
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:22,240
normal works there are also many

29
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,479
examples of web-based locations in

30
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,000
history each of which has had a huge

31
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:29,200
impact

32
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:31,520
why we should quantify i would like to

33
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,240
see that our research is not aimed at

34
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,799
hong kong as the hong kong wi-fi

35
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:39,520
occupies a dominant position in today's

36
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,640
intelligent mobile devices and it also

37
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,799
pays enough attention to product

38
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:48,000
security the research on the security of

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,799
the hong kong wi-fi can largely reflect

40
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:53,920
the current security actuality of wi-fi

41
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,799
in the industry

42
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,200
through the research of several

43
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,759
mainstream chief manufacturers of wifi

44
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,840
we can understand that the current

45
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,399
security situation of hong kong weapon

46
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:08,160
is better than that of other

47
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,520
manufacturers

48
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,080
we found a remote vulnerability in wi-fi

49
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:15,599
fixed by program in 2018 which is a

50
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,920
typical vulnerability in wi-fi for

51
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,840
passing information

52
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:22,239
this vulnerability responds and faced

53
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,400
internally by concave it was not

54
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,400
disclosed the function of the

55
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,280
vulnerability doesn't strictly check the

56
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,000
laws of the information element when

57
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,599
passing information

58
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:34,879
resulting in

59
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,640
entire underflow vulnerability

60
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,720
now hong kong adopts the following

61
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:43,120
passive method in passing part of wifi

62
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,920
protocol which greatly awards about

63
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:48,480
vulnerability however

64
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,879
other manufacturers still have a lot of

65
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,680
such autobahn access vulnerability in

66
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:56,000
wifi called passive this can no

67
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,239
vulnerability reflects whether wifi

68
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:01,280
security is due at a low level it's

69
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:03,599
aware that compound wi-fi has

70
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:06,879
experienced multiple rounds of security

71
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,599
offense and defense and has a high

72
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,840
security level

73
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,319
better is too has a greater security

74
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:15,120
risk

75
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,599
i have firstly described the attack

76
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,560
surface of remotely euro clicker wifi

77
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,440
last year including the simplest and the

78
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,680
most important wi-fi authentication

79
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:28,480
stage action series query and other

80
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,519
functions this process do not seem to be

81
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,360
very complex

82
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,680
some always only need two or three

83
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,560
communication interactions and some even

84
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,120
perform one package to complete the

85
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,239
prepared functions unless the process do

86
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,440
not repair passwords and any permissions

87
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,920
but even in this process

88
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,480
there are still many serious problems

89
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,360
later i will show that the security

90
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,480
risks still exist in the latest hong

91
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,680
kong wi-fi

92
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,599
so the two thereof club remote

93
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:06,560
vulnerability that we found in 2020

94
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:09,200
let me first briefly introduce the wi-fi

95
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,360
architecture of hong kong where we

96
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,760
introduce all architecture of hong kong

97
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:17,440
wifi with snapdragon 845 the hardware

98
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,160
uses a sdx20 to integrate the baseband

99
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:23,880
function and the

100
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:26,880
wcn390 is responsible for wifi and

101
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,919
bluetooth in the software patch tuesday

102
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:33,919
cld2qcrd suite is a driver of hong kong

103
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:36,639
wi-fi most of the protocol class and

104
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:39,199
function implementation of wi-fi are

105
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,240
completed here while the wifi firmware

106
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,560
accomplished control the lower level

107
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:47,199
work the wi-fi firmware will be loaded

108
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,520
into the bitspawn sound system program

109
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,880
when it comes to snapdragon 865 the

110
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,759
hardware device responsible for wi-fi

111
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,280
and bluetooth is 2d a6390 there is no

112
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,600
big change in the driver

113
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,000
when the wi-fi firmware is loaded in the

114
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,759
various lens and system to run

115
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,080
wi-fi general analytics the main

116
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,720
function of wi-fi which is naturally the

117
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:17,440
research goal of the main security

118
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:18,880
researchers

119
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,440
as the the part of the open source

120
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,080
software for content wi-fi driver source

121
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,199
code is available to all therefore the

122
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,160
security has received a lot of scrutiny

123
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:32,479
in recent years here are some mini

124
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,800
driver modules like att sme pe and so on

125
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,960
hdd http our user configurations need to

126
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,160
book through the http there atd is also

127
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,120
the interactive interface of the network

128
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,400
step in today's training as i mean

129
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,520
station

130
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,400
management

131
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,000
entry control paths layer between hdd

132
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,039
and pe

133
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,720
ap crossbow engine mainly responsible

134
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:04,960
for passing and generating wifi protocol

135
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:08,000
here is a detailed introduction to the

136
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,680
two remote memory corruption

137
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:12,400
vulnerabilities which we found last year

138
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:15,039
this vulnerability was submitted to hong

139
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,360
kong in april 2020

140
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:19,840
in december hong kong repaired and

141
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:22,720
disclose the vulnerability information

142
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,440
there are multiple attack paths for the

143
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,400
vulnerability the simplest attack path

144
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,520
is to make a big horse spot and justice

145
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,319
and managers become free when the target

146
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,160
mobile phone tries to connect to the

147
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,960
hotspot and trigger this vulnerability

148
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:41,039
for wifi management frame information

149
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:43,919
elements and other knowledge a lot

150
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:46,800
number of public documents and materials

151
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:49,280
have been introduced i will not replace

152
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,759
it here

153
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:53,520
the vulnerability

154
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,400
is in this function the wi-fi driver

155
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,560
will obtain wifi hotspot scanning

156
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:01,280
results when connecting a host watch

157
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:02,960
when passing as an

158
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,000
information element in the become frame

159
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,800
it doesn't fully check the pm pid

160
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:11,360
control field it only checks whether the

161
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,720
plk id configured is greater than the

162
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,000
mkd this batter does not check the value

163
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,280
of the pmk id compute the standard

164
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,080
memory used to store their gallery list

165
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,800
only supports 4 pm games

166
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:29,199
therefore when playing id count is

167
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:31,360
greater than 4 there will be a step

168
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,919
backward flow

169
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:39,280
vulnerability 3 20 26 36 98 we found

170
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,919
this vulnerability in may 2020 but

171
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,720
unfortunately the research has submitted

172
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,919
it before me

173
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:49,120
in july hong kong fix and disclose the

174
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:52,800
vulnerability on hong kong july quality

175
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:55,360
there are also multiple attack plans for

176
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:57,520
this vulnerability

177
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,759
which can be triggered by an action

178
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,319
frame or when connecting to the big

179
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,280
horsepower the attack the complexity is

180
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,319
very low when the target mobile phone

181
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,199
opens a hotspot the attacker can trigger

182
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:13,520
the vulnerability by sending an action

183
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:16,240
frame with measures to us map

184
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,720
information elements the vulnerability

185
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:22,240
is in the sme layer

186
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:24,720
this is the beauty of the vulnerability

187
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,599
we can know that 2x map information

188
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,599
elements carries multiple dncp range and

189
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,399
distraction structures which contain a

190
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:37,440
low value and a high value

191
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,880
the code on this page and do with 2s

192
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,399
math in sme including vulnerability code

193
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,360
and the definition of related over

194
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,640
variables

195
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,080
the scp

196
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:54,399
range is an 2d array the sap reach i

197
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:57,920
one by zero stands for the low value of

198
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,160
the rcg the lcp range i one stand for

199
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:05,600
the high value of the lcd variable i

200
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,560
corresponds to the serial number of the

201
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,600
scp and the maximum number of dlcp is h

202
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,040
the code in the finger on the left turns

203
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:22,480
a 2d array to a one dimensional array ds

204
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,560
in banking the sct 19 is a actually a

205
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:30,000
global rate which contains 6-4 elements

206
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,440
of the intent

207
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,640
the low value of the scp in our pc 9

208
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,160
high value is 255 this code will

209
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,720
withstand value to elements 10 run to

210
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,360
255 of dsct mapping array

211
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,880
value is a serial num number of this

212
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:52,959
dscg well the scp machine has only 64

213
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:56,000
elements and here it will be written

214
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:57,279
into

215
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:00,480
android 45 elements holding the memory

216
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:03,839
auto bounce range which will power the

217
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:06,800
subsequent feature but the quantity of

218
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:10,240
this vulnerability is very high

219
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,720
the bowel machine when replacing should

220
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:15,600
have been written in the quote if you

221
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,079
bend one vulnerability and fix one

222
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,040
number of vulnerabilities will converge

223
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:23,920
just like a jungle stock generally hong

224
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,600
kong wi-fi should be more and more

225
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,399
secure but in fact everything is

226
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,959
difficult to develop as smoothly as

227
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:32,720
people expected

228
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,760
it seems that vulnerabilities are always

229
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:38,000
endless

230
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,680
the vulnerability

231
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:42,399
from the today may be the result of new

232
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,560
functions all the following interesting

233
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:47,120
tradition i guess this vulnerability is

234
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,480
likely to be a new one probably one hong

235
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,440
kong is the repair of

236
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:54,800
vulnerability

237
00:10:54,800 --> 00:10:58,079
or awarding or vulnerability make this

238
00:10:58,079 --> 00:10:59,360
one

239
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,920
20 21 1955 is a logical vulnerability

240
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:09,440
which exists in snapdragon 845 and 855

241
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:12,880
its attack pass is at photo the targeted

242
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,920
mobile phone open the hotspot and the

243
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,399
attacker attempt to connect

244
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:21,040
to the hotspot when the attackers and

245
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:23,680
the multiple mail from the association

246
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,160
with pastor friends will trigger the

247
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,560
vulnerability this vulnerability is

248
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,720
located in the pe mode

249
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,320
testing association passive frame

250
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,800
this vulnerability is caused by

251
00:11:36,800 --> 00:11:39,760
extensive stem or wp information element

252
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,959
loss and i think in information and

253
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,920
intellect in association request

254
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:48,480
in this function when the sum of the

255
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,399
length of the two

256
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,839
information elements is greater than 250

257
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:56,800
bank an error will be reported to

258
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,680
the exist this function obviously this

259
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,399
is to provide memory correction this

260
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:05,519
function is tools and uh

261
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:08,680
notification message to sme left

262
00:12:08,680 --> 00:12:10,880
button it brings on without sending a

263
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:14,079
notification message because of an error

264
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:16,240
which leads to a problem in the

265
00:12:16,240 --> 00:12:18,240
subsequent active

266
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,040
command view and of course the driver

267
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,279
can watch

268
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:25,920
however both android and the function

269
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,480
have taken a lot of

270
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,279
mitigation to mitigate the time of

271
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,800
vulnerability such as that cookie cookie

272
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,560
pas

273
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:39,040
with the improvements of performance

274
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,320
abroad by the upgrading of smartphone

275
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,600
and where android system can apply more

276
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:48,639
powerful administration such as cfi

277
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,440
which position footage of huge

278
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:53,440
obstacle to the expulsion of

279
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,240
vulnerability or enrollment system

280
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:58,399
it's very difficult to break through

281
00:12:58,399 --> 00:13:00,639
this mitigation by only one

282
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:03,120
vulnerability

283
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:06,399
according to those statistics or wi-fi

284
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:09,360
vulnerability in the past three years

285
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,320
some rest in hong kong security policy

286
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,560
we can see that the number of websites

287
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,720
from where vulnerability is on the rest

288
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,279
especially in remote vulnerability

289
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:23,200
number of remote vulnerability

290
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,760
overflight flavor is also increasing

291
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,279
faster growth reach is obviously not as

292
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,399
fast and less firmware this is probably

293
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,639
related to the fact that the

294
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:36,959
vulnerability notification of wi-fi

295
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:39,920
driver are much higher than that of

296
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,120
wi-fi firmware and many researchers on

297
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,560
wi-fi firmware have improved uh i will

298
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,279
roll mounted more people's attention to

299
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:53,000
this patch this makes a attacker or

300
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:56,560
security researcher more likely to go to

301
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:59,680
the road to easier success

302
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,399
weapon firmware as a remote attack

303
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,880
option to break through the intelligence

304
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,240
system it's also logical

305
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:11,040
now let's talk about the security of

306
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,920
hong kong wi-fi firmware wi-fi firmware

307
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:17,199
is a part of the closest soft software

308
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:20,000
for the sake of storage space and the

309
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,959
other considerations there is no drone

310
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,160
on the chip to store weaponry weapon

311
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,480
firmware is stored in the android

312
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,720
administrator and loaded

313
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:34,800
into the processor ddr of the wisconsin

314
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,920
system or wireless lan subsystem when

315
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,360
running wi-fi

316
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:43,040
taking some dragon age 45 as an example

317
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,519
the weapon firmware is wlan mtsp.nbn

318
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,639
and the

319
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,240
modern uw dot json is a expanded

320
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:54,000
configuration fair

321
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:59,720
it can be seen that weapon firmware is

322
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:02,840
[Music]

323
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,040
their memory from android musician

324
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,959
when it comes to snapdragon 865 the wifi

325
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:17,120
firmware is loaded and run in the wlan

326
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,839
subsystem and the weapon firmware

327
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,800
becomes ams as 20. the file in the same

328
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:27,040
directory of wi-fi firmware

329
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,920
in the finger wi-fi bought this belt

330
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:32,240
this file needs to be replaced by

331
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:34,880
firmware and the url containing country

332
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,399
code and other information for example

333
00:15:38,399 --> 00:15:40,480
wlan.bla

334
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:43,839
is loaded on devices in china

335
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,839
css connectivity subsystem will complete

336
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:52,320
the operation or loading firmware

337
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,399
here is the loading process of them

338
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:57,600
tracking 865 weather firmware when the

339
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:01,199
user turns on weapon from settings wi-fi

341
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:07,040
access transform driver opens wi-fi

342
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,199
success hardware for

343
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:12,560
the zenith platform driver performs and

344
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,279
api calls the driver to load firmware

345
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,240
image into ddr

346
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,959
firmware sends the service ready message

347
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:24,079
to see access and phone call and the

348
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,240
thing access to demand

349
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,800
then firmware sends memory to pass the

350
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,160
instruction to cnss and phone travel to

351
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:35,279
download the 5 binary match

352
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:39,040
after that css and form driver lose the

353
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:42,079
body spell to firmware

354
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:45,360
when css platform travel gets firmware

355
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:48,240
for ready indication then it will call

356
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,360
wi-fi hot the first driver callback tool

357
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:54,399
in nationalized wireless lan foster

358
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,800
camera

359
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:59,519
let's talk about the subsection of hong

360
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,480
kong in addition to the main

361
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,880
application processor there are some

362
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,839
additional process running their own

363
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:11,119
software associate such as modern gpu

364
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:15,280
etc this starts system non-integrant on

365
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,919
all soc instead dragon age 45 there is a

366
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,599
modern sound system that is a beast band

367
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,799
some sensor when whereas that firmware

368
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:30,400
produce or crash it also displays an

369
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,960
error message in the respect sound

370
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,799
system in some dragon it it's a 65 there

371
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,400
is a wireless that sound system

372
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,679
ssr is a succession restart

373
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:46,799
is a feature of subsystem

374
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:49,840
access app ensures that the whole system

375
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,720
can run normally even in the case of

376
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,400
some system crash ssr is turned on by

377
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:58,960
the start level value control when

378
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,799
setting to related will enable ssr only

379
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:06,240
the sound system will be restarted when

380
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,559
the sound system is unnormal

381
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,440
random of our subsystem will be

382
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:13,280
collected

383
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:16,960
once set into system or will disable ssr

384
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,600
the main system restarts and the random

385
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:22,640
will be not collected

386
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:25,919
when we enable ssr we need to execute

387
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,760
the following command to cancel every

388
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:30,559
example although some system but the

389
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:33,360
situation i encourage the word that

390
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:37,039
random fail would be deleted also so it

391
00:18:37,039 --> 00:18:40,840
writes a scraps to copy random

392
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:44,400
quickly modem and the wi-fi box uses

393
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,360
hong kong has gun processor the hong

394
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:50,000
kong hexagon processor is a general

395
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,480
purpose digital signal processor

396
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:54,960
designed for high performance and the

397
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,679
low power across the white variants of

398
00:18:57,679 --> 00:18:59,360
multimedia and

399
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:02,160
modern affections so the research of

400
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,160
white platform where must know something

401
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,080
about hong kong like

402
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:09,520
hexagon hong kong offered pro grammar

403
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:13,039
reference manual file

404
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:18,320
bms20.bin is a wi-fi firmware of 2ce6390

405
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:20,720
the architecture of ams

406
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:22,880
20 dot bin

407
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:26,400
and identified by read eif is an

408
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:27,679
architecture

409
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:30,720
however the architecture of ems 20

410
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:33,880
dolphin is not a fast qualcomm

411
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:37,919
dsp6 processor therefore ib cannot

412
00:19:37,919 --> 00:19:41,200
analyze correctly modify the machine

413
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,960
field or eiffel handler or ams 20 dot

414
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:49,760
bin and the ide can analyze it correctly

415
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,960
in wlan mtsp mtsp.nb

416
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:55,840
and we confirm the search function by

417
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:58,640
screen inserted in and find the model

418
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:01,120
information according to the functions

419
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:04,559
that reference assert so this method a

420
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:07,039
large number of function names can be

421
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,720
restored

422
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,480
however in firmware of snapdragon 865

423
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,320
there are some difference

424
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:16,880
but it's impossible to directly obtain

425
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:19,840
the reference of a search function in

426
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:22,720
static analysis but the crash

427
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:25,440
information in crash reason fact can

428
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,000
help us take the follow finger as an

429
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,720
example the first address in

430
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,440
the next instruction address or will

431
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:36,640
search the second address is the return

432
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:39,200
address of the function in which the

433
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:42,559
search is located and the line number is

434
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:45,280
the code plan of the search

435
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:47,919
in this information we can confirm a

436
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:51,280
third function its first parameter

437
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,799
is the number of code length

438
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,679
how to catch firmware exception we can

439
00:20:57,679 --> 00:21:00,799
do this by looking at the number exist

440
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:03,600
in crash counterfeit

441
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,480
is increasing to chat whether there is a

442
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,360
new crash we can get a largest surprise

443
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:12,400
information so fresh reason that all

444
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,280
gets a lot of information or firmware

445
00:21:15,280 --> 00:21:17,360
crashed so the message

446
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,480
restart level is related by default when

447
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:23,360
is successor to system the flash or wifi

448
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:26,320
firmware will lead to the restart of the

449
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:28,559
whole system

450
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:30,960
here we take where is the action frame

451
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:33,919
at that example to introduce the

452
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:37,440
structure of action management free

453
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:39,760
i won't explain the structure of frame

454
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,480
handler in d2 it is the 24 best followed

455
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:48,080
by one batch of category code and the

456
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:51,200
oneplus of action id

457
00:21:51,200 --> 00:21:54,240
on the premise of understanding the

458
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,679
structure of a full hd action the wifi

459
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:00,320
firmware is analyzed the worst link to

460
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:04,000
vendor path or which t action in wifi

461
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:07,440
firmware in the last finger register 17

462
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:10,320
represents the contour to the management

463
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:14,240
frame in the right finger register 17 at

464
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:16,159
0x18

465
00:22:16,159 --> 00:22:19,520
0x18 is the loss of the frame handle and

466
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,400
the greatest the variable bonds to the

467
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,120
frame body register 2 and the ratchet

468
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:27,679
three phone to action id and the

469
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,200
category

470
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:32,000
in the right finger is just the whether

471
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:35,200
the received management frame is a vhc

472
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,760
action frame with group id management

473
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:38,720
tab

474
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,760
after passing the judgement the frame

475
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:44,879
will be processed

476
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:49,039
in 2020 we also found four remote url

477
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:51,200
global vulnerability in the lattice

478
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:54,720
system tracking h65 wifi firmware and

479
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,520
one is that dragon

480
00:22:56,520 --> 00:23:02,159
1617 among though 3 20 21 and 1907 was

481
00:23:02,159 --> 00:23:04,880
fixed by hong kong after the time of sun

482
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:07,880
mission 3 2021

483
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:13,600

00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,200
officially

485
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,360
disclosed the details of the

486
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,919
vulnerability will not be

487
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:22,480
described here

488
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:24,200
3 2021

489
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:27,520
1937 adult vulnerability in wifi

490
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:30,159
firmware which will trigger when asserts

491
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,039
and the trigger test is very simple this

492
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:35,360
vulnerability can also be

493
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:37,919
triggered by sending an association

494
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:41,919
faster frame with a normal pt capability

495
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:44,559
information element in the association

496
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:46,480
stage

497
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:48,720
in this function according to the

498
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:51,120
assembly code it will

499
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:54,480
traverse the space stream to obtain a

500
00:23:54,480 --> 00:23:58,159
wider mcs however it is done

501
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:00,960
not obtaining a valid ncs after

502
00:24:00,960 --> 00:24:04,080
perishing the speech screen the program

503
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,440
will trigger an exception therefore a

504
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,240
sending of ht capabilities information

505
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:13,440
elements with an abnormal mcs will

506
00:24:13,440 --> 00:24:16,480
trigger an exception in wifi firmware

507
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,679
calling the wireless

508
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,400
foreign 2021

509
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:26,159
1925 vulnerability is the new

510
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,799
vulnerability in wifi firmware and there

511
00:24:28,799 --> 00:24:31,200
is no such vulnerability instead

512
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:34,799
tracking is 45 firmware which is a new

513
00:24:34,799 --> 00:24:37,120
problem for the

514
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,200
changing the code logic

515
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,360
it exists in wlan management x frame

516
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,520
handler function

517
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:48,320
this is the function instead of dragging

518
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:53,120
h65 and 845 respectively which is

519
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:55,760
obviously this function is that dragging

520
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:57,919
its 65 is huge

521
00:24:57,919 --> 00:25:02,960
so reverse analyzes the original wlan tx

522
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:08,480
5ee pass gid function and in wlan dsp

523
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:11,200
dot nbn is

524
00:25:11,200 --> 00:25:12,880
compatible

525
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,039
into this function

526
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:18,000
this vulnerability can be triggered by

527
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,799
only one action measurement frame which

528
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:24,880
is a vht action frame mentioned earlier

529
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,440
these fingers in this slide

530
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,039
this function in wlan

531
00:25:30,039 --> 00:25:34,320
mdsp.nb of snapdragon is 45

532
00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:37,840
it is used to pass the id from wii

533
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:41,360
from wii ht action frame and set it to

534
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:43,919
variable here the value

535
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:46,159
in the memberships their

536
00:25:46,159 --> 00:25:50,240
status array in the timing frame is used

537
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:54,960
as the condition to exist the loop

538
00:25:55,039 --> 00:25:58,080
the firmware code in the left finger

539
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,640
determines that the received management

540
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:04,000
frame is a group management action frame

541
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,520
then began to pass gid in the right

542
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,320
finger we'll see from gp tv gets a value

543
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:15,679
tax we don't get the potential of value

544
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,960
in reverse but it is obviously different

545
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:21,360
from the processing logic instead

546
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:23,760
dragging

547
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,120
then it goes into a cycle which can be

548
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:30,320
exceeded up to

549
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:34,559
a time when the sample index and x

550
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:36,240
exceeds

551
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:39,520
zero x z three f

552
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:42,880
the assault is triggered

553
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,640
then several other firmware

554
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:47,360
vulnerability we reported are similar

555
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,840
next let's talk about the mitigation of

556
00:26:49,840 --> 00:26:51,760
hong kong's webcam

557
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,039
because the

558
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:55,440
binary sets or weapon firmware can't be

559
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:57,440
too large and

560
00:26:57,440 --> 00:27:01,039
more mitigation can't be applied aslr

561
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:04,480
and the cfl can't be applied and the

562
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,720
degree of

563
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,360
vulnerability initiation is greatly

564
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,120
weakened

565
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,080
these assault vulnerabilities are not in

566
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,960
passive gain new features and functions

567
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,520
make wifi driver and firmware are

568
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:21,760
constantly changing for example

569
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:24,159
snapdragon 865

570
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:27,279
new support wi-fi 6 and the wt3

571
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,080
authentication method

572
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,120
the search function should not exist in

573
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,080
the release world of software because

574
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:39,039
this week to catch exception is not

575
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:42,000
friendly however a source is well used

576
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,200
in wifi firmware which is likely to

577
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,320
result in a large number of remote dots

578
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:52,000
but it may have compared all the regions

579
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:54,320
stated in the firmware

580
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:57,919
for security research it also pro with

581
00:27:57,919 --> 00:28:01,360
us with a lot of clues every assert is a

582
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:04,000
check condition or input we can find the

583
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:07,039
insufficient part of the chat by

584
00:28:07,039 --> 00:28:10,640
examining on every search we observed

585
00:28:10,640 --> 00:28:14,320
that the new firmware in snapdragon 865

586
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:17,120
has some changes in condition checking

587
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,399
compared with the h4 effect the finger

588
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,679
about shows functioning is body fat from

589
00:28:23,679 --> 00:28:26,399
where checking the incoming parameters

590
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:27,679
one by one

591
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:30,559
the finger below should check on the

592
00:28:30,559 --> 00:28:33,039
timing parameters by the same function

593
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:37,360
in h65 firmware for this example does

594
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:39,919
not mean that this check will reduce the

595
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,440
security that indicates that this change

596
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,960
may introduce new risks

597
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:50,080
i introduce the how to get random early

598
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,039
rendang wlan.eif

599
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,279
contains the firmware code and the

600
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,000
memory user and the firmware of course

601
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,279
is mainly concentrated in this

602
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,080
range but there are

603
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,360
also hips in it

604
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,960
with regard

605
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,760
to memory debugging it's difficult to

606
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:15,279
debug wi-fi from where in blackbox mode

607
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:18,559
however by triggering flash and analyze

608
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:19,279
the

609
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:21,760
render we can see the memory

610
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,640
distribution of weapon firmware the

611
00:29:24,640 --> 00:29:27,840
finger on the left should the with

612
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,279
it in the run down we can see the qc

613
00:29:31,279 --> 00:29:34,000
with center in different memory address

614
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:37,279
and these usage all appear as a sim

615
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:40,399
address you can also see that the memory

616
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:42,000
and the code are

617
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,480
mixed together

618
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:46,640
our goal is to find out more

619
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,600
high-quality vulnerabilities in firmware

620
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:52,720
as well as convenience research on new

621
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:56,399
weapon features and the optimization

622
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,559
of memory debugging measures

623
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,720
we are committed to

624
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,279
discovering the real workflow the remote

625
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,679
vulnerability of wi-fi on the lattice

626
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:08,720
devices at present we are also in the

627
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:11,760
process of in-depth research looking

628
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:14,720
forward to sharing more shocking content

629
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:18,480
with you in the future

630
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,520
we have demonstrated the risks of hong

631
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:24,320
kong wi-fi a large number of firmware

632
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,720
when replacing the weak mitigation of

633
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:28,399
weapons from where

634
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:29,200
come

635
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,080
combining those together is like the

636
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:35,120
thought of dumplings hanging on hong

637
00:30:35,120 --> 00:30:37,919
kong and android mobile phones which may

638
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:40,960
give android users of how it below

639
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:42,559
attended 10.

640
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:44,960
hong kong have fixed all vulnerabilities

641
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:47,919
in front and their own security team has

642
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,000
also found more vulnerability in

643
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:51,679
self-examination

644
00:30:51,679 --> 00:30:54,559
i believe that wifi will become more and

645
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:58,720
more robust on snapdragon 865 with hong

646
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:01,120
kong wi-fi security coming towards happy

647
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,159
ending

648
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:06,159
in error of that driving age 45 and 855

649
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:08,799
we also believe that wi-fi will become

650
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:11,679
more and more secure it seems that they

651
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:15,600
would have wonder office and defense war

652
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,480
on wi-fi security unfortunately

653
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:21,519
things are not like this we never know

654
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:23,679
what new features will appear in the

655
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:26,080
next generation of wi-fi products

656
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:29,200
whether developers make a mistake when

657
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,240
iu vulnerability will certainly operate

658
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:36,080
its stature after all wifi security is

659
00:31:36,080 --> 00:31:39,279
at infinite war preparing our continuous

660
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:40,799
focus

661
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:45,120
that is all thanks for listening
