00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:14,700
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> built</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 90 thousand dollars for this</font>

about the company I represent f-secure

00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,569
we do although<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of our revenues come</font>

from working with ISPs to protect

00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:47,190
traditional Windows computers but i

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,070
really want to start by<font color="#E5E5E5"> asking you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

19
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:54,390
question how many of you had one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

20
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:56,520
these oh my god yes that's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much</font>

21
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:58,920
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> of all it dates us and second of</font>

22
00:00:56,520 --> 00:01:01,739
all yeah they were great devices us

23
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:03,030
Robert E funny thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I tried to find his</font>

24
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:05,099
image i found it from us robotics

25
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:07,740
website us robotics is still around<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

26
00:01:05,099 --> 00:01:09,000
are still<font color="#E5E5E5"> around today they have 120</font>

27
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:11,640
employees which was a bit of a surprise

28
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,740
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me so it's sort of disappeared but</font>

29
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,979
that's a modem that's how<font color="#E5E5E5"> we use to get</font>

30
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:19,649
online in fact we all used to have

31
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:23,670
modems in fact some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of our computers</font>

32
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:25,710
still do fact is my thinkpad here which

33
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:28,560
is like two years<font color="#E5E5E5"> old still has a modem</font>

34
00:01:25,710 --> 00:01:29,908
slot for a telephone<font color="#CCCCCC"> line of course it's</font>

35
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,540
never connected to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> telephone line</font>

36
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:35,640
anymore there is a modem and back then

37
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:37,320
when everybody used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to have a modem and</font>

38
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:41,009
it used to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> connected to a telephone</font>

39
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:43,289
line we had a problem particular problem

40
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:46,680
what used to be known as dialers or<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

41
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:48,960
specifically porn dialers so<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows</font>

42
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">trojans that would infect your computer</font>

43
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,479
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> start making phone calls with</font>

44
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:58,559
your modem then<font color="#E5E5E5"> charge money back to you</font>

45
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:00,869
quite a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit of these were obvious to the</font>

46
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,479
user they told the user with the EULA

47
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:05,880
that you know we will show you porn

48
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:07,229
images or porn movies and<font color="#E5E5E5"> as we show</font>

49
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,810
them to you will at the same time will

50
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:11,250
be making phone calls to a 1 900 number

51
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:12,720
and people of course ignored that

52
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:13,890
completely because they never it you'll

53
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:15,450
us especially if they've

54
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:17,850
download an application to look at porn

55
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:19,230
tape<font color="#E5E5E5"> just going to ignore that so this</font>

56
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:20,880
was a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually was</font>

57
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:24,119
something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> many antiviruses put</font>

58
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:27,180
quite a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of effort into detecting but</font>

59
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:29,190
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem went away we are not we</font>

60
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,620
haven't seen new dialers using built-in

61
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:33,480
modems to do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> in quite a while</font>

62
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:36,150
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> nobody has modems anymore we all</font>

63
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:38,190
today go online with our<font color="#CCCCCC"> wife eyes with</font>

64
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:40,920
our dsl modems which can't be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

65
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:46,950
issue calls to 1 900 numbers and so on

66
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:51,510
so in a nutshell<font color="#E5E5E5"> my point of my talk is</font>

67
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:55,260
here that's a code snippet arm to make a

68
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:56,850
ping to send one ping packet basically

69
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:00,179
this code snippet right here which is

70
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:02,340
some line<font color="#E5E5E5"> source code somewhere creates</font>

71
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:04,950
a connection between two<font color="#E5E5E5"> devices that's</font>

72
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:06,930
what it does right very<font color="#E5E5E5"> simple let me</font>

73
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:10,049
show you<font color="#E5E5E5"> another code snippet this code</font>

74
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:11,970
snippet makes a telephone call this is

75
00:03:10,050 --> 00:03:14,130
actually code from a smart phone system

76
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:16,620
actually from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> Symbian system it makes</font>

77
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:19,440
a telephone call which is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> connection</font>

78
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:22,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">between</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two devices right you follow me</font>

79
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:23,459
so basically these two things make the

80
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:26,850
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing they create a connection</font>

81
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:31,320
between two devices<font color="#E5E5E5"> however there is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

82
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:35,910
crucial difference when this code of

83
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:38,190
sending ping packet is executed no money

84
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:39,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">is being moved</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when this code is</font>

85
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:42,060
executed this is actually a money

86
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:43,829
transaction it actually moves money

87
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:47,850
around because<font color="#E5E5E5"> when you make a phone</font>

88
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:50,790
call you pay for the call now imagine if

89
00:03:47,850 --> 00:03:53,100
traditional<font color="#E5E5E5"> virus writers who write</font>

90
00:03:50,790 --> 00:03:55,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">windows viruses today would have such an</font>

91
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:57,120
easy mechanism today to extract money

92
00:03:55,709 --> 00:03:59,130
from infected computers that would be

93
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:00,630
like their wet dream of course they

94
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:03,450
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so they have to go</font>

95
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:05,730
through<font color="#CCCCCC"> this frankly very complex</font>

96
00:04:03,450 --> 00:04:09,089
mechanisms of extracting money from

97
00:04:05,730 --> 00:04:11,010
infected computers like dropping a spam

98
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:13,019
box to an infected computer then sending

99
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:15,209
spam through the infected<font color="#E5E5E5"> machine to try</font>

100
00:04:13,019 --> 00:04:17,519
to advertise via car than salvia you

101
00:04:15,209 --> 00:04:19,500
know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty complicated or to drop</font>

102
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,418
<font color="#CCCCCC">a keylogger</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on an infected windows box</font>

103
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,770
then wait for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the user to go online to</font>

104
00:04:21,418 --> 00:04:24,150
make online purchases get his credit

105
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:25,830
card number then use this credit<font color="#CCCCCC"> card</font>

106

107

laptops resell them again

108
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,590
very complicated yet this is what

109
00:04:30,060 --> 00:04:33,510
they're doing though although this is

110
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:35,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">complicated they still do this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if they</font>

111
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:36,960
would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a direct mechanism of just</font>

112
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:39,510
extracting<font color="#E5E5E5"> money straight off from</font>

113
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,190
infected computers it would be their wet

114
00:04:39,510 --> 00:04:42,300
dream<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they don't have them they used</font>

116
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:50,760
modems they don't anymore so another

117
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:53,430
problem with these premium rate numbers

118
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:55,650
come from well<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's quite a bit of</font>

119
00:04:53,430 --> 00:04:57,090
difference worldwide when we look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

120
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,859
these premium rate numbers that where

121
00:04:57,090 --> 00:05:01,739
you can dial and which actually cost you

122
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:03,510
extra money here in<font color="#CCCCCC"> USA these are the 1</font>

900 numbers you go to other countries

124
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:07,110
you pretty much have<font color="#E5E5E5"> these in every</font>

127
00:05:08,970 --> 00:05:12,210
zero seven hundred numbers and they can

128
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,979
charge you anything from ten cents a

129
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:16,560
minute to nine dollars a minute or

130
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:18,510
something like that now 1 900 numbers

131
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:22,260

beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the call telling you where</font>

144
00:05:45,450 --> 00:05:49,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">your calling and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> who runs it who owns it</font>

145
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,260
and how<font color="#CCCCCC"> much you're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to pay even</font>

146
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:53,760
more importantly if you run fraud for

147
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,860
example if you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a dialer today</font>

148
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,780
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> would automatically issue calls to</font>

149
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:59,430
a 1 900 number and would do it

150
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:02,039
completely illegally without the user

151
00:05:59,430 --> 00:06:03,570
knowing users would realize they would

152
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:05,610
see this they would complain and this

153
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:08,099
would be shut down before any money is

154
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:10,110
moved to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the criminal this has been</font>

155
00:06:08,100 --> 00:06:11,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">designed just to prevent fraud like this</font>

156
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:14,910
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the money immediately</font>

157
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:17,010
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> 30-day delay before the number</font>

158
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:20,039
<font color="#E5E5E5">owner gets the money out of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> cost</font>

159
00:06:17,010 --> 00:06:23,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">which is pretty neat in preventing fraud</font>

160
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:24,690
like this one thing which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bit of a</font>

161
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:27,210
surprise to<font color="#CCCCCC"> me when I realized this is</font>

162
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:29,729
that here in USA<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can't call premium</font>

163
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:30,930
rate numbers from a cell phone the cat

164
00:06:29,729 --> 00:06:32,190
they only work from landlines of

165
00:06:30,930 --> 00:06:35,100
coordinate of course landlines are going

166
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:37,200
away everywhere else<font color="#E5E5E5"> as far</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as I know</font>

167
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:38,610
they do work like local premium rate

168
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:40,500
numbers anywhere in Europe anywhere in

169
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:41,670
Asia do work from cell<font color="#E5E5E5"> phones of course</font>

170
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:44,190
they do I don't actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

171
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:46,470
why you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> call a 1 900 number here</font>

172
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:47,790
in USA but you call which means<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

173
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:49,950
somebody wants to write a smartphone

<font color="#E5E5E5">trojan to call premium rate numbers they</font>

175
00:06:49,950 --> 00:06:55,440
can't use a 1 900 number and the last

176
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:58,950
barrier is that these numbers are not

177
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:01,469
international from USA you can't call a

178

zero seven hundred premium rate number

179
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:05,820
in Finland it will not work from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Finland</font>

00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:43,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">doesn't work if they want to have</font>

286
00:11:26,579 --> 00:11:34,290
isn't actually the real company and of

287
00:11:31,290 --> 00:11:36,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">course the only modification of removing</font>

288
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:38,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">common protection wasn't the only thing</font>

289
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:40,829
modified in the game the main

290
00:11:38,189 --> 00:11:45,300
modification that was done the game was

291
00:11:40,829 --> 00:11:47,489
this the<font color="#CCCCCC"> hacker had added a small code</font>

292
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,319
snippet which modified the system to

293
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:53,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">work so that when the game was installed</font>

294
00:11:49,319 --> 00:11:55,319
initially it waited for a delay of

295
00:11:53,009 --> 00:11:58,259
random amount of hours somewhere<font color="#E5E5E5"> between</font>

296
00:11:55,319 --> 00:12:01,199
0 and 12 hours<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then it issued a</font>

297
00:11:58,259 --> 00:12:03,420
series of phone calls phone calls to

298
00:12:01,199 --> 00:12:07,889
these eight numbers listed right here

299
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:10,349
and it waited for in hex<font color="#CCCCCC"> e350 that's</font>

300
00:12:07,889 --> 00:12:13,319
50,000 timer ticks waited for the call

301
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:15,120
to go<font color="#CCCCCC"> on and then it shut down the call</font>

302
00:12:13,319 --> 00:12:17,639
and issued another call<font color="#E5E5E5"> and once it had</font>

303
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:20,639
called all of<font color="#CCCCCC"> these numbers</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these eight</font>

304
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:23,670
numbers then it slipped for 31 days

305
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:26,519
after 31 days it repeated the calls and

306
00:12:23,670 --> 00:12:29,490
slipped for 31<font color="#CCCCCC"> days that's what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it does</font>

307
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:32,370
and when you call these numbers these

308
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:34,889
will create you<font color="#E5E5E5"> around twelve dollars in</font>

309
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:37,649
costs and the logic in doing is only

310
00:12:34,889 --> 00:12:39,509
every 31 days is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of us have a</font>

311
00:12:37,649 --> 00:12:41,309
monthly bill if you don't have a prepaid

312
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:44,309
number then you typically get a monthly

313
00:12:41,309 --> 00:12:46,649
bill if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get an extra $12</font>

314
00:12:44,309 --> 00:12:48,059
international calls in your bill well

315
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:50,790
some of us will notice some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us would</font>

316
00:12:48,059 --> 00:12:52,709
I wouldn't notice for example I have you

317
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:54,269
know so so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> international calls</font>

318
00:12:52,709 --> 00:12:58,109
anyway that twelve dollars would easily

319
00:12:54,269 --> 00:13:01,559
go through so what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> these numbers</font>

320
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:05,370
where was the phone actually calling

321
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:08,730
well it was calling the south god damn

322
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:10,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">Paul yes it was calling Antarctica was</font>

323
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:11,850
calling<font color="#E5E5E5"> Dominican Republic it was</font>

324
00:13:10,019 --> 00:13:14,160
calling different satellite providers he

325
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:15,660
was calling Somalia in Africa South

326
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,579
tomé and príncipe which is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

327
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:21,240
small island nation right outside of

329
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:25,360
obvious

330
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:27,370
you know if you call faraway places like

331
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,720
this it's going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be an expensive call</font>

332
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:30,610
everybody understands that if you're

333
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:34,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to call the South Pole it's gonna</font>

334
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:37,030
cost you money right so how does the guy

335
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:40,000
get money out of this that's the crucial

336
00:13:37,030 --> 00:13:42,100
part how does this actually work so that

337
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,260
the guy running this operation is able

338
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:45,820
to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> money out of it and is able to do</font>

339
00:13:44,260 --> 00:13:48,640
it without<font color="#CCCCCC"> getting caught and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is able to</font>

340
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:51,190
continue it although they might be

341
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:53,350
attempt to take him down and these<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

342
00:13:51,190 --> 00:13:55,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">all done by the fact that these numbers</font>

343
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:58,840
are so-called international premium rate

344
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:00,070
numbers which means<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are not premium</font>

345
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:02,200
rate numbers they're perfectly normal

346
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:05,350
numbers in perfectly number normal

347
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:07,630
number space but they are very expensive

348
00:14:05,350 --> 00:14:10,000
and they built so that they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

349
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:12,939
fund money back to the person<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's</font>

350
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:15,790
operating<font color="#E5E5E5"> the number and this means that</font>

351
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:17,950
these numbers will<font color="#E5E5E5"> work from anywhere in</font>

352
00:14:15,790 --> 00:14:19,839
the world<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they will work for cell</font>

353
00:14:17,950 --> 00:14:23,290
phones so if you compare these<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers</font>

354
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:24,730
today 1 900 numbers here in<font color="#CCCCCC"> USA well you</font>

355
00:14:23,290 --> 00:14:26,680
can call this from USA you can call this

356
00:14:24,730 --> 00:14:29,410
from cell phones and they will generate

357
00:14:26,680 --> 00:14:31,900
money to the person operating it they do

358
00:14:29,410 --> 00:14:33,760
all the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you cannot do with 1</font>

country in the world any phone anywhere

the operator and<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are called called</font>

364
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:50,439
illegal call terminations also known as

365
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:52,210
short stopping or long lining and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

366
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,800
basic idea is actually very simple let's

367
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:56,410
for example assume that we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

368
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:59,500
a phone call from here in Nevada to

369
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:02,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">Somalia in in Eastern Africa and that</font>

370
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:05,020
would eject the minute price from AT&T

371
00:15:02,350 --> 00:15:06,550
or<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sprint it was two dollars 55 cents a</font>

372
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:07,930
minute when you make a<font color="#E5E5E5"> call like that so</font>

373
00:15:06,550 --> 00:15:09,339
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> pretty expensive but you can</font>

374
00:15:07,930 --> 00:15:11,079
understand because Somalia is far away

375
00:15:09,340 --> 00:15:14,410
it's developing country all that you

376
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:15,550
know now the trick<font color="#E5E5E5"> is when you call one</font>

377
00:15:14,410 --> 00:15:16,930
of these numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> for example the number</font>

378
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:20,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">that was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> listed right here going to</font>

379
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:23,380
Somalia it<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually won't go to Somalia</font>

380
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:26,770
they call get disconnected for example

381
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:29,860
in Florida or Canada or Australia or the

382
00:15:26,770 --> 00:15:32,560
Netherlands and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> keep the rest of</font>

383
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:34,090
the money and calling Florida<font color="#E5E5E5"> from never</font>

384
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,930
a course to a couple of cents which

385
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:38,330
means they get to keep over to

386
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:40,250
a minute of extra and this is what's

387
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:42,350
known as short stopping or long lining

388
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:44,480
illegal<font color="#E5E5E5"> cold terminations they are</font>

389
00:15:42,350 --> 00:15:46,760
terminating the call before<font color="#CCCCCC"> it actually</font>

390
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,710
reaches the place so when your phone if

00:15:46,760 --> 00:15:50,210
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was infected by 3d untie Terrace</font>

397
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:06,079
pretty neat so how do you actually

398
00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:08,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">create a number like this how do you</font>

399
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:12,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">create a number that uses these cold</font>

terminations or short stopping well you

401
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:16,040
just go online and you search for this

402
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:17,839
and you'll find several operators that

403
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:20,719
are selling<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers exactly like this</font>

that the calls are terminated before

they reach the actual destination and

00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:25,459
one of these operators they're selling

429
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:29,750
look at these they are selling numbers

430
00:17:25,459 --> 00:17:32,870
in North goddamn<font color="#CCCCCC"> Korea right there you</font>

431
00:17:29,750 --> 00:17:34,070
can buy a North Korean number plus 358

432
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:35,689
goes to north korea which of course

433
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:38,300
never goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> north korea but can be</font>

434
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:42,410
used for exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> these and now i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure</font>

435
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:44,960
there is some logical perfectly fine

436
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:46,400
explanation why somebody would like to

437
00:17:44,960 --> 00:17:48,140
buy a number like this and which

438
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,760
wouldn't which would make sense and

439
00:17:48,140 --> 00:17:51,590
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't be illegal or fee</font>

440
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:53,180
she in any way I'm sure there<font color="#CCCCCC"> is some</font>

441
00:17:51,590 --> 00:17:57,709
explanation but I can't figure it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

442
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:59,660
I'm i do<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can't imagine a non shady</font>

443
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:01,790
reason why somebody would like to have a

444
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:03,650
phone number<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> North Korea and get</font>

445
00:18:01,790 --> 00:18:05,540
extra money out of whenever<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody</font>

446
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:10,250
calls that number if you can figure<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

447
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:11,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">out you tell me and these operators like</font>

448
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:15,710
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> said these are fairly easy to find</font>

449
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:17,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay I'm sure there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are logical reasons</font>

450
00:18:15,710 --> 00:18:18,920
why they keep doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> this and why this is</font>

451
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,350
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really being regulated some of them</font>

452
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:23,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">seem to be very touching about this</font>

453
00:18:21,350 --> 00:18:26,300
subject I made a short blog post about

454
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:28,879
these when I was researching background

455
00:18:26,300 --> 00:18:30,050
for this for this talk mentioning couple

456
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,030
of these operators and I immediately

457
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:35,120
started getting threats from one of

458
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:36,560
these<font color="#E5E5E5"> operators so they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seem to seem to</font>

459
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,550
be a bit touchy about the fact that if

460
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:42,770
somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> starts looking into their</font>

461
00:18:37,550 --> 00:18:45,230
operation no just nasty emails that's

462
00:18:42,770 --> 00:18:50,480
what I got nobody was trying to beat<font color="#CCCCCC"> me</font>

463
00:18:45,230 --> 00:18:52,910
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> now and there are a lot of problems</font>

464
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,230
like like if you have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> international</font>

465
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:56,030
phone number like<font color="#CCCCCC"> these like for example</font>

466
00:18:54,230 --> 00:18:58,730
the numbers used by the treaty

468
00:18:58,730 --> 00:19:03,290
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> who operated those not like</font>

469
00:19:01,220 --> 00:19:05,120
which of these companies was running

470
00:19:03,290 --> 00:19:07,550
those numbers there's no way to do that

471
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:08,510
no way<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I'm aware of which means</font>

472
00:19:07,550 --> 00:19:11,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">there's nowhere you could actually</font>

473
00:19:08,510 --> 00:19:12,800
complain how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get such a number</font>

474
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:16,610
shut down if you can't figure out<font color="#CCCCCC"> who's</font>

475
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:19,700
the operator behind it these are pretty

476
00:19:16,610 --> 00:19:21,620
nasty problems those numbers those eight

477
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:23,300
numbers used by 3d<font color="#E5E5E5"> untidy restriction</font>

00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:26,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">are now shut down they don't work</font>

479
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:27,560
anymore I don't know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> and who did it</font>

480
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:28,940
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> we sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't do it we tried</font>

481
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:34,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">shutting them down we couldn't find any</font>

482
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:37,940
party where to report them and of course

483
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:40,820
eventually virus<font color="#E5E5E5"> writers will realize</font>

484
00:19:37,940 --> 00:19:44,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">that it is easier to make money by</font>

485
00:19:40,820 --> 00:19:47,419
interacting pose than it is by infecting

486
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:50,090
computers because you have this built-in

487
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:53,540
billing mechanism on phones that you do

488
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:55,939
not have in computers and also let's

489
00:19:53,540 --> 00:20:00,530
remember that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are more phones on</font>

490
00:19:55,940 --> 00:20:01,600
this planet than computers but of course

491
00:20:00,530 --> 00:20:07,178
<font color="#CCCCCC">this hasn't happened</font>

492
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:09,129
yet and my numbers on what what did what

493
00:20:07,179 --> 00:20:11,620
the difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> amount of malware</font>

494
00:20:09,130 --> 00:20:14,289
today on window side and what a mode of

495
00:20:11,620 --> 00:20:16,780
vulvar today on phone side is nicely

496
00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:18,429
illustrated by this figure showing the

497
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:22,030
difference between<font color="#E5E5E5"> the size of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Sun and</font>

498
00:20:18,429 --> 00:20:23,320
sides of Earth so there really is a

499
00:20:22,030 --> 00:20:25,809
world of difference right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> we are</font>

500
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:28,149
really not very likely today<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

501
00:20:25,809 --> 00:20:30,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">infected by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a mobile phone attack not</font>

502
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:31,960
even the kind of stuff that the 3d anti

503
00:20:30,130 --> 00:20:33,909
terrace<font color="#E5E5E5"> trojan was done yes there were</font>

504
00:20:31,960 --> 00:20:36,370
global infections but<font color="#CCCCCC"> even then the</font>

505
00:20:33,909 --> 00:20:39,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">number of our pauline hundreds more than</font>

506
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:42,070
or maybe in thousands but not more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than</font>

507
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:56,889
that so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really isn't there</font>

508
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:58,330
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> could be but it isn't they were done</font>

509
00:20:56,890 --> 00:20:59,679
from those attacks that you mentioned

510
00:20:58,330 --> 00:21:07,949
we're done from phones using phone

511
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:07,950
malware or something else sure

512
00:21:15,290 --> 00:21:22,340
yes so yes there is tons of like

513
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:24,110
traditional hacking going on which uses

514
00:21:22,340 --> 00:21:25,610
premium rate numbers to get money<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of</font>

515
00:21:24,110 --> 00:21:28,010
it including hacking voice over IP

systems and<font color="#CCCCCC"> ass through systems and</font>

517
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:31,490
others what I'm talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> here is</font>

518
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:32,780
the difference<font color="#CCCCCC"> between PC malware and</font>

519
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:35,060
mobile malware be specifically using

520
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:36,590
mobile malware to issue calls straight

521
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:40,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">from the smartphone and that difference</font>

522
00:21:36,590 --> 00:21:43,429
is that big 500 mobile vulvar of which

523
00:21:40,790 --> 00:21:45,320
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> a handful tries to do a premium</font>

524
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:47,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">rate text messages or premium rate calls</font>

525
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:51,290
so this problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't exist yet we</font>

526
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:54,830
only have a handful of example my theory

work so well<font color="#E5E5E5"> for them already right now</font>

569
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:39,169
why would<font color="#CCCCCC"> they move such an easy target</font>

570
00:23:34,070 --> 00:23:41,840
so what should you<font color="#CCCCCC"> do to protect against</font>

571
00:23:39,170 --> 00:23:44,120
attacks like this to protect the

572
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:46,850
scenario where your customers or your

573
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:48,409
users are hit by a piece of malware and

574
00:23:46,850 --> 00:23:51,919
which uses their smartphones to issue

575
00:23:48,410 --> 00:23:53,810
calls to<font color="#CCCCCC"> faraway places well the usual</font>

00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:55,070
look down<font color="#E5E5E5"> the devices prevent</font>

00:23:53,810 --> 00:23:58,070

something you would need more in the

that's what I had please any questions

603
00:25:02,870 --> 00:25:16,520
yes question was about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the smartphone</font>

604
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:18,770
operating systems and which one we see

605
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,480
targeted by malware the example I was

606
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:21,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">giving it was the this treaty</font>

anti-terrorist<font color="#E5E5E5"> trojan and another</font>

610
00:25:26,270 --> 00:25:30,320
mobile but if you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the mobile</font>

611
00:25:28,130 --> 00:25:33,680

612
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:36,950
516 mobile phone attacks we've seen so

613
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:39,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">far majority by for targeting symbian</font>

614
00:25:36,950 --> 00:25:42,650
symbian like for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> my nokia phone</font>

615
00:25:39,890 --> 00:25:44,750
right<font color="#CCCCCC"> here question why symbian because</font>

616
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:47,360
symbian<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the king of the hill</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> symbian</font>

617
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:49,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">is the gorilla they by far have the</font>

618
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,409
biggest market share of smartphone

619
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:53,990
operating systems they are three times

620
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:57,170
ahead of blackberry or iphone or android

621
00:25:53,990 --> 00:25:59,600
or windows mobile of course here in USA

622
00:25:57,170 --> 00:26:01,250
nobody runs symbian but you go anywhere

623
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">else and it is by far the most common</font>

624
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:05,330
platform so most of the attackers are

625
00:26:03,500 --> 00:26:07,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">writing for the biggest operating system</font>

626
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:10,428
yes there are some attacks for others

627
00:26:07,550 --> 00:26:15,740
but frankly very little so that's that's

628
00:26:10,429 --> 00:26:19,070
the distribution<font color="#E5E5E5"> of malware today we</font>

629
00:26:15,740 --> 00:26:21,980
have seen for<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of Lexus by remote</font>

630
00:26:19,070 --> 00:26:24,230
spy program is available for blackberry

631
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:25,820
so it's not it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a virus or worm but</font>

632
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:27,559
it's a spying tool that can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be installed</font>

633
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:30,350
on a blackberry and then to be used to

634
00:26:27,559 --> 00:26:32,000
remotely listen on the phone call see

635
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:33,439
the location<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> phone turn on the</font>

636
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,030
microphone remotely and listening what's

637
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:37,309
being discussed that would be a typical

638
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:39,620
example<font color="#CCCCCC"> of blackberry malware but</font>

639
00:26:37,309 --> 00:26:43,840
outside of that there's very<font color="#CCCCCC"> few example</font>

640
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:43,840
yes

641
00:26:48,640 --> 00:26:56,320
not really what we have seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> in addition</font>

642
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:57,790
of the eight numbers a listed the 3d

643
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:59,260
poker art game which was done by the

644
00:26:57,790 --> 00:27:01,360
same Russian hacker<font color="#CCCCCC"> with exactly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

645
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:02,950
same logic two weeks<font color="#E5E5E5"> later it had the</font>

646
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:05,290
same<font color="#E5E5E5"> list of numbers except in order</font>

647
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:07,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">your seven number so it had even smaller</font>

648
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:09,490
list of numbers then we've seen similar

649
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:11,410
attacks with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Java Trojans with send text</font>

650
00:27:09,490 --> 00:27:13,510
messages but those have only been seen

651
00:27:11,410 --> 00:27:14,920
inside Russia so the Trojans are in

652
00:27:13,510 --> 00:27:16,360
Russian language they use Russian

653
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:17,770
numbers which only work with in Russia

654
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:20,169
so you don't have to worry about those

655
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:21,580
outside of Russia those numbers sure I

656
00:27:20,170 --> 00:27:36,940
can provide that list to you but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

657
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:39,610
only eight numbers so forging the caller

658
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:41,050
ID using voice over IP to get the user

659
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:43,810
call back maybe or<font color="#CCCCCC"> something like that</font>

660
00:27:41,050 --> 00:27:46,810
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that what you mean right well the</font>

661
00:27:43,810 --> 00:27:48,730
problem is if<font color="#CCCCCC"> yeah depends</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the other</font>

662
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:50,230
building is done if if you have a system

663
00:27:48,730 --> 00:27:53,440
where<font color="#E5E5E5"> the receiver pays for the call</font>

664
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:55,480
positively we haven't seen it but<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

665
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:58,270
we have seen is that there are calls

666
00:27:55,480 --> 00:28:00,610
being placed from those very expensive

667
00:27:58,270 --> 00:28:02,350
numbers and hanged up immediately

668
00:28:00,610 --> 00:28:04,149
leaving you a missed call and of course

669
00:28:02,350 --> 00:28:06,639
they will call<font color="#E5E5E5"> back when they have a</font>

670
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:08,170
missed call that's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

671
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:10,180
seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> but that has nothing to do with</font>

672
00:28:08,170 --> 00:28:12,190
mobile malware that's just a traditional

673
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:13,360
attack not too interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> from our</font>

674
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:14,980
point of view but that's what we have

675
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:21,149
seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we believe those are done which</font>

676
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:21,150
was over IP systems yes yes

677
00:28:24,950 --> 00:28:44,450
so the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> was about looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

678
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:46,760
numbers of course you can get your

679
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:48,529
operator to block these numbers so for

680
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:50,779
example if your operator is AT&T or

681
00:28:48,529 --> 00:28:51,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">t-mobile you can call them up explain</font>

682
00:28:50,779 --> 00:28:54,710
that these are bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers that they</font>

683
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:56,809
will block anybody from t-mobile or from

684
00:28:54,710 --> 00:28:58,130
AT&T calling the numbers that's not

685
00:28:56,809 --> 00:29:00,260
going to solve the problem it's that

686
00:28:58,130 --> 00:29:01,850
spun operator in the world so the real

687
00:29:00,260 --> 00:29:03,320
way would of course to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shutdown</font>

688
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:06,439
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers themselves that's much</font>

689
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:08,029
harder to do and one last<font color="#E5E5E5"> question</font>

690
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:23,659
before you switch for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next door yes</font>

691
00:29:08,029 --> 00:29:25,340
you want to see them I'll show you there

692

on any other platform that's important

700
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:47,389
point we haven't seen mobile exploits

701
00:29:44,269 --> 00:29:49,549
being used by mother ever that's very

702
00:29:47,389 --> 00:29:52,250
important the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we saw an iPhone</font>

around the world who had iphones in

there who are selling iphones including

quite a few operators around the world

730
00:30:59,809 --> 00:31:06,230
second worm if you look close here in

731
00:31:04,669 --> 00:31:07,760
the bottom you can actually see issuing

732
00:31:06,230 --> 00:31:10,100
this is a shell script so it issues a

733
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:11,419
curl command to connect with these IP

734
00:31:10,100 --> 00:31:14,600

00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:18,889
and as you can see downloads a PHP file

737
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:21,500
when this was going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on I went to that</font>

website i just used<font color="#E5E5E5"> download the same</font>

739
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:27,170
PHP file now look at this this audience

740
00:31:25,429 --> 00:31:30,200
should actually be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this</font>

741
00:31:27,170 --> 00:31:33,320
i'm downloading a PHP file you can see

742
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:38,000
here that what I'm getting is 404 not

743

be exactly very good header says 200 ok

747
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:52,400

00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:53,960
file which says 404 not found but

754
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:04,910

786
00:33:24,710 --> 00:33:28,760

787
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:31,340
looks the same so it's a full copy of

788
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:33,410
the side and this change the fact that

789
00:33:31,340 --> 00:33:34,760
you know you're doing this from<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

actually hacked site selling pottery

793
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:44,270

00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,550
had an ssl certificate and they needed

795
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:48,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">an ssl certificate for the hack work so</font>

these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the two iphone trojans we see</font>

797
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:52,400
so it's a banking<font color="#E5E5E5"> trojan trying to steal</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">actually be much more smarter from the</font>

801
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:59,240
attackers not to try to do complex

802
00:33:57,860 --> 00:34:00,649
things like these<font color="#E5E5E5"> but instead just make</font>

803
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:02,330
international calls to premium rate

804
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:04,010
numbers and get money instantly and

805
00:34:02,330 --> 00:34:05,629

mobile malware will be thank you very

807
