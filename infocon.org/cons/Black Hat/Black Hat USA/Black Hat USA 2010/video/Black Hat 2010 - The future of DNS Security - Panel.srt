infrastructure taken off yet what's

113
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:00,030
wrong with PK out and you know when

00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:02,940
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> ask you a question like that you</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">a lot of times I thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of a lot of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">different excuses and the one I</font>

118
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:11,730
particularly like for a long time I

119
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:13,860
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's true is that it's a capital</font>

120
00:05:11,730 --> 00:05:16,290
development problem you get the benefit

121
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,580
comes kind of down rear and the costs

122
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:19,290
are up front so it's a bit of hard to

123
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:21,000
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it started</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and after you get a</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">certain amount of it then everybody</font>

125
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to begin to one so why was you</font>

126
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,920
know all these people predicting we're

127
00:05:24,510 --> 00:05:29,370
going to see the need of the exponential

128
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:33,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">anytime but I've come to realize this</font>

129
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:36,600
another problem and that is of all

130
00:05:33,990 --> 00:05:39,210
authentication it's a keying

131
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:40,950
infrastructures basically make

132
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:42,450
introductions you know the fact you

133
00:05:40,950 --> 00:05:44,280
encrypt with the keys once you get them

134
00:05:42,450 --> 00:05:46,110
and so forth is subordinate to the fact

135
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:47,940
the essential thing they do is hand you

136
00:05:46,110 --> 00:05:51,000
something say here I introduce<font color="#CCCCCC"> you to</font>

137
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:53,370
so-and-so well<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're such and such or</font>

138
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:56,730
something like that and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> all</font>

139
00:05:53,370 --> 00:06:05,820
authentication is relative<font color="#CCCCCC"> to some kind</font>

140
00:05:56,730 --> 00:06:07,770
of namespace and they prob one of the

141
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:10,409
problems I realizes people were trying

142
00:06:07,770 --> 00:06:12,659
to sell you know classic marketing

143
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:15,060
problem you're trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sell two things</font>

144
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:17,580
and you have to sell the customer on

145
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,230
both of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them and one was a namespace and</font>

146
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:21,870
the other was the authentication

147
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:23,340
mechanism for the namespace and that's

148
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:27,120
not there was not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was no</font>

149
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:29,039
success<font color="#CCCCCC"> i mean ssl for example a finesse</font>

150
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,500
this problem very very elegantly and

151
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:35,280
it's it's been probably the most widely

152
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:38,060
deployed crypto security mechanism ever

153
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:41,450
seen but now

154
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:45,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">what DNS SEC it seems</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to me we may have</font>

155
00:06:41,450 --> 00:06:50,120
jumped a major hurdle because we had a

156
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:52,820
namespace that was already accepted that

157
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:56,720
had been developing for you know 20<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

158
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:59,780
25 years and now we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> merely</font>

159
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:03,440
introducing an authentication mechanism

160
00:06:59,780 --> 00:07:07,159
that runs within that namespace and that

161
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:12,380
now gives us something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be</font>

162
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:15,950
deployed for its primary use and once

163
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:18,290
you have authenticated<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS identities</font>

164
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:21,020
then you'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to press that father</font>

165
00:07:18,290 --> 00:07:22,850
and do more with it so with that I think

166
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:27,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll yield the balance of my five</font>

167
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:31,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">minutes thanks with ten years ago when I</font>

168
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:33,740
left a public sector job to to go to a

169
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:35,150
little company<font color="#CCCCCC"> called network solutions</font>

170
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:37,669
I thought man I got the easiest job in

171
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:39,888
the world I its dns how hard can it be

172
00:07:37,669 --> 00:07:41,960
you know I mean it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just some domain</font>

173
00:07:39,889 --> 00:07:43,850
names and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean don't don't you just</font>

174
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:47,330
use VI to edit them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then call it a</font>

175
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:50,210
day at that time we were doing I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

176
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:52,640
we were doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> about high-end speed about</font>

177
00:07:50,210 --> 00:07:55,460
60,000 queries a second now we do over a

178
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:56,900
million queries a second but I've had

179
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:59,570
the opportunity over the last<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">of sort of I've had the opportunity to</font>

181
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:03,950
see over the last 10<font color="#CCCCCC"> years sort of how</font>

182
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:05,270
that's how DNS itself has changed

183
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:08,450
although the protocol has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been largely</font>

184
00:08:05,270 --> 00:08:10,940
unchanged its usage has changed a lot

185
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:13,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">ten</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ago is a pretty big deal when</font>

186
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:15,410
ad networks were sort of using the

187
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:17,180
domain name system to serve up different

188
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:18,889
ads by just simply cycling through

189
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:20,510
different different domain names or

190
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:22,940
different IP addresses from those domain

191
00:08:20,510 --> 00:08:25,280
names and that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that turned out to be a</font>

192
00:08:22,940 --> 00:08:26,539
pretty successful venture for them but

193
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:28,400
then other people got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the idea that hey</font>

194
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:30,380
we could<font color="#CCCCCC"> use DNS to do a global</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> site</font>

195
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:32,990
load balancing we can use DNS to do a

196
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:35,719
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of things so what we've seen is an</font>

197
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:38,479
increase sort of in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the capacity that</font>

198
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:40,669
has been needed for the domain<font color="#E5E5E5"> name</font>

199
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:42,919
system not just because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the number of</font>

200
00:08:40,669 --> 00:08:44,660
users grows on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet or the</font>

201
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:47,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">number of domain names grows on the</font>

202
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:49,610
internet but because those users and

203
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,350
those domains are doing so<font color="#CCCCCC"> much more</font>

204
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:53,830
than the

205
00:08:50,350 --> 00:08:55,840
did before so from a sort of a challenge

206
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:59,080
perspective is you have a capacity

207
00:08:55,840 --> 00:09:01,780
growth issue where it's redoubling about

208
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:04,180
every 16 to 18 months where that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

209
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:05,620
interesting scalability<font color="#E5E5E5"> challenge that</font>

210
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:08,140
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to stay in front of because if</font>

211
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:09,730
the DNS system doesn't work then the

212
00:09:08,140 --> 00:09:12,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet doesn't work it's pretty much</font>

213
00:09:09,730 --> 00:09:16,480
that simple but then coupled with that

214
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:17,949
so many users now are getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

215
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,780
bandwidth from broadband I mean the

216
00:09:17,950 --> 00:09:20,950
definition of broadband used to be a lot

217
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:23,170
lower than what people are actually

218
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:24,730
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> today in fact most cell phones can</font>

219
00:09:23,170 --> 00:09:26,890
actually transmit speeds higher than

220
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:29,500
what the US government for example

221
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:33,400
originally classified as broadband those

222
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:35,620
devices now become either an attack

223
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:39,370
element or a query element for

224
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:43,960
legitimate purposes but either way the

225
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:46,510
growth in in malicious traffic or attack

226
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:48,550
traffic on the DNS infrastructure has

227
00:09:46,510 --> 00:09:50,890
outpaced that of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> legitimate traffic</font>

228
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:53,079
that's not unexpected and I think you'd

229
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:55,660
find<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in in many</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the industries</font>

230
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:57,310
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> the challenge that it presents us</font>

231
00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:00,250
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stay so far ahead of it</font>

232
00:09:57,310 --> 00:10:02,170
because you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> time to go</font>

233
00:10:00,250 --> 00:10:04,540
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and update you know a hundred</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

234
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:06,130
more sites at a moment's notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">throw more capacity the problem so it</font>

236
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:09,550
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be something that's sort</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

237
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:13,420
forecasted well in advance and DNS

238
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:15,670
itself up until<font color="#E5E5E5"> now really had no</font>

239
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:17,140
security associated with it used the UDP

240
00:10:15,670 --> 00:10:19,810
protocol which was a completely

241
00:10:17,140 --> 00:10:23,230
stateless protocol so a dresses could

242
00:10:19,810 --> 00:10:25,390
easily be forged and and there was no

243
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:27,550
validation that it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming from any</font>

244
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:29,470
particular place<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so DNS was often</font>

245
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:30,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">used as a reflector attack against other</font>

246
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:33,490
victims where he could send a relatively

247
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:34,900
small query and the answer coming from

248
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:36,880
the name servers<font color="#E5E5E5"> would be relatively</font>

249
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:39,579
large so you could amplify an attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

250
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:44,080
10 or even 64 times what it originally

251
00:10:39,580 --> 00:10:47,050
was so DNS is both a victim and sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

252
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:49,840
an enabler if you will of other denial

253
00:10:47,050 --> 00:10:51,640
of service types attacks so a lot of the

254
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:53,290
research is<font color="#CCCCCC"> going on in this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> space is</font>

255
00:10:51,640 --> 00:10:55,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">not just around how to secure the</font>

256
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:59,199
message<font color="#E5E5E5"> itself which DNS SEC does a very</font>

257
00:10:55,960 --> 00:11:01,330
good job of but also how to fortify the

258
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:03,760
protocol itself in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the longer term and</font>

259
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:05,560
thinking sort of years down the road

260
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:07,420
what is that protocol going to look<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

261
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:09,939
so that it's less susceptible to the

262
00:11:07,420 --> 00:11:12,280
kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of attacks that it is today and</font>

263
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:13,810
with that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll turn it up turn</font>

264
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:15,550
to balance of my time over to the

265
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:18,609
distinguished gentleman from California

266
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:23,530
and that would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one to my right</font>

267
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:25,570
sandy hi so I guess one of the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

268
00:11:23,530 --> 00:11:28,270
wanted to say is since we've got the

269
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:31,120
panel here is congratulations on signing

270
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:34,600
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> root rod and wit so that's a very</font>

271
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:40,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">important milestone for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the security of</font>

272
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:44,830
DNS but it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's just the first</font>

273
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:49,150
step there are large numbers of

274
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:53,050
deployment issues I think with DNS SEC

275
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:55,120
and and it's an enormously important

276
00:11:53,050 --> 00:11:56,500
thing to do but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think what they</font>

277
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,070
actually said it pretty well which is

278
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:02,590
there's a large upfront cost in order to

279
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:05,560
get there and so I think there's kind of

280
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:08,140
two things and key vulnerabilities

281
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:10,630
beyond what they were saying is one you

282
00:12:08,140 --> 00:12:13,600
know how can we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hacker community</font>

283
00:12:10,630 --> 00:12:16,210
to actually contribute to figuring out

284
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:19,330
where there might be additional you know

285
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:21,130
DNS SEC has a long gestation period but

286
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:25,000
how can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get the hacker community to</font>

287
00:12:21,130 --> 00:12:28,870
work with<font color="#CCCCCC"> us before you know I think I</font>

288
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:30,610
think what was<font color="#E5E5E5"> it maybe Jeff said</font>

289
00:12:28,870 --> 00:12:33,130
something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> this at the keynote it</font>

290
00:12:30,610 --> 00:12:34,990
you know oftentimes it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> 15 20</font>

291
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:36,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">years before we find some of the</font>

00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:39,760
vulnerabilities and things right i mean

293
00:12:36,790 --> 00:12:43,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">dan's vulnerability in the dns was there</font>

294
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:45,189
the whole time right<font color="#CCCCCC"> but we didn't know</font>

295
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:47,590
about it and and then we found<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

296
00:12:45,190 --> 00:12:49,090
solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> short-term</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> solution and</font>

297
00:12:47,590 --> 00:12:51,550
then you know people are getting a

298
00:12:49,090 --> 00:12:56,500
little bit complacent again i would<font color="#CCCCCC"> say</font>

299
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:58,390
perhaps and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we really need the</font>

300
00:12:56,500 --> 00:13:02,110
hacker community to come out and force

301
00:12:58,390 --> 00:13:04,270
to help us find any additional

302
00:13:02,110 --> 00:13:08,430
vulnerabilities in the protocol as we

303
00:13:04,270 --> 00:13:08,430
try to put<font color="#CCCCCC"> it out there so</font>

304
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:12,790
Thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> You sandy and I'm going to do a</font>

00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:14,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">little bit of a bridge between some of</font>

the concepts laid down as a foundation

<font color="#E5E5E5">here and that the next two speakers and</font>

00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:24,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">be here today because like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Dan</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font>

310
00:13:21,339 --> 00:13:27,370
here in 2008 and in 2008 I had the honor

311
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:28,690
to do the kickoff keynote when I was

312
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:31,600
serving as the director of the National

313
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:33,399
cybersecurity Center and the key message

314
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,380
that I delivered at that time was the

315
00:13:33,399 --> 00:13:37,899
importance of enhancing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet</font>

316
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:39,640
protocols for greater security that the

317
00:13:37,899 --> 00:13:41,770
best<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing we could do to secure the</font>

318
00:13:39,640 --> 00:13:44,290
internet was to invest in the

319
00:13:41,770 --> 00:13:46,300
fundamental protocols and developing the

320
00:13:44,290 --> 00:13:48,040
standards<font color="#E5E5E5"> and deploying them and that</font>

321
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:50,079
without doing that we can<font color="#CCCCCC"> spend many</font>

322
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:52,270
billions hundreds of billions or even

323
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:54,700
trillions of dollars on security with a

324
00:13:52,270 --> 00:13:57,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">limited impact and to be here today they</font>

325
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:59,800
have the honor to serve I can and to

326
00:13:57,250 --> 00:14:02,170
serve the community and to see DNS SEC

327
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:05,649
that so many of you have been working<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

328
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:08,410
for up to 20<font color="#CCCCCC"> years rolling out makes me</font>

329
00:14:05,649 --> 00:14:11,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">feel truly truly fortunate and when we</font>

330
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:12,459
look in that at what's been accomplished

331
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:14,680
the first thing I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to do is just</font>

332
00:14:12,459 --> 00:14:17,349
recognize the work of the internet

333
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:19,899
Engineering Task Force and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IETF has</font>

334
00:14:17,350 --> 00:14:23,649
worked on this problem for a long long

335
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:26,200
time many engineers have have work to

336
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:29,560
develop the the standards developed<font color="#E5E5E5"> test</font>

337
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:32,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">beds work through the rfcs it's been an</font>

338
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:35,439
enormous mountain of work that the rest

339
00:14:32,709 --> 00:14:37,390
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us can can benefit from and so we're</font>

340
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,130
all very grateful<font color="#E5E5E5"> for that so what</font>

341
00:14:37,390 --> 00:14:41,439
<font color="#CCCCCC">happened so you know now the roots been</font>

342
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:44,110
signed so what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean does that</font>

343
00:14:41,440 --> 00:14:47,140
mean the internet is now safe know what

344
00:14:44,110 --> 00:14:49,990
it means is that it now can become much

345
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:52,060
safer but<font color="#E5E5E5"> what has to happen for it to</font>

346
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:55,329
become much safer and there's really two

347
00:14:52,060 --> 00:14:57,670
two major things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to happen two</font>

348
00:14:55,329 --> 00:15:01,449
categories of things<font color="#E5E5E5"> number</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one is to</font>

349
00:14:57,670 --> 00:15:03,370
propagate the DNS SEC signings

350
00:15:01,450 --> 00:15:06,940
throughout the top-level domains of the

351
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:08,680
internet so as of today there's a number

352
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:11,790
nine that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> believe have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> been signed</font>

353
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:15,599
with the the new DNS SEC

354
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:21,360
a root key that's nine out of roughly

355
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:23,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">270 so there's another 261 to go so the</font>

356
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">namespace has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be secured in that</font>

357
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:27,240
fashion then there has to be the

358
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:29,040
development of the applications to

359
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,770
leverage this whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's the browsers</font>

360
00:15:29,040 --> 00:15:33,240
or it's the email systems or any of the

361
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:37,829
other systems that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are leveraging the</font>

362
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:40,170
domain name system need to be evolved

363
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:44,820
and then of course as well the ISPs need

364
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:48,180
to adopt and support the the name server

365
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:50,460
capabilities in supporting DNS<font color="#E5E5E5"> SEC so</font>

366
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:53,579
now we move into a new phase which

367
00:15:50,460 --> 00:15:55,410
really relates to adoption and I think

368
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:59,640
it's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> relevant then that I now hand</font>

369
00:15:55,410 --> 00:16:01,530
it over to Dan Kaminsky who's been

370
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:04,110
working<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this area and then we'll cap</font>

371
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:06,180
off with with<font color="#CCCCCC"> mark</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Weatherford who has</font>

372
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:12,210
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> very involved in deploying DNS SEC</font>

373
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:15,270
in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> state of California so I'd like</font>

374
00:16:12,210 --> 00:16:19,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">to begin by actually joining rotten his</font>

375
00:16:15,270 --> 00:16:21,390
congratulations of the the IETF there

376
00:16:19,140 --> 00:16:24,960
are a tremendous number of engineers who

377
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:27,840
have literally put may be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to even</font>

378
00:16:24,960 --> 00:16:32,160
decades of their life into the project

379
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:34,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">of DNS SEC I was not one of them I was</font>

380
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:38,250
in fact like many engineers who thought

381
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:42,510
DNS SEC was<font color="#E5E5E5"> a too much work for not</font>

382
00:16:38,250 --> 00:16:46,290
enough benefit you know what I was<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong</font>

383
00:16:42,510 --> 00:16:48,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">and that's okay um being wrong just</font>

384
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:49,500
means the world's<font color="#E5E5E5"> more interesting than</font>

385
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:54,480
the world and then you thought it was

386
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:56,880
DNS SEC turns out to be one of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> most</font>

387
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:59,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting technologies that I have</font>

388
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:02,460
ever seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my career not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> simply for</font>

389
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:04,290
its ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to fix problems in DNS</font>

390
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:07,050
itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> although it does a pretty</font>

391
00:17:04,290 --> 00:17:10,440
comprehensive job of that but in

392
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:14,369
actually providing a infrastructure a a

the single most pernicious problems in

395
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:24,189
all of security cannot merely be

396
00:17:20,190 --> 00:17:27,610
addressed but addressed efficiently

397
00:17:24,190 --> 00:17:29,590
effectively affordably these are worse

398
00:17:27,609 --> 00:17:31,540
we don't generally<font color="#E5E5E5"> consider</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in security</font>

399
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:33,310
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> usually just think oh well we're just</font>

402
00:17:35,170 --> 00:17:40,990
it's got to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> good it's got to be</font>

403

404
00:17:40,990 --> 00:17:48,970
field and the really<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting thing</font>

405
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:51,310
about 18 months ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> I sat down and said</font>

406
00:17:48,970 --> 00:17:52,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay all my friends keep telling me I</font>

407
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:54,970
gotta look at this DNS sex stuff I'm

408
00:17:52,930 --> 00:17:58,600
gonna write a server and tell anyone

409
00:17:54,970 --> 00:18:01,510
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> sat down and wrote one about 18</font>

410
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:04,149
months<font color="#CCCCCC"> ago I completely changed my tune</font>

411
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:08,110
on DNS SEC why because the server was

412
00:18:04,150 --> 00:18:10,420
really good so all the things<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I've</font>

413
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:13,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">been saying for the last 18 months about</font>

414
00:18:10,420 --> 00:18:17,290
securing email about securing the web

415
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:19,210
about making it<font color="#E5E5E5"> possible to authenticate</font>

416
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:22,420
across organizational boundaries you

417
00:18:19,210 --> 00:18:24,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what I think all of you all should</font>

418
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:26,770
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little sick of it by now because</font>

419
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,990
it's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot of talk and not a lot of</font>

420
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:31,690
code and so I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you all</font>

421
00:18:28,990 --> 00:18:33,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">right now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in about five hours we're</font>

00:18:31,690 --> 00:18:35,530
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> releasing a lot of code</font>

423
00:18:33,130 --> 00:18:39,220
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to show you just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> how much</font>

424
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:43,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">value this technology is going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to bring</font>

425
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:46,300
securing the internet that sounds very

426
00:18:43,810 --> 00:18:50,050
tempting their first<font color="#E5E5E5"> all to attend that</font>

427
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:52,060
session that's for sure mark so that

428
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:53,770
means everybody write it down you need

429
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:55,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">to come to dance presentation this</font>

430
00:18:53,770 --> 00:19:03,160
afternoon this is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be another</font>

431
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:08,350
event just like 2008 like that well as

432
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:10,510
rod said I am formerly the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CISO on the</font>

433
00:19:08,350 --> 00:19:12,429
state of California so i am<font color="#CCCCCC"> not an</font>

434
00:19:10,510 --> 00:19:13,810
official representative from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> state</font>

435
00:19:12,430 --> 00:19:15,040
of California any longer but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font>

436
00:19:13,810 --> 00:19:18,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk about it a little bit today</font>

437
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:21,700
unless you're in state government in

438
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:23,650
October of 2007 that date probably

439
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:25,420
doesn't mean a lot to you but if you're

440
00:19:23,650 --> 00:19:27,550
in california state government the date

441
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:31,300
would mean a whole lot because that was

442
00:19:27,550 --> 00:19:36,399
the day that was the month that<font color="#E5E5E5"> OMB took</font>

443
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:37,049
ca.gov offline and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can tell you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

444
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,690
gets

445
00:19:37,049 --> 00:19:41,789
attention fortunately<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wasn't in</font>

446
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:43,889
California I was the CSO a call in

447
00:19:41,789 --> 00:19:45,840
Colorado at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the time and I remember</font>

448
00:19:43,889 --> 00:19:50,459
reading about anything and holy cow

449
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:53,639
somebody is in big trouble is what

450
00:19:50,460 --> 00:20:01,169
happened was there was a California has

451
00:19:53,639 --> 00:20:05,100
almost<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2000 dot CA gov domains a CA gov</font>

452
00:20:01,169 --> 00:20:07,080
and state CA us and they're scattered

453
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:08,610
and they're not only within state

454
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:12,389
government a lot of local governments

455
00:20:08,610 --> 00:20:15,178
fire departments libraries all over the

456
00:20:12,389 --> 00:20:18,748
place and they're managed by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the state</font>

457
00:20:15,179 --> 00:20:22,649
and at the time perhaps not too well

458
00:20:18,749 --> 00:20:26,220
managed there was a domain in in a

459
00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:29,549
county that had some some malicious code

460
00:20:26,220 --> 00:20:31,109
on their on their website and OMB had

461
00:20:29,549 --> 00:20:32,879
been trying for several months<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

462
00:20:31,109 --> 00:20:37,019
them to fix it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they didn't fix it so</font>

463
00:20:32,879 --> 00:20:38,639
OMB just took ca.gov offline so i

464
00:20:37,019 --> 00:20:41,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember reading about it when I took</font>

465
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:44,789
the job in and california that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

466
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:46,649
what I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to fix</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS that's going</font>

467
00:20:44,789 --> 00:20:49,739
to be one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things I want to work</font>

468
00:20:46,649 --> 00:20:52,080
on one of my big project and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I you know</font>

469
00:20:49,739 --> 00:20:54,659
DNS SEC is the way I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do it if</font>

470
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:58,408
we're going to fix DNS let's really fix

471
00:20:54,659 --> 00:21:00,179
dns so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I started rooting around trying</font>

472
00:20:58,409 --> 00:21:04,590
to find some money<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I got a homeland</font>

473
00:21:00,179 --> 00:21:08,879
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> grant for it last year to to</font>

474
00:21:04,590 --> 00:21:12,899
implement DNS SEC<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the state and so it</font>

475
00:21:08,879 --> 00:21:15,029
the challenges and and I am NOT a DNS

476
00:21:12,899 --> 00:21:17,668
SEC expert but I do understand what

477
00:21:15,029 --> 00:21:20,279
Dan's you said<font color="#CCCCCC"> that DNS SEC will fix a</font>

478
00:21:17,669 --> 00:21:22,230
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our problems I want citizens and</font>

479
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:24,840
the state of California when they go

480
00:21:22,230 --> 00:21:26,249
visit a DMV website or health care

481
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">department of healthcare services</font>

482
00:21:26,249 --> 00:21:31,350
website that they're sure that they're

483
00:21:28,409 --> 00:21:34,649
visiting that website DNS SEC will do

484
00:21:31,350 --> 00:21:37,199
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> for us so so they're in the middle</font>

485
00:21:34,649 --> 00:21:40,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">of actually in the beginning phases of a</font>

486
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:43,109
deployment right now and it's been a

487
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:46,139
challenge it is one I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to convince</font>

488
00:21:43,109 --> 00:21:47,759
everybody up through the governor's

489
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:49,889
office that this was the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right thing to</font>

490
00:21:47,759 --> 00:21:52,560
do because this is a huge

491
00:21:49,890 --> 00:21:56,820
cultural change and it impacts a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

492
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:59,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">people on a lot of organizations so so</font>

493
00:21:56,820 --> 00:22:03,689
that's kind of where I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> focused on this</font>

494
00:21:59,790 --> 00:22:05,730
is the organizational change required to

495
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:07,920
to do something<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a DNS</font>

496
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:11,760
implementation on a large government

497
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:13,470
organization it's great well I want to

498
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">thank all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the panelists and now we'd</font>

499
00:22:13,470 --> 00:22:20,160
like to<font color="#CCCCCC"> open it up to questions from the</font>

500
00:22:16,410 --> 00:22:22,590
audience for any of the panelists or any

501
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,630
number of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> panelists and while you</font>

502
00:22:22,590 --> 00:22:26,760
all think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those questions I'll ask</font>

503
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:28,710
question to the panel and anyone can

504
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:31,200
pick<font color="#E5E5E5"> it up they like and that is so if</font>

505
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:33,090
each<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you had a you know a magic wand</font>

506
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:36,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you can pick the next thing that</font>

507
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:39,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">needs to get done for DNS SEC to get</font>

508
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:40,889
deployed successfully in whatever is the

509
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">environment you most care about or deal</font>

510
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:44,820
with you know what what would you what

511
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:49,830
what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to get done what do you</font>

512
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:52,169
want to see happen well I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think the</font>

513
00:22:49,830 --> 00:22:55,679
first step in getting DNS SEC out there

514
00:22:52,170 --> 00:22:58,380
is basically making it<font color="#CCCCCC"> just dead simple</font>

515
00:22:55,680 --> 00:23:00,990
for people who are today dns

516
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:03,660
administrators to sign zones the duels

517
00:23:00,990 --> 00:23:07,590
for that have been woefully inadequate

518
00:23:03,660 --> 00:23:09,540
just that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know 25 page documents</font>

519
00:23:07,590 --> 00:23:12,720
about all the different steps that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

520
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:16,440
have to go through design zones you know

521
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:18,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">recently the plug you know my plug is as</font>

522
00:23:16,440 --> 00:23:20,520
we produce something that makes it

523
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:22,379
somewhat easier and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think other people</font>

524
00:23:20,520 --> 00:23:23,970
are doing the same kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things but I</font>

525
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:26,250
think it's super important and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that's</font>

526
00:23:23,970 --> 00:23:30,420
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> the first step to getting more</font>

527
00:23:26,250 --> 00:23:32,040
people to sign their zone sooner great

528
00:23:30,420 --> 00:23:33,480
any other panelists want to take a<font color="#CCCCCC"> stab</font>

529
00:23:32,040 --> 00:23:35,550
for that while someone from the audience

530
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:37,770
we have we have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> audience</font>

531
00:23:35,550 --> 00:23:40,080
please<font color="#E5E5E5"> go ahead yeah sorry through a</font>

532
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:42,330
rhetorical<font color="#E5E5E5"> thumb question and I know</font>

533
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,070
Vera signs on the panel wouldn't it have

534
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:45,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">just been easier just to mandate for</font>

535
00:23:44,070 --> 00:23:48,510
high security<font color="#E5E5E5"> high important websites</font>

536
00:23:45,660 --> 00:23:50,550
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to everyone have EV ssl a lot</font>

537
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:52,830
easier a lot simpler and that way you

538
00:23:50,550 --> 00:23:54,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually know and you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> could verify and</font>

539
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:56,040
you just click on that left little

540
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:57,360
button<font color="#E5E5E5"> then your browser and see who it</font>

541
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:59,100
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you're talkin to and that's it a</font>

542
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,139
lot easier than adding in this extra

543
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:01,679
crypto and extra work at the multiple

544
00:24:01,140 --> 00:24:07,200
levels

545
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:09,810
well it is kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of interesting because</font>

546
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:12,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">you use the term could you just mandate</font>

547
00:24:09,810 --> 00:24:15,330
that they use EV ssl I don't know that

548
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:17,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">any mandate has ever actually worked on</font>

549
00:24:15,330 --> 00:24:23,490
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> internet successfully easily</font>

550
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:28,199
certainly EV ssl was was a is a rapidly

551
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:32,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">expanding implementation of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> SSL but even</font>

552
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:36,330
<font color="#CCCCCC">with</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the extended valid extend</font>

553
00:24:32,490 --> 00:24:40,470
validation ssl certificates there there

554
00:24:36,330 --> 00:24:42,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">still was not a firm mechanism in place</font>

555
00:24:40,470 --> 00:24:45,930
to prevent cache poisoning and those

556
00:24:42,540 --> 00:24:47,760
sorts of things so even even if you

557
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:49,380
could validate at the site and know that

558
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:51,150
you were<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to the site not everyone</font>

559
00:24:49,380 --> 00:24:52,920
was actually paying attention<font color="#CCCCCC"> to all of</font>

560
00:24:51,150 --> 00:24:54,450
those indicators for instance there's

561
00:24:52,920 --> 00:24:57,090
always been a padlock at the bottom of

562
00:24:54,450 --> 00:24:59,820
the browser and even before some of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

563
00:24:57,090 --> 00:25:03,540
domain validated ssl certificates from

564
00:24:59,820 --> 00:25:07,200
some cas were viewed as<font color="#E5E5E5"> somewhat risky</font>

565
00:25:03,540 --> 00:25:08,670
or riskier than EV ssl people still

566
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,780
didn't pay attention to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> padlock at</font>

567
00:25:08,670 --> 00:25:11,790
the bottom and they still don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> pay</font>

568
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:13,680
attention necessarily to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the green bar</font>

569
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:15,930
it's a good technology but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> takes a</font>

570
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:18,540
while to get you know one point eight or

571
00:25:15,930 --> 00:25:20,760
so billion users kind of accustomed to

572
00:25:18,540 --> 00:25:23,970
that the other thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they also</font>

573
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:27,000
relied on the user having to make a

00:25:23,970 --> 00:25:28,950
decision<font color="#E5E5E5"> what DNS SEC does is it takes</font>

00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:30,420
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> decision-making</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of out of</font>

576
00:25:28,950 --> 00:25:31,890
their<font color="#E5E5E5"> hands and it all happens in the</font>

577
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:34,110
background on the infrastructure itself

578
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:35,790
does that validation for them and I

579
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:38,340
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's one of the key things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

580
00:25:35,790 --> 00:25:40,800
DNS SEC does differently than most of

581
00:25:38,340 --> 00:25:42,570
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> traditional</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pki systems and that is</font>

582
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:44,190
it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> require</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the user to have to</font>

583
00:25:42,570 --> 00:25:47,310
do a whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot it requires the real</font>

584
00:25:44,190 --> 00:25:50,190
smart IT staff in the background to do a

585
00:25:47,310 --> 00:25:52,379
lot and what what we hope will happen is

586
00:25:50,190 --> 00:25:54,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">that the browsers and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the other client</font>

587
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:56,040
applications which exists on the

588
00:25:54,300 --> 00:25:57,899
desktops will then begin to<font color="#E5E5E5"> recognize</font>

589
00:25:56,040 --> 00:26:00,090
those messages and present them to the

590
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,890
user in a way that actually makes some

591
00:26:00,090 --> 00:26:06,480
sense to them and tells them when it

592
00:26:01,890 --> 00:26:08,850
doesn't validate why that happened yeah

593
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:12,450
I have a I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess this is a simple</font>

594
00:26:08,850 --> 00:26:14,520
question I remember when Dan came out

595
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:15,000
with its disclosure about the weaknesses

596
00:26:14,520 --> 00:26:18,510
<font color="#CCCCCC">in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> D</font>

597
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:19,560
we were sitting<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the office kind</font>

598
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:23,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">of trying to come up with solutions</font>

599
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:25,620
about how we could<font color="#E5E5E5"> fix it and one of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

600
00:26:23,610 --> 00:26:28,320
solutions was oh why<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't we just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> send</font>

601
00:26:25,620 --> 00:26:30,989
just have the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS servers and two</font>

602
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:33,659
replies instead of one and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> somebody</font>

603
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:35,700
came up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the realization</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's</font>

604
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:37,200
physically impossible because the DNS

605
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:40,650
servers are now almost running at

606
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:42,300
capacity so when I heard about oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

607
00:26:40,650 --> 00:26:45,180
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start implementing DNS</font>

608
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:47,280
SEC I thought wow if we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have the</font>

609
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:49,020
capacity to run you know to do something

610
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:52,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">that simple how do we have the capacity</font>

611
00:26:49,020 --> 00:26:56,010
to actually run DNS SEC<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so</font>

612
00:26:52,980 --> 00:27:00,660
what you refer<font color="#CCCCCC"> to is actually we called</font>

613
00:26:56,010 --> 00:27:03,150
it multi query um so it was a it was

614
00:27:00,660 --> 00:27:04,770
actually really interesting because<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

615
00:27:03,150 --> 00:27:09,030
we were sitting at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this meeting at</font>

616
00:27:04,770 --> 00:27:10,470
Microsoft I was like 16 of us and we're

617
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:12,930
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> over all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the possible solutions</font>

618
00:27:10,470 --> 00:27:17,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">that aren't just doing what dan</font>

619
00:27:12,930 --> 00:27:20,250
bernstein said to do in 1999 and the

620
00:27:17,730 --> 00:27:22,860
problem with multi query capacity is an

621
00:27:20,250 --> 00:27:25,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">issue but the thing is theoretically you</font>

622
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:27,870
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> just do multi query in situations</font>

623
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:29,460
where there might be an attack the real

624
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:31,409
issue<font color="#CCCCCC"> with multi query is there's no</font>

625
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:33,720
guarantee from request to request that

626
00:27:31,410 --> 00:27:36,480
you'll get the same answer back like if

627
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:37,890
you look at facebook or you look at hulu

628
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,020
or you look at a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of very very</font>

629
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:42,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">popular sites you can't just say well</font>

630
00:27:40,020 --> 00:27:46,650
will secure the entire internet but who

631
00:27:42,450 --> 00:27:48,630
because that doesn't fly so multi query

632
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:50,190
was dropped not because of capacity

633
00:27:48,630 --> 00:27:52,410
because we were able to scope when the

634
00:27:50,190 --> 00:27:56,700
capacity it happened it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> dropped for</font>

635
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:59,550
compatibility reasons right another

636
00:27:56,700 --> 00:28:03,330
question over here what can<font color="#E5E5E5"> i as an IT</font>

637
00:27:59,550 --> 00:28:06,210
professional do and a<font color="#CCCCCC"> dns had been to</font>

638
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:07,530
get dns out there for my domains and<font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font>

639
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:08,610
do i implement it and where should I

640
00:28:07,530 --> 00:28:10,410
start looking for that sort of thing

641
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:13,229
we're so glad<font color="#CCCCCC"> you asked that question</font>

642
00:28:10,410 --> 00:28:15,470
maybe<font color="#CCCCCC"> cannoned dan can you help help on</font>

643
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:15,470
this one

644
00:28:16,350 --> 00:28:23,309
and timelines in<font color="#E5E5E5"> time one yeah so there</font>

645
00:28:21,090 --> 00:28:25,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">are a lot of tools that are out there to</font>

646
00:28:23,309 --> 00:28:27,690
help you do that i would say initially

647
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:29,429
don't try to overdo it<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in other</font>

648
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:31,799
words don't try to adopt a policy that

649
00:28:29,429 --> 00:28:35,730
the root in top-level domains have with

650
00:28:31,799 --> 00:28:37,020
rapidly changing signing keys because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

651
00:28:35,730 --> 00:28:38,730
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you do that you're opening</font>

652
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:40,139
yourself up to a huge management

653
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:41,400
nightmare of trying to figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

654
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:43,350
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> roll them and all those</font>

655
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,690
sorts of things the keys are pretty

656
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:47,969
strong<font color="#CCCCCC"> and your level they're probably</font>

657
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:49,980
strong enough to last a very very long

658
00:28:47,970 --> 00:28:52,169
time without having<font color="#CCCCCC"> to change them</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

659
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:54,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">damn might disagree or you might agree</font>

660
00:28:52,169 --> 00:28:57,059
but that there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are a lot of tools out</font>

661
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:58,500
there and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that there are</font>

662
00:28:57,059 --> 00:29:00,600
some better tools that are going to come

663
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:02,909
along so you have a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of options if</font>

664
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:05,039
you've<font color="#E5E5E5"> got the time and you've got</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

665
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:06,480
resources to use the existing sort of

command line tools that are available to

667
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:14,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">you today then by all means do it if you</font>

668
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:16,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't then</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you</font>

669
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:18,178
still want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deploy DNS SEC and you're</font>

670
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:20,250
still set on<font color="#E5E5E5"> it then I think what you</font>

00:29:18,179 --> 00:29:23,760
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need to start you know</font>

674
00:29:26,370 --> 00:29:33,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">terms of timelines so as rod said there</font>

675
00:29:30,809 --> 00:29:37,139
were I think nine signed top-level

676
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:41,880
domains tomorrow<font color="#CCCCCC"> though be 10 okay then</font>

00:29:37,140 --> 00:29:46,350
in pardon<font color="#E5E5E5"> calm will be signed in March</font>

680
00:29:49,409 --> 00:29:54,150
the next few days<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so that's sort of</font>

681
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,340
the timelines for those top level

682
00:29:54,150 --> 00:29:58,169
domains and other top-level domains such

683
00:29:56,340 --> 00:30:00,480
as dot org and others have already begun

684
00:29:58,169 --> 00:30:03,179
that implementation process and in fact

685
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:04,260
our sign today so it's at the top level

686
00:30:03,179 --> 00:30:06,299
domain it's happening pretty quickly

687
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:07,500
there are a lot of tools out there but

688
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:09,418
they need those tools need to be

689
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:11,870
improved unless you've got a lot of time

690

on your hands

691

we are the we're at the first wave of a

call DNS SEC for humans we're also

00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:35,750
it's getting a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> easier you ask the</font>

715
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:38,389
very specific questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> about timelines</font>

716
00:31:35,750 --> 00:31:40,520
here are the timelines that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I see I see</font>

717
00:31:38,390 --> 00:31:43,640
over the course<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the next six months</font>

718
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:45,830
it becoming clear that there's a new

719
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:47,960
generation of best practices to develop

720
00:31:45,830 --> 00:31:50,990
for how to affordably and effectively

721
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:52,970
deploy DNS SEC over those at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

722
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:55,460
the six months<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll start seeing the</font>

723
00:31:52,970 --> 00:31:58,550
beginning of products and<font color="#E5E5E5"> services</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

724
00:31:55,460 --> 00:32:02,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">depend on your infrastructure having DNS</font>

725
00:31:58,550 --> 00:32:04,460
SEC available after about nine months of

726
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:06,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">those being available we'll start seeing</font>

727
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:08,780
the big guys start moving their products

728
00:32:06,260 --> 00:32:11,150
over to this meaning over the course<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

729
00:32:08,780 --> 00:32:13,220
next year and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the third two and a half</font>

730
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:16,220
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really see some interesting</font>

731
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:20,330
stuff happen now you're right it's not

732
00:32:16,220 --> 00:32:23,700
instantaneous but this train is moving

733
00:32:20,330 --> 00:32:25,620
and and nothing's going to stop it

734
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:29,549
I just want to build on that very

735
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:31,949
quickly in terms of time frames is can

736
00:32:29,549 --> 00:32:35,970
mention the time frames for net and com

737
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:39,600
for those zones being signed within 12

738
00:32:35,970 --> 00:32:41,309
months it looks quite certain that well

739
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:43,199
over<font color="#E5E5E5"> half of all the domain names in the</font>

740
00:32:41,309 --> 00:32:45,210
world will fall under top-level domains

741
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:47,909
that have been that have been signed on

742
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:50,820
our DNS SEC because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the major</font>

743
00:32:47,909 --> 00:32:53,760
top-level domains are are working on

744
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:55,710
that and so good progress is is is being

745
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,480
made on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> site which which provides</font>

746
00:32:55,710 --> 00:33:00,120
an important part of the foundation as

747
00:32:57,480 --> 00:33:02,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">well as the others in terms of the the</font>

748
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:04,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">software enhancements thing I want to</font>

749
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:05,760
mention<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a second is it parties here</font>

750
00:33:04,470 --> 00:33:08,940
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been very kind in recognizing</font>

752
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:12,690
also want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> recognize the Department of</font>

Commerce and verisign who have been

partners that we've worked<font color="#CCCCCC"> together with</font>

side by side on signing the<font color="#CCCCCC"> root and</font>

00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:20,940
thank them and recognize them so please

would everything they've done

Thank<font color="#CCCCCC"> You Man people give me</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way too</font>

760
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:37,549
much credit and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like to add again</font>

761
00:33:35,090 --> 00:33:40,549
from a from a from a deployment

762
00:33:37,549 --> 00:33:44,030
perspective you've heard kind of dance

763
00:33:40,549 --> 00:33:45,918
vision of where this is going to be if

764
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:47,629
you have a large<font color="#CCCCCC"> organization if you</font>

765
00:33:45,919 --> 00:33:49,190
have the small organization you need to

766
00:33:47,630 --> 00:33:51,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">start thinking about it and planning now</font>

767
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:53,299
because you start gathering your

768
00:33:51,409 --> 00:33:55,580
resources start inventory in your

769
00:33:53,299 --> 00:33:58,220
environment this is I even if you

770
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:59,928
decided to do it today it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

771
00:33:58,220 --> 00:34:02,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">take a little while to do this so you</font>

772
00:33:59,929 --> 00:34:05,299
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> start the planning process now</font>

773
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:07,820
for the for the the benefits that we're

774
00:34:05,299 --> 00:34:13,429
going to see in the nine to<font color="#E5E5E5"> 18 month</font>

775
00:34:07,820 --> 00:34:16,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">time frame yeah I'd like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> build on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

776
00:34:13,429 --> 00:34:19,668
something dan said and maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> wits</font>

777
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:21,619
perspective on this as well for the

778
00:34:19,668 --> 00:34:25,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">first time we actually have a pretty</font>

779
00:34:21,619 --> 00:34:28,129
seamless cyan't message system that

780
00:34:25,310 --> 00:34:30,589
almost every computer can digest<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

781
00:34:28,129 --> 00:34:34,520
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> the packets are digitally signed</font>

782
00:34:30,589 --> 00:34:37,009
and once this is fully implemented we

783
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:39,440
tend to think of DNS SEC is only about

784
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:41,119
domain names themselves and not about

785
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:43,310
the rest of the information and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

786
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:46,790
other kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things that could be</font>

787
00:34:43,310 --> 00:34:51,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">carried that the possibilities i think</font>

788
00:34:46,790 --> 00:34:52,790
are way beyond just just protecting

789
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:55,970
against cache poisoning and things like

790
00:34:52,790 --> 00:34:57,560
that i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's it's a it's a message</font>

791
00:34:55,969 --> 00:34:59,000
system now that has some inherent

792
00:34:57,560 --> 00:35:01,970
security which will allow us to

793
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:04,099
transport other kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information in</font>

794
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:06,709
the information we haven't even<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought</font>

795
00:35:04,099 --> 00:35:08,270
of yet that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> i think is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

796
00:35:06,710 --> 00:35:10,160
very interesting and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think this now</font>

797
00:35:08,270 --> 00:35:12,589
opens a possibility because it is so

798
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:14,299
seamless and the trust is so seamless

799
00:35:12,589 --> 00:35:15,680
that the user doesn't have to do

800
00:35:14,300 --> 00:35:17,420
anything but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it can be built into</font>

801
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:19,098
software to take complete advantage that

802
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:20,960
I'd kind of like to get which kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

803
00:35:19,099 --> 00:35:23,960
perspective on that having seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> pki of</font>

804
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:25,940
all over fears yeah well that sounds

805
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:29,119
yeah sounds right to me once you get a

806
00:35:25,940 --> 00:35:31,040
working mechanism that people will then

807
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:32,750
the way things evolve is people push it

808
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,650
to do things that you'd never expect

809
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:44,540
them to do

810
00:35:33,650 --> 00:35:47,480
for so yes I expect this and with you I

811
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:49,460
guess I wanted the following up on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

812
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,960
just to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> something out to some of the</font>

813
00:35:49,460 --> 00:35:53,120
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> folks on the panel you know what</font>

814
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:56,420
kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of products and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> services do you</font>

815
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:58,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">think will best take advantage of that</font>

816
00:35:56,420 --> 00:36:01,070
kind of that kind of a trust

817
00:35:58,850 --> 00:36:03,680
infrastructure because we've talked

818
00:36:01,070 --> 00:36:06,500
about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> several times in the past where</font>

819
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:08,480
there are you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know it it opened you know</font>

820
00:36:06,500 --> 00:36:10,340
Ken's evident opens up a new Vista

821
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:12,560
around trust and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> what do you think</font>

822
00:36:10,340 --> 00:36:16,670
are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the the first new things that will</font>

823
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:19,400
take<font color="#CCCCCC"> advantage of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that when i receive</font>

824
00:36:16,670 --> 00:36:22,670
email from my bank<font color="#CCCCCC"> i would like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

825
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:25,580
it actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> came from my bank this is a</font>

826
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:30,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">promise we have been making for 15 years</font>

827
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:32,360
and we're not succeeding so they've

828
00:36:30,410 --> 00:36:34,490
number one application<font color="#E5E5E5"> i really see us</font>

829
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:38,270
finally after all these years getting

830
00:36:34,490 --> 00:36:41,330
secure email um I also see federated

831
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:43,160
identity actually working um one of the

832
00:36:41,330 --> 00:36:45,440
demos that I'm really<font color="#E5E5E5"> excited about is</font>

833
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:47,149
the ability to say you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what I have</font>

834
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:50,600
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> maintain that machine over there so</font>

835
00:36:47,150 --> 00:36:53,990
you know I'm a Dan at remote vendor I

836
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:59,150
need to log into root at some customer

837
00:36:53,990 --> 00:37:01,819
org and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> needed to just work and would</font>

838
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:06,110
you believe it with DNS SEC it actually

839
00:37:01,820 --> 00:37:08,120
did so there's been so much how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

840
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:09,830
these federated identity systems have we

841
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,910
seen come across our desks and we go

842
00:37:09,830 --> 00:37:13,130
ahead and we test them and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they work</font>

843
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:15,170
great<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you know you actually try</font>

844
00:37:13,130 --> 00:37:18,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">to deploy them and they don't scale yeah</font>

845
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:20,360
i'm done with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I want security</font>

846
00:37:18,140 --> 00:37:23,299
systems at scale and as wit has

847
00:37:20,360 --> 00:37:25,670
basically pointed out very cleanly we

848
00:37:23,300 --> 00:37:29,900
now<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the namespace in which this can</font>

849
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:31,520
actually be done great and thanks Dan

850
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:34,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">insanity response to your question I</font>

851
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:35,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">just say as an observer here you know I</font>

852
00:37:34,010 --> 00:37:37,340
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build off the comments to Jeff</font>

853
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:38,510
Moss made this this morning<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

854
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:39,950
opening session how many people heard

855
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:42,530
Jeff's remarks at the opening session

856
00:37:39,950 --> 00:37:44,210
this morning<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you'll recall</font>

857
00:37:42,530 --> 00:37:46,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">what Jeff talked about as he said you</font>

858
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:47,390
know we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on security for</font>

859
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:49,038
many years black

860
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:50,509
it's been meeting for 13 years but

861
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:53,390
what's really been accomplished<font color="#E5E5E5"> i mean</font>

862
00:37:50,510 --> 00:37:55,789
what success has really been scored that

863
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:58,519
changed the security situation or

864
00:37:55,789 --> 00:38:01,130
landscape for corporations users

865
00:37:58,519 --> 00:38:02,930
governments other parties and and his

866
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:05,839
comment was there<font color="#E5E5E5"> really hasn't been a</font>

867
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:08,868
lot but today and now there is one and

868
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:12,589
that's DNS SEC that this is a major

869
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:16,609
change in a milestone<font color="#E5E5E5"> in insecurity</font>

870
00:38:12,589 --> 00:38:19,730
opportunity for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet what we see</font>

871
00:38:16,609 --> 00:38:21,500
happening and hope to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have happen with</font>

872
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:23,450
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> many talented people on this stage</font>

873
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:26,420
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> elsewhere is a profusion of</font>

874
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:27,890
applications technologies and tools that

875
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:30,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">will leverage this new piece of</font>

876

<font color="#E5E5E5">infrastructure that in in some ways is</font>

877
00:38:30,890 --> 00:38:34,970
like the GPS system our enemy the GPS

878
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:37,579
system got developed<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a very narrow</font>

879

specific set of applications initially

880
00:38:37,579 --> 00:38:43,760
but then became a service that could be

881
00:38:40,819 --> 00:38:45,799
leveraged by many different<font color="#E5E5E5"> and new and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">unanticipated applications that get</font>

883
00:38:45,799 --> 00:38:50,119
developed over time many of which are

884
00:38:47,869 --> 00:38:52,250
now on our cell phones that<font color="#E5E5E5"> wouldn't</font>

have been envisioned at all when GPS was

886
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:56,809
developed so this is a very fundamental

887
00:38:54,589 --> 00:38:58,819
new technology that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> introduced</font>

888
00:38:56,809 --> 00:39:01,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">and where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll be excited to see sandy</font>

889
00:38:58,819 --> 00:39:05,119
what what everyone comes comes forward

00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:08,450
with any<font color="#E5E5E5"> other questions we have a yes</font>

891
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:11,390
sir listen I well I'm curious what your

892
00:39:08,450 --> 00:39:14,180
thoughts are on<font color="#E5E5E5"> social engineering</font>

893
00:39:11,390 --> 00:39:16,339
threats cousin domains ID and spoofing

894
00:39:14,180 --> 00:39:18,078
attacks things like that is there an

895
00:39:16,339 --> 00:39:19,339
opportunity<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DNS act to fix those</font>

896

fixed hiring<font color="#CCCCCC"> the application stack so so</font>

898
00:39:25,369 --> 00:39:31,309
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually a fascinating question</font>

899
00:39:27,079 --> 00:39:33,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">because a lot of people have asked why</font>

900
00:39:31,309 --> 00:39:37,009
can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can do something about like Bank</font>

dash dash of dash dash America<font color="#CCCCCC"> com you</font>

902
00:39:37,009 --> 00:39:43,130
know why is this a<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> happens</font>

903
00:39:39,589 --> 00:39:46,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">the thing is DNS is strength is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

904
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:47,809
is a delegated namespace that once you

905
00:39:46,069 --> 00:39:49,460
have a<font color="#E5E5E5"> chunk you as long as no one else</font>

906
00:39:47,809 --> 00:39:53,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> using that chunk you can put whatever</font>

907
00:39:49,460 --> 00:39:54,250
you want in there making<font color="#CCCCCC"> DNS not DNS is</font>

908
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:57,580
not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

909
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:59,560
that is what extended validation is for

910
00:39:57,580 --> 00:40:01,870
that is what certificate authorities are

911
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:03,549
for a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of people think DNS SEC means</font>

912
00:40:01,870 --> 00:40:05,440
we aren't going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to need the CAS anymore</font>

913
00:40:03,550 --> 00:40:07,210
they're wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> the certificate</font>

914
00:40:05,440 --> 00:40:10,420
authorities are more important now than

915
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:12,430
they've ever been because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they are the</font>

00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:15,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">third parties that have boots in the</font>

917
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:18,940
ground all<font color="#E5E5E5"> over the world to</font>

918
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:22,060
differentiate what is a domain and what

919
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:23,410
is a brand brands are closed namespace

920
00:40:22,060 --> 00:40:26,830
you can't have something that's like

921
00:40:23,410 --> 00:40:28,870
McDonald's dash dash like you can do

922
00:40:26,830 --> 00:40:32,980
that with domains all day you can't do

923
00:40:28,870 --> 00:40:35,470
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> with brands we see doin DNS SEC</font>

924
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:38,620
actually bolstering extended validation

925
00:40:35,470 --> 00:40:40,899
there were some brilliant attacks run by

926
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:42,970
Mike Sussman and alex todorov against

927
00:40:40,900 --> 00:40:44,740
extended validation last year at black

928
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:47,290
hat that talked all about the

929
00:40:44,740 --> 00:40:49,660
limitations<font color="#E5E5E5"> of extended validation those</font>

930
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:52,060
limitations are actually completely

931
00:40:49,660 --> 00:40:54,279
resolve about as long as DNS SEC can

932
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:56,529
provide the exclusive description that

933
00:40:54,280 --> 00:41:00,310
not only is this an extended<font color="#E5E5E5"> validation</font>

934
00:40:56,530 --> 00:41:03,220
search but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> only certificate</font>

935
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:05,500
for this domain that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a fundamental</font>

936
00:41:03,220 --> 00:41:12,250
transformation in our ability to deliver

<font color="#E5E5E5">secure systems yeah I wouldn't get I</font>

938
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:16,240
wouldn't get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a false sense of security</font>

939
00:41:13,990 --> 00:41:20,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">in some of these areas though because</font>

940
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:23,080
here's an interesting scenario what if

941
00:41:20,380 --> 00:41:27,490
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> did in fact register Bank dash</font>

942
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:31,060
dash of dash dash america.com and then

943
00:41:27,490 --> 00:41:32,709
signed it they control<font color="#E5E5E5"> their keys right</font>

944
00:41:31,060 --> 00:41:34,720
so they can sign their<font color="#CCCCCC"> own zone if they</font>

945
00:41:32,710 --> 00:41:36,790
want you'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> a response that says</font>

946
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:38,980
that it's signed but would<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

947
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:40,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually noticed if it was dash dash of</font>

digitally signed it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and is it really</font>

is it really bank of america or is it

much more difficult to do that through

engineering is not a new problem it's

00:43:44,870 --> 00:43:50,810
infrastructures and I can tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that</font>

999
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:54,380
the signatures<font color="#E5E5E5"> are large and the amount</font>

1000
00:43:50,810 --> 00:43:58,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">of memory taken up to run the DNS in</font>

1001
00:43:54,380 --> 00:44:00,200
that scenario for large ISPs<font color="#E5E5E5"> in tier 1</font>

1002
00:43:58,490 --> 00:44:01,910
providers and things like that is

1003
00:44:00,200 --> 00:44:04,430
non-trivial so there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of work</font>

1004
00:44:01,910 --> 00:44:06,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they're going to have to do and and</font>

1005
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:10,759
deploy more servers as well they'll be

1006
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:13,460
increased traffic on the root and and

1007
00:44:10,760 --> 00:44:14,780
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> top-level domain servers as well in</font>

1008
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:17,870
terms of the amount of traffic that's

1009
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:19,690
coming in both UDP and probably also TCP

1010
00:44:17,870 --> 00:44:22,000
traffic as well

1011
00:44:19,690 --> 00:44:25,599
I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are just getting a handle</font>

1012
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:29,470
on that but but I have to say I think

1013
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:33,670
that that it it's it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of those</font>

1014
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:35,379
things that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 years ago the</font>

1015
00:44:33,670 --> 00:44:38,020
amount of computing power that I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1016
00:44:35,380 --> 00:44:40,510
my desktop I now have in my<font color="#CCCCCC"> iphone</font>

1017
00:44:38,020 --> 00:44:43,180
probably even more in my<font color="#CCCCCC"> iphone today</font>

1018
00:44:40,510 --> 00:44:45,280
and the capabilities of it so I think

1019
00:44:43,180 --> 00:44:47,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know the mark it's not so much that</font>

1020
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:49,300
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> march of technology won't catch up</font>

1021
00:44:47,650 --> 00:44:56,800
to it I<font color="#CCCCCC"> guess that's the best way of</font>

1022
00:44:49,300 --> 00:45:06,640
saying it I'm sorry I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> sorry miss that</font>

1023
00:44:56,800 --> 00:45:08,200
with a proof is he still work what um so

1024
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:11,710
the quote they do what he's referring to

1025
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:14,439
is uh you know my first demos in DNS

1026
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:18,520
involved streaming audio and eventually

1027
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:22,839
video / DNS just because it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was a fun it</font>

1028
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:24,849
was fun yeah once upon a time this stuff

1029
00:45:22,839 --> 00:45:29,980
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> just fun and games and then it uh a</font>

1030
00:45:24,849 --> 00:45:32,500
little more serious<font color="#E5E5E5"> I will say this so I</font>

1031
00:45:29,980 --> 00:45:34,869
haven't done the work that sandy has in

1032
00:45:32,500 --> 00:45:37,150
building recursive servers and and

1033
00:45:34,869 --> 00:45:40,869
clearly the recursive load is increasing

1034
00:45:37,150 --> 00:45:44,109
in DNS SEC from an authoritative

1035
00:45:40,869 --> 00:45:45,910
perspective it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hardware</font>

1036
00:45:44,109 --> 00:45:49,630
that's gotten<font color="#E5E5E5"> ridiculously more</font>

1037
00:45:45,910 --> 00:45:52,509
efficient uh the colonel so when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wrote</font>

1038
00:45:49,630 --> 00:45:54,490
did my first talk on<font color="#CCCCCC"> that black hat I'm</font>

1039
00:45:52,510 --> 00:45:55,720
like man these kernels are so slow i'm

1040
00:45:54,490 --> 00:45:58,419
just going to generate the packets

1041
00:45:55,720 --> 00:46:04,118
myself yeah so kernels are good now um

1042
00:45:58,420 --> 00:46:09,010
ended up writing a very small<font color="#CCCCCC"> live event</font>

1043
00:46:04,119 --> 00:46:10,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">based</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dns x server so what was it sixty</font>

1044
00:46:09,010 --> 00:46:14,589
thousand queries per second used to be

1045
00:46:10,630 --> 00:46:16,720
all that verisign used to do yeah yeah

1046
00:46:14,589 --> 00:46:20,500
so you can do<font color="#CCCCCC"> 60,000 queries per second</font>

1047
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:22,598
on one server in it and this is what's

1048
00:46:20,500 --> 00:46:24,520
significant it's not like you got<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

1049
00:46:22,599 --> 00:46:28,089
a genius<font color="#E5E5E5"> to write it in like a couple</font>

1050
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:30,339
hundred lines of code so we live in a

1051
00:46:28,089 --> 00:46:31,509
different world of available performance

1052
00:46:30,339 --> 00:46:34,000
then

1053
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:40,780
and importantly then even DNS SEC itself

1054
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:42,640
was originally conceived of so just<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1055
00:46:40,780 --> 00:46:44,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">just to sort of throw out some some real</font>

1056
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:48,400
metrics from what we've actually seen

1057
00:46:44,740 --> 00:46:50,379
from what's been deployed thus far about

1058
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:53,740
fifty<font color="#CCCCCC"> percent of the queries to the</font>

1059
00:46:50,380 --> 00:46:57,160
servers today are asking for<font color="#E5E5E5"> an extended</font>

1060
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:58,990
response and those responses are about

1061
00:46:57,160 --> 00:47:00,940
four times larger than they were before

1062
00:46:58,990 --> 00:47:02,979
so it's about doubling of the bandwidth

1063
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:05,020
itself we haven't seen a significant

1064
00:47:02,980 --> 00:47:06,700
increase in the query volume in other

1065
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:08,800
words the numbers of queries per second

1066
00:47:06,700 --> 00:47:11,379
that we've seen but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have seen it go</font>

1067
00:47:08,800 --> 00:47:14,410
up on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> TCP side and a lot it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> has to</font>

1068
00:47:11,380 --> 00:47:16,720
do with the fact<font color="#CCCCCC"> it just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> depends on how</font>

1069
00:47:14,410 --> 00:47:19,629
different devices handle fragmentation

1070
00:47:16,720 --> 00:47:22,419
or those sorts of things but but<font color="#E5E5E5"> by a</font>

1071
00:47:19,630 --> 00:47:24,310
large with the extensions to the to the

<font color="#E5E5E5">length of the DNS package ember that</font>

1073
00:47:24,310 --> 00:47:30,970
five years ago you know 512 bytes was it

1074
00:47:27,520 --> 00:47:33,130
that was it and in so streaming<font color="#E5E5E5"> south</font>

1075
00:47:30,970 --> 00:47:34,689
park you know you had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to jam it into a</font>

00:47:33,130 --> 00:47:36,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">bunch of a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bunch</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of small packets but</font>

1077
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:37,960
now we have much<font color="#E5E5E5"> larger packets and in</font>

1078
00:47:36,250 --> 00:47:41,710
fragmentations allowed in those sorts of

1079
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:46,060
things which isn't the idea now<font color="#CCCCCC"> we'd go</font>

1080
00:47:41,710 --> 00:47:47,500
HD but but of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course the band was going</font>

1081
00:47:46,060 --> 00:47:51,850
to go up and of course the loads going

1082
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:55,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go up on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> server's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get over it it</font>

1083
00:47:51,850 --> 00:47:57,850
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and that's you just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to face</font>

1084
00:47:55,570 --> 00:48:00,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">a DNS load in general</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with or without</font>

1085
00:47:57,850 --> 00:48:01,960
DNS SEC was going to go up one way or

1086
00:48:00,100 --> 00:48:04,150
another now it's just gone<font color="#CCCCCC"> up in a</font>

1087
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:05,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">different way but the other things will</font>

1088
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:06,850
still drive load as well and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think we</font>

1089
00:48:05,680 --> 00:48:08,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">still</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to be prepared for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that and</font>

1090
00:48:06,850 --> 00:48:10,720
that's what i said<font color="#CCCCCC"> earlier my opening</font>

1091
00:48:08,140 --> 00:48:13,450
remarks was that<font color="#CCCCCC"> that DNS is an</font>

1092
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:14,799
interesting protocol DNS SEC is even

1093
00:48:13,450 --> 00:48:17,980
more interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> because of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1094
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:20,410
possibility that allows DNS to do other

00:48:17,980 --> 00:48:27,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">than just serve up an IP address for a</font>

1097
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:35,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">a little weird I run</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a closed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> network</font>

1098
00:48:31,090 --> 00:48:40,600
lab for testing purposes in that lab I

1099
00:48:35,650 --> 00:48:41,980
had to emulate to the roots this sounds

1100
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:43,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">like it would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be pretty difficult for me</font>

1101
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:47,190
to emulate this in

1102
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:50,609
closed secured lab where I'm test email

1103
00:48:47,190 --> 00:48:53,460
where as someone thought of<font color="#E5E5E5"> how I could</font>

1104
00:48:50,610 --> 00:48:59,760
replicate this for<font color="#E5E5E5"> malware forensics uh</font>

1105
00:48:53,460 --> 00:49:01,890
I am kind of<font color="#CCCCCC"> a my only reason I'm</font>

1106
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:05,130
dropping<font color="#CCCCCC"> the mic is because yes like</font>

1107
00:49:01,890 --> 00:49:06,660
that's been a quiet little thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

1108
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:08,640
been in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the background like how do we</font>

1109
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:13,020
actually support these these closed

1110
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:15,299
chunks and you have some issues if

1111
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:20,400
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> trying to hijack the the</font>

1112
00:49:15,300 --> 00:49:22,200
namespaces of that you don't control but

1113
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:25,500
if you do control the namespaces you can

1114
00:49:22,200 --> 00:49:27,120
basically make a stub emulations of

1115
00:49:25,500 --> 00:49:30,090
those namespaces and then bring them

1116

into<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Road if you don't do that</font>

fact need to be modified to validate

1119
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:41,610
against you and not against the real

1120
00:49:37,710 --> 00:49:43,440
root but it but it's certainly the case

1121
00:49:41,610 --> 00:49:45,450
I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you do the stuff trick I mean</font>

1122
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:47,880
all of the servers basically have a way

1123
00:49:45,450 --> 00:49:50,430
to set up a trust anchor for the thing

1124
00:49:47,880 --> 00:49:51,480
that is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> looking for so</font>

1125
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:59,129
that's something that most of the

1126
00:49:51,480 --> 00:50:00,360
resolvers have otherwise yours there are

1127

<font color="#E5E5E5">some people with long the other scene</font>

you've enough green and I agreed that

1130
00:50:06,330 --> 00:50:14,870
had others send the proctor running

1132
00:50:17,750 --> 00:50:21,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">I was just wondering</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> been a</font>

1133
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:24,890
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of talk of how the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> servers work and</font>

1134
00:50:21,950 --> 00:50:26,480
how the endpoint resolvers work but what

1135
00:50:24,890 --> 00:50:29,180
are the implications at the client tier

1136
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:30,620
here and how how are these air is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

1137
00:50:29,180 --> 00:50:34,040
to get propagated up to the users

1138
00:50:30,620 --> 00:50:37,069
especially on systems that may not be

1139
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:47,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">the latest greatest patch levels or</font>

1140
00:50:37,070 --> 00:50:51,140
write anything else so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are two</font>

1141
00:50:47,600 --> 00:50:53,750
philosophies one philosophy is you know

1142
00:50:51,140 --> 00:50:56,420
what you let your your recursive server

1143
00:50:53,750 --> 00:50:57,890
do the work and maybe some information

1144
00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:01,520
gets back to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> client and maybe not</font>

1145
00:50:57,890 --> 00:51:03,410
and the other philosophy is end-to-end

1146
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:05,180
trust is awesome and anything that is

1147
00:51:03,410 --> 00:51:09,470
not end-to-end trust doesn't matter um

1148
00:51:05,180 --> 00:51:13,940
not to disrespect the former<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a fan</font>

1149
00:51:09,470 --> 00:51:18,980
of the latter approach the way that ice

1150
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:21,830
that we sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of see things moving is the</font>

1151
00:51:18,980 --> 00:51:25,730
actual certificate verification engines

1152
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:29,390
are going to be updated to to validate

1153
00:51:25,730 --> 00:51:32,210
against DNS SEC so when the when the

1154
00:51:29,390 --> 00:51:35,150
client is actually trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be secure</font>

1155
00:51:32,210 --> 00:51:38,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">before it was using the certificate</font>

1156
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:41,810
authority system which worked as best it

1157
00:51:38,120 --> 00:51:44,390
could um now it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1158
00:51:41,810 --> 00:51:48,470
use DNS SEC and the nice thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1159
00:51:44,390 --> 00:51:52,040
this is this aspect of the API subset

1160
00:51:48,470 --> 00:51:54,649
has inherent in it handlers for hey

1161
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:58,370
before was the certificate as bad now as

1162
00:51:54,650 --> 00:52:00,170
hey the DNS SEC trust chain is bad so

1163
00:51:58,370 --> 00:52:03,560
you end up being able to leverage the

1164
00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:05,810
existing infrastructure there I there is

1165
00:52:03,560 --> 00:52:08,660
some value not<font color="#E5E5E5"> even somebody there's</font>

1166
00:52:05,810 --> 00:52:12,110
definitely value in validating when

1167
00:52:08,660 --> 00:52:14,420
available on the non cryptographic trust

1168
00:52:12,110 --> 00:52:16,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">information so IP addresses and whatnot</font>

1169
00:52:14,420 --> 00:52:19,010
I mean this is great for recursos it

1170
00:52:16,970 --> 00:52:21,740
stops cache poisoning attacks and so on

1171
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:25,820
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> where the meat of the value is in</font>

1172
00:52:21,740 --> 00:52:28,600
making certificate validation work more

1173
00:52:25,820 --> 00:52:28,600
reliably

1174
00:52:29,260 --> 00:52:33,370
but you think that's going to happen<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1175
00:52:31,510 --> 00:52:34,840
the client right the validation is going

1176
00:52:33,370 --> 00:52:37,720
to happen on the client rather than on

1177
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:39,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">the on the recursive servers I think the</font>

1178
00:52:37,720 --> 00:52:41,020
recursive servers still need to do

1179
00:52:39,460 --> 00:52:43,180
validation so that we get the

1180
00:52:41,020 --> 00:52:47,380
comprehensive fix for cache poisoning

1181
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:49,480
attacks but you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> i love starbucks i</font>

1182
00:52:47,380 --> 00:52:52,450
think their coffee is great I'm not

1183
00:52:49,480 --> 00:52:54,700
trusting a bit in a DNS DNS reply to

1184
00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:57,279
tell me oh by the way this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1185
00:52:54,700 --> 00:53:00,549
certificate for your bank I mean another

1186
00:52:57,280 --> 00:53:03,340
answer if right but another answer to

1187
00:53:00,550 --> 00:53:06,880
your question is is that for those older

1188
00:53:03,340 --> 00:53:08,500
systems the recur the former method that

1189
00:53:06,880 --> 00:53:11,170
Dan was talking about will still provide

1190
00:53:08,500 --> 00:53:12,850
value it just won't provide the last

1191
00:53:11,170 --> 00:53:15,640
mile of value<font color="#CCCCCC"> that he was just</font>

1192
00:53:12,850 --> 00:53:16,900
describing and I don't know I be

1193
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:19,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">interested in getting other people's</font>

1194
00:53:16,900 --> 00:53:21,310
idea as to whether they think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that</font>

1195
00:53:19,210 --> 00:53:25,870
former model will get implemented first

1196
00:53:21,310 --> 00:53:28,360
followed by the the latter model or

1197
00:53:25,870 --> 00:53:31,330
whether we'll just go straight to the

1198
00:53:28,360 --> 00:53:40,450
end solution sooner rather than later I

1199
00:53:31,330 --> 00:53:43,600
think there's I think there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doubt</font>

1200
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:44,890
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the former is going to have to get</font>

1201
00:53:43,600 --> 00:53:46,660
implemented first just simply because

1202
00:53:44,890 --> 00:53:52,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's the only path we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have at the very</font>

1203
00:53:46,660 --> 00:53:55,029
moment for for a lot of it the the

1204
00:53:52,780 --> 00:53:56,740
client software that appears in

1205
00:53:55,030 --> 00:53:59,950
operating systems it becomes the default

1206
00:53:56,740 --> 00:54:02,200
thing that you use they're going to get

1207
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:03,640
upgraded they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get updated</font>

00:54:02,200 --> 00:54:05,649
throughout time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think you'll see</font>

1209
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:08,109
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> browser's will start to look for</font>

1210
00:54:05,650 --> 00:54:10,660
that DNS SEC response and start to

1211
00:54:08,110 --> 00:54:12,670
inform you in a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> way but up</font>

1212
00:54:10,660 --> 00:54:14,470
until now it wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even possible for</font>

00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:17,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">that stuff to even provide any feedback</font>

1214
00:54:14,470 --> 00:54:20,140
to you whatsoever because there was no

1215
00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:24,250
there was<font color="#E5E5E5"> no core mechanism to enable it</font>

1216
00:54:20,140 --> 00:54:27,100
until DNS SEC wasn't implemented on the

1217
00:54:24,250 --> 00:54:31,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">root it wasn't even possible to broadly</font>

1218
00:54:27,100 --> 00:54:32,710
deploy DNS SEC outside of closed labs it

1219

just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't possible because without a</font>

00:54:32,710 --> 00:54:37,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">true without</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a chain of trust you know</font>

1221
00:54:35,530 --> 00:54:40,060
some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> tried and I think we all</font>

1222
00:54:37,570 --> 00:54:42,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">have varying degrees of experience with</font>

1223
00:54:40,060 --> 00:54:44,200
those and how successful<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they were</font>

1224
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:46,750
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally we've actually started</font>

1225
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:48,490
something now that<font color="#E5E5E5"> will enable those</font>

1226
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:51,400
client applications to have something

1227
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:53,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">that they can use until they do I mean</font>

1228
00:54:51,400 --> 00:54:55,599
why would you<font color="#CCCCCC"> put it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

1229
00:54:53,170 --> 00:54:58,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">explorer if there's no protocol to read</font>

1230
00:54:55,599 --> 00:55:00,369
yet and everyone at the time was talking

1231
00:54:58,750 --> 00:55:02,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">like DNS SEC was still another five or</font>

1232
00:55:00,369 --> 00:55:05,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">ten</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> years down</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the road remember the NSX</font>

1233
00:55:02,320 --> 00:55:08,050
been a you know a protocol if you will

1234
00:55:05,230 --> 00:55:11,680
or or an extension to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> protocols for</font>

1235
00:55:08,050 --> 00:55:20,140
a dozen years it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> just taken that long</font>

1236
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:23,230
to roll out so just as a note<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah we're</font>

1237
00:55:20,140 --> 00:55:25,328
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to release and end client DNS</font>

1238
00:55:23,230 --> 00:55:33,849
validation logic in like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple hours</font>

1239
00:55:25,329 --> 00:55:35,859
so this game is<font color="#E5E5E5"> on with with recursive</font>

1240
00:55:33,849 --> 00:55:37,930
name servers moving towards DNS<font color="#CCCCCC"> sac in</font>

1241
00:55:35,859 --> 00:55:39,339
that whole model that that still

1242
00:55:37,930 --> 00:55:41,319
requires the client to trust the

1243
00:55:39,339 --> 00:55:43,420
recursive server and the panacea is that

1244
00:55:41,320 --> 00:55:44,980
the client will actually do and to end

1245
00:55:43,420 --> 00:55:47,319
trust as well do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have any feel for</font>

1246
00:55:44,980 --> 00:55:49,329
what the major vendors are doing like

the sun's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> apples the Microsoft's of</font>

1248
00:55:49,329 --> 00:55:53,560
the world what they're doing in terms of

1249
00:55:51,040 --> 00:55:55,480
incorporating DNS<font color="#E5E5E5"> second to the end node</font>

1250
00:55:53,560 --> 00:55:56,799
operating systems so that the

00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:59,829
application layers can<font color="#E5E5E5"> make use of that</font>

1252
00:55:56,800 --> 00:56:01,390
it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to start at the API is</font>

1253
00:55:59,829 --> 00:56:03,940
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to start in the end</font>

1254
00:56:01,390 --> 00:56:06,339
applications and then move into the the

1255
00:56:03,940 --> 00:56:08,589
operating systems that's just kind of

1256
00:56:06,339 --> 00:56:10,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">the path of innovation now so it's going</font>

1257
00:56:08,589 --> 00:56:12,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">to start with the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> browser's it's going</font>

1258
00:56:10,660 --> 00:56:14,410
to start with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> desktop applications</font>

1259
00:56:12,910 --> 00:56:16,118
it's going to start with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the actual code</font>

1260
00:56:14,410 --> 00:56:19,029
instead of calling into the operating

1261
00:56:16,119 --> 00:56:21,040
system calling into<font color="#CCCCCC"> L DNS writing the</font>

1262
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:25,630
eight lines of code it takes to do an

00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:27,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">end to end resolve and using the trusted</font>

1264
00:56:25,630 --> 00:56:31,089
value from there that's kind of the path

1265
00:56:27,940 --> 00:56:33,280
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I see and then assuming this</font>

1266
00:56:31,089 --> 00:56:35,230
becomes popular then<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah we'll see</font>

1267
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:37,240
we'll see operating system level support

1268
00:56:35,230 --> 00:56:41,290
somewhere down the line but the

1269
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:42,970
flexibility of the end applications is

1270
00:56:41,290 --> 00:56:44,650
much higher than the flexibility of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1271
00:56:42,970 --> 00:56:47,740
operating system which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> just on much</font>

1272
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:50,020
longer time lines and i'll just<font color="#E5E5E5"> add</font>

1273
00:56:47,740 --> 00:56:51,578
there's a number of speakers in the

1274
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:52,960
program over the next few days from

1275
00:56:51,579 --> 00:56:54,730
those firms and you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be</font>

them dns the DNS system supports ipv6 in

1305

top-level domain servers on ipv6

many registries that don't accept DNS or

ipv6 registrations today so most of

that's in place it's now in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the hands of</font>

the firewalls load balancers etc that

where people are implementing ipv6 they

do have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sort of translate back and</font>

forth inside their network to ipv4 and

the but the great thing about it

1327
00:59:09,000 --> 00:59:13,650
is that that possibility exists that we

1328
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:16,410
could even do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> where with DNS SEC</font>

almost none<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the prep work had been</font>

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> router level at the firewall level</font>

for all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this until two two and a half</font>

1333

three years<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago when when it looked like</font>

1334
00:59:26,940 --> 00:59:32,220
DNS SEC was catching momentum so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1335
00:59:29,640 --> 00:59:33,540
as the ISPs roll it out I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think I think</font>

00:59:32,220 --> 00:59:36,839
everyone's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be ready</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for it</font>

1337
00:59:33,540 --> 00:59:39,779
because you know the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ionic and can</font>

assign I ipv6 address blocks today I

mean you can get one today if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> wanted</font>

1342
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:50,100
actually in better shape with ipv6 it's

00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:53,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">really just the largest of the large</font>

1348

that companies that use those domains

1349
01:00:08,340 --> 01:00:14,220
can realize now by signing their their

1350

don't get and are there any additional

get or what you're going to get from the

1354
01:00:23,520 --> 01:00:29,880
root first so you will not be able to

1356
01:00:29,880 --> 01:00:35,910
net today because those those zones are

1357
01:00:34,470 --> 01:00:37,680
not currently signed but they are in a

1358
01:00:35,910 --> 01:00:39,690
roadmap to be signed and essentially

1359
01:00:37,680 --> 01:00:41,250
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're starting</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to see is that</font>

1360
01:00:39,690 --> 01:00:43,380
these top level domains are sort of

1361
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:46,260
starting from the smaller ones up to the

1362

larger ones kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of in that order as we</font>

1363
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:50,070
roll them out but by this time next year

1364
01:00:48,630 --> 01:00:52,410
you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> take</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> full advantage of</font>

common net at that level

can you repeat<font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a microphone please</font>

1368

such are you seeing a move towards that

1373
01:01:23,890 --> 01:01:27,370
being abused more like I know DNS has

1374
01:01:26,140 --> 01:01:29,170
historically been used for command and

1375
01:01:27,370 --> 01:01:31,299
control for botnets and stuff have you

1376
01:01:29,170 --> 01:01:33,760
seen any other<font color="#E5E5E5"> moves towards abusing</font>

1377
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:36,940
that new packet size or or making use of

1378
01:01:33,760 --> 01:01:44,830
DNS those larger packet sizes for

1379
01:01:36,940 --> 01:01:47,290
malicious intent so so one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one of</font>

1385
01:01:59,140 --> 01:02:05,589
necessarily DNS SEC like bad guys

worse

1401
01:02:49,400 --> 01:02:55,340
III think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you raise a good point but I</font>

1402
01:02:53,210 --> 01:02:58,520
don't think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's any different than port</font>

1406
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:10,850
now allowing port 53 I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

worse than it would have been before

1410

it's just another port<font color="#E5E5E5"> that allows you</font>

1414
01:03:29,780 --> 01:03:35,600
allow a very long staining connection to

SEC is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to allow a long</font>

1417
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:41,359
persistent connection so it's actually

1418
01:03:38,870 --> 01:03:42,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">better in that respect then it would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> doing some</font>

the port 53 it's not going to happen

1424
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:54,050
probably in the next release of the

1425
01:03:52,730 --> 01:03:57,100
software but it'll be<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometime in the</font>

next 18 months or<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>
