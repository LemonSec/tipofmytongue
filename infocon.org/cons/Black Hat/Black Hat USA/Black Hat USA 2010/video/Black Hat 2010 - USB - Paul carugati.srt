00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,210
good afternoon everyone this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a turbo</font>

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:09,960
talk in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Florentine room talking</font>

3
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:14,309
<font color="#E5E5E5">about USC be hid which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we've defined</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> as</font>

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:17,520
hacker interface design myself<font color="#E5E5E5"> Richard</font>

5
00:00:14,309 --> 00:00:20,279
rushing I have Jason Posada here and

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:23,970
Paul<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kerr Gotti here we're from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Motorola</font>

7
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:26,400
and we originally started looking at

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:27,960
this and Jason<font color="#CCCCCC"> will give you some more</font>

9
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:32,940
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> of what kind of triggered</font>

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:34,559
this event but in regards to we're USB

11
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:37,739
is pretty much that ultimate interface

12
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,718
is being used today the issue is that

13
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:41,190
there's a look we've gone through

14
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:42,840
several iterations of bad things

15
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:44,760
happening we're just you say oh here's a

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,850
memory stick plug it in and copy files

17
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:50,730
oh here is the autorun capability

18
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:53,760
malware issue you three issues and we

19
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,379
keep going<font color="#E5E5E5"> through this and it's part of</font>

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,599
the culture part of the issues that are

21
00:00:55,379 --> 00:01:00,149
there and now we're starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see some</font>

22
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,160
leveraging<font color="#E5E5E5"> of additional sides of this</font>

23
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:04,409
we've<font color="#CCCCCC"> seen a couple</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of people use this</font>

24
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,080
at different levels<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

25
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:09,810
thing it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> super easy to exploit</font>

26
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:11,640
and it gives you pretty much good

27
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:15,000
control of what you're actually trying

28
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:16,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do so I'll turn it over to Jason here</font>

29
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,409
which we will<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about how he actually</font>

30
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:24,990
how we actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> came into being on this</font>

31
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:26,700
sure so we've got you know a USB device

32
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:29,070
spec that lets<font color="#E5E5E5"> us do a lot of really</font>

33
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,450
flexible things and what we've seen is

34
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:33,210
you know obviously used in a lot of

35
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:35,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> areas in USB</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hids any device</font>

36
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:37,140
that wants to talk in the USB bus can

37
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:39,150
you know comply with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> HID standard</font>

38
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">announce itself to find these data</font>

39
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:43,649
formats and basically get access to

40
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:45,240
existing drivers you know to some extent

41
00:01:43,649 --> 00:01:50,670
without having to load new device

42
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:52,110
drivers on the endpoint so this goes

43
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:58,290
across you know giant class of things

44
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:59,700
cameras everything else and what we're

45
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,369
starting<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see and that this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is what</font>

46
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:04,110
trigger for us is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that a financial</font>

47
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:06,930
company had sent me a piece of junk mail

48
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:09,300
and on my way to the trash bin with it I

49
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:12,209
noticed it had USB contacts on back I

50
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:13,349
thought you know why would they bother

51
00:02:12,209 --> 00:02:13,840
to put metal in the back of a piece of

52
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:14,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">disposed</font>

53
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,920
plastic<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm going to put</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the trash</font>

54
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:20,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">can and took a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little closer look at it</font>

55
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,089
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you realize yeah okay USB they mean</font>

56
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:23,738
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to plug it into my computer I'm</font>

57
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:25,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">recently smart guy my machine doesn't do</font>

58
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:26,590
autorun I've got whitelisting enabled

59
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:29,110
nothing is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run on my computer</font>

60
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:30,400
maybe I get a free<font color="#CCCCCC"> leone free 64 you</font>

61
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:32,410
know Meg memory card out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it you know</font>

62
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,849
in memory so cheap now I plugged it in

63
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:36,700
and you know little<font color="#E5E5E5"> did I know it's</font>

64
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:38,530
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to bring up a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> web page on</font>

65
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:40,298
my computer you know launches an

66
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:44,890
intermediate page and eventually lands

67
00:02:40,299 --> 00:02:47,140
me at the financial site but i had to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

68
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:49,179
nothing windows initial if you know saw

69
00:02:47,140 --> 00:02:51,609
the device initialize it<font color="#CCCCCC"> as a keyboard</font>

70
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:52,690
and you know took<font color="#E5E5E5"> an input stream from</font>

71
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:55,720
it and do it you know you can do

72
00:02:52,690 --> 00:02:58,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">whatever it wants so it took no effort</font>

73
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,590
nope no brains<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not really sure why</font>

74
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:01,569
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> felt the need to go to this much</font>

75
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:04,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">you no expense to get me to you know</font>

76
00:03:01,569 --> 00:03:07,238
land on a 24 character URL at their

77
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:08,950
website so i guess what we're looking at

78
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:12,040
this is this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a bypass an intentional</font>

79
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:14,738
bypass of controls to use this type of

80
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:16,298
device versus anything else because

81
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:17,739
bypasses all those autorun controls that

82
00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:22,150
we've worked<font color="#CCCCCC"> so hard to get disabled in</font>

83
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:23,290
our enterprises so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is I think you</font>

84
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:26,410
know for<font color="#E5E5E5"> us is the next thing we're</font>

85
00:03:23,290 --> 00:03:34,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">going to have to tackle and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Paul wants</font>

86
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:38,170
to go to HP's here<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so after Jason's</font>

87
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:41,260
epiphany and in received via sale junk

88
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:42,730
mail what did<font color="#E5E5E5"> we decide to do so we</font>

89
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,168
wanted to try to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put this in some sort</font>

90
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:47,018
of proof of concept right to see what

91
00:03:44,169 --> 00:03:49,720
what what could we do with this we had a

92
00:03:47,019 --> 00:03:51,160
limited amount of time so we came up

93
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:52,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">with a few things just again</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as a proof</font>

94
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:55,000
of concept just to show you<font color="#CCCCCC"> what the</font>

95
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,069
potential<font color="#E5E5E5"> here and the ability of being</font>

96
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:58,359
able to bypass some of the interactive

97
00:03:57,069 --> 00:04:00,849
control features within the operating

98
00:03:58,359 --> 00:04:05,650
system so we were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is identify</font>

99
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:07,780
or find a a USB micro controller

00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:10,900
programmable read<font color="#E5E5E5"> write microcontroller</font>

101
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:13,419
to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to program to emulate this</font>

102
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:15,970
type of a human interface device there's

103
00:04:13,419 --> 00:04:18,970
a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different compilation</font>

104
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:22,419
software programs you can use when<font color="#E5E5E5"> AVR</font>

105
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:24,460
we actually use<font color="#CCCCCC"> Arduino which is a very</font>

106
00:04:22,419 --> 00:04:26,500
very similar<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a to a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> C programming</font>

00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:31,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">case because and it is and this the</font>

110
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:34,000
microcontroller that we used just<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

111
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:37,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">happened to support the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Arduino software</font>

112
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,070
natively so it was super super<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy the</font>

113
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:41,710
the microcontroller comes with free

114
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:44,290
loader software I think the I think the

115
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:46,180
chip<font color="#CCCCCC"> cost like 20 bucks we got it the</font>

116
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:49,060
mail within a couple days and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

117
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:50,110
within about 30 minutes I mean so I'm

118
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,390
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> a programmer I'm a security</font>

half years<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we sat down and with</font>

00:04:57,310 --> 00:05:01,120
literally<font color="#E5E5E5"> thin 20 minutes we were able</font>

123
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:02,680
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get this working so what we're going</font>

124
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,350
to try to do is demo it for you it's

125
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:06,400
super quick it's not very not very fancy

126
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:08,860
unfortunately we're hoping to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

127
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,659
something a little more interactive but

128
00:05:08,860 --> 00:05:12,070
I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you'll get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the point of the</font>

00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:25,480
the controller to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to we we</font>

134
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:27,430
emulated exactly the device that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Jason</font>

was sent in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> mail we also thought well</font>

136
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:30,100
hey what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's some of the other</font>

137
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:32,500
super easy exploits that we might be

<font color="#CCCCCC">able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to run as a result of this and</font>

139
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:37,060
we're able to you know open a command

line natively without any user input

00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,430
potentially malicious network share

143
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:46,900
ultimately what we're trying to do is

144
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:48,880
make<font color="#CCCCCC"> the pop make the impossible</font>

145
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:52,179
possible here right so we've already

146
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,320
completely disabled autorun so we're

147
00:05:52,180 --> 00:05:55,720
completely fine right we've got appt

148
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,770
whitelisting we've got you know the

149
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,660
other different types of security

150
00:05:56,770 --> 00:06:01,210
control programs on the OS we're fine

151
00:05:58,660 --> 00:06:02,530
not the case right the other key point

152
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,609
in here that we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have in</font>

153
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:06,580
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> presentation is this is</font>

154
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:08,530
cross-platform right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Alderaan some is</font>

155
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:09,969
something that's specific to<font color="#CCCCCC"> two windows</font>

156
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:12,159
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> when other OSS have different</font>

157
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:14,560
variants obviously but this is this is

158
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:18,400
standard hid right so this is this is

159
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:22,600
Windows Linux Mac across the board and

160
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:26,200
of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> right making the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Box do what</font>

161
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:28,360
you want priceless across real quick

162
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:31,000
before we get into the demo this is the

163
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:34,570
source again very short it's like you

164
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,740
know 50 lines or so for your pleasure if

165
00:06:34,570 --> 00:06:36,760
you'd like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a look at it again</font>

166
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:38,260
what we're trying to do is just

167
00:06:36,760 --> 00:06:40,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">implement a proof of concept show you</font>

168
00:06:38,260 --> 00:06:40,670
the potential here right this obvious is

169
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:42,020
in

170
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:45,290
and I'll be all what we're going to show

171
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:47,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">you but I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you get the point of the</font>

172
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:50,870
potential danger that this might have so

173
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:53,630
the first em I'll show you the the

174
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:55,310
device itself will instead well if it

175
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:57,170
obviously if it's the first install it

176
00:06:55,310 --> 00:06:59,930
will load the driver we've got a

177
00:06:57,170 --> 00:07:02,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">30-second wait for the hid driver to</font>

178
00:06:59,930 --> 00:07:07,550
finish installing it'll then simply

179
00:07:02,270 --> 00:07:10,490
emulate a<font color="#CCCCCC"> Windows hot key input open up</font>

180
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:14,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">a command prompt and then attempt to</font>

181
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:16,550
mount a share outside of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the internal</font>

182
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:19,700
network so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it looks like</font>

183
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:27,710
here's the chip right standard mini USB

184
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:30,020
input let's see there you<font color="#CCCCCC"> go I drew the</font>

185
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:35,750
short straw so hopefully the demo demons

186
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:38,810
don't get me here right so it's plugged

187
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:40,190
in we might have<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually plugged it</font>

188
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:42,980
into this machine before so obviously

189
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:44,960
the you're not going to see the they pop

190
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:47,240
up that windows would normally show you

191
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:48,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">it's waiting 30 seconds right now so</font>

192
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:55,880
hopefully within 30 seconds we'll see a

193
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:58,100
pop-up yeah exactly for your free to

194
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:59,540
talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to amongst yourselves I think Paul</font>

195
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:02,930
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's the way you're holding it</font>

196
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:06,560
oh is it sorry how's that there we go so

197
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:08,810
there's your command prompts and then it

198
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,900
should shift focus back to the original

199
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:14,180
window which it did but didn't work the

200
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:16,640
way I wanted it to but so obviously

201
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:19,610
again nothing nothing major frills

202
00:08:16,640 --> 00:08:20,960
nothing majorly fancy here but the point

203
00:08:19,610 --> 00:08:23,210
is is what we were able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is just</font>

204
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">simply by installing this autorun is</font>

205
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:28,489
completely disabled it's not executing

206
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:30,650
any any PE it's simply<font color="#CCCCCC"> just emulating</font>

207
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:33,620
keyboard human interface device

208
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:35,449
keystrokes into the system so you know

209
00:08:33,620 --> 00:08:37,940
with a little<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little more intelligent</font>

210
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:39,800
code something be able to detect the the

211
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,660
OS you know whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not it's XP or if</font>

212
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:43,789
it's vista or seven for windows if it's

213
00:08:41,659 --> 00:08:45,620
got you AC running you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know if you AC</font>

214
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:46,910
pops up there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> no reason I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> couldn't if</font>

215
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:49,070
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to run in a you know</font>

216
00:08:46,910 --> 00:08:50,870
and an advanced privileged command I

217
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:53,420
could just simply click through the<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes</font>

218
00:08:50,870 --> 00:08:55,700
right on the UAC the key here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is being</font>

219
00:08:53,420 --> 00:08:57,740
able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do this quick you know so the</font>

220
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,810
user is completely unaware<font color="#CCCCCC"> of anything</font>

221
00:08:57,740 --> 00:09:01,580
happening and you know you know the

222
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:03,290
majority<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them at least in my family</font>

223
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:06,620
would definitely fall into that category

224
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:08,240
so I've one other point I did forget to

225
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:09,830
mention is within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the source you'll see</font>

226
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,180
I did<font color="#E5E5E5"> put a bunch of sleeps in here to</font>

227
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:12,890
make this run a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little slower just so</font>

228
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:14,120
for the purposes of the demo so that you

229
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:16,069
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see the windows popping</font>

230
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:19,220
up but you can go as<font color="#CCCCCC"> fast as the input</font>

231
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:21,560
would expect right so you know

232
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,880
anticipate any any actual user

233
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:24,380
interaction that's going to be changing

234
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you're anticipating on the screen</font>

235
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:29,240
this could go you know within this could

236
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:30,620
actually all happened within between two

237
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:36,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">or three seconds without the user being</font>

238
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:42,320
aware so that's it oh yeah let's do the

239
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:55,220
other one so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to unplug this</font>

240
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:57,050
one and plug in this one you know I

241
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:59,000
realized there's an LED on this we

242
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:01,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">should have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> had it blink or something</font>

243
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:03,860
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to keep you guys you know it's</font>

244
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:05,510
after the ice cream<font color="#E5E5E5"> social it's you guys</font>

245
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:07,730
are sugar high you're coming down off

246
00:10:05,510 --> 00:10:12,020
that so again waiting<font color="#E5E5E5"> for 30 seconds</font>

247
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:13,490
just this is completely programmable

248
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:15,350
it's just something that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we put in so</font>

249
00:10:13,490 --> 00:10:17,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">that if it was the devices first time</font>

250
00:10:15,350 --> 00:10:24,590
installing we would wait for<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows</font>

251
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:28,700
below the hig driver may be there we go

252
00:10:24,590 --> 00:10:31,580
and of course return to waterless off

253
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:33,110
because we're at black hat so that's not

254
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:36,170
going to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it changed focus if</font>

255
00:10:33,110 --> 00:10:39,440
you notice real quick so what happened

256
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:41,420
was is it loaded ie tried to go do evil

257
00:10:39,440 --> 00:10:44,330
URL again you could point this<font color="#E5E5E5"> directly</font>

258
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:47,089
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> uh to a file on a web server click</font>

259
00:10:44,330 --> 00:10:49,100
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the accept yes to download and</font>

260
00:10:47,090 --> 00:10:50,780
then it automatically changed focus so

261
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:53,000
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> went right back to the to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the window</font>

262
00:10:50,780 --> 00:10:54,680
I was looking at so again you blink for

263
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:56,240
a couple seconds keep in mind i slowed

264
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,560
this down specifically for<font color="#E5E5E5"> this demo so</font>

265
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,210
if user blinks<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a couple seconds</font>

266
00:10:57,560 --> 00:10:59,670
drops quarter on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the floor they're going</font>

267
00:10:59,210 --> 00:11:03,270
to miss<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

268
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:09,900
so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's it Richard you're up</font>

269
00:11:03,270 --> 00:11:11,189
thanks Paul yeah so and we've we've

270
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:13,290
looked at different things<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

271
00:11:11,190 --> 00:11:15,960
you can again being<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a keyboard design</font>

272
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:18,630
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use hotkeys to functionally make</font>

273
00:11:15,960 --> 00:11:20,700
your screen go external so also in the

274
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:21,780
screen would go black looks what happens

275
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:24,090
it's actually going to the external

276
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:25,920
monitor come back online you're back on

277
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:28,350
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other side so all sorts of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

278
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:31,319
ways to<font color="#CCCCCC"> hide in the background and do</font>

279
00:11:28,350 --> 00:11:34,740
other functions um so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you do on</font>

280
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:36,750
this side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it and this where it gets</font>

281
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,970
some of the area's we've looked at the

282
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:41,790
web page download malware is always fun

283
00:11:38,970 --> 00:11:44,190
you can even force log on so if they're

284
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:46,349
casting credentials or anything else you

285
00:11:44,190 --> 00:11:48,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">can do a look at it capture than that in</font>

286
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:50,850
there is again click through anything

287
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:54,390
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything you're really or desire</font>

288
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:55,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">to want in this area it's also one of</font>

00:11:54,390 --> 00:11:57,600
these items that is a corporate

290

291
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,260
works on one machine and organization

292
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:03,870
it's probably going to work on every

293
00:12:01,260 --> 00:12:07,110
single machine in the organization and

294
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:09,690
once you have one capability you can go

295
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:12,090
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you can also create VNC type</font>

296
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:13,950
like access very easily<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you can</font>

297
00:12:12,090 --> 00:12:16,170
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> get a shell running somewhere</font>

298

in the background missing the focus on

that copy files to from shares back up

things over<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet anything you want</font>

301
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:29,069
to eliminate emulate on the keyboard you

302
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:31,439
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do it's really limited by</font>

303
00:12:29,070 --> 00:12:32,970
just what your your imagination actually

304
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:35,010
sits down with<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's all keyboard</font>

305
00:12:32,970 --> 00:12:38,670
shortcuts and again how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hide things</font>

306
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:40,230
sizing<font color="#E5E5E5"> windows everything else is part</font>

307
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:42,750
of the issues on minimization and

308
00:12:40,230 --> 00:12:44,700
everything else so<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's always something</font>

309
00:12:42,750 --> 00:12:46,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we really left with what can you</font>

310
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:48,600
actually do and then we start looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

311
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:52,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay what's the future scape of this</font>

312
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:53,520
what can you actually do<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get into</font>

313
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:56,700
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the areas and one of the key</font>

314
00:12:53,520 --> 00:13:00,420
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> came into it as a as a as a</font>

315
00:12:56,700 --> 00:13:06,090
known issue in the past if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can we</font>

316
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:08,250
can minimize some things here and do

317
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:11,310
like I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is that screen savers</font>

318
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:12,840
are you I know it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really silly but it</font>

319
00:13:11,310 --> 00:13:14,699
goes back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the same</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of idea</font>

320
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:16,800
once somebody has physical access to

321
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:18,900
your device game over it's been that way

322
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:21,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">for a very long time oh yeah I can boot</font>

323
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:22,920
with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> CDI</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get control of anything</font>

324
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:25,079
else it's pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> much on the same thing</font>

325
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:30,839
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> screensavers have this wonderful</font>

326
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:34,940
feature which is accessibility options

327
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:34,940
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

328
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:45,680
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> screensaver is enabled and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I can turn</font>

329
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:48,860
on certain accessibility options do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

330
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:50,540
want to enable high contrast or not okay

331
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:52,730
wait<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's screen saved you should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not do</font>

332
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:55,370
anything I don't want to do and

333
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:57,740
accessibility options are designed to

334
00:13:55,370 --> 00:14:00,200
bypass in some of those levels which

335
00:13:57,740 --> 00:14:02,270
allow you access to<font color="#E5E5E5"> certain things to</font>

336
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:03,830
turn on and not turn on so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

337
00:14:02,270 --> 00:14:06,140
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you basically say</font>

338
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:09,890
well if safe and that same goes for auto

339
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:11,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">run you're not in those those specifics</font>

340
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:13,670
of that because you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually make</font>

341
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:15,170
changes and do other things so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

342
00:14:13,670 --> 00:14:18,010
where we start getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> into the exploit</font>

343
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:18,010
side of the world

344
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,710
and

345
00:14:32,850 --> 00:14:37,350
you can start<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at the</font>

346
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,699
capabilities that are out there I view

347
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:40,139
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> as the ultimate version of a</font>

348
00:14:38,699 --> 00:14:42,359
switchblade for those don't know

349
00:14:40,139 --> 00:14:44,850
switchblades usually USB self bootable

350
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:46,529
does malicious things these are even

351
00:14:44,850 --> 00:14:47,970
better because the machine can actually

352
00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:50,100
be on and you can do anything that you

353
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:52,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with the controls again these</font>

354
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:53,370
are a interface design things so it's a

355
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:56,849
mouse it's an interface you have

356
00:14:53,370 --> 00:14:59,519
multiple mice which could inserting this

357
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:02,009
removing it it's created in a mouse and

358
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:03,630
interface you can create<font color="#E5E5E5"> a mouse to sit</font>

359
00:15:02,009 --> 00:15:06,089
<font color="#E5E5E5">there</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and go one by one pixel in a</font>

360
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:07,319
circle somewhere just off the screen are

361
00:15:06,089 --> 00:15:08,639
just on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bottom not going to</font>

362
00:15:07,319 --> 00:15:10,860
interfere<font color="#E5E5E5"> with anything but it will</font>

363
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:12,630
prevent screensavers from coming on it

364
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:15,509
will keep everything active for the user

365
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:18,180
not to grunt autorun<font color="#E5E5E5"> disabled does</font>

366
00:15:15,509 --> 00:15:20,130
absolutely nothing on this<font color="#E5E5E5"> side some of</font>

367
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:22,829
the newer interesting areas that come

368
00:15:20,130 --> 00:15:24,990
into play USB fuzzy again the device

369
00:15:22,829 --> 00:15:28,258
drivers are designed for<font color="#E5E5E5"> hardware a</font>

370
00:15:24,990 --> 00:15:29,759
mouse only does certain things the

371
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:31,500
driver says is written<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a</font>

372
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:33,240
specification that you're only going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

373
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:34,680
do the following I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to change</font>

374
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,149
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to go anything</font>

375
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,920
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the mass is going to do and</font>

376
00:15:36,149 --> 00:15:40,860
the drivers are actually set to that

377
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:43,319
well guess what I can now change that by

378
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:44,759
this design and say no I'm not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

379
00:15:43,319 --> 00:15:47,550
be able to do this I'm going to do

380
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:50,160
something out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of bounds and this becomes</font>

381
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:53,339
some of the ability to actually fuzz the

382
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:56,550
devices using a simple interface and

383
00:15:53,339 --> 00:15:59,279
again blue screens are really easy to do

384
00:15:56,550 --> 00:16:01,199
in generating this function and you can

385
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,790
go generate any of the hid functions

386
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:04,740
that are actually there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you discover</font>

387
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:06,660
that most of the drivers are not very

388
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:08,100
well written again<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're standard</font>

389
00:16:06,660 --> 00:16:09,899
hardware drivers side I know how the

390
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,630
hardware is going to perform here's what

391
00:16:09,899 --> 00:16:14,579
I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to accept as its inputs and</font>

392
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:18,389
figuring the hardware is going to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

393
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:21,089
bound checking for a lot of this USB 3

394
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:24,000
dot 0 supports DMA direct memory access

395
00:16:21,089 --> 00:16:26,639
for those that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> familiar with DMA</font>

396
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,860
just say this is add into<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

397
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:31,980
functionality of firewire interfaces and

398
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:34,740
pcmcia interfaces so if you know some

399
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:36,449
old exploits that have been around for

400
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:39,269
that guess<font color="#CCCCCC"> what they're now going to be</font>

401
00:16:36,449 --> 00:16:41,160
done for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us be on that side of it so</font>

402
00:16:39,269 --> 00:16:43,769
you're able to do all sorts of more

403
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:45,510
really really malicious things with a

404
00:16:43,769 --> 00:16:48,060
simple side of the key on<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

405
00:16:45,510 --> 00:16:50,160
side of<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> becomes definitely</font>

406
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:53,640
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the interesting aspects and</font>

407
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:57,120
capabilities going<font color="#E5E5E5"> forward in this area</font>

408
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:58,740
um again what can be done and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

409
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:01,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">sometimes feel like the cat more than</font>

410
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:04,109
often that's there um you can disable

411

<font color="#E5E5E5">external</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> USBs the problem is docking</font>

413
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:09,900
now have four<font color="#CCCCCC"> USBs now guess what I plug</font>

414
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:11,699
into a docking station know your

415
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:13,589
keyboard doesn't work anymore thank you

416
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:16,260
for playing it's very hard to integrate

417
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:18,419
that into an organization my favorite is

418
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:19,890
the USB glue I actually don't know if

419
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:21,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is a humorous thing or that's</font>

420
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:23,070
actually a product I'm trying to order a

421
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:25,948
stick of it to see if I can<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually get</font>

422
00:17:23,069 --> 00:17:28,560
it but<font color="#E5E5E5"> again it's not out of common for</font>

423
00:17:25,949 --> 00:17:30,630
people to put epoxy and other types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

424
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:33,629
resins inside the USB to keep them<font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

425
00:17:30,630 --> 00:17:35,160
actually functioning on that side of it

426
00:17:33,630 --> 00:17:36,630
they understand the issues on the

00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:39,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">security side of this is becoming a</font>

00:17:36,630 --> 00:17:42,180
common areas<font color="#E5E5E5"> there USD device management</font>

429
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:44,520
group policies I know it's a dirty word

430
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:46,110
in some cases but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it also does allow</font>

431
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:48,600
certain functions to be actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> pushed</font>

432
00:17:46,110 --> 00:17:50,760
down to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> action we also talked about</font>

433
00:17:48,600 --> 00:17:53,550
third-party applications it's not a

434
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:55,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">really difficult to write a trivial</font>

435
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:57,419
program that would<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually say hey</font>

436
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:59,100
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> allowed to have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> two keyboards</font>

437
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:01,140
plugged into there at one time you'll

438
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:04,020
have or you have one single hid device

439
00:18:01,140 --> 00:18:06,150
why do you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to and you can prompt</font>

440
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:08,700
and disable the other one on the

441
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:11,010
capability as well as the OS monitoring

442
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:13,200
that controls the aspects of this over

443
00:18:11,010 --> 00:18:15,780
and over again so it's a it's definitely

444
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:17,940
an ongoing issue that's there it's

445
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:20,250
something that is now just<font color="#E5E5E5"> being</font>

446
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:22,620
exploited I've seen about three other

447
00:18:20,250 --> 00:18:24,630
talks based upon the same thing so I'm

448
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:27,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking they got jasons a card is about</font>

449
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:29,700
the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> time we did and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> again it's a</font>

450
00:18:27,150 --> 00:18:32,280
new frontier in regards to this it

451
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:33,570
becomes a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very easy you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> never thought</font>

452
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">about somebody walking around with a</font>

453
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:37,919
keyboard and plugging it into systems

454
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:39,840
and running commands now you've got all

455
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:42,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">I have to do is plug this one device in</font>

456
00:18:39,840 --> 00:18:45,360
and when it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> done unplug it and let it</font>

457
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:47,700
run it gives a whole different flexion

458
00:18:45,360 --> 00:18:49,139
of physical access and control and other

459
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:52,960
form factors to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to do</font>

460
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:55,360
exploitation on that<font color="#E5E5E5"> side</font>

461
00:18:52,960 --> 00:19:04,419
and that's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have about five minutes</font>

462
00:18:55,360 --> 00:19:05,889
for questions yes no because well you

463
00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:07,870
can do it through<font color="#CCCCCC"> GPO or some of the</font>

464
00:19:05,890 --> 00:19:09,610
other policies that are there but all a

465
00:19:07,870 --> 00:19:11,110
lot of the human interface drivers are

466
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:13,149
already pre-loaded into the application

467
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:16,928
that's actually there and so it just

468
00:19:13,149 --> 00:19:19,000
recognizes it as another USB keyboard in

469
00:19:16,929 --> 00:19:20,740
that aspect of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's really</font>

470
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">difficult to to perform that function</font>

471
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:25,179
unless you create policy to say don't

472
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:27,668
load these drivers in that subset of

473
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:28,990
that but you defect all USB keyboards if

474
00:19:27,669 --> 00:19:38,770
you were to do that you can disable your

475
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:42,159
speaker you lose them all at once use

476
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:44,799
the native windows driver so no yeah

477
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:46,720
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah so the question</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was that when</font>

478
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:49,658
<font color="#CCCCCC">he got his card from the major financial</font>

479
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,490
institution did it install a driver or

480
00:19:49,659 --> 00:19:53,320
not and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Jason's point is now a</font>

481
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:54,970
basically used the drivers that<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

482
00:19:53,320 --> 00:19:56,020
built into<font color="#E5E5E5"> their way it initializes you</font>

483
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:57,399
know initialize the device with a

484
00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:00,039
built-in driver there was nothing extra

485
00:19:57,399 --> 00:20:01,449
load it just worked just like it would

486
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:07,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you let in bought a keyboard and a</font>

487
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:07,860
moment<font color="#E5E5E5"> led to them left side black shirt</font>

488
00:20:14,029 --> 00:20:19,429
so Oh question go ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> Robbie</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sorry so</font>

489
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:21,499
to repeat the question how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you how</font>

490
00:20:19,429 --> 00:20:34,399
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> you detect what OS is running</font>

491
00:20:21,499 --> 00:20:35,509
right so again proof of concept we did

492
00:20:34,399 --> 00:20:36,978
<font color="#E5E5E5">an action we weren't able to get that</font>

493
00:20:35,509 --> 00:20:39,979
far with the limited time that we had to

494
00:20:36,979 --> 00:20:41,929
put everything together but what what I

495
00:20:39,979 --> 00:20:45,049
was what we were conceptualizing is the

496
00:20:41,929 --> 00:20:47,089
ability of being able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to perhaps load if</font>

497
00:20:45,049 --> 00:20:49,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">you could leverage it as another driver</font>

498
00:20:47,089 --> 00:20:51,499
or in fact to<font color="#E5E5E5"> perhaps try to take</font>

499
00:20:49,879 --> 00:20:53,718
advantage of the fact if autorun is not

500
00:20:51,499 --> 00:20:55,789
disabled to run something just to simply

501
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:59,269
check and then call a specific routine

502
00:20:55,789 --> 00:21:01,009
that would then load the the the hid

503
00:20:59,269 --> 00:21:02,599
driver and then would<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know run as</font>

504
00:21:01,009 --> 00:21:04,999
specific callers but the specific

505
00:21:02,599 --> 00:21:07,309
function within<font color="#E5E5E5"> the code that that was</font>

506
00:21:04,999 --> 00:21:09,499
written for that UF OS like for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example</font>

507
00:21:07,309 --> 00:21:11,599
if it was XP you wouldn't want the extra

508
00:21:09,499 --> 00:21:21,999
clicks for you AC because you know that

509
00:21:11,599 --> 00:21:21,999
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not there exactly</font>

510
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:32,059
correct yes it's kind of complex and

511
00:21:30,770 --> 00:21:34,250
there's a lot of nested logic in there

512
00:21:32,059 --> 00:21:36,320
but technically possible we think yeah

513
00:21:34,250 --> 00:21:38,840
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> again it a lot of this is just your</font>

514
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:41,928
streaming input information off of that

515
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:44,780
so again to Paul's point you could see

516
00:21:41,929 --> 00:21:47,419
about potentially status of doing

517
00:21:44,780 --> 00:21:50,030
something back onto the driver to load

518
00:21:47,419 --> 00:21:51,770
something else and the form factor you

519
00:21:50,030 --> 00:21:57,649
said it was two parts or is that both

520
00:21:51,770 --> 00:22:13,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay there's one other question oh yeah</font>

521
00:21:57,650 --> 00:22:15,919
sure of it so yeah so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> question is is</font>

522
00:22:13,610 --> 00:22:18,080
are some of the devices like these

523
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:23,150
teensy boards or anything else multiple

524
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:26,330
devices that hold again combo drives USB

525
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:28,400
drives<font color="#CCCCCC"> or some of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the other ones uh I</font>

526
00:22:26,330 --> 00:22:30,080
personally didn't see any like<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we</font>

527
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:31,309
went for the low hanging fruit the

528
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,110
cheapest board we should get out there

529
00:22:31,309 --> 00:22:35,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">just to get it running the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> team's is</font>

530
00:22:33,110 --> 00:22:38,120
capable of multiple you can do mass

531
00:22:35,690 --> 00:22:39,500
storage and I think it's got it there's

532
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:43,189
no reason we couldn't split it in<font color="#CCCCCC"> half</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

533
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:45,020
think these are 128 256<font color="#E5E5E5"> mega know</font>

534
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:54,890
there's no reason you couldn't split it

535
00:22:45,020 --> 00:22:56,990
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay question you could do wireless</font>

536
00:22:54,890 --> 00:23:00,230
you can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ethernet you can do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Ethernet</font>

537
00:22:56,990 --> 00:23:02,600
you can do a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other functionality</font>

538
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:06,620
built into that<font color="#CCCCCC"> again a lot of anything</font>

539
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:09,530
that's based on USB now becomes prior

540
00:23:06,620 --> 00:23:13,580
functions again other things such as USB

541
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:16,190
hubs operate very strangely and another

542
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:18,980
USB hubs plugged in and how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> they find</font>

543
00:23:16,190 --> 00:23:21,020
which one's connected to where there's

544
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:24,530
there's all sorts of little things as

545
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:26,240
these as these boards can produce that

546
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:33,530
can change way things are actually

547
00:23:26,240 --> 00:23:34,740
configured yes dear next year yeah one

548
00:23:33,530 --> 00:23:37,260
of one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the issues</font>

549
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:40,710
two<font color="#E5E5E5"> years ago they did an exploit for</font>

550
00:23:37,260 --> 00:23:42,929
wireless keyboards based upon the

551
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:46,800
<font color="#CCCCCC">Bluetooth and again it uses Bluetooth</font>

552
00:23:42,929 --> 00:23:48,780
that uses the l2cap interface to go back

553
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">and forth but under that l2cap interface</font>

554
00:23:48,780 --> 00:23:53,850
is the hid that's actually plugged into

555
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:57,899
so it becomes the same functionality and

556
00:23:53,850 --> 00:24:00,389
capability that's there one more

557
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:04,170
question<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> anyone going once going</font>

558
00:24:00,390 --> 00:24:07,160
<font color="#CCCCCC">twice sold</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay thank you very much</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

559
00:24:04,170 --> 00:24:07,160
your time appreciate it
