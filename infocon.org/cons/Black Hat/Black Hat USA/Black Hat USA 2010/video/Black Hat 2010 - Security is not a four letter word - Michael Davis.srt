00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you everyone for staying</font>

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:05,430
late in the day hopefully this will be

3
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:08,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">the most informative talk you come to of</font>

4
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:09,510
all black hat<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right and the reason I</font>

5
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:10,650
say that is actually cuz we're talk

6
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,969
about something that<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> never talked</font>

7
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">about at blackhat which is when we come</font>

8
00:00:11,969 --> 00:00:17,279
back<font color="#E5E5E5"> to our jobs we leave from this</font>

9
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,750
conference we have to buy tools and you

10
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:20,220
know things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that help us solve these</font>

11
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:22,500
security issues that we just<font color="#E5E5E5"> learned</font>

12
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,590
about and inevitably that<font color="#E5E5E5"> means we have</font>

13
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,650
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to our bosses executives etc and</font>

14
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:29,820
try to justify these costs and so that's

15
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,098
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this topic is about is how to</font>

16
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:36,030
communicate with executive management

17
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:37,349
and talk about security so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> licks</font>

18
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:38,460
thing about me I'm CEO<font color="#CCCCCC"> Saavik</font>

19
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:41,700
technologies I've been around the

20
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:43,890

windows bunch of other tools so I've

23
00:00:45,989 --> 00:00:48,899
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> around for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> while and also done a</font>

24

25
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,190
pretty much every major conference what

26
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,170
I'm else most<font color="#E5E5E5"> well known for those</font>

29
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,050
exposed that came out last year so if

30
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:02,910
you're still want to buy a book I'll

31
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:05,729
sign it for you if you go buy one out

32
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,170
there at the bookstore but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've done</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

33
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:08,520
lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> work for now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> InformationWeek</font>

35
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,729
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk about came from</font>

36
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:14,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">information week I've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> doing a lot</font>

37
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:16,890
of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> cover stories on more</font>

38
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:18,658
technical related items and as I was

39
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:20,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">working with a lot of the csos and</font>

40
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:22,049
whatnot across the United States<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

41
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,090
realized that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this topic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> had been</font>

42
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:26,670
communicated too much or discussed and

43
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:29,159
so what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I did is I started a big survey</font>

44
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,170
and so we spent<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a year and a half</font>

45
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:33,210
researching how do people communicate

46
00:01:31,170 --> 00:01:35,100
within their jobs over a thousand

47
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:36,869
companies we've worked with all those

48
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,240
thousand over 200 had actually had

49
00:01:36,869 --> 00:01:41,909
breaches and there in a couple different

50
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,140
industries<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and so kind of some of</font>

51
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:44,490
the tips<font color="#E5E5E5"> and techniques will talk about</font>

52
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:46,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">are directly related from these</font>

53
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:48,270
interviews with the csos and directors

54
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:51,570
of security and security engineers

55
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:52,740
across the world so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing we</font>

56
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:56,309
did is we said you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know what do you guys</font>

57
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,630
concerned with and this led into a lot

58
00:01:56,310 --> 00:01:59,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">of different interesting conversations</font>

59
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,469
but what was most important about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

60
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:03,390
was that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the percentages that you see</font>

61
00:02:01,469 --> 00:02:05,369
here so managing the complexity of

62
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,220
security was a huge increase from the

63
00:02:05,369 --> 00:02:09,959
previous few years and we had done

64
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:11,879
similar surveys like this a couple years

65
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,180
ago but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's gone</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up dramatically in</font>

66
00:02:11,879 --> 00:02:14,379
complexity and

67
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:16,629
as you can imagine it's getting more

68
00:02:14,379 --> 00:02:18,879
complex as more and more networks are

69
00:02:16,629 --> 00:02:21,429
getting decentralized and<font color="#CCCCCC"> D perimeter</font>

70
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,140
eyes but the fifteen percent of getting

71
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:25,269
manager and buying is going up as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font>

72
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:27,849
we're seeing<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the economy there's less</font>

73
00:02:25,269 --> 00:02:29,709
investment in security it was decreased

74
00:02:27,849 --> 00:02:31,090
last year we just saw the Verizon

75
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:33,310
Business Report if anybody's read that

76
00:02:31,090 --> 00:02:36,219
yesterday they got released security

77
00:02:33,310 --> 00:02:38,230
breaches went down so far in 2009 and in

78
00:02:36,219 --> 00:02:39,879
2010 so how are you going to go sell

79
00:02:38,230 --> 00:02:41,738
your boss<font color="#E5E5E5"> on doing security stuff with</font>

80
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:43,239
preachers are done right so a couple

81
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:44,799
different<font color="#CCCCCC"> things have been changing but</font>

82
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:47,829
talking to executives hasn't really

83
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:49,030
changed so<font color="#E5E5E5"> the question that we started</font>

84
00:02:47,829 --> 00:02:50,950
asking people who are you how do you

85
00:02:49,030 --> 00:02:52,780
manage security and security metrics

86
00:02:50,950 --> 00:02:54,458
started becoming a pretty important

87
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:56,560
topic in about two thousand and five and

88
00:02:54,459 --> 00:02:58,239
a whole whopping two books are released

89
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:00,790
about it and they're actually here at

90
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:02,139
<font color="#E5E5E5">the bookstore those are the only two</font>

91
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:04,120
books right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about security</font>

92
00:03:02,139 --> 00:03:06,129
metrics and they're very very deep and

93
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:07,599
detailed they talk exactly about how to

94
00:03:06,129 --> 00:03:09,280
measure these things and monitor them

95
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,500
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're talking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know your</font>

96
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,459
modified annual loss expectancy and how

97
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:15,189
you can do<font color="#E5E5E5"> all these different things</font>

98
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:17,440
those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are great things</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to start with but</font>

99
00:03:15,189 --> 00:03:19,209
both books sadly only dedicate 11 pages

100
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:21,220
to how to communicate those actual

101
00:03:19,209 --> 00:03:22,479
metrics you've now collected so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you've</font>

102
00:03:21,220 --> 00:03:23,829
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> all these great</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> metrics you know all</font>

103
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:25,569
this great information about how well

104
00:03:23,829 --> 00:03:27,760
you're doing in security but you don't

105
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:29,798
<font color="#CCCCCC">know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to tell people that okay so I</font>

106
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,030
liken this to my<font color="#E5E5E5"> five-year-old son who</font>

107
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:32,439
it's got all those great stuff to tell

108
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">me and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you just stammering real quick</font>

109
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:35,290
and he's just you're breaking up with

110
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:38,168
<font color="#E5E5E5">sentences and whatnot because he can't</font>

111
00:03:35,290 --> 00:03:39,069
fully explain what he's trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get</font>

112
00:03:38,169 --> 00:03:41,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">through because he doesn't know the</font>

113
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:43,149
right terms to ask him to<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about and</font>

114
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:44,290
so when<font color="#CCCCCC"> we start looking at these</font>

115
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:46,389
different things<font color="#E5E5E5"> we saw that there</font>

116
00:03:44,290 --> 00:03:47,709
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> was no commonality okay that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

117
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:49,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">the biggest piece we saw your security</font>

118
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:50,739
metrics there's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch of stuff</font>

119
00:03:49,359 --> 00:03:52,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this right why aren't people</font>

120
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:54,189
having these frameworks built up and

121
00:03:52,389 --> 00:03:56,739
using the same things over and over

122
00:03:54,189 --> 00:03:58,120
again and of the companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we work</font>

123
00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:00,519
with that we thought were doing the

124
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:02,019
right things they didn't actually use

125
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:04,329
any common framework they kind of

126
00:04:02,019 --> 00:04:06,280
homegrown in and built it up<font color="#CCCCCC"> in their</font>

127
00:04:04,329 --> 00:04:08,109
own<font color="#E5E5E5"> environment and the reason it was so</font>

128
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,449
successful is because as they homegrown

129
00:04:08,109 --> 00:04:11,590
that system their executives and the

130
00:04:10,449 --> 00:04:13,629
rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the business bought into it</font>

131
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:15,370
because they drew it with them all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right</font>

132
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:16,449
and so immediately when we<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

133
00:04:15,370 --> 00:04:18,849
companies<font color="#CCCCCC"> that brought in a big</font>

134
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:20,239
framework<font color="#CCCCCC"> like you know an ISO and the</font>

135
00:04:18,849 --> 00:04:22,130
metrics that come with that or

136
00:04:20,238 --> 00:04:23,840
like that business executives were

137
00:04:22,130 --> 00:04:25,130
immediately like<font color="#CCCCCC"> whoa I don't understand</font>

138
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,318
that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't want to listen they turn</font>

139
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:29,120
their brains off<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay when they started</font>

140
00:04:27,319 --> 00:04:31,039
growing in homegrown they got a lot more

141
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:34,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">success so all these metrics that are</font>

142
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:35,210
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> are actually good maybe okay they</font>

143
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,440
can be good<font color="#E5E5E5"> if they're good for your</font>

144
00:04:35,210 --> 00:04:37,789
environment so that's the key here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

145
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,520
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything needs to be customized</font>

146
00:04:37,789 --> 00:04:42,949
so the first<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we saw was that</font>

147
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:45,770
security and it ends<font color="#CCCCCC"> up being</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a set of</font>

148
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:47,389
very strategic projects okay and tricked

149
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,919
projects are very difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

150
00:04:47,389 --> 00:04:51,139
beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> their complex are very</font>

151
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:53,090
difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> to communicate and so on top</font>

152
00:04:51,139 --> 00:04:55,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">of that security can never stop right we</font>

153
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:57,979
can't stop doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> something so just</font>

154
00:04:55,250 --> 00:05:00,080
because firewalls are no longer you know

155
00:04:57,979 --> 00:05:01,849
the threats are no longer operating

156
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,068
system and the firewalls the only tool

157
00:05:01,849 --> 00:05:05,990
you have these still need firewalls

158
00:05:04,069 --> 00:05:07,159
right you still need some antivirus and

159
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:09,110
things like that everything kind of

160
00:05:07,159 --> 00:05:11,000
built on top of<font color="#CCCCCC"> each other and yet all</font>

161
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:12,470
the security metrics that people work

162
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">with our point in time metrics they're</font>

163
00:05:12,470 --> 00:05:17,659
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> focused on longer term strategies</font>

164
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:20,419
and so 2005 book the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first one in IT</font>

165
00:05:17,659 --> 00:05:21,409
security metrics written<font color="#E5E5E5"> by a gentleman</font>

166
00:05:20,419 --> 00:05:23,780
he talked about the balanced scorecard

167
00:05:21,409 --> 00:05:25,639
method but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this balanced scorecard is</font>

168
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:27,258
and it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great tool that's why I'm</font>

169
00:05:25,639 --> 00:05:29,780
bringing it up but nobody used it in our

170
00:05:27,259 --> 00:05:31,430
survey<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a single company use the</font>

171
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:33,710
balanced scorecard method what this

172
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:35,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">method is is was developed by Harvard to</font>

173
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:36,620
do business strategy so forget about

174
00:05:35,449 --> 00:05:38,719
security just how do you do big

175
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:40,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">long-term business strategies you know</font>

176
00:05:38,719 --> 00:05:41,750
kind of like BP how they gonna clean up

177
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:44,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">the oil spill it's a pretty long term</font>

178
00:05:41,750 --> 00:05:46,400
strategy issue and so use a balanced

179
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,289
scorecard for that type of approach and

180
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,479
so what they did is they adapt at the

181
00:05:48,289 --> 00:05:52,009
balanced scorecard for security<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and</font>

182
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:53,508
it found it very very effective<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

183
00:05:52,009 --> 00:05:55,340
the core tenant of the balanced

184
00:05:53,509 --> 00:05:57,259
scorecard method is whatever you're

185
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:59,719
measuring and doing has to link to a

186
00:05:57,259 --> 00:06:01,250
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> objective plain and simple</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

187
00:05:59,719 --> 00:06:03,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">business objective of your bank could be</font>

188
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:04,580
the open for new branches it could be

189
00:06:03,289 --> 00:06:06,229
gross sales twenty percent a year

190
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:08,780
whatever the business is trying to do

191
00:06:06,229 --> 00:06:10,940
everything<font color="#E5E5E5"> from a project perspective</font>

192
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:12,258
has to match to those objectives if they

193
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,750
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> you shouldn't be doing the project</font>

194
00:06:12,259 --> 00:06:16,370
and so as they sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of looking at</font>

195
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,930
mapping<font color="#CCCCCC"> these technologies to the</font>

196
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:19,819
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> objectives they found out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

197
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:22,310
it was much easier to communicate with

198
00:06:19,819 --> 00:06:24,139
executive because now the execs figured

199
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:25,759
out why you're doing it so if you can

200
00:06:24,139 --> 00:06:26,659
link vulnerability management and things

201
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,130
like that to some of their business

202
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:30,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">objectives they don't turn their brains</font>

203
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:31,770
off ok they keep listening because they

204
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:34,110
understand the value much more

205
00:06:31,770 --> 00:06:36,389
the other focus of the balance<font color="#E5E5E5"> work are</font>

206
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:39,090
though are very defined metrics<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

207
00:06:36,389 --> 00:06:40,289
the rest of those security metric books

208
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:42,270
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mentioned they have all the</font>

209
00:06:40,289 --> 00:06:43,500
metrics you could ever want<font color="#E5E5E5"> the balanced</font>

210
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:46,139
scorecard helps you figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> which</font>

211
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:48,750
ones are best and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd help provide</font>

212
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:50,490
accuracy to your claims while<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

213
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:51,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">getting you too deep into</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> precision and</font>

214
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:54,120
we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> about difference between</font>

215
00:06:51,539 --> 00:06:56,430
accuracy and precision in a second but

216
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,289
the biggest piece that I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stay</font>

217
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,430
here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that although no company we</font>

218
00:06:58,289 --> 00:07:01,710
talked to was doing the balanced

219
00:06:59,430 --> 00:07:03,720
scorecard method there was a couple that

220
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:05,520
we found through research with things

221
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:07,500
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as they were actually doing it</font>

222
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,169
the first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> told us was it</font>

223
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:11,940
doesn't always<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

224
00:07:10,169 --> 00:07:13,740
one-stop framework<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's going to make</font>

225
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:15,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything easy for you okay so you got</font>

226
00:07:13,740 --> 00:07:16,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">to realize</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that this for everything</font>

227
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:18,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're trying to do in security this</font>

228
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:20,729
will not<font color="#E5E5E5"> always work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright sometimes a</font>

229
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:21,960
little sometimes as well so what do we

230
00:07:20,729 --> 00:07:23,969
<font color="#E5E5E5">see well the first things that we heard</font>

231
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">back from everybody was that basically</font>

232
00:07:23,969 --> 00:07:27,659
<font color="#CCCCCC">nobody believes me okay all your</font>

233
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:29,250
assumptions about your value to the

234
00:07:27,659 --> 00:07:30,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">company are wrong is what we found from</font>

235
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:33,000
a security perspective as an engineer

236
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:35,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">you already have an uphill</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> battle</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

237
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,110
their business is focused on<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

238
00:07:35,819 --> 00:07:38,880
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> they look at you as an outsider</font>

239
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:41,310
immediately because you weren't in the

240
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:43,169
business you're an IT<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy so you're a</font>

241
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:44,400
geek right and there's all these

242
00:07:43,169 --> 00:07:45,900
different stereotypes you have to fight

243
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,090
against just to get into<font color="#E5E5E5"> the door to</font>

244
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,679
explain the project<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you have and it</font>

245
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:51,448
may be the highest risk issue you guys

246
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:53,219
get broken into tomorrow and everything

247
00:07:51,449 --> 00:07:55,080
stolen and you still have these uphill

248
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:56,460
battles will deal with so the first

249
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:57,960
thing we saw when we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually looked at</font>

250
00:07:56,460 --> 00:07:59,370
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> powerpoints maybe we went deep into</font>

251
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:00,989
this we said let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> PowerPoint</font>

252
00:07:59,370 --> 00:08:03,419
you're using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the justify your projects</font>

253
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:05,190
let me see the actual people you're

254
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:07,710
talking to is it<font color="#E5E5E5"> Board of Directors is</font>

255
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:11,279
it committees who is it first thing we

256
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:13,409
saw is way too<font color="#E5E5E5"> many variables geeks love</font>

257
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:15,479
variables and they will go get industry

258
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:16,889
data like crazy and show 18 different

259
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:18,359
intersection points of why this is

260
00:08:16,889 --> 00:08:20,370
important because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have to prove</font>

261
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:23,130
this case it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very difficult to prove</font>

262
00:08:20,370 --> 00:08:24,779
this case of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> complex project so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we saw</font>

263
00:08:23,130 --> 00:08:27,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">that those who were successful though</font>

264
00:08:24,779 --> 00:08:29,069
removed all the variables<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay they made</font>

265
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:30,690
things a lot simpler not give you an

266
00:08:29,069 --> 00:08:33,539
example in a second but they also

267
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:35,669
focused on reducing precision<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay you</font>

268
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:39,630
can see here point six point five five

269
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:41,819
point six one day<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't care okay it's</font>

270
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:44,219
close enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay accuracy is what</font>

271
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:45,480
matters not precision so in this case we

272
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:47,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">talked about precision</font>

273
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:48,630
whether it's your internal metrics<font color="#CCCCCC"> your</font>

274
00:08:47,070 --> 00:08:50,820
monitoring whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's industry</font>

275
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:52,350
statistics precision<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not important</font>

276
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,910
what is important is the accuracy of

277
00:08:52,350 --> 00:08:55,709
<font color="#E5E5E5">that data to make sure that it's close</font>

278
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:58,410
enough and that it got the<font color="#CCCCCC"> point across</font>

279
00:08:55,709 --> 00:09:01,829
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it's a point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 55 or a point 65 it's</font>

280
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:04,019
good enough<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and make sure your</font>

281
00:09:01,829 --> 00:09:05,699
correctly reflecting the size of what

282
00:09:04,019 --> 00:09:07,199
you're actually measuring this is the

283
00:09:05,699 --> 00:09:08,939
number one<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue we sell an industry</font>

284
00:09:07,199 --> 00:09:10,439
data we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get these verizon business</font>

285
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,389
reports we could all this stuff out from

286
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,490
the industry we go back to our you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

287
00:09:12,389 --> 00:09:15,990
offices or cubes we start adapting it to

288
00:09:14,490 --> 00:09:17,820
our environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the first thing the</font>

289
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:20,250
guy says is well they're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

290
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:21,360
company as us or we're different than

291
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:22,860
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> rest of the industry to the</font>

292
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:25,500
businesses so immediately all your stats

293
00:09:22,860 --> 00:09:27,389
are worthless all right all because<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

294
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,699
didn't apply things properly to what

295
00:09:27,389 --> 00:09:32,010
you're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've saw the ones</font>

296
00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:34,229
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> were most successful at this is a</font>

297
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:36,209
used repeatable metrics from within

298
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:37,560
their own organization easy metrics

299
00:09:36,209 --> 00:09:39,479
things that you can pull up within two

300
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,040
minutes of having a conversation now

301
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:42,300
that does mean that you could pull those

302
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:44,219
up easily because you're tracking them

303
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,599
very well or it also could mean that

304
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:48,690
it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> just an easy metric to measure</font>

305
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,040
metrics that we found very complex to

306
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:51,930
measure we're the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ones that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were</font>

307
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,849
immediately thrown off as either you

308
00:09:51,930 --> 00:09:55,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">know gobbly gook or you're trying to</font>

309
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:57,240
just make up numbers<font color="#E5E5E5"> to prove a point</font>

310
00:09:55,110 --> 00:09:59,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">because immediately they look at this as</font>

311
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,319
if it's complex it's risky so if your

312
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:03,240
analysis and<font color="#CCCCCC"> your details of your</font>

313
00:10:01,319 --> 00:10:04,500
variables are complex that means it's

314
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:08,310
risky they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to have any</font>

315
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:10,139
interest in it so the number one thing

316
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:12,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">that we saw back when we interviewed</font>

317
00:10:10,139 --> 00:10:13,290
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> csos and we said okay these are</font>

318
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:14,910
the ones that we like we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

319
00:10:13,290 --> 00:10:17,099
doing very well when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes to both</font>

320
00:10:14,910 --> 00:10:18,449
managing security having buy-in for

321
00:10:17,100 --> 00:10:20,880
management we said can we talk to your

322
00:10:18,449 --> 00:10:22,319
managers can we go talk to the CEOs and

323
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,660
CFOs of people you're actually dealing

324
00:10:22,319 --> 00:10:27,510
with let's ask that what you do well and

325
00:10:24,660 --> 00:10:29,189
they all said one thing communication

326
00:10:27,510 --> 00:10:32,370
they made<font color="#E5E5E5"> it easy for me to understand</font>

327
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:34,620
none of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them said you know he's great at</font>

328
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:36,839
explaining you know how this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a great</font>

329
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:38,670
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> high risk issue and we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

330
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:40,410
fix it etc well they did is they said

331
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:42,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're good at actually communicating</font>

332
00:10:40,410 --> 00:10:43,709
things so the first thing you see<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

333
00:10:42,180 --> 00:10:46,290
that talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> numbers and risk is</font>

334
00:10:43,709 --> 00:10:47,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">very hard</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we started taking</font>

335
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:49,949
parallels from other industries like

336
00:10:47,910 --> 00:10:51,810
life insurance<font color="#E5E5E5"> industries auto insurance</font>

337
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:53,279
industries they have<font color="#E5E5E5"> less hard time</font>

338
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:55,380
we're trying to sell you on insurance

339
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:57,480
which is very<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar security you're</font>

340
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:57,910
buying something in case something

341
00:10:57,480 --> 00:11:00,280
happens

342
00:10:57,910 --> 00:11:01,959
and so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> said what do insurance</font>

343
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:04,150
companies do when they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the sales</font>

344
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:05,560
cycle to try to sell you the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing</font>

345
00:11:04,150 --> 00:11:08,319
we saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they communicate the</font>

346
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:10,359
proposition very easily and so you don't

347
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">get the situation where you're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

348
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:13,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">to an executive he says well you know</font>

349
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:15,070
Mike it didn't happen last year it won't

350
00:11:13,570 --> 00:11:16,540
happen this year we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go ahead and</font>

351
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:18,880
just you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know not put that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the budget</font>

352
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:20,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay and everybody's focusing on keeping</font>

353
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,890
their budget just on maintenance no new

354
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:25,420
expenditures but when we actually I went

355
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:26,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and talked</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple life</font>

356
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:29,290
insurance salesman and said hey guys

357
00:11:26,740 --> 00:11:31,540
tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> me how you sell this stuff I want</font>

358
00:11:29,290 --> 00:11:34,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">to know what the insides are they said</font>

359
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:35,469
the number<font color="#E5E5E5"> one thing is scenarios and we</font>

360
00:11:34,240 --> 00:11:37,540
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> see that trend when we look</font>

361
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:38,920
through the previous data but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> saw we</font>

362
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:40,780
look to these PowerPoint presentations

363
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:43,660
after I talked to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> life insurance guy</font>

364
00:11:40,780 --> 00:11:45,850
holy cow these<font color="#CCCCCC"> CSOs and these directors</font>

365
00:11:43,660 --> 00:11:47,140
of security<font color="#E5E5E5"> were totally using scenarios</font>

366
00:11:45,850 --> 00:11:49,660
the entire time<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they weren't just</font>

367
00:11:47,140 --> 00:11:51,970
using scenarios from the industry<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

368
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:53,980
were picking people in the executive<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

369
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:56,650
executive team so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> had a team</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

370
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:58,390
five people said the CFO was there it

371
00:11:56,650 --> 00:12:00,130
would be CFO you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tom he's a guy</font>

372
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:02,350
that sends out the funny emails<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay you</font>

373
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:03,640
know that guy you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have one he sends out</font>

374
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,620
the funny email or what not even though

375
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,390
may or may not be work appropriate he

376
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:09,370
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> that guy in that little group</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

377
00:12:07,390 --> 00:12:11,380
so he used him as an example about how

378
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:13,570
hey what if somebody else sent out a

379
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:14,770
funny email on your behalf wouldn't

380
00:12:13,570 --> 00:12:17,770
everybody open it because they're used

381
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:19,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">to that from you he built off that to do</font>

382
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:21,670
a whole case on why they needed<font color="#E5E5E5"> a leak</font>

383
00:12:19,930 --> 00:12:23,739
prevention all from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one simple</font>

384
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:25,900
example but because it was a scenario

385
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:27,880
that was related<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the environment he</font>

386
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:29,560
was in he had everybody's attention

387
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:31,870
everybody understood it and it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

388
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:32,920
simple<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay and life insurance is the</font>

389
00:12:31,870 --> 00:12:35,140
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing when they're talking about</font>

390
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:36,699
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know oh you're going to die in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 25</font>

391
00:12:35,140 --> 00:12:38,260
years<font color="#CCCCCC"> or whatnot is your kids going to</font>

392
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:41,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">be safe there using scenarios that are</font>

393
00:12:38,260 --> 00:12:42,520
directly linked to your life and yet we

394
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:44,109
saw presentations where they would say

395
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:46,720
you know in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the university sector</font>

396
00:12:44,110 --> 00:12:48,490
Cornell College has this type of risk

397
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,530
exposure and this is a different

398
00:12:48,490 --> 00:12:52,150
University and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> csos using a</font>

399
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:53,620
different universities risk profile to

400
00:12:52,150 --> 00:12:55,990
explain why they should invest in his

401
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:59,140
project totally not linked<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

402
00:12:55,990 --> 00:13:00,550
business at all okay now you're also not

403
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:01,930
a salesperson no but you end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> having</font>

404
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:04,120
to sell security to a degree which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

405
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:06,459
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> because most engineers don't</font>

406
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:08,290
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> be salespeople and also you have</font>

407
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:09,940
been educated on how to communicate no

408
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:10,490
security courses or class talk about

409
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,920
communicate

410
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:14,660
at all no matter<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> University you're</font>

411
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:16,670
in they don't explain how to make

412
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:19,640
complex things simple so you have all

413
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:20,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">these</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different pieces here and so what</font>

414
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:22,490
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wrap up with and actually go</font>

415
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:24,410
to question because I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as I've</font>

416
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:25,700
talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> with people mostly everybody has</font>

417
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:28,160
questions rather than just listening to

418
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:29,600
me a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> key things came</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out of this</font>

419
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:31,699
data<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we're going to be releasing a</font>

420
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">40 page report on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this with really</font>

421
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:35,510
detailed data in about two months from

422
00:13:34,100 --> 00:13:37,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">information week so you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go ahead and</font>

423
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:40,250
look for that this is kind of like a

424
00:13:37,370 --> 00:13:41,510
precursor to<font color="#E5E5E5"> it so the first question we</font>

425
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,670
asked you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to ask yourself is how do</font>

426
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:45,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">you use industry data if it is in</font>

427
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:46,880
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you show an executive or</font>

428
00:13:45,470 --> 00:13:48,529
anybody that makes a decision you're

429
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,620
you're doing it wrong plain and simple

430
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:53,689
ok industry data is number one mechanism

431
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:55,700
we found that people throw<font color="#CCCCCC"> out your case</font>

432
00:13:53,690 --> 00:13:57,529
of why it's actually important because

433
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:59,540
they immediately like I said it's not us

434
00:13:57,529 --> 00:14:00,890
we're not them we're not a<font color="#E5E5E5"> part of the</font>

435
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:03,110
industry we're different we're better or

436
00:14:00,890 --> 00:14:05,180
whatever and so they take entry data

437
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:06,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">just they just ignore you but where</font>

438
00:14:05,180 --> 00:14:08,510
industry data is important isn't

439
00:14:06,830 --> 00:14:09,950
actually helping you prioritize what

440
00:14:08,510 --> 00:14:12,020
your concern should be so keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> them in</font>

441
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:13,220
your cube keep them in your office<font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

442
00:14:12,020 --> 00:14:15,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">you're dealing with things in your team</font>

443
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,700
you know that's what industry data is

444
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:18,890
important but you don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use it</font>

445
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:20,930
as your communication tool do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you relate</font>

446
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:24,110
every security to a business objective

447
00:14:20,930 --> 00:14:25,459
we had a bank<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I talked with great</font>

448
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:27,020
example yet he had<font color="#E5E5E5"> wanted to roll out</font>

449
00:14:25,459 --> 00:14:29,329
automated patch management there's going

450
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:31,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">to be a very very very large project and</font>

451
00:14:29,329 --> 00:14:33,020
a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> long time from a resource</font>

452
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:34,610
perspective he had gotten pushed back

453
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,649
and things like that from his initial

454
00:14:34,610 --> 00:14:39,320
talks he did two things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> were pretty</font>

455
00:14:36,649 --> 00:14:42,170
interesting first he changed the way he

456
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:43,640
decided to communicate the actual

457
00:14:42,170 --> 00:14:45,620
message completely he said you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

458
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:48,110
I looked at her business objectives and

459
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:49,910
we want to open<font color="#CCCCCC"> four branches you know</font>

460
00:14:48,110 --> 00:14:52,160
every couple of months for the next X

461
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:53,990
number of years and we just heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> back</font>

462
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,060
from the Fed who's going to be auditing

463
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:57,560
us that if we don't fix some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these</font>

464
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:59,119
issues that they may put an injunction

465
00:14:57,560 --> 00:15:02,119
for our capability to actually open her

466
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:05,089
branches<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what the Fed was</font>

467
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:06,200
looking at was XYZ and why was the fact

468
00:15:05,089 --> 00:15:08,959
that her patches aren't up to date

469
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:10,070
because our guys are overworked so what

470
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:12,170
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is I want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to implement this</font>

471
00:15:10,070 --> 00:15:13,940
program which solves<font color="#CCCCCC"> y which means the</font>

472
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:16,969
feds happy which means we open our four

473
00:15:13,940 --> 00:15:18,860
branches<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay he served the conversation</font>

474
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:21,140
like that it's a completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

475
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:22,000
way than talking about oh my gosh you

476
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,800
know

477
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,000
rampant malware out there is infecting

478
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,620
machines that don't have patches the

479
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:29,380
average patch latency in a business is

480
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:32,560
40 days blah blah blah totally different

481
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:34,420
<font color="#CCCCCC">way and completely change it now this</font>

482
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,790
gentleman<font color="#E5E5E5"> although a great you know</font>

483
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:38,650
presentation and whatnot he didn't get

484
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:40,449
<font color="#E5E5E5">the idea to do all that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> himself</font>

485
00:15:38,650 --> 00:15:43,240
the person you actually talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to is the</font>

486
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:44,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">VP of Marketing ok we saw this is</font>

487
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,170
another<font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting trend that we saw is</font>

488
00:15:44,530 --> 00:15:48,699
those were<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the top of their game from</font>

489
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:50,680
a security perspective leveraged other

490
00:15:48,700 --> 00:15:52,390
people in the business to<font color="#CCCCCC"> help with</font>

491
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:54,430
their case so in this case we've

492
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:56,500
actually saw a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> CSOs who use</font>

493
00:15:54,430 --> 00:15:58,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">marketing people to say hey can you take</font>

494
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">my look at my presentation and see if</font>

495
00:15:58,030 --> 00:16:01,150
there's any way you could simplify it

496
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:03,430
that's what marketing people do right

497
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:05,709
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> take a complex thing simplify it so</font>

498
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:07,599
people will buy<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and that helped him</font>

499
00:16:05,710 --> 00:16:10,120
simplify his proposition and simplify

500
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:13,150
his scenarios when he went to position

501
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:14,860
this project second thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we are</font>

502
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:17,079
<font color="#CCCCCC">third thing that we saw was reduced risk</font>

503
00:16:14,860 --> 00:16:18,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok everybody seems to focus on risk</font>

504
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:20,110
whether they're doing a quantitative

505
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:22,300
approach with numbers and metrics with

506
00:16:20,110 --> 00:16:23,680
impact and probability etc or they're

507
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:26,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">just doing a red green yellow high</font>

508
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:28,270
medium low approach all of those that

509
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:31,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">use of risk as their main communication</font>

510
00:16:28,270 --> 00:16:32,770
metric again that the executive teams<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

511
00:16:31,270 --> 00:16:34,900
management didn't seem to listen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to well</font>

512
00:16:32,770 --> 00:16:36,699
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay what really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was important was that</font>

513
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:38,770
the fact that the risk was high medium

514
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:40,390
or low<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't too much of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a concern it's</font>

515
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:42,579
the probability of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that risk that really</font>

516
00:16:40,390 --> 00:16:44,170
matters to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the organization is this</font>

517
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:46,300
going to happen tomorrow we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

518
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:48,370
going to happen<font color="#CCCCCC"> in three years</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and many</font>

519
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,839
times we saw pretty strategic projects

520
00:16:48,370 --> 00:16:51,940
when they'd go and they look at the risk

521
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:54,250
the strategic project wasn't necessarily

522
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:56,050
solving a high-risk item may be a medium

523
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:57,490
or low res item but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was a high</font>

524
00:16:56,050 --> 00:16:59,920
probability item of it actually

525
00:16:57,490 --> 00:17:01,089
occurring so the situation<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I have</font>

526
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,550
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about is you know if you have a</font>

527
00:17:01,089 --> 00:17:05,350
low probability item and or high

528
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:07,329
probability item that's medium to low

529
00:17:05,349 --> 00:17:08,169
risk you get a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> those you</font>

530
00:17:07,329 --> 00:17:10,599
immediately have a very high risk

531
00:17:08,170 --> 00:17:13,449
situation<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so focus on probability</font>

532
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:15,520
lastly your numbers are a point in<font color="#E5E5E5"> time</font>

533
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:17,110
they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> show those internal trends so</font>

534
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:19,150
when you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at those repeatable</font>

535
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:21,369
measurements like I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mentioned if you can</font>

536
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:23,050
easily trend those before you're even

537
00:17:21,369 --> 00:17:25,869
talking to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the executive management team</font>

538
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:27,669
you'll completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> discredit any</font>

539
00:17:25,869 --> 00:17:29,290
arguments they have of saying well that

540
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:31,060
just was because of last week's you know

541
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:32,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">rushed orders or that was because of</font>

542
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:34,780
this so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can start trending some</font>

543
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:35,350
things and lastly we saw a pretty

544
00:17:34,780 --> 00:17:39,639
<font color="#CCCCCC">interesting</font>

545
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:41,949
which was if you have IT involved in any

546
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,929
strategic planning meetings and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> TS</font>

547
00:17:41,950 --> 00:17:46,960
heading any projects they ended up

548
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:48,429
failing<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so let me let me clarify</font>

549
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,500
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Larry month is if it was a</font>

550
00:17:48,429 --> 00:17:52,179
strategic project an IT was actually

551
00:17:50,500 --> 00:17:53,470
spearheading it meaning managing<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

552
00:17:52,179 --> 00:17:55,750
meetings getting involved because I d

553
00:17:53,470 --> 00:17:58,150
had a vested interest in it it<font color="#CCCCCC"> usually</font>

554
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:59,740
just fell<font color="#CCCCCC"> on its face what we saw</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

555
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:01,480
company as implementing committees

556
00:17:59,740 --> 00:18:03,370
usually have say three to five people

557
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:06,370
where the business<font color="#CCCCCC"> was all involved</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> nor</font>

558
00:18:03,370 --> 00:18:07,870
was one IT person and he translated from

559
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:10,360
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> business speak to the tech speak</font>

560
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:12,129
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay and that's all he</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> did was just</font>

561
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:14,500
translate things now IT had great

562
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:16,870
involvement and reward out of these

563
00:18:14,500 --> 00:18:18,010
programs but by having the business

564
00:18:16,870 --> 00:18:19,658
making majority of decisions and

565
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:22,059
spending most their time educating the

566
00:18:19,659 --> 00:18:24,640
business those projects never got

567
00:18:22,059 --> 00:18:26,590
unfunded we're much more successful and

568
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,929
usually we're adopted by the business as

569
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:30,639
acceptable safe practices as opposed to

570
00:18:28,929 --> 00:18:34,750
look at the Gestapo coming in on me

571
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:37,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to do something</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's it</font>

572
00:18:34,750 --> 00:18:38,530
all i had for a last piece there<font color="#E5E5E5"> i said</font>

573
00:18:37,419 --> 00:18:41,049
before there's going to be a lot more

574
00:18:38,530 --> 00:18:43,149
information<font color="#E5E5E5"> forthcoming we found lots of</font>

575
00:18:41,049 --> 00:18:45,668
interesting data also<font color="#E5E5E5"> on what metrics</font>

576
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:47,230
were very successful<font color="#CCCCCC"> too so do look out</font>

577
00:18:45,669 --> 00:18:53,730
for that report but any questions at all

578
00:18:47,230 --> 00:18:53,730
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a high level thank you</font>

579
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:11,159
so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> question was you have accuracy</font>

580
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:12,240
and probability and you know those two

581
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:15,090
together can be difficult to<font color="#E5E5E5"> measure</font>

582
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:16,290
over time and be accurate on right and

583
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:18,209
so what we saw is actually it's all

584
00:19:16,290 --> 00:19:20,010
about your internal measurements so what

585
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:21,570
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get you can't control industry</font>

586
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:23,040
data or things outside of it but you

587
00:19:21,570 --> 00:19:25,260
can't control your internal measurements

588
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:27,720
and so when it comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> to probabilities</font>

589
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:30,090
people do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not look at security like they</font>

590
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:31,350
do disaster recovery but they should we

591
00:19:30,090 --> 00:19:33,389
have seen companies simulate fake

592
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:35,399
disasters<font color="#E5E5E5"> fake virus outbreaks etc to</font>

593
00:19:33,390 --> 00:19:37,050
get some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those probability metrics so</font>

594
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:39,630
you want to hey you having an argument

595
00:19:37,050 --> 00:19:41,430
or debate on how probable this is go try

596
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:42,750
it out in a small<font color="#E5E5E5"> segment of the network</font>

597
00:19:41,430 --> 00:19:44,430
and see how probable it actually was

598
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:46,530
that will give you a you know your

599
00:19:44,430 --> 00:19:53,750
information that you need any other

600
00:19:46,530 --> 00:19:53,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">questions at all no oh go ahead</font>

601
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:08,980
examples survey sanitizing me yeah so

602
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:10,570
the question<font color="#CCCCCC"> was the balanced scorecard</font>

603
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,710
approach was there any templates<font color="#E5E5E5"> I saw</font>

604
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:14,740
anything that I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> give back to the</font>

605
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:16,419
community very<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually very on time</font>

606
00:20:14,740 --> 00:20:17,919
point actually had a discussion with the

607
00:20:16,419 --> 00:20:20,830
editor<font color="#CCCCCC"> of information week last week</font>

608
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:22,360
about doing exactly that no nobody in

609
00:20:20,830 --> 00:20:24,129
our survey used the balanced scorecard

610
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:25,689
like I mentioned but a couple<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

611
00:20:24,130 --> 00:20:28,659
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> did interview outside that I</font>

612
00:20:25,690 --> 00:20:30,100
research did we asked them if we could

613
00:20:28,659 --> 00:20:31,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">modify some of those who come</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font>

614
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:33,250
our own so we're probably going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

615
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:34,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">releasing them either with that report</font>

616
00:20:33,250 --> 00:20:36,190
or a supplemental by the end of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> year</font>

617
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,440
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those type of things I</font>

618
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:39,580
personally<font color="#CCCCCC"> within my own IT consultancy</font>

619
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:41,769
business have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> using the balanced</font>

620
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:43,029
scorecard for years I just never blinked

621
00:20:41,769 --> 00:20:45,220
up anything until I started really

622
00:20:43,029 --> 00:20:46,570
diving deep in the survey but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

623
00:20:45,220 --> 00:20:49,600
been implementing something very similar

624
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:50,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">to it for our clients for years so we</font>

625
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:55,350
have some of that too<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we can</font>

626
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:55,350
leverage go ahead

627
00:21:05,670 --> 00:21:09,330
right so the question was a lot of

628
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:11,189
<font color="#E5E5E5">companies are talking about compliance</font>

629
00:21:09,330 --> 00:21:13,620
and how there's difference between being

630
00:21:11,190 --> 00:21:14,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">in complying and being truly secure and</font>

631
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,709
you're a hundred percent<font color="#E5E5E5"> right if the</font>

632
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:18,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">only argument you ever have is does it</font>

633
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:19,950
matter for compliance that that means

634
00:21:18,660 --> 00:21:21,720
you have an immediate education issue

635
00:21:19,950 --> 00:21:23,430
and not an education issue from a

636
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:25,050
security perspective I'm talking about

637
00:21:23,430 --> 00:21:27,570
education of what your value is<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

638
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:28,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">business so when I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talk to a CSO who</font>

639
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:31,590
mentions that to me Mike the only hammer

640
00:21:28,920 --> 00:21:32,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">i have is compliance and of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> course when</font>

641
00:21:31,590 --> 00:21:34,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">you only have one hammer everything</font>

642
00:21:32,250 --> 00:21:35,490
looks like a nail right so if you've met

643
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:37,380
your compliance requirements and you

644
00:21:35,490 --> 00:21:39,990
pass your audit why are you there right

645
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:41,220
and so the question I said back to<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

646
00:21:39,990 --> 00:21:42,630
was what we need to start looking at you

647
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:44,940
from a strategic perspective how does

648
00:21:42,630 --> 00:21:46,950
security help the business so in this

649
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:49,320
place is<font color="#E5E5E5"> case was an actual SAS provider</font>

650
00:21:46,950 --> 00:21:50,910
and I told<font color="#E5E5E5"> them you know what you can</font>

651
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:52,649
start<font color="#E5E5E5"> using marketing or security within</font>

652
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,880
your marketing and start tracking<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

653
00:21:52,650 --> 00:21:55,980
things can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> work with the sales team</font>

654
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:57,540
for example and say hey if we build<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

655
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:59,610
marketing literature about our security

656
00:21:57,540 --> 00:22:02,370
processes can you start tracking if that

657
00:21:59,610 --> 00:22:04,020
helps you close deals<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so over about</font>

658
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:05,760
an eight-month period he went back to

659
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:07,200
the to the board<font color="#CCCCCC"> and said listen we did</font>

660
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,150
a little survey and come to find out we

661
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:11,340
got this really big banking customer

662
00:22:09,150 --> 00:22:12,660
because we open the kimono a little bit

663
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:15,149
about our security processes and they

664
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:16,650
saw what we did and they liked it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so</font>

665
00:22:15,150 --> 00:22:18,960
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> was a thing that led to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

666
00:22:16,650 --> 00:22:20,970
sale so now security<font color="#E5E5E5"> is not just there</font>

667
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,700
as a you know compliance requirement

668
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:25,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">check box it's enabling sales right it's</font>

669
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:27,630
enabling marketing's capability and

670
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:29,340
things like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell people</font>

671
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:31,020
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> always stuck in the forest so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

672
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:33,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">got to step out compliance is a good</font>

673
00:22:31,020 --> 00:22:35,160
thing from an idea perspective because

674
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:37,830
it's supposed to help ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

675
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:39,600
know customers are protected etc etc we

676
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:42,179
seem to lose sight of that sometimes<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

677
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:43,500
most of the reasons why consumers like

678
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:45,210
compliance requirements is<font color="#E5E5E5"> its</font>

679
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,680
protecting them yet we don't tell

680
00:22:45,210 --> 00:22:49,620
consumers how we're protecting them

681
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:51,210
right and things like that<font color="#CCCCCC"> so I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would</font>

682
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,320
say you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look take a step back</font>

683
00:22:51,210 --> 00:22:53,550
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> look at what are the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things</font>

684
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:56,280
are important to the business<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font>

685
00:22:53,550 --> 00:22:59,280
can do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can help</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> them here's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> another</font>

686
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:01,500
great example to not to get too

687
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,700
long-winded but they had an issue with

688
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:05,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">salespeople leaving the organization</font>

689
00:23:02,700 --> 00:23:08,430
stealing customers so they went<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and</font>

690
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:10,320
he sold<font color="#E5E5E5"> a DLP email archiving project to</font>

691
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:11,790
management because they allow them to

692
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,860
print<font color="#E5E5E5"> out exactly what the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> salespeople</font>

693
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:15,540
were<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing before they left to prove in</font>

694
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:19,199
court or not whether they actually stole

695
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:19,450
sales list<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay to that business that</font>

696
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:23,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">was</font>

697
00:23:19,450 --> 00:23:24,549
very important right now he had 15 other

698
00:23:23,019 --> 00:23:26,380
issues why dlp was interesting to him

699
00:23:24,549 --> 00:23:28,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">but those were</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the ones that he</font>

700
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:30,850
leveraged from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> business perspective</font>

701
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:32,260
and wide<font color="#E5E5E5"> the business bought in so all</font>

702
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:33,428
right I'm good guys hearing more

703
00:23:32,260 --> 00:23:36,510
questions you can come see me<font color="#CCCCCC"> offstage</font>

704
00:23:33,429 --> 00:23:36,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">thank you for your time</font>
