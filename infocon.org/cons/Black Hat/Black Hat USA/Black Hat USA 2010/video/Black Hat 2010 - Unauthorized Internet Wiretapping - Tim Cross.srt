for coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> here my talk this morning can</font>

everyone hear me okay little<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh let me</font>

9
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:36,809
move this up how's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that better better</font>

10
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:39,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so um what do I start</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright so</font>

11
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:42,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm here to talk about lawful intercept</font>

systems in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet and security</font>

13
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,910
issues with them so a lawful intercept

14
00:00:45,149 --> 00:00:51,300
is 0 is a wiretap it's a it's a lawfully

15
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:53,370
authorized wiretap and there's there's

16
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:57,239
been this debate that's been going on

17
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:59,459
for I would say<font color="#E5E5E5"> as much as 30 years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now</font>

18
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:01,739
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how the telecommunications</font>

19
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:06,420
infrastructure of the future will work

20
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:08,729
regarding the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ability for law</font>

21
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:12,600
enforcement to perform surveillance of

22
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:17,220
suspected criminals and the the debate

23
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:18,658
is sort of defined but belief that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

24
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,650
sort of surveillance is either going to

25
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:24,930
be easy well you're either going to have

26
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">an encryption and there's really not</font>

27
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:30,509
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a way to do any surveillance</font>

28
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:33,240
or we're actually going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be building</font>

29
00:01:30,509 --> 00:01:35,790
infrastructure into the internet<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

30
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,919
enables surveillance and so if we're

31
00:01:35,790 --> 00:01:39,930
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look up or you know and so</font>

32
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:43,890
there's been all these different sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

33
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:48,030
salvos in this debate one of the first

34
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:50,850
was the the per chip and you heard<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

35
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">it from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Moxie earlier if you were in his</font>

36
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,619
talk he kind of teed up a couple of the

37
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:57,329
topics<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm going to discuss so you</font>

38
00:01:55,619 --> 00:01:58,920
know the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Clipper Chip was an encryption</font>

39
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:00,600
system that had a back door so the

40
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,880
government<font color="#CCCCCC"> if lawfully authorized could</font>

41
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,350
listen to your communications and one of

42
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,979
the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that happen to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the Clipper</font>

43
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:10,889
Chip is in fact the crypto system was

44
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:12,660
proven to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be weak and so as a</font>

45
00:02:10,889 --> 00:02:13,890
consequence someone might be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

46
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:19,140
access<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

47
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:21,059
the data without authorization there's

48
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:24,540
at about the same time this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is from the</font>

49
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:27,780
early 1990s the United States law called

00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:32,299
the communications assistance for what

51
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:32,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay we're going to switch</font>

52
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:52,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay can you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hear me now sounds louder</font>

53
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright so there was this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the United</font>

54
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:55,290
States services communications

assistance for law enforcement act and

56
00:02:55,290 --> 00:02:58,200
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it said is that if you were</font>

57
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:00,780
building telecommunications

58
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:03,660
infrastructure you had to create

59
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:06,209
facilities that allowed law enforcement

60
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:09,690
to access the content<font color="#E5E5E5"> on your network</font>

61
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:11,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the impetus for this was that at</font>

62
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:13,709
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> time telecommunication systems were</font>

63
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:16,260
getting more<font color="#E5E5E5"> and more complicated and so</font>

64
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:18,360
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> idea of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> simply wiretapping by using</font>

65
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,470
alligator clips was becoming out modded

00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they knew that that was going to</font>

67
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:24,300
continue<font color="#E5E5E5"> to happen in the future so that</font>

68
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,580
they wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to sort of require that the</font>

69
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:30,480
phone companies to build in a way for

70
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:32,760
them to do this the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kalia has parallels</font>

71
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,109
in other places in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world and that's</font>

72
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:38,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to be important as I as I go</font>

73
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:40,709
through this discussion in 2005 the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FCC</font>

74
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:43,500
ruled that Kalia applies to broadband

75
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:46,290
internet providers so<font color="#E5E5E5"> originally when</font>

76
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:47,820
Kalia was passed there was this there

77
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:50,459
was this compromise that said<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

78
00:03:47,820 --> 00:03:53,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet services were not covered but</font>

79
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:54,810
over time they don't know it's somewhat

80
00:03:53,579 --> 00:03:57,150
of a reversal it's not a complete

81
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:58,079
reversal<font color="#E5E5E5"> but they decided</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that broadband</font>

82
00:03:57,150 --> 00:03:59,760
internet providers were

83
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:02,820
telecommunications companies and so they

84
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:05,040
had to comply with<font color="#CCCCCC"> colio so that that</font>

85
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,570
brings us so originally<font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of the</font>

86
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,870
Kalia equipment had to do with wire

87
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:12,570
tapping telephones but you know if we

88
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:14,160
have to if we have to comply with Kalia

89
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:16,140
in the internet that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we need to</font>

90
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:18,089
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet wiretapping infrastructure</font>

91
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:23,490
and that's how we get to this discussion

92
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:26,489
the IETF published in rfcs RFC 2804 i

93
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:28,289
think it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the year 2000 about the</font>

94
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:30,360
concept of<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet wiretapping</font>

95
00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:33,060
infrastructure and whether ietf

96
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:35,370
standards should take internet wire

97
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,260
tapping into account and their their

98
00:04:35,370 --> 00:04:38,610
<font color="#E5E5E5">argument was that they should</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not and</font>

99
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:41,219
there's a bunch of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different reasons</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

100
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:43,590
<font color="#CCCCCC">that but one of the arguments relates to</font>

101
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:47,550
that thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I said before that that</font>

102
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:49,260
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bifurcation in this debate where</font>

103
00:04:47,550 --> 00:04:50,580
you think that wiretapping is either

104
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:51,560
going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be easy or it's going to be</font>

105
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:53,330
impossible

106
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,400
either going to have end end encryption

107
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:58,430
where you can't do any wiretapping or

108
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:59,388
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're you're not going to have any</font>

109
00:04:58,430 --> 00:05:00,800
you're not going to have enough

110
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:02,389
encryption and so there's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a</font>

111
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,710
place where<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's easy to hook up and do</font>

112
00:05:02,389 --> 00:05:07,280
wiretapping and so you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

113
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:10,130
infrastructure to support that the other

114
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,539
thing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ITF said is that the</font>

115
00:05:10,130 --> 00:05:13,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet should be free from security</font>

116
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:15,169
loopholes and there's a concern<font color="#CCCCCC"> that if</font>

117
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:17,090
they build wiretapping capabilities into

118
00:05:15,169 --> 00:05:18,469
the internet that they could represent a

119
00:05:17,090 --> 00:05:22,489
security weakness that could be

120
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:25,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">exploited by somebody so in having said</font>

121
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:27,050
all of this the ITF also said that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

122
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:28,669
you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to do this if you're going</font>

123
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:30,169
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet wiretapping</font>

124
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:32,450
infrastructure that you should publish

125
00:05:30,169 --> 00:05:34,190
the details of your architecture so that

126
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:36,260
people can peer review it from a

127
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:37,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">security perspective and this makes a</font>

128
00:05:36,260 --> 00:05:40,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">lot of sense if you consider the fact</font>

129
00:05:37,729 --> 00:05:44,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">that all of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the protocols that underlie</font>

130
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:46,340
the internet are all public documents

00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:48,919
they're all<font color="#E5E5E5"> ITF rfcs that you can go</font>

132
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:51,229
download and read anyone can understand

133
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:54,109
how the internet works and so if there

134
00:05:51,229 --> 00:05:55,880
was some secret mechanism that there was

135
00:05:54,110 --> 00:05:57,500
being used<font color="#E5E5E5"> for wiretapping in the</font>

00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:24,109
intercept an IP networks<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco had to</font>

145
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:25,969
create this architecture because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font>

146
00:06:24,110 --> 00:06:27,710
have customers who are<font color="#E5E5E5"> forced to comply</font>

147
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:29,210
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Kalia and other similar laws in</font>

148
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:31,310
other countries and so they have to

149
00:06:29,210 --> 00:06:33,950
introduce wiretapping infrastructure

150
00:06:31,310 --> 00:06:36,500
into their internet systems and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco</font>

151
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:40,039
came up with an approach and they

152
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:41,630
published it in this RFC<font color="#CCCCCC"> and basically</font>

153
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:43,909
so that their approaches loosely based

154
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:45,620
on an architecture which was<font color="#CCCCCC"> defined by</font>

155
00:06:43,910 --> 00:06:49,220
the European telecommunications

156
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:52,940
standards Institute for wiretapping it's

157
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:54,320
an SNMP v3 based interface that allows

158
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:56,389
you to<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a myth that you can</font>

159
00:06:54,320 --> 00:07:01,909
<font color="#E5E5E5">access that allows you to provision a</font>

160
00:06:56,389 --> 00:07:03,140
wiretap it so one of the reasons<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

161
00:07:01,909 --> 00:07:05,000
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IETF said that you should publish</font>

162
00:07:03,140 --> 00:07:05,330
these architectures is so that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

163
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,370
peer

164
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:09,830
review them for security reasons and so

165
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:11,030
that's what essentially<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to do</font>

166
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:13,039
in its talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm going to look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at this</font>

167
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:14,659
architecture and and consider some of

168
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,818
<font color="#E5E5E5">its security properties and i think that</font>

169
00:07:14,659 --> 00:07:18,889
there there are properties of this

170
00:07:16,819 --> 00:07:21,080
architecture that are not as secure as i

171
00:07:18,889 --> 00:07:23,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">think they should be and so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i have some</font>

172
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:27,530
input about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how I would design this if</font>

173
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:29,388
you ask me so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first thing I'm going</font>

174
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:32,388
to do is I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to explain</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how this</font>

175
00:07:29,389 --> 00:07:33,860
architecture works so here's the overall

176
00:07:32,389 --> 00:07:37,219
architectural diagram which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I pasted</font>

00:07:33,860 --> 00:07:39,590
right in from<font color="#CCCCCC"> there RFC the thing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> over</font>

180
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,870
blocks in this diagram are actual

<font color="#E5E5E5">network devices and some of these blocks</font>

182
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:49,340
are groups of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people the l EA is a group</font>

they get lawful authorization to do it

186
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:57,319
and they go to this thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> called the Li</font>

00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:18,800
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> these guys will do is they'll take</font>

201
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:30,800
it is in fact lawful and then they'll go

202
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:33,169
in the provision the wiretap<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was</font>

they provision the wiretap using this

00:08:38,089 --> 00:08:41,630
thing called a mediation device the

207
00:08:40,159 --> 00:08:43,069
mediation device is in the center of

208
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:45,680
this diagram<font color="#CCCCCC"> and as you can see it's</font>

209
00:08:43,070 --> 00:08:47,899
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the architectural core of this</font>

lawful intercept system the mediation

211
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:53,690
device goes out and sends messages such

212
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:55,550
as this snmpv3 message to devices that

213
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:57,260
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually do the wiretapping and then</font>

214
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:59,240
it collects the results of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that wiretap</font>

215
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:01,730
and packages it and provides it to the

00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:03,019
law enforcement<font color="#CCCCCC"> agency there are a bunch</font>

mediation devices that interoperate with

00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:10,790
cisco routers and and support the cisco

220
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:13,279
architecture for lawful intercept and

221
00:09:10,790 --> 00:09:14,719
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> this picture is just a it's from</font>

00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:15,980
the marketing material from variant

223
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:18,740
which is one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the companies</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that makes</font>

these mediation devices

225
00:09:18,740 --> 00:09:26,209
so there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are two I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ap's in this diagram</font>

227
00:09:26,209 --> 00:09:31,369
point that the there's two kinds of them

228
00:09:29,510 --> 00:09:35,480
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this represents sort of the</font>

229
00:09:31,370 --> 00:09:37,520
historical concept in in most Western

230
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:39,140
legal systems that there's a difference

231
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:41,810
between collecting content and

232
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:43,760
collecting addressing information the

233
00:09:41,810 --> 00:09:46,310
most ancient kind of telecommunications

234
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:47,959
is is a letter a letter has an envelope

235
00:09:46,310 --> 00:09:50,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">with an address</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on the outside and so a</font>

236
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:52,339
postman could easily see who your

237
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:53,540
mailing letters to but in order to read

238
00:09:52,339 --> 00:09:55,640
the content<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to go to the</font>

239
00:09:53,540 --> 00:09:57,469
trouble of steaming the envelope open in

240
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:59,089
order to in order to read it and so most

241
00:09:57,470 --> 00:10:01,370
legal systems over a long period of time

242
00:09:59,089 --> 00:10:04,100
have developed this idea that in order

243
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:05,899
for the police<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see addressing</font>

you're emailing that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a sort of a</font>

246
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:12,140
light amount of lawful authorization

high level<font color="#CCCCCC"> of suspicion they don't have</font>

249
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:17,390
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a lot of documentation but there</font>

250
00:10:16,010 --> 00:10:19,790
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> some process that they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to go</font>

00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:20,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">through but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not as heavy weight as</font>

the content is more carefully protected

and so that actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> ends up being</font>

256
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:31,970
reflected in this technical architecture

257
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:34,279
there are two kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of intercept access</font>

258
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:37,190
points the IRI intercept access point

259
00:10:34,279 --> 00:10:38,779
can only collect it's a specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> device</font>

260
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:42,050
designed only to collect header

261
00:10:38,779 --> 00:10:43,970
information or outing information for

262
00:10:42,050 --> 00:10:45,529
cases where these guys only have the

263
00:10:43,970 --> 00:10:50,149
lawful authority to collect that kind of

264
00:10:45,529 --> 00:10:51,860
data the content<font color="#E5E5E5"> I a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> pee</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it can collect</font>

279
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:29,329
can find it fairly easily by googling

289
00:11:45,079 --> 00:11:50,388
collected they can specify the address

290
00:11:46,939 --> 00:11:52,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">and port number of the of the</font>

291
00:11:50,389 --> 00:11:55,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">destination host what transport and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll</font>

292
00:11:52,819 --> 00:11:56,599
talk in more detail about that and

293
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,600
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not notification is enabled</font>

294
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:04,670
so there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of flexibility in this</font>

295
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:06,170
in this architecture so what let's take

296
00:12:04,670 --> 00:12:07,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">a step back from this whole thing and</font>

297
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:09,050
ask ourselves like what are the

298
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:10,670
different security issues you would need

299
00:12:09,050 --> 00:12:13,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">to think about if you were building</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

300
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:14,779
wiretapping system the first thing you

301
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:17,629
would want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is prevent the subject</font>

302
00:12:14,779 --> 00:12:22,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">from discovering the surveillance so in</font>

303
00:12:17,629 --> 00:12:23,629
the in the RFC that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco published they</font>

304
00:12:22,069 --> 00:12:25,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">described</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the fact that they don't add</font>

305
00:12:23,629 --> 00:12:26,959
additional hops to a trace route for

306
00:12:25,550 --> 00:12:28,998
example to make it obvious that there's

307
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:31,099
a new device in the network they built

308
00:12:28,999 --> 00:12:34,309
it into the router that's already there

309
00:12:31,100 --> 00:12:36,259
some people have have asked you know

310
00:12:34,309 --> 00:12:37,819
whether enabling this<font color="#E5E5E5"> interface would</font>

311
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:39,980
have a performance impact in the router

312
00:12:37,819 --> 00:12:41,149
and I wasn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to study that but it's</font>

313
00:12:39,980 --> 00:12:43,220
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting question if you could</font>

314
00:12:41,149 --> 00:12:44,990
observe that the network performance of

315
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:46,369
slow today that might mean that<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

316
00:12:44,990 --> 00:12:48,290
wiretapping but it could mean something

317
00:12:46,369 --> 00:12:49,759
else too so I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> how reliable</font>

318
00:12:48,290 --> 00:12:52,399
that would be as a method of detecting

319
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:54,350
the presence of this another thing that

320
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:56,059
the you know you need to think about if

321
00:12:54,350 --> 00:12:58,040
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> designing a wiretapping system is</font>

322
00:12:56,059 --> 00:13:00,170
preventing the subject<font color="#E5E5E5"> from manipulating</font>

323
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:01,429
the surveillance so there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

324
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:03,259
interesting paper called the

325
00:13:01,429 --> 00:13:05,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">eavesdroppers dilemma that Matt blaze</font>

326
00:13:03,259 --> 00:13:07,249
wrote and published I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think a couple</font>

327
00:13:05,329 --> 00:13:10,878
<font color="#CCCCCC">years ago they talked about the subject</font>

328
00:13:07,249 --> 00:13:12,949
if you're if you suspect<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're</font>

329
00:13:10,879 --> 00:13:14,179
being wired<font color="#CCCCCC"> so so let me let me explain</font>

330
00:13:12,949 --> 00:13:18,229
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other perspective if you're</font>

331
00:13:14,179 --> 00:13:20,240
wiretapping somebody and if you they

332
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:22,220
send a packet for example with a bad

333
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,259
checksum you can do one of two things

334
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:26,029
with it you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> either throw it out</font>

335
00:13:24,259 --> 00:13:27,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">because you think that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the end host is</font>

336
00:13:26,029 --> 00:13:29,869
not going to is also going to throw it

337
00:13:27,679 --> 00:13:31,850
out or you can include<font color="#E5E5E5"> it with the</font>

338
00:13:29,869 --> 00:13:33,079
content that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've collected because do</font>

339
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:35,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">you think that the end hosts might</font>

340
00:13:33,079 --> 00:13:38,089
actually interpret it and so that that

341
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,199
<font color="#E5E5E5">gives the the subject a couple of</font>

342
00:13:38,089 --> 00:13:41,660
different options<font color="#CCCCCC"> if they want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

343
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:43,669
confuse you if you're collecting packets

344
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:45,139
with bad checksums they can send a whole

345
00:13:43,669 --> 00:13:46,970
bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those in addition to the</font>

346
00:13:45,139 --> 00:13:48,980
real messages that they're sending and

347
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:50,299
those additional messages that are

348
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:52,670
transmitting that aren't being received

349
00:13:50,299 --> 00:13:54,019
by the receiver might confuse the person

350
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:57,229
performing the surveillance as to what's

351
00:13:54,019 --> 00:13:58,699
being discussed<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the other hand</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font>

352
00:13:57,230 --> 00:14:01,549
decide you're going to throw out packets

353
00:13:58,699 --> 00:14:02,809
with a bad checksum then the the guy

354
00:14:01,549 --> 00:14:04,339
who's being surveilled to needle<font color="#CCCCCC"> e</font>

355
00:14:02,809 --> 00:14:06,079
configure the computer on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the other end</font>

356
00:14:04,339 --> 00:14:07,009
to accept packets with bad check sums

357
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:09,589
and he can send all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> his</font>

358
00:14:07,009 --> 00:14:11,809
communications with bad<font color="#E5E5E5"> check sums and</font>

359
00:14:09,589 --> 00:14:13,730
you know he'll be completely invisible

360
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:16,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">to your surveillance so that's a that's</font>

361
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:18,019
a difficult problem and you know they're

362
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:19,819
there there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of other research</font>

363
00:14:18,019 --> 00:14:21,559
out there that discusses it the other

364
00:14:19,819 --> 00:14:24,290
thing that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be concerned with</font>

365
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:25,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">is unauthorized use of the wiretapping</font>

366
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:28,669
system your building and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

367
00:14:25,669 --> 00:14:31,069
what this talk is about you need to

368
00:14:28,669 --> 00:14:33,589
prevent people who don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have permission</font>

369
00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:35,179
<font color="#CCCCCC">from provisioning wiretaps</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but you and</font>

370
00:14:33,589 --> 00:14:36,829
you also need to make<font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that those</font>

371
00:14:35,179 --> 00:14:38,540
who<font color="#E5E5E5"> do have permission are only</font>

372
00:14:36,829 --> 00:14:40,878
collecting the information that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

373
00:14:38,540 --> 00:14:42,230
authorized to collect that second thing

374
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:45,079
there's a technical term<font color="#CCCCCC"> for it which is</font>

375
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:46,609
minimization and those two things are

376
00:14:45,079 --> 00:14:47,599
really the subject of this talk and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

377
00:14:46,609 --> 00:14:49,819
want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sure that's clear because</font>

378
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,369
in the last time I gave this some<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

379
00:14:49,819 --> 00:14:54,709
didn't understand that this talk is

380
00:14:52,369 --> 00:14:59,269
about gaining unauthorized access this

381
00:14:54,709 --> 00:15:00,410
is black hat so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a network map to</font>

382
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:01,970
try to give<font color="#CCCCCC"> you more of a real-world</font>

383
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:05,419
<font color="#E5E5E5">picture of how this is going to look</font>

384
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:06,919
this is an ISP network there's an edge

385
00:15:05,419 --> 00:15:09,230
router down here that's providing

386
00:15:06,919 --> 00:15:11,600
service to a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of customers it's an</font>

387
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:13,100
intercept access point and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then there's</font>

388
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,569
a service<font color="#E5E5E5"> provider management network</font>

389
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,879
that hopefully is firewalled off from

390
00:15:14,569 --> 00:15:17,929
the rest of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ISPs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Network and in it</font>

391
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:20,119
you've got a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of computers</font>

392
00:15:17,929 --> 00:15:23,269
including an SNMP management host and

393
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:26,119
mediation device that or you're using to

394
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:28,039
operate the surveillance system so this

395
00:15:26,119 --> 00:15:30,289
<font color="#CCCCCC">is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things are supposed to work the</font>

396
00:15:28,039 --> 00:15:32,239
mediation device would send SNMP v3

397
00:15:30,289 --> 00:15:34,519
interception requests through the

398
00:15:32,239 --> 00:15:36,289
network to the edge router and provision

399
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:38,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">a wiretap and then the wiretap would</font>

400
00:15:36,289 --> 00:15:40,549
flow back across<font color="#CCCCCC"> that red link there</font>

401
00:15:38,299 --> 00:15:42,079
from the router to the mediation device

402
00:15:40,549 --> 00:15:45,649
which would collect it and send it<font color="#E5E5E5"> off</font>

403
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:48,439
to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> law</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> enforcement</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> agency this is an</font>

00:15:48,439 --> 00:15:52,488
<font color="#CCCCCC">on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> internet sends an interception</font>

406
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:54,499
request that same router provisions a

407
00:15:52,489 --> 00:15:56,539
wiretap and has the results<font color="#E5E5E5"> of that</font>

408
00:15:54,499 --> 00:15:58,760
wiretap sent back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to his machine again</font>

409
00:15:56,539 --> 00:16:01,010
out on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet</font>

410
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:02,840
so how do we<font color="#E5E5E5"> do that what we're going to</font>

411
00:16:01,010 --> 00:16:05,180
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is send</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> an unauthorized</font>

412
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:08,090
interception request it's a single

413
00:16:05,180 --> 00:16:11,900
properly authenticated SNMP SNMP v3

414
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:14,060
packet which accesses this tap nib which

415
00:16:11,900 --> 00:16:17,000
as I told you before as is available

416
00:16:14,060 --> 00:16:19,040
online you need to know the correct

417
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:22,400
username and password for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the interface</font>

418
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,439
you also<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to know the SNMP v3 engine</font>

419
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:26,660
ID engine boots and engine time values

420
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:29,870
those values are designed to prevent

421
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:31,550
replay of SNMP v3 transactions and they

422
00:16:29,870 --> 00:16:32,990
are readily avail available from the

423
00:16:31,550 --> 00:16:35,870
router if you're allowed to transact

424
00:16:32,990 --> 00:16:37,880
SNMP with it so it will will tell anyone

425
00:16:35,870 --> 00:16:39,530
what those values are because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're</font>

426
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:41,210
not supposed to be secret and you can

427
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:42,500
share them between house so if you know

428
00:16:41,210 --> 00:16:45,980
them you can tell someone else and they

429
00:16:42,500 --> 00:16:47,720
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use them the attacker would also</font>

430
00:16:45,980 --> 00:16:49,130

about that an encryption might prove to

right<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they probably didn't so I'm</font>

00:17:29,150 --> 00:17:34,700
disclosed in the summer of two thousand

are authenticated with this message

00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:40,939
digest and and so you as the client you

454
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:42,410
calculate the digest you attach<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to</font>

00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:48,500
is to see how<font color="#E5E5E5"> long the message digests</font>

458
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:50,270
you sent was and if it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not 12 bytes</font>

459
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,650
long it's supposed<font color="#CCCCCC"> to throw the packet</font>

460
00:17:50,270 --> 00:17:53,480
out it pretty much says that in black

461
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:56,390
and white in the RFC but a bunch of

462
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:59,870
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't implement that step and so</font>

463
00:17:56,390 --> 00:18:01,520
they set the packet on to the so the

464
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:03,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">next thing they do is the server does is</font>

465
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,420
calculate its own<font color="#CCCCCC"> H Mac for the packet</font>

466
00:18:03,170 --> 00:18:07,820
and then it wants to compare its<font color="#E5E5E5"> H Mac</font>

467
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:09,470
with the HVAC that you send and a lot of

468
00:18:07,820 --> 00:18:11,919
<font color="#E5E5E5">these comparison operations were</font>

469
00:18:09,470 --> 00:18:14,170
implemented as shown they

470
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:16,420
take the packets<font color="#E5E5E5"> H Mac buffer and their</font>

471
00:18:14,170 --> 00:18:19,330
H Mac buffer and they compared using the

472
00:18:16,420 --> 00:18:20,950
link of data that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was in the packet so</font>

473
00:18:19,330 --> 00:18:23,830
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> consequence of that is that if you</font>

474
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:25,600
send a<font color="#E5E5E5"> single bite as long as that one</font>

475
00:18:23,830 --> 00:18:27,730
bite is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same as</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the first bite of</font>

the ballot<font color="#E5E5E5"> H back for the packet your</font>

477
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:32,530
packet is accepted as valid and so

478
00:18:30,340 --> 00:18:35,889
really what you do is you send 256 of

479
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:37,330
these things<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know one for each</font>

480
00:18:35,890 --> 00:18:39,760
possible bite and one of them will be

481
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:41,379
accepted or the other way you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

482
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:43,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">this and it gets more complicated is</font>

483
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:45,460
that the valid<font color="#E5E5E5"> HVAC changes constantly</font>

484
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:47,950
because because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the engine time so</font>

485
00:18:45,460 --> 00:18:49,030
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually send the same bite over</font>

486
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:53,680
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> over and over again and one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

487
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:55,450
packets will be accepted<font color="#E5E5E5"> so as I said</font>

488
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:57,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">this was disclosed in june two thousand</font>

489
00:18:55,450 --> 00:19:00,250
eight<font color="#E5E5E5"> i hope everyone has patched this</font>

490
00:18:57,430 --> 00:19:01,990
but people tend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be slow about</font>

491
00:19:00,250 --> 00:19:04,120
patching routers so you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to take</font>

492
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:05,920
the router down the new version<font color="#E5E5E5"> of iOS</font>

493
00:19:04,120 --> 00:19:07,179
might have a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> new software</font>

494
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,700
features that you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> test on your</font>

495
00:19:07,180 --> 00:19:12,160
network and you know so it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> it can be</font>

496
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:13,390
complicated to deal with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I hope</font>

497
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:14,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">that everyone is patched by now but</font>

498
00:19:13,390 --> 00:19:16,810
there might still be routers out there

499
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:19,989
that aren't patched what's also

500
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:21,700
interesting is that most of the versions

501
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:23,260
of iOS that support this lawful

502
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:25,660
intercept technology were not vulnerable

503
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:27,460
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this particular vulnerability and</font>

504
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:30,550
given<font color="#CCCCCC"> that this vulnerability existed in</font>

505
00:19:27,460 --> 00:19:33,190
implementations for like six years it's

506
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:35,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">surprising to me I there there must have</font>

507
00:19:33,190 --> 00:19:36,910
been two different<font color="#E5E5E5"> SNMP implementations</font>

508
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:39,010
floating around in their code bases and

509
00:19:36,910 --> 00:19:41,410
one of them didn't happen have this flaw

510
00:19:39,010 --> 00:19:43,150
but I did find a specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> version</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

511
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:45,850
may be more but I did find a specific

512
00:19:43,150 --> 00:19:47,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">version in the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the list of vulnerable</font>

513
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:48,969
versions that happens to also support

514
00:19:47,350 --> 00:19:51,520
lawful intercept and it runs on the

515
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:54,040
cisco 10000 series edge routers these

516
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:55,660
routers are for cable modem companies or

517
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:59,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">DSL companies that are serving like</font>

518
00:19:55,660 --> 00:20:00,040
large numbers of customers so you know

519
00:19:59,080 --> 00:20:01,090
these things are out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there on the</font>

520
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:02,980
internet and you know potentially

521
00:20:01,090 --> 00:20:06,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's a lot of consumer data that's</font>

522
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:08,830
flowing through them so let's<font color="#E5E5E5"> say you're</font>

523
00:20:06,790 --> 00:20:10,330
you're trying to break into this lawful

524
00:20:08,830 --> 00:20:12,250
intercept system and these guys have

525
00:20:10,330 --> 00:20:13,750
patched the router so that vulnerability

526
00:20:12,250 --> 00:20:15,670
is not available anymore you're going to

527
00:20:13,750 --> 00:20:18,130
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to actually have the valid username</font>

528
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:19,990
and password in order to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get in you're</font>

529
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:22,600
going to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to brute force them turns</font>

530
00:20:19,990 --> 00:20:25,570
out snmpv3 makes that really easy for

531
00:20:22,600 --> 00:20:27,820
<font color="#CCCCCC">you but through a very classic mistake</font>

532
00:20:25,570 --> 00:20:30,370
they have very verbose error messages if

533
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:31,810
you send a packet to an SNMP v3

534
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:33,580
interface and you have the wrong

535
00:20:31,810 --> 00:20:34,960
username tell you that the user name<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

536
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,280
wrong if you have the wrong password

537
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:38,530
will tell you that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the password was</font>

538
00:20:36,280 --> 00:20:39,940
wrong<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so it's easy to guess user</font>

539
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:41,139
names until you get one that's accepted

540
00:20:39,940 --> 00:20:42,640
and then you guess passwords until you

541
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:44,770
get one that was accepted and that helps

542
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:48,490
break up the amount<font color="#E5E5E5"> of entropy that you</font>

543
00:20:44,770 --> 00:20:51,010
need to to to gas without getting any

544
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:52,570
feedback all kinds of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different systems</font>

00:20:51,010 --> 00:20:53,860
<font color="#E5E5E5">have been implemented</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this way in the</font>

546
00:20:52,570 --> 00:20:56,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">past and usually this ends up getting</font>

547
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:59,229
disclosed as a vulnerability with a very

548
00:20:56,290 --> 00:21:01,060
low cvss score and they fix it but it's

549
00:20:59,230 --> 00:21:02,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be hard to fix SNMP</font>

550
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,840
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk about that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

551
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:06,129
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit later so let's say you've</font>

00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:08,439
brute force the<font color="#E5E5E5"> username and password</font>

553
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:09,580
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> might be a little bit concerned</font>

554
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:11,800
because it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take you a while</font>

555
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:13,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">to guess to trial those guesses that you</font>

00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:16,510
might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be noticed doing that right all</font>

557
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:18,459
that traffic that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're generating you</font>

558
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:19,720
know you would<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that that that</font>

559
00:21:18,460 --> 00:21:22,060
might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be picked up by the people</font>

560
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:23,770
operating the network but<font color="#E5E5E5"> unfortunately</font>

561
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:25,929
<font color="#CCCCCC">there there really isn't much of an</font>

audit<font color="#CCCCCC"> trail in place that would alert</font>

563
00:21:25,930 --> 00:21:31,750
the network managers to this activity so

564
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:35,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">I originally thought that this was an</font>

565
00:21:31,750 --> 00:21:37,570
implementation flaw in snmpv2 if you

566
00:21:35,650 --> 00:21:39,700
send a message<font color="#CCCCCC"> to so they didn't have</font>

567
00:21:37,570 --> 00:21:41,649
huge names and passwords in snmpv2 they

568
00:21:39,700 --> 00:21:44,470
had community strings which was<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of</font>

569
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:48,490
a you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know what sort of like a password</font>

570
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:50,170
but if you if you sent an snmpv2 message

00:21:48,490 --> 00:21:53,200
to a router that was configured to do

572
00:21:50,170 --> 00:21:55,090
traps and you had a bad community<font color="#E5E5E5"> string</font>

573
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,610
it would do<font color="#E5E5E5"> this authentication failure</font>

574
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:58,870
trap to the SNMP management server so

00:21:57,610 --> 00:22:00,250
the network managers would know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

576
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:01,870
somebody screwing around somebody is

577
00:22:00,250 --> 00:22:04,450
sending us messages that are not

578
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:06,189
properly authenticated and the all the

579
00:22:04,450 --> 00:22:08,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">documentation</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seemed to strongly suggest</font>

580
00:22:06,190 --> 00:22:10,270
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you configured snmpv3 with</font>

either notification traps or inform

582
00:22:10,270 --> 00:22:13,870
since what they're called in v3 that

583
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:15,669
that they would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be generated if a bad</font>

590
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:30,790
I told Cisco des and they spend<font color="#E5E5E5"> some</font>

591
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:34,210
time thinking about it and they<font color="#E5E5E5"> decided</font>

592
00:22:30,790 --> 00:22:36,730
that that the behavior<font color="#CCCCCC"> was as designed</font>

593
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:39,500
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> the documentation</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was wrong and so</font>

594
00:22:36,730 --> 00:22:40,880
they they actually have this bulletin in

595
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,680
which you can look up which explains

596
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:44,660
that the documentation seems to imply

597
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:46,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">that we will generate traps when there's</font>

598
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:48,290
an authentication failure but in fact we

599
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:50,960
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> not and that it's supposed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be that</font>

600
00:22:48,290 --> 00:22:52,760
way so you can try bad<font color="#CCCCCC"> usernames and</font>

601
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:56,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">passwords all day long and no one will</font>

602
00:22:52,760 --> 00:22:59,480
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> notice the other thing is that</font>

603
00:22:56,600 --> 00:23:01,219
once you get in you would think you

604
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:02,630
would be noticed you know once<font color="#E5E5E5"> you crack</font>

605
00:23:01,220 --> 00:23:04,610
crack the right username and pass when

606
00:23:02,630 --> 00:23:05,570
you actually provision a wire tab you

607
00:23:04,610 --> 00:23:07,459
would think there would be an audit

608
00:23:05,570 --> 00:23:09,980
trail<font color="#E5E5E5"> that would be generated and they</font>

609
00:23:07,460 --> 00:23:12,440
would know that the wiretapping system

610
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:15,410
was being used<font color="#E5E5E5"> it turns out that that</font>

611
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:18,740
you can actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> turn the logs off in</font>

619
00:23:37,460 --> 00:23:43,490
to me it's bizarre most kinds of systems

620
00:23:40,970 --> 00:23:45,980
have audit trails built into them in

621
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:47,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">various levels of authorization so if</font>

you're logged into a unix shell you're

623

you're generating all the syslog

unless your route right<font color="#E5E5E5"> DHCP servers</font>

630
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:07,010
is different in this case the user can

631
00:24:03,590 --> 00:24:08,629
turn the logs off and and it seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

632
00:24:07,010 --> 00:24:11,840
a bunch of different<font color="#CCCCCC"> lawful intercept</font>

633
00:24:08,630 --> 00:24:14,630
technology that is completely unrelated

technically<font color="#E5E5E5"> has this same architectural</font>

635
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:20,150
feature so there is<font color="#CCCCCC"> this article</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in I</font>

637
00:24:20,150 --> 00:24:25,820
which is very interesting which involved

00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:28,610
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> ericsson cellular phone switches</font>

639
00:24:25,820 --> 00:24:30,439
that were in Greece and I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make</font>

640
00:24:28,610 --> 00:24:31,939
it clear no Cisco equipment was involved

641
00:24:30,440 --> 00:24:34,220
here these were totally different

642
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:36,380
machines built by a different company

643
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:37,490
for use in the cellular network<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a</font>

644
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:39,050
completely different technical

645
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:41,450
architecture except that they had this

646
00:24:39,050 --> 00:24:43,399
same flaw that the there was a

647
00:24:41,450 --> 00:24:45,800
disconnect between the device that

648
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:48,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">performs the wiretapping and the actual</font>

649
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:50,240
device that or the device that's used to

650
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:52,070
provision the wiretaps and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> logs</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> roll</font>

651
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,420
kept on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the provisioning device and not</font>

652
00:24:52,070 --> 00:24:57,200
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the device where the actual</font>

653
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:59,390
I our taps occurred and so what happened

654
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,880
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that someone got a rootkit installed</font>

655
00:24:59,390 --> 00:25:04,730
on the actual cellular phone switch and

656
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:07,370
and that rootkit accessed this interface

657
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:08,750
for wiretapping and it could do<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

658
00:25:07,370 --> 00:25:10,100
without generating any audit trail

659
00:25:08,750 --> 00:25:11,390
because the audit trails were all over

660
00:25:10,100 --> 00:25:16,370
here on the provisioning device which<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

661
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:18,200
never touched and what so um<font color="#CCCCCC"> Erickson</font>

662
00:25:16,370 --> 00:25:19,489
discovered this because there were some

663
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,800
problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the switch at started</font>

664
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:23,510
crashing and they send some escalation

665
00:25:21,800 --> 00:25:25,070
engineers down to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Greece to find out</font>

666
00:25:23,510 --> 00:25:26,420
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> was going on and they started</font>

667
00:25:25,070 --> 00:25:28,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking through the core dumps and they</font>

668
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:29,330
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> found assembly code in the core</font>

669
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:31,820
dump so that their company didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> write</font>

670
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:33,740
it's like the support escalation

671
00:25:31,820 --> 00:25:35,389
nightmare of all time right you find

672
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:36,800
this assembly code your company didn't

673
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:42,380
produce it and it turns out<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's spying</font>

674
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:46,129
on people so there's a there's a there's

675
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:48,950
an origin to to this architectural flaw

676
00:25:46,130 --> 00:25:50,630
and I don't know exactly what it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is and</font>

677
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:54,380
I'll talk to you about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit</font>

678
00:25:50,630 --> 00:25:55,700
later but there's a there's some<font color="#CCCCCC"> reason</font>

679
00:25:54,380 --> 00:25:57,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">why all these systems have been designed</font>

680
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:59,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">this way and I don't know exactly why</font>

681
00:25:57,230 --> 00:26:00,800
but I think it's a problem and I have a

682
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:02,750
suggestion for an alternate architecture

683
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,280
so there's one other reason why this is

684
00:26:02,750 --> 00:26:06,680
a problem even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you decide that you're</font>

685
00:26:04,280 --> 00:26:08,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">not concerned about unauthorized use and</font>

686
00:26:06,680 --> 00:26:10,430
that is that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> allegations of misuse</font>

687
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:13,070
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system cannot be investigated if</font>

688
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:14,840
somebody says I was wiretapped without

689
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:17,090
authorization you have no way to go<font color="#E5E5E5"> back</font>

690
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:19,310
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> see whether or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not they're lying and</font>

691
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:24,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that that's a that's an interesting</font>

692
00:26:19,310 --> 00:26:26,870
problem in and of itself I think so you

693
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:29,060
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> crack the password or you can</font>

694
00:26:26,870 --> 00:26:30,800
exploit that vulnerability to get in

695
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:33,830
there's no logs that are being<font color="#E5E5E5"> generated</font>

696
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:35,480
of your activity what<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the output</font>

697
00:26:33,830 --> 00:26:37,429
<font color="#E5E5E5">strain you would think that the output</font>

698
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:38,780
stream would only go to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the mediation</font>

699
00:26:37,430 --> 00:26:40,130
device and so that would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be kind of a</font>

700
00:26:38,780 --> 00:26:41,450
problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> because you need to own the</font>

701
00:26:40,130 --> 00:26:43,640
mediation device and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably</font>

702
00:26:41,450 --> 00:26:45,770
pretty secure but it turns out that you

703
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:47,450
can send the output stream anywhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

704
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:49,010
you want you can send it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> any</font>

705
00:26:47,450 --> 00:26:52,880
destination address on the global

00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:55,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet over any port using one of four</font>

707
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:57,770
different encapsulation methods a UDP

708
00:26:55,400 --> 00:27:01,250
two different UDP formats one of which

709
00:26:57,770 --> 00:27:04,129
is based on RTP a<font color="#E5E5E5"> tcp and an STC p</font>

710
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:06,509
stream so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very unlikely that your</font>

711
00:27:04,130 --> 00:27:10,440
output stream is going to be back at

712
00:27:06,509 --> 00:27:11,969
altered or even noticed and so for

713
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,279

00:27:11,969 --> 00:27:16,289

721
00:27:29,099 --> 00:27:31,649
and you can pretty much send them

722
00:27:30,329 --> 00:27:35,820
anywhere you want once you've got this

723

00:27:49,889 --> 00:27:54,149
mentioned before as well as the

00:27:51,419 --> 00:27:55,889

00:27:54,149 --> 00:27:57,029

732

lists where you basically say the

733
00:27:57,029 --> 00:28:02,459
service provider land is the only place

734
00:27:58,889 --> 00:28:03,899
that will accept SNMP packets from now

735
00:28:02,459 --> 00:28:05,279
the problem is you can spoof this

736
00:28:03,899 --> 00:28:07,889
interception request so you don't

737

743
00:28:22,349 --> 00:28:25,379

00:28:25,379 --> 00:28:28,408
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably going to want to ask the router</font>

746
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:30,690
for them and in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that you</font>

747

749
00:28:32,699 --> 00:28:36,029
want to use those error messages to

750
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:37,829
crack the username and password you<font color="#CCCCCC"> need</font>

751
00:28:36,029 --> 00:28:39,659
to receive them so again you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

752
00:28:37,829 --> 00:28:41,428
in an<font color="#CCCCCC"> address that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> router will</font>

753
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:43,229
interact with for SNMP so these

754
00:28:41,429 --> 00:28:46,289
infrastructure access control lists do

755
00:28:43,229 --> 00:28:49,529
have a practical effect on the viability

756
00:28:46,289 --> 00:28:51,749
<font color="#CCCCCC">of this attack even though in theory you</font>

757
00:28:49,529 --> 00:28:54,749
<font color="#CCCCCC">could bypass them through spoofing so</font>

758
00:28:51,749 --> 00:28:56,639
this network map kind of represents what

759
00:28:54,749 --> 00:28:58,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">I think is a real world attack scenario</font>

760
00:28:56,639 --> 00:29:00,508
you've owned a machine in the service

761
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:03,119
land it could be any machine in the

762
00:29:00,509 --> 00:29:04,379
service land and and then you send your

763
00:29:03,119 --> 00:29:07,019
interception<font color="#CCCCCC"> request</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from that machine</font>

764
00:29:04,379 --> 00:29:09,178
to the edge router and then the edge

765
00:29:07,019 --> 00:29:12,479
router sends the wiretap to your

766
00:29:09,179 --> 00:29:13,979
computer out on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet so</font>

767
00:29:12,479 --> 00:29:16,169
immediately you get this reaction well

768
00:29:13,979 --> 00:29:17,609
you know either people either say oh the

769
00:29:16,169 --> 00:29:19,950
service lands are<font color="#CCCCCC"> in editable</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so that's</font>

770
00:29:17,609 --> 00:29:20,879
on a problem or they say well one

771
00:29:19,950 --> 00:29:22,440
you're in the service line you pretty

772
00:29:20,880 --> 00:29:24,330
much control the ISP anyway so what's

773
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,519
what difference does it make there are

774
00:29:24,330 --> 00:29:28,710
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are two differences the first is</font>

775
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:30,210
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are there are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a lot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

776
00:29:28,710 --> 00:29:31,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">who have legitimate access to the</font>

777
00:29:30,210 --> 00:29:34,620
service land who are not supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be</font>

778
00:29:31,710 --> 00:29:36,179
using lawful intercept and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font>

779
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:37,739
security architecture here<font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually</font>

780
00:29:36,179 --> 00:29:39,809
<font color="#CCCCCC">supposed</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to provide better assurance as</font>

781
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:42,840
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> less and it doesn't so that's that</font>

782
00:29:39,809 --> 00:29:45,029
in and of itself as an<font color="#E5E5E5"> issue the second</font>

783
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:46,500
thing is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we've built all this</font>

784
00:29:45,029 --> 00:29:48,360
awesome functionality that makes<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

785
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:49,860
really easy to perform wiretaps and so

786
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:51,389
that makes controlling service land

787
00:29:49,860 --> 00:29:54,570
suddenly more attractive than maybe

788
00:29:51,389 --> 00:29:57,178
otherwise would be there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> frack</font>

789
00:29:54,570 --> 00:29:59,158
article from like I don't know<font color="#CCCCCC"> ten years</font>

790
00:29:57,179 --> 00:30:01,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">ago that talks about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> how to if you</font>

791
00:29:59,159 --> 00:30:03,480
control iOS you can configure

792
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:05,639
essentially the same sort of wiretap

793
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:07,380
where you set up a tunnel an IP and<font color="#E5E5E5"> IP</font>

794
00:30:05,639 --> 00:30:09,600
tunnel from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the router to some device</font>

795
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:11,789
out on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> internet and you you r out a</font>

796
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:15,269
particular traffic set through this

797
00:30:11,789 --> 00:30:16,590
tunnel then back and then out and and so

798
00:30:15,269 --> 00:30:18,600
you can set up<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like that it's</font>

799
00:30:16,590 --> 00:30:20,399
extremely cumbersome the person that

800
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:22,529
you're targeting might notice it this is

801
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:26,760
a single UDP packet it's a hell of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot</font>

802
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:28,590
easier to use and so the fact that it's

803
00:30:26,760 --> 00:30:30,029
easier to use makes it makes it less

804
00:30:28,590 --> 00:30:31,320
expensive to perform this attack

805
00:30:30,029 --> 00:30:34,139
essentially and so it becomes more

806
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:36,029
attractive so I work in exports research

807
00:30:34,139 --> 00:30:37,439
we make intrusion prevention systems and

808
00:30:36,029 --> 00:30:39,029
we spend a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of time looking at</font>

809
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:40,169
security vulnerabilities and trying to

810
00:30:39,029 --> 00:30:41,610
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> which security</font>

811
00:30:40,169 --> 00:30:43,860
vulnerabilities are more likely to get

812
00:30:41,610 --> 00:30:45,240
exploited than other ones and we came<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

813
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:47,070
<font color="#E5E5E5">at this sort of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like simple way of</font>

814
00:30:45,240 --> 00:30:50,760
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the process that we go</font>

815
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:52,740
through where we consider<font color="#E5E5E5"> the economic</font>

816
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:55,169
prospect that a vulnerability represents

817
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:57,510
to an attacker and so I've got this

818
00:30:55,169 --> 00:30:58,830
chart here<font color="#E5E5E5"> on one axis I chart the</font>

819
00:30:57,510 --> 00:31:00,658
opportunity that<font color="#CCCCCC"> a vulnerability</font>

820
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:04,049
represents like how<font color="#CCCCCC"> many systems out</font>

821
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:05,789
there are affected and and<font color="#E5E5E5"> and what kind</font>

822
00:31:04,049 --> 00:31:08,549
of data do they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> on them on the</font>

823
00:31:05,789 --> 00:31:09,629
other axis I chart how much it<font color="#CCCCCC"> costs the</font>

824
00:31:08,549 --> 00:31:12,929
bad guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> to exploit that vulnerability</font>

825
00:31:09,630 --> 00:31:14,580
does the vulnerability fit into a

826
00:31:12,929 --> 00:31:15,899
business<font color="#E5E5E5"> model that attackers are</font>

827
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,039
already running or are they going to

828
00:31:15,899 --> 00:31:19,168
have to come up with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of new</font>

829
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:20,908
tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> and techniques in order to in</font>

830
00:31:19,169 --> 00:31:24,029
order to really exploit it and make

831
00:31:20,909 --> 00:31:25,350
money with it so if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about this</font>

832
00:31:24,029 --> 00:31:26,820
the fact that we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> created this</font>

833
00:31:25,350 --> 00:31:28,918
infrastructure that makes it really easy

834
00:31:26,820 --> 00:31:32,340
to do this what you<font color="#E5E5E5"> end up doing is</font>

835
00:31:28,919 --> 00:31:33,539
moving this attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right side of</font>

836
00:31:32,340 --> 00:31:34,830
this chart

837
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:36,479
basically you're making it less and less

838
00:31:34,830 --> 00:31:38,039
expensive<font color="#CCCCCC"> to perform the attack and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

839
00:31:36,479 --> 00:31:39,899
consequence is that it becomes more

840
00:31:38,039 --> 00:31:41,519
attractive most of the vulnerabilities

841
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:43,498
that the x-force gets really sped up

842
00:31:41,519 --> 00:31:45,299
about are the ones in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> top quadrant</font>

843
00:31:43,499 --> 00:31:48,179
that represent a big opportunity and are

844
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:50,399
real cheap to exploit and anything that

845
00:31:48,179 --> 00:31:52,109
you do that that that that makes things

846
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:56,639
<font color="#E5E5E5">cheaper makes them more likely to happen</font>

847
00:31:52,109 --> 00:31:58,799
in practice there's another kind of

848
00:31:56,639 --> 00:32:00,539
access list besides these infrastructure

849
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:03,210
access control<font color="#E5E5E5"> lists that you can</font>

850
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:05,340
configure on a cisco router and it turns

851
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:07,379
out that it has a big impact on the

852
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:10,559
security implications of this interface

853
00:32:07,379 --> 00:32:11,939
but unfortunately<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not at least</font>

854
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:14,879
originally when I looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at this it was</font>

855
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:16,679
not documented in the SNMP v3 hardening

856
00:32:14,879 --> 00:32:18,478
guide or the configuration guides for

857
00:32:16,679 --> 00:32:21,720
lawful intercept so I'm pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

858
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:23,460
one actually does this but it it you

859
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:26,580
should if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually have to deploy</font>

860
00:32:23,460 --> 00:32:29,009
this stuff in practice you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can specify</font>

861
00:32:26,580 --> 00:32:32,129
an access control list for an SNMP v3

862
00:32:29,009 --> 00:32:35,399
user so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> user can only come from a</font>

863
00:32:32,129 --> 00:32:37,320
<font color="#E5E5E5">specific source address and again the</font>

864
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:39,209
interception<font color="#E5E5E5"> request could be spoofed so</font>

865
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:40,678
in and of itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> this does not solve all</font>

866
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:43,320
your security problems but coupled with

867
00:32:40,679 --> 00:32:45,149
other things it can it may be difficult

868
00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:47,519
for an attacker to figure out<font color="#CCCCCC"> the IP</font>

869
00:32:45,149 --> 00:32:50,488
address of your mediation device and the

870
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:52,559
other thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this actually</font>

871
00:32:50,489 --> 00:32:54,929
generates an audit<font color="#CCCCCC"> trail once you</font>

872
00:32:52,559 --> 00:32:57,178
configure this access control list if

873
00:32:54,929 --> 00:32:58,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">you send a packet to the router using</font>

874
00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:01,080
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> username</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from a different source</font>

875
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:04,710
address an authentication failure trap

876
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:06,720
will be generated so I you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

877
00:33:04,710 --> 00:33:09,929
that's a that's a strange result in my

878
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:11,879
mind<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it can help you identify when</font>

879
00:33:09,929 --> 00:33:14,249
things that are suspicious are going on

880
00:33:11,879 --> 00:33:15,299
so so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is a good</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> thing to use</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but I</font>

881
00:33:14,249 --> 00:33:18,749
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> if a lot of people are</font>

882
00:33:15,299 --> 00:33:20,940
actually using<font color="#E5E5E5"> it another good thing to</font>

883
00:33:18,749 --> 00:33:22,349
use<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> encryption and I know for a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> fact</font>

884
00:33:20,940 --> 00:33:24,720
that a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are not using</font>

885
00:33:22,349 --> 00:33:26,158
encryption with this system it you don't

886
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,929
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have encryption to have the</font>

887
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,479
lawful intercept feature and the

888
00:33:27,929 --> 00:33:33,210
documentation says although encryption

889
00:33:30,479 --> 00:33:34,919
is not necessary we recommend it and I

890
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:36,090
know that they do<font color="#E5E5E5"> Cisco really wants you</font>

891
00:33:34,919 --> 00:33:39,059
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use encryption with this but</font>

892
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:40,649
sometimes you you you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> afford the</font>

893
00:33:39,059 --> 00:33:43,139
encryption version of iOS on your router

894
00:33:40,649 --> 00:33:45,689
and so there's a couple different kinds

895
00:33:43,139 --> 00:33:47,449
<font color="#CCCCCC">of encryption that you can use in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

896
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:49,610
context what is<font color="#E5E5E5"> SNMP v3</font>

897
00:33:47,450 --> 00:33:51,380
encryption and it's a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing to use</font>

898
00:33:49,610 --> 00:33:52,610
because it makes the attack a little bit

899
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:54,380
harder but it doesn't protect the

900
00:33:52,610 --> 00:33:59,840
privacy of the wiretap coming back out

901
00:33:54,380 --> 00:34:01,070
and so what a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people do if</font>

902
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:02,959
they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> using encryption is they set up</font>

903
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:05,299
an ipsec tunnel from the mediation

904
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:06,649
device to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the router and that's actually</font>

905
00:34:05,299 --> 00:34:08,030
mentioned in the internet draft<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

906
00:34:06,649 --> 00:34:11,598
tap nib that's how they meant you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> do</font>

907
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:13,879
this but the problem<font color="#CCCCCC"> is again that that</font>

908
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:16,669
IPSec tunnels are disconnected from the

909
00:34:13,879 --> 00:34:19,399
actual lawful intercept or the SNMP v3

910
00:34:16,668 --> 00:34:20,839
system so imagine that there's an ipsec

911
00:34:19,399 --> 00:34:22,429
tunnel configured in this case between

912
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:25,070
the mediation device in the edge router

913
00:34:22,429 --> 00:34:28,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm sending my attack from a different</font>

914
00:34:25,070 --> 00:34:29,570
source so when the router receives my

915
00:34:28,010 --> 00:34:31,760
attack packet it's not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to expect</font>

916
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:33,109
it to be encrypted so the fact that your

917
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:34,520
tunnel is there does<font color="#E5E5E5"> not prevent me</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> from</font>

918
00:34:33,109 --> 00:34:37,969
accessing the interface without

919
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:39,829
authorization when the and then when my

920
00:34:37,969 --> 00:34:41,089
output stream goes out it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not going to</font>

921
00:34:39,829 --> 00:34:42,710
the mediation devices go into a

922
00:34:41,089 --> 00:34:45,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">different destination on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Internet so</font>

923
00:34:42,710 --> 00:34:46,639
again the<font color="#CCCCCC"> the ipsec tunnel is only going</font>

924
00:34:45,230 --> 00:34:47,990
to encrypt traffic if it's headed<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

925
00:34:46,639 --> 00:34:51,859
the mediation device and my output

926
00:34:47,989 --> 00:34:54,859
traffic is not so even if you did go to

927
00:34:51,859 --> 00:34:56,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">the trouble of configuring IP SEC it may</font>

928
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:59,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">not necessarily protect you from this</font>

929
00:34:56,149 --> 00:35:01,759
attack only if you couple IPSec with

930
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:04,190
that user group access list that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

931
00:35:01,760 --> 00:35:05,540
mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> before are you really secure</font>

932
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:07,250
against unauthorized use of this

933
00:35:05,540 --> 00:35:08,750
interface and I don't think a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

934
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:10,430
people are doing that in practice so

935
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:12,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is one of the questions it's like</font>

936
00:35:10,430 --> 00:35:14,180
um you know what<font color="#CCCCCC"> do I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think people are</font>

937
00:35:12,619 --> 00:35:16,819
doing in the real world I think they're

938
00:35:14,180 --> 00:35:18,980
using that infrastructure access control

939
00:35:16,819 --> 00:35:20,569
list but and hopefully they've some

940
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:22,520
people are probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> still vulnerable to</font>

941
00:35:20,569 --> 00:35:26,029
<font color="#E5E5E5">that to that authentication</font>

942
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:27,410
vulnerability and most some people are

943
00:35:26,030 --> 00:35:28,849
not using encryption and most<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are</font>

944
00:35:27,410 --> 00:35:31,368
not using that group access control us

945
00:35:28,849 --> 00:35:32,720
so the consequence is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that these systems</font>

946
00:35:31,369 --> 00:35:35,060
can be attacked in the real world and

947
00:35:32,720 --> 00:35:39,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this attack scenario is realistic</font>

948
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:42,619
in a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of places so um let me shift</font>

949
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:46,160
gears here and talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

950
00:35:42,619 --> 00:35:48,140
done to<font color="#CCCCCC"> address these problems so there</font>

951
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:50,299
<font color="#CCCCCC">are different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> layers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> at which</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

952
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:53,240
address security issues in an Internet

953
00:35:50,300 --> 00:35:55,369
Protocol you can change the design you

954
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:58,450
can fix the implementation or you can

955
00:35:55,369 --> 00:35:58,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">just deploy it right</font>

956
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:02,098
I have some recommendations for proper

957
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:04,348
deployment I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to bore you</font>

958
00:36:02,099 --> 00:36:06,060
with them as I said before you can

959
00:36:04,349 --> 00:36:07,950
configure this in such a way that it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

960
00:36:06,060 --> 00:36:09,690
pretty secure against against this

961
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:13,470
attack I just don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that a lot of</font>

962
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:15,030
people do that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in practice the but</font>

963
00:36:13,470 --> 00:36:16,799
there's a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> problems with this the</font>

964
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:18,810
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that even if you do this even</font>

965
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:21,210
if you configure it securely you still

966
00:36:18,810 --> 00:36:22,859
don't have an audit<font color="#CCCCCC"> trail so you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still</font>

967
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:24,300
can't investigate misuse of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the system</font>

968
00:36:22,859 --> 00:36:27,630
by people who are authorized to use it

969
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:29,910
there's also no way for me<font color="#E5E5E5"> as a user to</font>

970
00:36:27,630 --> 00:36:32,790
know whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> or not my isp has deployed</font>

971
00:36:29,910 --> 00:36:35,940
this correctly and again I assume that<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

972
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:37,680
lot of ISPs are not so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

973
00:36:35,940 --> 00:36:39,270
changes through the design of the

974
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:41,098
protocols it would make the system

975
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:45,060
harder to attack regardless of how well

976
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:47,940
it was deployed I have a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

977
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:49,770
recommendations for that for SNMP v3 I

978
00:36:47,940 --> 00:36:51,480
think that we should get rid<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those</font>

979
00:36:49,770 --> 00:36:52,410
helpful authentication errors that tell

980
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:55,410
you whether the user<font color="#E5E5E5"> name</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or the</font>

981
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:56,609
password<font color="#E5E5E5"> was bad we should send traps</font>

982
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:58,710
and informs with any authentication

983
00:36:56,609 --> 00:37:00,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">failure occurs so the network managers</font>

984
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:02,430
will know when someone's<font color="#CCCCCC"> trying to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> crack</font>

985
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:04,050
passwords we should also make the engine

986
00:37:02,430 --> 00:37:07,348
values more difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to predict and</font>

987
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:10,440
share so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would love to be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> able to do</font>

988
00:37:07,349 --> 00:37:14,220
these<font color="#CCCCCC"> things but unfortunately the the</font>

989
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:16,380
working group for SNMP is closed so the

990
00:37:14,220 --> 00:37:19,439
process<font color="#E5E5E5"> of actually getting the ITF to</font>

991
00:37:16,380 --> 00:37:22,859
update the the standard to include these

992
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:24,390
changes is this Byzantine bureaucratic

993
00:37:22,859 --> 00:37:29,460
discussion that would take several years

994
00:37:24,390 --> 00:37:30,598
so it's not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to happen the these</font>

995
00:37:29,460 --> 00:37:32,640
things are all really easy to implement

996
00:37:30,599 --> 00:37:33,990
in practice if you did this to your SNMP

997
00:37:32,640 --> 00:37:35,520
implementation you wouldn't have to have

998
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:37,529
a flag day or anything you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

999
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:39,750
deploy it and would be fine<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

1000
00:37:37,530 --> 00:37:42,540
unfortunately that's not going to happen

1001
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:45,119
I also have some recommendations for

1002
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:48,660
lawful intercept the most important<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

1003
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:49,920
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that that notification control should</font>

1004
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:52,828
be moved into the router configuration

1005
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:55,200
so that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's an audit trail for every</font>

1006
00:37:52,829 --> 00:37:57,720
single<font color="#E5E5E5"> wire tap that takes place now the</font>

1007
00:37:55,200 --> 00:38:00,149
one of the reasons for the architecture

1008
00:37:57,720 --> 00:38:02,609
that that exists<font color="#CCCCCC"> here where the audit</font>

1009
00:38:00,150 --> 00:38:03,990
trail is in the is in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> immediate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

1010
00:38:02,609 --> 00:38:06,180
is them the mediation device and not in

1011
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:08,339
the router is that they don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want the</font>

1012
00:38:06,180 --> 00:38:10,049
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> run the network to know when</font>

1013
00:38:08,339 --> 00:38:10,920
the police are wiretapping somebody

1014
00:38:10,050 --> 00:38:12,690
because they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessarily</font>

1015
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,890
authorized to know that so if they

1016
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:16,440
go in the router and configure any

1017
00:38:13,890 --> 00:38:18,150
destination to receive traps whatever

1018
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:19,710
the wiretapping system is used they

1019
00:38:18,150 --> 00:38:21,300
would know when wiretaps are taking

1020
00:38:19,710 --> 00:38:23,670
place and they could call their friend

1021
00:38:21,300 --> 00:38:27,240
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say hey there wiretapping again so</font>

1022
00:38:23,670 --> 00:38:28,950
that's why the they wanted the the

1023
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:31,410
lawful intercept administration people

1024
00:38:28,950 --> 00:38:33,509
to control the notification so that the

1025
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:35,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">the router administrators you know</font>

1026
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:36,900
wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> be able to find out what was</font>

1027
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:39,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">going on so what I suggest is you</font>

1028
00:38:36,900 --> 00:38:41,700
actually need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to have agreement between</font>

1029
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:43,170
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who are operating the the</font>

1030
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:44,848
wiretaps<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who are</font>

1031
00:38:43,170 --> 00:38:46,260
operating the network so when you

1032
00:38:44,849 --> 00:38:47,970
configure the router you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure a</font>

1033
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:50,130
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of different possible destination</font>

1034
00:38:47,970 --> 00:38:52,859
addresses for traps and you enforce that

1035
00:38:50,130 --> 00:38:54,420
when a wiretap is provisioned they must

1036
00:38:52,859 --> 00:38:57,660
specify one of those different

1037
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:59,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">destination addresses if they don't then</font>

1038
00:38:57,660 --> 00:39:01,020
no wiretap happens and this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> allows</font>

1039
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:03,000
you to have different law enforcement

1040
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:05,339
organizations that have different

1041
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:08,910
security policies using the same

1042
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:09,930
infrastructure and the reporting you

1043
00:39:08,910 --> 00:39:11,399
know and they can all control their own

1044
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:12,450
reporting so that so that each one

1045
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:16,079
doesn't find out about the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other's</font>

1046
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:18,810
activities again I don't think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that that</font>

1047
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:20,640
change<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to happen this this</font>

1048
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:22,500
design as<font color="#CCCCCC"> it exists complies with</font>

1049
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:23,910
government requirements and I put that

1050
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:25,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">in quotation marks because I don't know</font>

1051
00:39:23,910 --> 00:39:28,170
which government and I don't know what

1052
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:29,640
requirement someone mentioned the etsy

1053
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:31,109
standards to me and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> went through the</font>

1054
00:39:29,640 --> 00:39:33,450
etsy standards and tried to find a place

1055
00:39:31,109 --> 00:39:35,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">where they require that that you have a</font>

1056
00:39:33,450 --> 00:39:36,930
way to turn the audit trail off and I

1057
00:39:35,069 --> 00:39:38,490
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> find it so I don't think it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

1058
00:39:36,930 --> 00:39:40,919
there I don't know where it is but we

1059
00:39:38,490 --> 00:39:42,450
see it again in totally different lawful

1060
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:45,270
intercept systems designed by different

1061
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:47,430
people in very different ways and

1062
00:39:45,270 --> 00:39:51,630
there's some fundamental origin of this

1063
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:53,339
of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> decision but the other thing is</font>

1064
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:55,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">the network providers are not demanding</font>

1065
00:39:53,339 --> 00:39:57,420
it so I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this I want</font>

1066
00:39:55,829 --> 00:39:58,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this issue a little bit</font>

1067
00:39:57,420 --> 00:40:03,900
more the design implementation and

1068
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:05,609
deployment with ITF protocols you have

1069
00:40:03,900 --> 00:40:07,890
these protocol designers that design us

1070
00:40:05,609 --> 00:40:09,630
an RFC standard and then you have these

1071
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:11,220
software vendors that actually implement

1072
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:13,500
it right they make the software that

1073
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:15,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">implements the RFC and then you have</font>

1074
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:16,349
these network operators that take that

1075
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:18,420
software and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually run it on the</font>

1076
00:40:16,349 --> 00:40:19,890
network so you can use it and then you

1077
00:40:18,420 --> 00:40:23,040
have customers who actually use<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1078
00:40:19,890 --> 00:40:24,690
system in this case the customer is law

1079
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:26,550
enforcement they're the people who

1080
00:40:24,690 --> 00:40:27,960
actually access this lawful intercept

1081
00:40:26,550 --> 00:40:29,250
system and there are the people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

1082
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:31,830
setting the requirements for how it

1083
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:35,550
should work you are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> the customer</font>

1084
00:40:31,830 --> 00:40:38,850
what this is so in economics this is

1085
00:40:35,550 --> 00:40:40,770
called<font color="#E5E5E5"> the negative externality and let</font>

1086
00:40:38,850 --> 00:40:43,830
me give you a more simple example let's

1087
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:47,970
say you are in in Montana and you're

1088
00:40:43,830 --> 00:40:49,380
making widgets and your your widgets are

1089
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:51,359
very popular lots of people like to<font color="#E5E5E5"> buy</font>

1090
00:40:49,380 --> 00:40:53,670
them and your your haven't you have this

1091
00:40:51,360 --> 00:40:56,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">great business but you're also um</font>

1092
00:40:53,670 --> 00:40:57,660
polluting and<font color="#CCCCCC"> your pollution because of</font>

1093
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:59,580
the wind<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know doesn't blow into</font>

1094
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:01,410
Montana and so the people in montana who

1095
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:03,210
are buying your widgets are not affected

1096
00:41:01,410 --> 00:41:05,430
by<font color="#CCCCCC"> it it blows into another state and</font>

1097
00:41:03,210 --> 00:41:06,900
those people<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't buy your widgets they</font>

1098
00:41:05,430 --> 00:41:08,669
don't benefit from the<font color="#E5E5E5"> product</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1099
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:11,940
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> making it anyway and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> they they</font>

1100
00:41:08,670 --> 00:41:13,920
can't influence your your your your

1101
00:41:11,940 --> 00:41:16,110
plant operations by choosing not to buy

1102
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,370
your product and so and so the

1103
00:41:16,110 --> 00:41:18,960
consequence is that there's this

1104
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:21,330
economic transaction going on between

1105
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:23,430
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> plant and and the people buying</font>

1106
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:25,290
your widgets that has a negative impact

1107
00:41:23,430 --> 00:41:27,120
on a third party that<font color="#E5E5E5"> isn't actually</font>

1108
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:29,279
part of the economic transaction and

1109
00:41:27,120 --> 00:41:31,319
can't affect it it's a market failure

1110
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:32,940
and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> called it's called a negative</font>

1111
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:34,350
externality and it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> often a place where</font>

1112
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:36,390
regulation is used so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> government</font>

1113
00:41:34,350 --> 00:41:37,620
comes<font color="#E5E5E5"> in and they say okay you know your</font>

1114
00:41:36,390 --> 00:41:38,850
customers aren't going to stop buying

1115
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:40,920
your product because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of this pollution</font>

1116
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:43,230
so we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to require you to not</font>

1117
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:46,650
pollute as much<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the interests of</font>

1118
00:41:43,230 --> 00:41:48,360
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> third party are important negative</font>

1119
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:51,480
externalities can exist in protocol

1120
00:41:48,360 --> 00:41:54,960
designs a good<font color="#E5E5E5"> example I guess is is</font>

1121
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:57,540
traffic amplification vulnerabilities so

1122
00:41:54,960 --> 00:42:00,090
like RTP you can you can send a single

1123
00:41:57,540 --> 00:42:02,279
packet a single sip packet and get a get

1124
00:42:00,090 --> 00:42:04,410
an RTP stream directed at a destination

1125
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:05,730
address of your choice right so you can

1126
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:07,560
send this<font color="#E5E5E5"> one little packet and get a</font>

1127
00:42:05,730 --> 00:42:08,820
whole bunch<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> data to go to any</font>

1128
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:10,529
destination on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the internet that you</font>

1129
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:12,330
want it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> supposed to come back to you</font>

1130
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:14,280
right it's supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a transaction</font>

1131
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:17,190
between you and then the the sip server

1132
00:42:14,280 --> 00:42:20,160
but you can you can target someone<font color="#CCCCCC"> else</font>

1133
00:42:17,190 --> 00:42:23,100
as the destination and as a consequence

1134
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:24,810
of that yeah that third party is

1135
00:42:23,100 --> 00:42:26,580
negatively impacted then they have<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

1136
00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:28,620
way within the context of this protocol

1137
00:42:26,580 --> 00:42:32,310
to turn that stream off they can't tell

1138
00:42:28,620 --> 00:42:35,880
you to stop negative externalities in

1139
00:42:32,310 --> 00:42:37,830
protocol design I believe can<font color="#CCCCCC"> be you can</font>

1140
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:40,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">have a positive</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> impact by addressing</font>

1141
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:43,769
them in the design as opposed to simply

1142
00:42:40,380 --> 00:42:46,380
pushing the the way we address this down

1143
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:47,879
to to the development level and and it

1144
00:42:46,380 --> 00:42:49,259
goes<font color="#CCCCCC"> back to this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> model you know the</font>

1145
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:51,150
protocol designers want to provide as

1146
00:42:49,259 --> 00:42:52,440
much functionality to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the vendors as</font>

1147
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:53,759
they can because that's who they serve

1148
00:42:52,440 --> 00:42:55,440
and the vendors want to provide as much

1149
00:42:53,759 --> 00:42:57,119
functionality the network operators as

1150
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,039
they can but in fact in some of these

1151
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:00,690
cases if the protocol designers stop and

1152
00:42:59,039 --> 00:43:03,180
decide to constrain their functionality

1153
00:43:00,690 --> 00:43:05,099
a little bit they will have a positive

1154
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:06,390
impact<font color="#E5E5E5"> on the security of the actual</font>

1158
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:17,369
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future with wiretapping</font>

1159
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:18,599
infrastructure and I think this is

1160
00:43:17,369 --> 00:43:24,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">probably the most interesting part of</font>

1161
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:26,490
the talk the so illegal wiretapping used

1162
00:43:24,509 --> 00:43:28,109
to be really easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> you used to be able to</font>

1163
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:29,609
go out to a telco junction box with a

1164
00:43:28,109 --> 00:43:31,710
couple of alligator clips and hook up

1165
00:43:29,609 --> 00:43:33,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">and listen to somebody's phone call you</font>

1166
00:43:31,710 --> 00:43:35,069
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a frequency scanner and listen</font>

1167
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:37,230
to people's cellular<font color="#CCCCCC"> phone calls or</font>

1168
00:43:35,069 --> 00:43:40,619
their cordless calls really easily over

1169
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:42,089
time it has been getting harder wireless

1170
00:43:40,619 --> 00:43:44,279
systems are maybe more likely to be

1171
00:43:42,089 --> 00:43:46,799
spread spectrum today cell phones have

1172
00:43:44,279 --> 00:43:48,420
link layer encryption a lot of the

1173
00:43:46,799 --> 00:43:50,759
network traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's actually going</font>

1174
00:43:48,420 --> 00:43:53,490
over the physical infrastructure is is

1175
00:43:50,759 --> 00:43:55,950
it uses protocols like a DSL that are

1176
00:43:53,490 --> 00:43:58,529
not as easy to decode it just like hook

1177
00:43:55,950 --> 00:44:01,379
up a little you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> RadioShack device</font>

1178
00:43:58,529 --> 00:44:03,720
and listen in so it's becoming more

1179
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:05,670
difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do but I don't know if</font>

1180
00:44:03,720 --> 00:44:08,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">we're going to achieve this this ideal</font>

1181
00:44:05,670 --> 00:44:11,130
result where we have perfect end

1182
00:44:08,279 --> 00:44:12,900
encryption people don't tend to use and

1183
00:44:11,130 --> 00:44:15,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">end encryption systems that often</font>

1184
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:17,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">because the actual</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> process of</font>

1185
00:44:15,630 --> 00:44:19,619
authenticating them is too cumbersome

1186
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:21,599
where encryption seems to have really

1187
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:23,730
taken hold is when it's built into the

1188
00:44:21,599 --> 00:44:26,400
link layer<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's invisible to the user</font>

1189
00:44:23,730 --> 00:44:28,109
everybody uses encryption on their<font color="#CCCCCC"> cell</font>

1190
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:29,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">phones but they're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not aware of it it's</font>

1191
00:44:28,109 --> 00:44:34,078
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> something that they have to bother</font>

1192
00:44:29,339 --> 00:44:35,670
authenticating so if you want to reduce

1193
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:39,059
the amount of illegal wiretapping that

1194
00:44:35,670 --> 00:44:41,039
happens doing work<font color="#E5E5E5"> on making link layer</font>

1195
00:44:39,059 --> 00:44:42,569
protocols more likely to be encrypted is

1196
00:44:41,039 --> 00:44:44,730
going to have a positive impact on that

1197
00:44:42,569 --> 00:44:46,288
there are still a bunch of link layer

1198
00:44:44,730 --> 00:44:48,450
protocols that we use that do not<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

1199
00:44:46,289 --> 00:44:49,650
any encryption in them and there are a

1200
00:44:48,450 --> 00:44:53,160
lot of assumptions that people make

1201
00:44:49,650 --> 00:44:54,160
about that something I didn't mention<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1202
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:55,450
guess about this

1203
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:57,069
awful intercept system is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> one of</font>

1204
00:44:55,450 --> 00:44:59,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">the things you can specify in the in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1205
00:44:57,069 --> 00:45:03,220
mid when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're provisioning the wiretap</font>

1206
00:44:59,020 --> 00:45:05,259
is the is the the VPN that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1207
00:45:03,220 --> 00:45:07,419
that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to listen to so there's</font>

1208
00:45:05,260 --> 00:45:09,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">this concept of a service provider VPN</font>

1209
00:45:07,420 --> 00:45:11,170
and it always kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of rubbed me the</font>

1210
00:45:09,130 --> 00:45:13,329
wrong way because when I think VPN I

1211
00:45:11,170 --> 00:45:15,609
think encryption and most people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who are</font>

1212
00:45:13,329 --> 00:45:17,799
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> there buying VPN technology think</font>

1213
00:45:15,609 --> 00:45:19,270
they're buying secure links and the

1214
00:45:17,799 --> 00:45:21,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">service provider industry has sort of</font>

1215
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:23,710
sold this concept of service provider

1216
00:45:21,130 --> 00:45:25,030
VPNs and and they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> using the same</font>

1217
00:45:23,710 --> 00:45:26,770
terminology but they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> using</font>

1218
00:45:25,030 --> 00:45:27,730
encryption and when you push them about

1219
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:29,288
it they say well you don't need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to worry</font>

1220
00:45:27,730 --> 00:45:30,609
<font color="#CCCCCC">about that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because the service provider</font>

1221
00:45:29,289 --> 00:45:34,960
network is not subject<font color="#CCCCCC"> to surveillance</font>

1222
00:45:30,609 --> 00:45:38,200
well in fact it is and in fact you can

1223
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:40,270
specify the the specific VPN you want to

1224
00:45:38,200 --> 00:45:42,549
listen<font color="#CCCCCC"> to in the interception request so</font>

1225
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:48,700
link layer encryption is actually a

1226
00:45:42,549 --> 00:45:50,349
really good idea so just the big

1227
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:53,319
question is should we build this sort of

1228
00:45:50,349 --> 00:45:54,940
infrastructure at all well law

1229
00:45:53,319 --> 00:45:56,890
enforcement likes to wiretap suspects

1230
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:58,510
and and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> honestly think that that we're</font>

1231
00:45:56,890 --> 00:45:59,470
no we're not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to again we're not</font>

1232
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:00,849
going to reach this point where it

1233
00:45:59,470 --> 00:46:01,930
becomes technically impossible because I

1234
00:46:00,849 --> 00:46:04,839
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think everyone's going to adopt</font>

1235
00:46:01,930 --> 00:46:06,098
end-to-end encryption so there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> always</font>

1236
00:46:04,839 --> 00:46:07,058
going to be a place to hook up and if

1237
00:46:06,099 --> 00:46:08,410
there's a place to hook up law

1238
00:46:07,059 --> 00:46:11,710
enforcement is going to want to do it

1239
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:14,170
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can either do it with temporary or</font>

1240
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:16,150
permanent infrastructure those are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1241
00:46:14,170 --> 00:46:17,890
two choices and the consensus view of

1242
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:20,200
the academic security research community

1243
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:21,730
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the risks</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> involved in creating</font>

1244
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:23,649
permanent infrastructure are too great

1245
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:25,329
that vulnerabilities like the ones I'm

1246
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:26,859
talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about in this talk will</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be used</font>

1247
00:46:25,329 --> 00:46:28,390
to take<font color="#CCCCCC"> control of any permanent</font>

1248
00:46:26,859 --> 00:46:32,348
infrastructure that you that you build

1249
00:46:28,390 --> 00:46:34,180
into the system so so use temporary

1250
00:46:32,349 --> 00:46:37,839
infrastructure instead use portable

1251
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:39,549
protocol analyzers and and I think that

1252
00:46:37,839 --> 00:46:41,619
that part of the reason for this view is

1253
00:46:39,549 --> 00:46:42,970
that they they also think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that creating</font>

1254
00:46:41,619 --> 00:46:44,799
this permanent infrastructure makes

1255
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:46,299
wiretapping really inexpensive it goes

1256
00:46:44,799 --> 00:46:48,549
back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that economic analysis I was</font>

1257
00:46:46,299 --> 00:46:50,680
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about and so more wiretapping</font>

1258
00:46:48,549 --> 00:46:52,990
will occur if we have it if we have this

1259
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:54,669
if we have these this temporary

1260
00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:57,339
infrastructure it's more cumbersome and

1261
00:46:54,670 --> 00:47:00,309
so people choose not to a wiretap when

1262
00:46:57,339 --> 00:47:01,538
the otherwise would so Susan Landau and

1263
00:47:00,309 --> 00:47:03,130
whitfield diffie wrote a book called

1264
00:47:01,539 --> 00:47:04,869
privacy on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the line which was published</font>

1265
00:47:03,130 --> 00:47:07,000
about ten years ago that talks about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1266
00:47:04,869 --> 00:47:08,020
subject<font color="#E5E5E5"> and Susan actually reached out</font>

1267
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:10,420
to me after I did

1268
00:47:08,020 --> 00:47:11,770
talk at black hat federal and and I

1269
00:47:10,420 --> 00:47:13,090
started talking to her about some of the

1270
00:47:11,770 --> 00:47:14,440
things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to tell you in a</font>

1271
00:47:13,090 --> 00:47:15,760
minute about what I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to</font>

1272
00:47:14,440 --> 00:47:17,110
happen in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future and she says I</font>

1273
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:19,660
really can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk to you about this</font>

1274
00:47:17,110 --> 00:47:21,160
until you<font color="#E5E5E5"> read my new book when's it</font>

1275
00:47:19,660 --> 00:47:23,379
coming out well it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> coming out in March</font>

1276
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:24,910
so she's<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a new book coming out in</font>

1277
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:27,250
March<font color="#E5E5E5"> and if you're interested in this</font>

1278
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:28,390
subject I suggest you read it I'm going

1279
00:47:27,250 --> 00:47:29,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">to read it so that I can go back and</font>

talk to<font color="#E5E5E5"> her about this stuff</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but not</font>

1284
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,230
research community and I'm going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1285
00:47:36,730 --> 00:47:41,050
provide you with<font color="#CCCCCC"> a different perspective</font>

1286
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:43,660
for better for worse and hopefully for

1287
00:47:41,050 --> 00:47:45,520
its food<font color="#CCCCCC"> for thought I think there are</font>

1288
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:48,609
arguable advantages to having permanent

1289
00:47:45,520 --> 00:47:50,440
infrastructure temporary devices don't

1290
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:52,720
have audit trails associated with<font color="#E5E5E5"> them</font>

1291
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:54,520
somebody goes to a store room and they

1292
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:56,350
check out this protocol analyzer and

1293
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,610
then they<font color="#CCCCCC"> go do a wiretap and hopefully</font>

1294
00:47:56,350 --> 00:47:59,440
they only collected the data they were

1295
00:47:57,610 --> 00:48:00,790
authorized to collect and then a few

1296
00:47:59,440 --> 00:48:03,700
weeks later they check it back in right

1297
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:05,950
if you have a permanent infrastructure

1298
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:07,750
then you can create checks and balances

1299
00:48:05,950 --> 00:48:10,120
and processes associated with access

1300
00:48:07,750 --> 00:48:11,410
control in fact you have to because you

1301
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:13,839
have to prevent unauthorized access

1302
00:48:11,410 --> 00:48:16,569
there are a<font color="#E5E5E5"> couple different ways to</font>

1303
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:19,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">build permanent infrastructure one</font>

1304
00:48:16,570 --> 00:48:20,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">approach is the way that this Cisco</font>

1305
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:23,350
architecture works where you're actually

1306
00:48:20,830 --> 00:48:26,049
doing minimization in the router itself

1307
00:48:23,350 --> 00:48:28,690
you're only collecting the data that you

1308
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:30,370
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to collect the other way you can do</font>

1309
00:48:28,690 --> 00:48:33,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is to scoop up everything and sort</font>

1310
00:48:30,370 --> 00:48:34,990
it out later and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> exactly what the</font>

1311
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:37,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">Cline declaration scribes the client</font>

1312
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:40,959
declaration is this so this guy worked

1313
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:42,820
for AT&T and he and he went to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the eff</font>

1314
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:45,040
and told them about this room that

1315
00:48:42,820 --> 00:48:46,660
existed in one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their switching</font>

1316
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:48,610
centers where there was a<font color="#CCCCCC"> fiber optic</font>

1317
00:48:46,660 --> 00:48:49,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">splitter and all the network traffic was</font>

1318
00:48:48,610 --> 00:48:51,850
being shunted off to this room where<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1319
00:48:49,990 --> 00:48:55,120
was being analyzed by<font color="#E5E5E5"> the NSA allegedly</font>

1320
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:56,710
and so in that case there's no we're not

1321
00:48:55,120 --> 00:48:59,470
carefully selecting the data we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1322
00:48:56,710 --> 00:49:01,540
we want to we want to look at we're

1323
00:48:59,470 --> 00:49:03,310
taking<font color="#E5E5E5"> it all so what kind of</font>

1324
00:49:01,540 --> 00:49:04,570
architecture do we do we want to have I

1325
00:49:03,310 --> 00:49:10,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">think that's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really the discussion we</font>

1326
00:49:04,570 --> 00:49:11,860
need to be having so the key differences

1327
00:49:10,150 --> 00:49:13,300
between the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Klein and Cisco</font>

1328
00:49:11,860 --> 00:49:14,800
architectures is the present the

1329
00:49:13,300 --> 00:49:17,650
presence of human checks and<font color="#E5E5E5"> balances</font>

1330
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:19,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">and I think that you could build a wire</font>

1331
00:49:17,650 --> 00:49:21,400
tapping infrastructure that had good

1332
00:49:19,600 --> 00:49:23,259
human checks and balances in it<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1333
00:49:21,400 --> 00:49:24,880
had good audit trails and that required

1334
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:26,230
the right legal authorization to use the

1335
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:28,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">network and if you simultaneously</font>

1336
00:49:26,230 --> 00:49:31,180
coupled that with efforts to improve

1337
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:34,510
link layer encryption the consequence is

1338
00:49:31,180 --> 00:49:37,089
that you would almost you would

1339
00:49:34,510 --> 00:49:40,630
eliminate most illegal wiretapping most

1340
00:49:37,090 --> 00:49:42,700
wiretapping would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> legal and you'd</font>

1341
00:49:40,630 --> 00:49:44,590
it's interesting because you'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> have</font>

1342
00:49:42,700 --> 00:49:46,270
built into this wiretapping

1343
00:49:44,590 --> 00:49:49,510
infrastructure<font color="#CCCCCC"> a system that attempts to</font>

1344
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:53,560
uphold people's constitutional rights so

1345
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:55,120
that's a it's a it's a it's it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

research community thinks but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I i</font>

1349
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:03,040
present it for you for<font color="#E5E5E5"> food for thought</font>

1350
00:50:00,940 --> 00:50:05,470
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to be around all weekend</font>

1351
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:08,140
to to potentially discuss it if you're

1352
00:50:05,470 --> 00:50:10,419
interested so there's one other point I

1353
00:50:08,140 --> 00:50:13,210
want to make and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that is that the peer</font>

1354
00:50:10,420 --> 00:50:15,910
review<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really important this is how</font>

1355
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:18,760
we build secure systems nobody in the

1356
00:50:15,910 --> 00:50:21,009
world is building follow software

1357
00:50:18,760 --> 00:50:22,480
systems every you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know and this</font>

1358
00:50:21,010 --> 00:50:23,620
conference for years has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a place</font>

1359
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:25,570
<font color="#E5E5E5">where we come to discuss security</font>

1360
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:27,910
vulnerabilities and the way we do it is

1361
00:50:25,570 --> 00:50:29,530
by looking at the through peer review by

1362
00:50:27,910 --> 00:50:31,089
looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at other peoples technology and</font>

1363
00:50:29,530 --> 00:50:33,700
through a different<font color="#E5E5E5"> perspective and</font>

1364
00:50:31,090 --> 00:50:37,180
seeing things that they haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen so</font>

1365
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:38,799
what Cisco did here is as they publish

1366
00:50:37,180 --> 00:50:41,080
this architecture so that we can peer

1367
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:43,420
review it and that's a that's a great

1368
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:44,710
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> and it's it's risky to do that</font>

1369
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:45,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">because somebody</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is going to get up at a</font>

1370
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:48,760
conference and they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font>

1371
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:50,649
about their technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you know they</font>

1372
00:50:48,760 --> 00:50:52,240
and and you know nobody likes to be

1373
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:53,710
criticized but the reality is that it's

1374
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:56,169
through this process of criticism that

1375
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:59,440
we actually achieve secure systems and

1376
00:50:56,170 --> 00:51:02,020
and you all know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so I think I think</font>

1377
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:04,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know Cisco should be applauded for</font>

1378
00:51:02,020 --> 00:51:06,670
for for actually providing us with this

1379
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:09,010
architecture to review and i think that

1380
00:51:06,670 --> 00:51:10,570
there's a whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> bunch of other lawful</font>

1381
00:51:09,010 --> 00:51:11,560
intercept technology out there that's

1382
00:51:10,570 --> 00:51:13,960
actually in our telecommunications

1383
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:16,330
infrastructure that has not been subject

1384
00:51:13,960 --> 00:51:18,280
to any peer review that does<font color="#E5E5E5"> not have</font>

1385
00:51:16,330 --> 00:51:19,600
any public<font color="#E5E5E5"> architectural diagrams there</font>

1386
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:21,760
are all these different vendors that i

1387
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:24,100
mentioned that make mediation devices

1388
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:25,900
for example and and who's looking at

1389
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:29,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">that stuff to see if it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vulnerable</font>

1390
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:32,260
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> yesterday Barnaby Jack jackpot</font>

1391
00:51:29,950 --> 00:51:34,060
in an ATM on stage here and and people

1392
00:51:32,260 --> 00:51:35,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">tend to have this assumption that ATMs</font>

1393
00:51:34,060 --> 00:51:36,790
would be pretty secure

1394
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:38,589
the guys who would build stuff like that

1395
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:40,119
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> really care about building</font>

1396
00:51:38,589 --> 00:51:42,279
something that was as solid as possible

1397
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:43,839
but in fact when<font color="#CCCCCC"> you really look at it</font>

1398
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:45,550
it turns out it's it's you know there

1399
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:46,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">are weaknesses well that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> same thing</font>

1400
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:48,460
is true of just about any<font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of</font>

1401
00:51:46,960 --> 00:51:50,170
<font color="#E5E5E5">technical system that we've deployed and</font>

1402
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:52,000
so until somebody actually does<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1403
00:51:50,170 --> 00:51:55,359
kind of analysis and looks at it we

1404
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:57,460
can't be assured of its security so so

1405
00:51:55,359 --> 00:52:00,069
um peer review is important and that's

1406
00:51:57,460 --> 00:52:01,300
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> my talk thank you very</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much for</font>

1407
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:03,160
listening to me I hope<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was</font>

1408
00:52:01,300 --> 00:52:13,470
interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> and again I'm gonna be</font>

around sir

1410
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:32,479
one second someone can correct me if<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font>

1411
00:52:30,980 --> 00:52:36,860
wrong but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know of any country</font>

1412
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:41,119
that currently requires key escrow it

1413
00:52:36,860 --> 00:52:44,690
was a it was a it was an idea<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font>

1417
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:57,380
choice Sookie disclosure is sort of a

1418
00:52:53,570 --> 00:52:59,540
different so no the wiretapping

1419
00:52:57,380 --> 00:53:01,490
infrastructure we isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> set up to to</font>

come and they arrest you and they compel

1423

you to give them the key and if you

jail cell until you give<font color="#CCCCCC"> it to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them so</font>

1426
00:53:10,730 --> 00:53:14,480
that's it's it's a it's a that's a very

1427
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:18,580
human approach as opposed to a technical

1428
00:53:14,480 --> 00:53:18,580
approach sir

1429
00:53:27,400 --> 00:53:33,839
that's right

1430
00:53:30,390 --> 00:53:36,180
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> assuming they can enforce that rule</font>

1431
00:53:33,839 --> 00:53:37,740
but if they start looking at your stuff

1432
00:53:36,180 --> 00:53:44,629
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's encrypted then you know they</font>

1433
00:53:37,740 --> 00:53:44,629
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> bust you for that that's right yeah</font>

1434
00:53:49,940 --> 00:53:51,940
Oh

1435
00:53:58,119 --> 00:54:05,740
I mean I I believe that that no I mean I

1436
00:54:02,529 --> 00:54:09,789
haven't I I know that you know Cisco did

1437
00:54:05,740 --> 00:54:12,549
you know read my research and I I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

1438
00:54:09,789 --> 00:54:15,130
that you know it takes<font color="#E5E5E5"> a long time to to</font>

1439
00:54:12,549 --> 00:54:17,619
<font color="#E5E5E5">change some of these systems for example</font>

1440
00:54:15,130 --> 00:54:18,880
the SNMP I<font color="#CCCCCC"> guess</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so this guy at SNMP</font>

1441
00:54:17,619 --> 00:54:21,130
research reached out to me and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

1442
00:54:18,880 --> 00:54:22,630
they make their own custom SNMP stuff

1443
00:54:21,130 --> 00:54:24,279
and he said I read<font color="#E5E5E5"> your paper your</font>

1444
00:54:22,630 --> 00:54:25,480
recommendations for the SNMP protocol

1445
00:54:24,279 --> 00:54:27,700
make a lot of sense and you can

1446
00:54:25,480 --> 00:54:29,140
implement them without a flag day do you

1447
00:54:27,700 --> 00:54:31,779
have any customers that are demanding

1448
00:54:29,140 --> 00:54:32,980
them and and I don't have customers that

1449
00:54:31,779 --> 00:54:35,200
are saying we need to make these changes

1450
00:54:32,980 --> 00:54:36,670
I'm out<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about this because I'm</font>

1451
00:54:35,200 --> 00:54:38,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">trying to raise awareness about it to a</font>

1452
00:54:36,670 --> 00:54:41,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">certain extent but until the people that</font>

1453
00:54:38,740 --> 00:54:43,749
until the phone companies actually want

1454
00:54:41,079 --> 00:54:46,720
a you know Cisco<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make these changes</font>

1455
00:54:43,749 --> 00:54:48,249
or want any other SNMP implementer to

1456
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:50,410
make these changes they're not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

1457
00:54:48,249 --> 00:54:52,029
get made it's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's their</font>

1458
00:54:50,410 --> 00:54:53,558
business relationship and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so all I can</font>

1459
00:54:52,029 --> 00:54:54,999
do is say this is what I think hopefully

1460
00:54:53,559 --> 00:54:58,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">the next time they designed this they'll</font>

1461
00:54:54,999 --> 00:54:59,649
consider my suggestions but in<font color="#CCCCCC"> terms of</font>

1462
00:54:58,180 --> 00:55:02,288
actually we are<font color="#E5E5E5"> collecting the stuff in</font>

1463
00:54:59,650 --> 00:55:04,059
practice it's for the the vendors to to

1464
00:55:02,289 --> 00:55:06,089
decide so let me get this question back

1465
00:55:04,059 --> 00:55:06,089
here

1466
00:55:13,100 --> 00:55:18,920
well you'd have to establish at least

1467
00:55:17,330 --> 00:55:20,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">the United</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> States and again I'm not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1468
00:55:18,920 --> 00:55:21,800
lawyer so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ask one of the eff people</font>

1469
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:23,540
but I think you have to establish

1470
00:55:21,800 --> 00:55:25,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">standing and so you've</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> got to actually</font>

1471
00:55:23,540 --> 00:55:28,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">demonstrate that you were personally</font>

1472
00:55:25,520 --> 00:55:29,450
subject to unauthorized surveillance as

1473
00:55:28,190 --> 00:55:32,240
a consequence of these vulnerabilities

1474
00:55:29,450 --> 00:55:38,270
and that's very difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> to establish</font>

1475
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:40,220
so well well the reality is that the

1476
00:55:38,270 --> 00:55:41,390
court system won't they won't consider

1477
00:55:40,220 --> 00:55:42,830
your case unless you can demonstrate

1478
00:55:41,390 --> 00:55:57,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">that you actually have meaningful harm</font>

1479
00:55:42,830 --> 00:56:03,860
going oh no<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I don't know I have no</font>

1480
00:55:57,290 --> 00:56:06,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">idea I and I again I I'd like to</font>

1481
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:08,990
understand the purpose well I do

1482
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:12,470
understand the purpose behind the the

1483
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:13,430
the lack of audit trails they don't want

1484
00:56:12,470 --> 00:56:15,500
the people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who work for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the phone</font>

1485
00:56:13,430 --> 00:56:17,240
company to know what they're doing but I

1486
00:56:15,500 --> 00:56:18,770
again I feel like there's another way to

1487
00:56:17,240 --> 00:56:20,660
design it so that that problem doesn't

1488
00:56:18,770 --> 00:56:24,080
exist and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I think that basically we</font>

1489
00:56:20,660 --> 00:56:25,850
can we can we can we can achieve an

1490
00:56:24,080 --> 00:56:29,060
architecture that satisfies everyone's

1491
00:56:25,850 --> 00:56:31,160
interest but I you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't know if</font>

1492
00:56:29,060 --> 00:56:33,740
we'll be able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> have that dialogue or</font>

1493
00:56:31,160 --> 00:56:34,970
how we will have it except that<font color="#E5E5E5"> except</font>

1494
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:39,700
coming here and talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> and hoping</font>

1495
00:56:34,970 --> 00:56:39,700
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> people are listening sir</font>

1496
00:56:43,670 --> 00:56:49,940
so sir yeah there's lots of thoughts in

1497
00:56:48,710 --> 00:56:52,700
here that I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get out when I was</font>

1498
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:54,200
speaking so software<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's so new radio</font>

1499
00:56:52,700 --> 00:56:56,000
for example is this really cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> project</font>

1500
00:56:54,200 --> 00:57:00,109
that lets you build software-defined

1501
00:56:56,000 --> 00:57:01,640
radios and so so a protocol analyzer

1502
00:57:00,109 --> 00:57:03,740
like you know back in the day you could

1503
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:05,750
go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> get get a phone within a couple</font>

1504
00:57:03,740 --> 00:57:07,459
of alligator clips and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could go open</font>

1505
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:08,990
a junction<font color="#CCCCCC"> box and hook up to a phone</font>

1506
00:57:07,460 --> 00:57:11,720
line and listen to people's calls it was

1507
00:57:08,990 --> 00:57:13,640
that simple but now if you have if

1508
00:57:11,720 --> 00:57:15,230
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing VoIP over dsl you have</font>

1509
00:57:13,640 --> 00:57:16,609
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole protocol stack it up to parse</font>

1510
00:57:15,230 --> 00:57:18,109
and so it's far more complicated you

1511
00:57:16,609 --> 00:57:23,270
can't just plug in a<font color="#CCCCCC"> fifteen dollar</font>

1512
00:57:18,109 --> 00:57:24,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">device there are companies that sell</font>

1513
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:26,240
protocol analyzers that are used for

1514
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:28,250
that purpose but they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> very expensive</font>

1515
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:31,098
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so they're difficult to which that</font>

1516
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:33,200
they're difficult to get your hands on

1517
00:57:31,099 --> 00:57:34,640
and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> hopefully the inaccessibility of</font>

1518
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:35,808
them has significantly reduced the

1519
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:38,450
amount of illegal wiretapping that

1520
00:57:35,809 --> 00:57:40,880
happens but if new radio can do that

1521
00:57:38,450 --> 00:57:43,578
same kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of protocol analysis then it</font>

1522
00:57:40,880 --> 00:57:45,589
could peel apart the ADSL layer and peel

1523
00:57:43,579 --> 00:57:47,359
apart the void player and and so you

1524
00:57:45,589 --> 00:57:49,369
could then again get to the point where

1525
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:51,770
you take this<font color="#E5E5E5"> laptop running open-source</font>

1526
00:57:49,369 --> 00:57:53,119
software to you know a junction<font color="#CCCCCC"> box and</font>

1527
00:57:51,770 --> 00:57:55,040
plug it in and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> listen to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

1528
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:56,720
stuff and so that's a technical

1529
00:57:55,040 --> 00:57:58,700
direction<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm just pointing out where we</font>

1530
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:00,200
we sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of things got really hard</font>

1531
00:57:58,700 --> 00:58:01,759
because the protocols got complicated

1532
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:04,250
and the systems required to parse them

1533
00:58:01,760 --> 00:58:06,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">are expensive but over time it may get</font>

1534
00:58:04,250 --> 00:58:08,119
cheap again to parse those protocols and

1535
00:58:06,079 --> 00:58:09,530
so I again it's an argument for<font color="#E5E5E5"> why it</font>

1536
00:58:08,119 --> 00:58:12,140
makes sense<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do link layer encryption</font>

1537
00:58:09,530 --> 00:58:14,569
because ultimately if you're not doing

1538
00:58:12,140 --> 00:58:16,009
link layer encryption somebody you know

1539
00:58:14,569 --> 00:58:21,470
can get access<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the infrastructure and</font>

1540
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:23,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">listen to the list of the calls so any</font>

1541
00:58:21,470 --> 00:58:28,089
other questions<font color="#E5E5E5"> or should I shut it down</font>

1542
00:58:23,450 --> 00:58:28,089
thanks<font color="#E5E5E5"> everybody</font>
