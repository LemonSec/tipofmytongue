1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:03,300
yes welcome this is not your structure
track

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,439
uh... strongly ran you can tell there in
a tough vote

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,059
or driving

4
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:12,928
we're driving smarking

5
00:00:12,929 --> 00:00:16,259
the

6
00:00:16,259 --> 00:00:17,609
so actually on

7
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:20,609
actually we were working on that is
actually end up

8
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:23,289
we've got a little behind and so uh...
we actually has created a hot chick

9
00:00:23,289 --> 00:00:27,460
broke while

10
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:28,849
people it was kinda

11
00:00:28,849 --> 00:00:32,628
we did it do instead

12
00:00:32,628 --> 00:00:34,180
mix

13
00:00:34,180 --> 00:00:40,820
which with

14
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,810
so i think account archive money
security assessment team wish on for

15
00:00:44,810 --> 00:00:46,020
fishnet security

16
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:47,780
out we do

17
00:00:47,780 --> 00:00:51,560
penetration testing motorboat
assessments the fact that party job

18
00:00:51,560 --> 00:00:55,980
ready opportunity to look at a lot of
interstates market infrastructure for

19
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,400
part of a long-term engagement or early
this year

20
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:00,820
and eg esol

21
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:04,250
talk about this and think about this and
kinda resulted in the stock yet and

22
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:04,940
uh...

23
00:01:04,940 --> 00:01:08,740
yet make a sellout both of our
qualifications for this work

24
00:01:08,740 --> 00:01:12,229
anne you know i i was going to do this
to a fault but

25
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:13,640
basically one of our sales guys

26
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:17,990
uh... told us that he'd sold a really
big wireless assessment and down

27
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,220
we start talking to a watery you know
what a reassessing the u_s_

28
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:24,230
why it's about three thousand

29
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:27,780
i think advices like two thousand
eyepiece okay yeah that's what we've yet

30
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:29,710
we've done bigger u

31
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:31,429
that were considered abigail

32
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:34,009
pump which i think there are over wifi

33
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:38,090
okay okay yeah now we can where that's a
really big one of several e wanted

34
00:01:38,090 --> 00:01:40,630
collisions installed with without much
traffic

35
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:42,030
and uh...

36
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:43,189
so well

37
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:44,630
sukru

38
00:01:44,630 --> 00:01:49,520
to they kick off with the client and
start talking about it

39
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,009
the the client goes in shows us the bank
of meters

40
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:57,600
and says now it states to stop over here

41
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,619
isn't that why prize at one time

42
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,270
right that's what we thought it was

43
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:02,729
and so

44
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:03,960
we spent a lot of time

45
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,270
uh... try to figure that out

46
00:02:07,270 --> 00:02:09,090
and uh... then they can obtain that

47
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:13,269
they will build up in that area

48
00:02:13,269 --> 00:02:15,530
c_n_n_ bird somewhere

49
00:02:15,530 --> 00:02:16,360
principle that's all

50
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,079
without fish that's assessment team

51
00:02:20,079 --> 00:02:23,519
ancestor by trade

52
00:02:23,519 --> 00:02:25,359
yet i'd be a higher tax they worked it
out

53
00:02:25,359 --> 00:02:27,030
a p_c_r_ parashar

54
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:29,119
as my partner job collagen

55
00:02:29,119 --> 00:02:30,679
karaoke with the saga

56
00:02:30,679 --> 00:02:33,839
but also remarkably resisted too

57
00:02:33,839 --> 00:02:36,129
sustainability temple person

58
00:02:36,129 --> 00:02:41,268
we've confirmed that because i was shut
down in

59
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:43,499
do things like smith my peterson

60
00:02:43,499 --> 00:02:49,269
both the cases in essence applica

61
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:50,930
so yeh bhi

62
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:53,649
general of the general kind of overall
topic they were really

63
00:02:53,649 --> 00:02:55,739
on about yours

64
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:57,190
smart grading utility radio

65
00:02:57,190 --> 00:03:00,120
and also condemned the radios well
slotted things we're talking about are

66
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,059
awesome in use in places where

67
00:03:02,059 --> 00:03:04,169
it's not necessarily

68
00:03:04,169 --> 00:03:08,169
smart grid perset

69
00:03:08,169 --> 00:03:10,189
so talking abt

70
00:03:10,189 --> 00:03:13,668
all the wild stuff that hooks all these
different pieces together

71
00:03:13,669 --> 00:03:17,579
all of the new invents things are coming
out the easiest way to general to lay

72
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:18,929
that out

73
00:03:18,929 --> 00:03:21,640
with little infrastructure requirements

74
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:26,428
all take place in the air around us

75
00:03:26,429 --> 00:03:27,919
it actually not just a in

76
00:03:27,919 --> 00:03:28,730
two p_m_

77
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,138
i've talked to you uh...

78
00:03:30,139 --> 00:03:32,739
people in other utilities gas water
things like that work

79
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:35,900
they're still looking at that a lot of
the same kind of technology sabha

80
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:41,189
fewer to collect data is a manager for
mation

81
00:03:41,189 --> 00:03:44,129
you all their distribution points to use
all the stuff is still kind of applicant

82
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:44,779
pool

83
00:03:44,779 --> 00:03:45,709
there as well

84
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:49,259
on they've been a lot slower to hit up
so you obviously the electoral you

85
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:51,268
utilities where a lot of us is going on

86
00:03:51,269 --> 00:03:53,009
pretty quickly right now

87
00:03:53,009 --> 00:03:55,219
pumping a lot of estrogen

88
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:56,230
pump as

89
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:59,559
some people probably know by the yet the
stimulus funds

90
00:03:59,559 --> 00:04:02,279
that'd be an issue to a number of
utilities

91
00:04:02,279 --> 00:04:05,418
the the students money actually

92
00:04:05,419 --> 00:04:06,469
ob

93
00:04:06,469 --> 00:04:10,519
part of the or the funds for the the
overall stimulus plan were were set

94
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:11,159
aside for

95
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:14,259
quote-unquote green energy and smart
grid

96
00:04:14,259 --> 00:04:16,279
and those are all here mark

97
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:19,819
that they had a a especially shelf life
of two years and so you have utilities

98
00:04:19,819 --> 00:04:20,669
that

99
00:04:20,668 --> 00:04:22,539
maybe had

100
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:25,699
of thousand five hundred nope highly

101
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:27,060
smart grid meters

102
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:27,790
sitting around

103
00:04:27,790 --> 00:04:31,970
that now all of a sudden are going oh
crap its wire the entire state

104
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:36,520
and let's review before you run out of
funds

105
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:39,940
so yes and some of the dead some some
other standards un

106
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:44,440
there's some of this that that is
available in my cancer documentation

107
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:45,740
or otherwise

108
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,930
discount openly document it and we have
access to it and then there's a fair

109
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:51,280
amount of stuff that happened under the
hood un

110
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,378
bill and often be referred to and and
literally as what their secret sauce

111
00:04:55,379 --> 00:04:58,779
and it's the kind of thing that

112
00:04:58,779 --> 00:05:01,509
that you just don't know about it he
start digging into i'm sorry that have

113
00:05:01,509 --> 00:05:05,179
been trade secret information we can
actually go into details about the

114
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:07,958
that's that's that's the standard answer
if you're a

115
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:12,349
if you call it the vendor estimate that
some stuff

116
00:05:12,349 --> 00:05:16,150
absurd yet tinnitus play really reached
with the rat rapid adoption the fast

117
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:17,219
track to go

118
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,389
tends to be good to start produced
together wireless

119
00:05:21,389 --> 00:05:23,979
actually coming to paris analogy here is
up

120
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:25,489
uh... africa

121
00:05:25,489 --> 00:05:27,780
in in terms of cellular service so

122
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:30,549
united states all of our cellular
structure still a lot of as what wired

123
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:31,900
into the hood

124
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:35,650
we have boldness wired infrastructure
africa actually leapfrog like that

125
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:39,068
because they related documents have been
empty

126
00:05:39,069 --> 00:05:40,240
setting all this stuff

127
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,380
ought be a wireless

128
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:44,289
let's go with the utilities with so

129
00:05:44,289 --> 00:05:46,449
they may have some of these things that
are

130
00:05:46,449 --> 00:05:50,550
some control pieces or some monitoring
component that's bits on some kind of

131
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,690
wired network now

132
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:54,850
but when you want to turn up at the very
large infrastructure very quickly before

133
00:05:54,850 --> 00:05:56,779
you run out of money

134
00:05:56,779 --> 00:05:57,599
they're not

135
00:05:57,599 --> 00:06:01,878
the wireless probably the fastest

136
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:05,610
writer sonya so i can send rapid
adoption alum

137
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:07,710
and as a missionary m minimal

138
00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:10,128
minimal level of infrastructure that's
required

139
00:06:10,129 --> 00:06:12,770
dippings uvm

140
00:06:12,770 --> 00:06:16,448
so there's not manasu anything wrong
with that approach as we looked a lot of

141
00:06:16,449 --> 00:06:17,129
this

142
00:06:17,129 --> 00:06:18,680
and it is a lot of

143
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,969
osman norris and it's an issue right now

144
00:06:20,969 --> 00:06:23,639
and specifically in this particular
topic

145
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:25,249
and um...

146
00:06:25,249 --> 00:06:27,800
there's nothing inherently bad

147
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:31,069
about these two bs ticket types of
projects

148
00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:33,360
then why was that that we stop overall

149
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:34,849
of runs the entire gamut from

150
00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:37,270
you know awful to two great

151
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,929
say there's nothing

152
00:06:39,929 --> 00:06:43,080
inherently bad about it but just given
the level of complexity the newness of

153
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:45,000
the vendors the news of the tech

154
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:50,679
there's certainly a lot of fail

155
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:54,649
for football is worth a lot of these
things we're seeing actually of a lot of

156
00:06:54,649 --> 00:06:55,980
vendors in this space

157
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,789
that specialize in

158
00:06:57,789 --> 00:06:59,609
co sourcing

159
00:06:59,609 --> 00:07:03,878
so bidders will actually come in and and
to run the whole rollout in

160
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:07,030
run deployment run the infrastructure
for utilities and handed over them

161
00:07:07,030 --> 00:07:08,549
you know after fat

162
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,439
to manage and

163
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:11,080
you know there's a

164
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:13,438
there's an entire marketing

165
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:16,110
utility space

166
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:17,209
blowing up right now

167
00:07:17,209 --> 00:07:20,519
with coming in and in running these use
marker grow up for the utilities are

168
00:07:20,519 --> 00:07:23,520
pushing stuff without

169
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,008
the utilities don't necessarily have the
right ask the questions ask this isn't

170
00:07:27,009 --> 00:07:30,369
necessarily their you know there without

171
00:07:30,369 --> 00:07:31,979
and so you're going from

172
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:35,300
you may be some limited pilot rollout

173
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:38,810
citywide statewide infrastructure all
over wireless and and they don't

174
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:41,960
necessarily notary questions asked

175
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,430
itgi particular uh... too

176
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:47,050
james our lives

177
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:50,919
points in in his talk earlier you know
we kind of we have the folks that i

178
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:52,539
understand the skin

179
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:54,180
and understand the backside

180
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:57,400
and how those pieces work and have been
in that industry for what's what's yours

181
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,359
again how all those pieces work

182
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:02,150
and then we have things like wireless
where

183
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,438
those are the kinds of questions that
you should be asked me are really not

184
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:06,550
that different from what you would be
asking

185
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:08,740
about how some of the setup

186
00:08:08,740 --> 00:08:14,129
into lebanon and dubuque etude how do
you handle you've searching and

187
00:08:14,129 --> 00:08:17,430
authentication break up with it the big
giant difference being that

188
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,580
in those cases

189
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:21,169
their gigantic open standards that this
industries

190
00:08:21,169 --> 00:08:22,409
vita death

191
00:08:22,409 --> 00:08:23,659
a long period of time

192
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:27,110
as opposed to something that was rapidly
developed bomb

193
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:32,239
maybe somebody's spare time in the
basement startup

194
00:08:32,239 --> 00:08:34,540
has not had any money in that same level
of scrutiny

195
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:38,919
right then and in fairness that's not
necessarily always the case right

196
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:42,919
but yen you actually if you go out and
you read vendor websites for the stuff

197
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,449
not

198
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:47,580
not just a minute urs but this margaret
technology in general

199
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:50,640
they will actually use things like
proprietary encryption is a selling

200
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,860
point

201
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:54,960
and describe that as you know this is a
disagreed asset we have that we have

202
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,789
this this proprietary protocol

203
00:08:56,789 --> 00:09:00,069
and artery infection that

204
00:09:00,070 --> 00:09:02,080
nobody is successfully broken before

205
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,850
to look at

206
00:09:04,850 --> 00:09:06,010
nobody

207
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:08,620
yet yet at getting a commonly see is m

208
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:11,920
they are all they dickey buzz words that
everybody's come to expect so

209
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:14,400
so if there are the word eight yes right
and then

210
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,530
the people on the other end of it they
don't really know of a lot about the

211
00:09:17,530 --> 00:09:19,430
details of how he got stuff works

212
00:09:19,430 --> 00:09:22,709
his eighth never had to do it for their
job

213
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:25,620
bill does it end all credo cases that's
all occurred dot

214
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:27,350
physical

215
00:09:27,350 --> 00:09:30,900
not not necessarily all because
brightness is one small component of an

216
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,730
overall architecture that all has to
work together fit

217
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:35,530
and if it doesn't then

218
00:09:35,530 --> 00:09:38,160
it's really no different than yet
project

219
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,219
property writing in yen tam patch it is
made the point of number of times that

220
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:45,820
uh... yet most of the most of them
looking at crypto working management

221
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,440
things like that

222
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,760
it's not really about even finding them

223
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,370
a flaw in the crypto itself its

224
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:54,260
in the implementation waits and waits
weight set up

225
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,620
and uh...

226
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,520
yeah a lot of his pieces

227
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,280
that the people who make these products
elections are not

228
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:05,810
though those questions asked

229
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:09,390
so just email me enters you did try to
get the separate for just a policy

230
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:11,980
permanent just kinda nail this down

231
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:13,480
so the things they were talking about
here

232
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:14,560
it airline

233
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:18,199
you'll you'll get a lot events we turn
at the structured

234
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,880
you also have

235
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:21,150
itamar

236
00:10:21,150 --> 00:10:22,230
bob which is

237
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:23,309
just remote

238
00:10:23,309 --> 00:10:24,209
read

239
00:10:24,209 --> 00:10:25,979
capabilities and things like that and
that's part of

240
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:28,170
that's going to really dot reproach

241
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:30,329
most of you probably have this

242
00:10:30,330 --> 00:10:32,730
i know that i did

243
00:10:32,730 --> 00:10:36,770
if you've if you walk out if you've had
your readers what they are you have

244
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:39,199
output l_e_d_ instead of big dial
sternum

245
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:40,010
right product

246
00:10:40,010 --> 00:10:41,950
if you look at you usually see

247
00:10:41,950 --> 00:10:44,280
uh... something about cellular

248
00:10:44,280 --> 00:10:48,069
barbecue poll information off of your
look up the model and things like that

249
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:50,550
it's probably work ever cellular network
that's what a lot of stuff that i was

250
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:52,140
doing

251
00:10:52,140 --> 00:10:53,810
kind of the total r

252
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:56,930
bob in when you talk easily studio in
that they're like yeah we're not really

253
00:10:56,930 --> 00:11:00,510
so sure about how this other stuff to
work out so we're just going to we're

254
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:01,780
just going to get

255
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,949
basically they gain

256
00:11:02,949 --> 00:11:05,758
remote disconnect the remote read
they're not walking up two meters in

257
00:11:05,759 --> 00:11:06,450
reading

258
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:09,170
every day off of the having guys in
trucks given anymore

259
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:10,300
so thats

260
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:13,109
that's kind of the first wave

261
00:11:13,110 --> 00:11:14,970
the radio if a structure

262
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,160
without yet so

263
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,110
radio tech you do you have everything
across the board you've got

264
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,549
surprise terry armour

265
00:11:21,549 --> 00:11:26,850
which e to be honest allot of unmade
themselves because it there wasn't

266
00:11:26,850 --> 00:11:27,670
at the time

267
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,130
a agood

268
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:32,850
you know product out there at a good
protocol out there that would do it they

269
00:11:32,850 --> 00:11:37,580
need andi think about the the type of
uh... of environment

270
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:40,980
meters and other types of the structure
like this needs to operate in you've got

271
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,810
very low throughput requirements and
it's not like

272
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:47,229
your doing what's right and your house
or something it's it's very

273
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:47,860
small

274
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:50,530
blitz information probably spaced out
across you know

275
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:54,630
may fifteen minutes an hour longer or
just infrequent commands the cumin and

276
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:57,100
onion i want to come back

277
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:59,690
and really just to make sure that gets
there

278
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:02,480
you need to have some amount of u

279
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,130
fault-tolerant spills and so that you
can go through like brick walls

280
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:08,279
and it can bounce around all these
different buildings

281
00:12:08,279 --> 00:12:11,170
and be able to get you got and there
were not a lot of great office lots of

282
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:12,060
some of them

283
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,079
made themselves

284
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:16,990
yet a sublease technologists like once
we uh...

285
00:12:16,990 --> 00:12:18,000
got rid of it

286
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,600
and and looked at

287
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,920
the high seas in the in the designs in
actually pulled in and we'll get to some

288
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,790
that little bit

289
00:12:23,790 --> 00:12:25,380
both things like and oxen stopped

290
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:28,120
you know these are companies that
particular wireless tech

291
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,930
in a day created fifteen twenty years
ago so that you couldn't

292
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,420
meeting you wouldn't be talking about

293
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:38,510
even things like a video or or signi or
other step is options work

294
00:12:38,510 --> 00:12:39,700
that was

295
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:43,330
you sort of design with that mindset

296
00:12:43,330 --> 00:12:46,070
in some cases than actually pipe

297
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:48,660
sick irrelevant are talking doesn't
apply to write this

298
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,819
bob in some cases you're actually seeing

299
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,480
all power line

300
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:56,490
the salads i think like extent

301
00:12:56,490 --> 00:13:00,280
that's not probably entirely fair
assessment

302
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:02,970
utilities are using the actual power
oneself as a transport

303
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,919
uh... rather than radios

304
00:13:04,919 --> 00:13:07,689
benders you know there's a lot of
rationale that usurping use your own

305
00:13:07,689 --> 00:13:10,040
wire dystrophy or you have

306
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:11,620
you know piggy-back on what happened

307
00:13:11,620 --> 00:13:17,340
for your network in in europe the
structure exxon ascent

308
00:13:17,340 --> 00:13:18,740
suddenly see

309
00:13:18,740 --> 00:13:22,530
yet you know across the board in a lot
of places even that that is simple level

310
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:25,079
is aladdin's substations and

311
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,470
every closures and

312
00:13:26,470 --> 00:13:29,070
and report the structure

313
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:31,790
or already on may be some kind of mail
to one

314
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:34,900
or winter fifty sixty minor motive

315
00:13:34,900 --> 00:13:37,650
on so that's good allot of the

316
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,100
what about sites up

317
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:41,950
and a lot of stuff that people
particularly hurt the people that we

318
00:13:41,950 --> 00:13:44,040
talked until it hurts i did get rid of

319
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:50,480
for ever treat it's rather expensive to
run to you on lines out individual

320
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,130
that's the end of the comes cost-benefit
going with

321
00:13:53,130 --> 00:13:56,330
but some kind of wireless techniques

322
00:13:56,330 --> 00:13:57,399
so

323
00:13:57,399 --> 00:14:00,800
again until one ax another another
common city-wide planning that we've

324
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,900
seen

325
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:04,750
one excessive edge of it being

326
00:14:04,750 --> 00:14:09,590
a again open standard that has had some
amount of people looking at it

327
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:13,580
you'll still run into ports
configuration types things configuration

328
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:14,740
types of problems

329
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:18,660
possibly implementation problems so that
maybe if the uh...

330
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,319
detective's cell for on paper

331
00:14:20,319 --> 00:14:21,498
looks great

332
00:14:21,499 --> 00:14:25,009
we've seen some problems and some of the
individual devices and how they're made

333
00:14:25,009 --> 00:14:28,849
and how they're hard himself oftentimes
a little exeter you know politics' boxes

334
00:14:28,849 --> 00:14:34,100
that have all the things you expect to
go with that

335
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,000
and it's it's got beat

336
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:39,420
it you know and i guess i should i
should clarify that when we say one x

337
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:42,490
here this is in our spirits not been

338
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:43,390
wimax like

339
00:14:43,390 --> 00:14:46,580
with the way you get a permit wimax
being sort of nice p or something along

340
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:51,320
those lines whether you know blinking a
city with the network so that you can do

341
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:54,520
that at the data transfer that he's a
private wimax networks that would be

342
00:14:54,520 --> 00:14:55,270
citywide

343
00:14:55,270 --> 00:15:01,410
right so the owned by utility or
substantially provider

344
00:15:01,410 --> 00:15:04,810
impactful for all those individual
devices with them

345
00:15:04,810 --> 00:15:08,689
then imports works if you can play a
properly you have a lot of the same

346
00:15:08,689 --> 00:15:09,730
yeah i sort of

347
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:13,700
i would say like the in a nutshell
definition of of a lot of at the white

348
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:17,800
expect is that the it inherits a lot of
stuff for 'em it for me to eleven so it

349
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:21,800
has increase your search in the ability
to dot indicate clients on a per client

350
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:25,530
basis to do

351
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:29,079
encryption all these are the come thinks
we can be set up like locking outskirts

352
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:32,440
it's it's not terrible

353
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,090
you still have in the in obviously a lot
of people prove that out with clearance

354
00:15:36,090 --> 00:15:39,300
of the other arabs just a lot of ways to
join at work but actually if you have a

355
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:40,130
device

356
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:41,730
and you do have

357
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:45,200
it which is unfortunate subsidize the
are going to be here for the proprietary

358
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:45,730
stuff

359
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:47,480
on you have consumer

360
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,470
devices that you can bite

361
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:55,790
made make it possible for you to it was
captured

362
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:56,870
ziggy stuff and we had

363
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:59,450
yes more stuff on zigbee general on

364
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:02,720
there's a gentleman with dreadlocks
around here somewhere that goes

365
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:05,870
probably way more than what evernote
about the topics as

366
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:07,180
so we're not going to

367
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,628
bracketed detected at that

368
00:16:08,629 --> 00:16:10,970
it that is something that

369
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:13,499
you're seeing a lot of allot of the
infrastructure

370
00:16:13,499 --> 00:16:16,419
ob actually not just for second-most
below that

371
00:16:16,419 --> 00:16:18,780
zigbee is four home area networks

372
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:22,740
and four your consumer devices in the
home thermostats and refrigerators on so

373
00:16:22,740 --> 00:16:23,700
that kinda stuff

374
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:28,290
but they're also bob in my vendors that
are using zigbee back all types of for

375
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:32,300
neighborhood as well

376
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,258
of course

377
00:16:33,259 --> 00:16:37,199
cellular networks as you know we already
mentioned uh... oftentimes you'll see

378
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:41,380
cellular networks for back all the plug
into some other type of

379
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:42,580
does

380
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:46,530
blanket r f or by the type of network

381
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:48,619
it issues is that simply as you know

382
00:16:48,619 --> 00:16:51,920
internet back on some cases in italy
just enough straight over the internet

383
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,319
in some sort of uh... you know
encapsulated eager to tell

384
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,100
in when you start looking at at ease in
a device is and all the different types

385
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:03,130
of options you get with them and the
things the plugin those come with some

386
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,410
sort of

387
00:17:04,410 --> 00:17:07,400
b_b_d_o_ or seen air keep your hands

388
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:09,050
yellow has the same

389
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:12,480
a lot of the same disadvantages to
nailed circuit which is that u

390
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:16,319
where the reasons why actually wimax is
getting a lot of adoptions that

391
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:18,319
utilities can

392
00:17:18,319 --> 00:17:22,250
get devices and get you know permission
to to practice on on

393
00:17:22,250 --> 00:17:25,280
gives some real perspective

394
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:28,840
used them to become their own telco for
their own i speak in in mind that

395
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:29,740
infrastructure

396
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:31,710
whereas you know in the case of

397
00:17:31,710 --> 00:17:32,680
something light

398
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,680
using sprints networker or rising to
wherever they are

399
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:39,570
unit cost is less than went into the
ones but they're still

400
00:17:39,570 --> 00:17:40,780
they're still paying for

401
00:17:40,780 --> 00:17:44,450
you fervently and service

402
00:17:44,450 --> 00:17:48,460
so yet wait we do see we we have seen
some wifi myspace too

403
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,810
which we had a lot

404
00:17:49,810 --> 00:17:51,710
yeah actual yet through it

405
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:54,030
right on strip of the five website

406
00:17:54,030 --> 00:17:55,649
and our

407
00:17:55,650 --> 00:17:57,720
with

408
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,049
limited configuration capabilities and
things like

409
00:18:00,049 --> 00:18:01,650
yet aud

410
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:02,620
bs casing

411
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,179
new certs opposite

412
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:08,200
there's yeah there's a vendor that
that's their example in in the aim i'm a

413
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:09,260
bit

414
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:13,629
we use please like white suburban
standard anybody can you set

415
00:18:13,630 --> 00:18:17,140
yeah work were kind of incumbents there
too i mean

416
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:18,820
the

417
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:23,580
the issues what's a sentence that unit
intervention about

418
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:27,470
you know why tax which also plans to be
that it's it's it's been opens bet

419
00:18:27,470 --> 00:18:29,210
joke vertical you can get the gear

420
00:18:29,210 --> 00:18:31,960
you know obviously we all have it

421
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:34,080
in a case of wi-fi

422
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,659
but there's also you know there's also a
lot of narrative at as far as

423
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:41,480
u_s_ utility can also see what the hell
you know

424
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,850
pretty pretty easily said

425
00:18:43,850 --> 00:18:49,780
baby yoghurt either good or bad yes

426
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,870
we've got to get on some of that hard is
it you know homer network you have

427
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:55,439
neighbors area networks and also back
calls

428
00:18:55,440 --> 00:19:00,050
on some kind of arab and management work
in their management

429
00:19:00,050 --> 00:19:03,050
is you typically some kind of control
channel for all these devices whether

430
00:19:03,050 --> 00:19:04,428
the meters or whether it be

431
00:19:04,429 --> 00:19:08,060
you know substations are or anything
else

432
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:12,210
yet and and when you get down to it
really again today it's all

433
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:17,270
old-school stay at st yet that somehow
the bolted into some sort of your attack

434
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:19,950
in general all the protocols that are
used

435
00:19:19,950 --> 00:19:21,320
are old

436
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:24,178
been defines as a bit like the anti
standard size

437
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:25,650
the things that we messed with

438
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:26,690
but

439
00:19:26,690 --> 00:19:29,350
all all been around for a long time and
head have just

440
00:19:29,350 --> 00:19:32,149
been converted and bolted into

441
00:19:32,150 --> 00:19:34,040
right and

442
00:19:34,040 --> 00:19:36,280
fundamentally that's a lot of these
devices were committed it's all very

443
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:39,670
well understood

444
00:19:39,670 --> 00:19:43,800
ultimately yet somewhere in that you
know in that transit somewhere somewhere

445
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:46,080
down one you're talking

446
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,080
subscale protocol

447
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,250
uh... a couple of the

448
00:19:50,250 --> 00:19:53,169
they my benders heads built their own

449
00:19:53,169 --> 00:19:54,450
essentially

450
00:19:54,450 --> 00:19:55,760
transports that allow them to talk

451
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,010
in particular uh... sequel nineteen inch
what we want to get it

452
00:20:00,010 --> 00:20:02,830
escapist expert provocative two meters

453
00:20:02,830 --> 00:20:06,639
so they've their or their secret sauce
is that they have their wacky protocol

454
00:20:06,639 --> 00:20:08,469
built italy's just talking

455
00:20:08,470 --> 00:20:13,450
yet skated to meager max

456
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:16,800
yet then yeah i just sort of we're
adoptions at right now

457
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:22,980
the and that's it's got a lot that
obviously um... california

458
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:26,960
pacific gas electric is not because we
are sick and i can name it

459
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:30,730
has done a lot in the space there's a
lot of that going on their spam

460
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,160
basically the way the stimulus money
laid out

461
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,150
oddly

462
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:38,250
they identified utilities in

463
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:41,550
each quadrant of the u_s_ and different
utilities can try to come disperse that

464
00:20:41,550 --> 00:20:42,299
money

465
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:43,070
uniquely

466
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,659
so there's there's little pockets where
the steps moving really fast and there's

467
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:47,460
other pockets where it's

468
00:20:47,460 --> 00:20:48,890
in slowed option

469
00:20:48,890 --> 00:20:50,779
actually on no one here you can see

470
00:20:50,779 --> 00:20:54,049
actually a more vicious verses a mile
someone on here so

471
00:20:54,049 --> 00:20:59,840
that you'll see a lot more that

472
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:01,020
ultimately

473
00:21:01,020 --> 00:21:03,430
what what we're doing is that we we've
given

474
00:21:03,430 --> 00:21:06,620
some means to join a network to everyone
who's devices

475
00:21:06,620 --> 00:21:07,739
so

476
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:10,450
when you're talking about say leaders

477
00:21:10,450 --> 00:21:13,030
then you've given

478
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,980
device and stuck at someone's house

479
00:21:14,980 --> 00:21:18,560
now there's lots of ways even try to
control the roundout again today

480
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:20,250
you've given them

481
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,510
detected needs to do it right so i can

482
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:25,109
you know i hate if you're not worried
about the

483
00:21:25,109 --> 00:21:28,529
sava lakh right and you just going to be
in a building in snap off the meter

484
00:21:28,529 --> 00:21:30,220
outside and take it on reverse it

485
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:35,180
well in addition what do you about that

486
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:37,219
signing p_k_ i've uh...

487
00:21:37,219 --> 00:21:40,619
all of those types of things that have
to controls that are good things that we

488
00:21:40,619 --> 00:21:42,158
talk about and we do know

489
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,740
ourselves about four

490
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:49,620
with any sort of eternity packard
physical access

491
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:52,500
yen in larger point we usually make
around that

492
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:53,460
is that

493
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,790
that's why

494
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:58,700
moderately publicis importantly
mentioned uteach will nineteen and in

495
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:01,899
the peacekeeper calls are their massive
what exactly

496
00:22:01,899 --> 00:22:04,320
you can pay you can't miss trevor

497
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,958
join it all for this new this whole
reference set of of all of the all the

498
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:08,599
kinds of things

499
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:10,929
so there's there's all kinds of
monitoring

500
00:22:10,930 --> 00:22:12,970
and logging capabilities that would

501
00:22:12,970 --> 00:22:14,700
univ detect hampering

502
00:22:14,700 --> 00:22:16,180
we found that

503
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:19,340
the many many cases like none of that
stuff was on

504
00:22:19,340 --> 00:22:22,909
by default inventor from our

505
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:26,470
all of these test cases and i have
jonathan pollard talk amir tampering i

506
00:22:26,470 --> 00:22:27,690
was

507
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:28,720
unfortunately

508
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,529
on slides

509
00:22:30,529 --> 00:22:32,060
i did not see that but

510
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:33,280
ob on

511
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:36,580
very good i've talked with him about it
you know

512
00:22:36,580 --> 00:22:40,658
ver over email things i mean there's a
lot

513
00:22:40,659 --> 00:22:43,530
very obvious things that you can do to
be yours that

514
00:22:43,530 --> 00:22:45,340
will allow you to

515
00:22:45,340 --> 00:22:47,510
tutsi every device in

516
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:49,240
impair their ability to

517
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:51,110
disconnect your service

518
00:22:51,110 --> 00:22:54,879
modify debated at their utility scene
back and all that

519
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:59,100
and essentially interactive map

520
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:03,539
yet see also you know my kids to stuff
the last year and trusted speeds from

521
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:07,539
neighbors things on or insignia physical
access devices and yuki extraction

522
00:23:07,539 --> 00:23:10,480
voltage but you know that so

523
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:15,240
is this again today you have access to
that

524
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,890
vivekanand mario other overall points
that

525
00:23:17,890 --> 00:23:20,530
kind it was good made if you've heard
well some of those things that they're

526
00:23:20,530 --> 00:23:21,519
trying to do

527
00:23:21,519 --> 00:23:23,500
on what's a video and industry

528
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:24,950
and think about like

529
00:23:24,950 --> 00:23:25,520
satellite

530
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:29,250
think about you contradiction like
current stuff a blue rarity those types

531
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:35,289
of things or save like microsoft in the
xbox or sony playstation acai thing

532
00:23:35,289 --> 00:23:39,400
this has been doing that for

533
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:43,340
a longtime precht and this is what they
what they do all the time around the

534
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,059
clock

535
00:23:44,059 --> 00:23:45,800
and they can't get it

536
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:49,960
they that eventually over those those
protections will fall

537
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,190
that's a really really high bar

538
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:54,579
right inserted to expect him

539
00:23:54,579 --> 00:23:56,820
forces soon

540
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:58,870
someone s designing estimated hasn't had

541
00:23:58,870 --> 00:24:00,770
that level of experience and

542
00:24:00,770 --> 00:24:02,560
protecting

543
00:24:02,560 --> 00:24:03,678
protecting

544
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,370
something that you've been given to
someone in expected them to not be able

545
00:24:06,370 --> 00:24:07,299
to break it apart

546
00:24:07,299 --> 00:24:08,720
an overnight back up

547
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,310
it's a very difficult thing to
accomplish

548
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:13,300
yet and we get we would typically

549
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:16,710
haven't seen even know some of the our
projections that you see on

550
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:20,639
you know other bothered by consumer
vices as far as like fuses in

551
00:24:20,639 --> 00:24:23,520
infuses forget bags and in any other
kind of

552
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,350
you hardware controls around a lot of
stuff like

553
00:24:26,350 --> 00:24:27,790
that it just hasn't

554
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:31,250
lucrative people into the thing that we
like consistently will get is

555
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:33,170
will that's really hard

556
00:24:33,170 --> 00:24:35,260
you know that we take a look

557
00:24:35,260 --> 00:24:37,000
somebody a really long time ago and

558
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,120
it had to make the again the the sack

559
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,389
you sally happened

560
00:24:40,389 --> 00:24:42,169
sort of analogy

561
00:24:42,170 --> 00:24:44,690
on if if any of you have to do

562
00:24:44,690 --> 00:24:47,730
three every box a recording of this
working more like

563
00:24:47,730 --> 00:24:51,490
ice unscrew the cable but

564
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:53,370
you don't do to deal with that stuff is
that

565
00:24:53,370 --> 00:24:56,439
you don't necessarily have to be able to
break

566
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:01,300
you know dot the particular bugler codes
for here for a satellite part yourself

567
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:04,750
he's happily for one person to do insure
that information

568
00:25:04,750 --> 00:25:05,940
so him

569
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:09,370
sampai centimeter stuff you've got these
devices that are out fifteen years

570
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:11,279
haw you expected lifetime

571
00:25:11,279 --> 00:25:13,970
they're very difficult to push updates
to you

572
00:25:13,970 --> 00:25:18,230
you know would you identify something
like that one time

573
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:21,090
post out on some equivalent of

574
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:23,270
uh... d_b_s_ form or whatever

575
00:25:23,270 --> 00:25:25,170
and share that information

576
00:25:25,170 --> 00:25:29,860
than ever but is to have access to it

577
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:31,029
and yet we've hit on

578
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,980
it would fit on some of that

579
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,900
we run into get right to a lot of stuff
where

580
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:39,420
you-know-who what your basically the
proprietary element of their technology

581
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:44,400
with the secret stuff they do as as
being you know something that

582
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:47,490
you know of selling point for the
security devices

583
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:49,170
there's a lot of

584
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:50,919
there's a lot of stuff

585
00:25:50,919 --> 00:25:53,620
liked that bit b_b_c_ deleon

586
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:57,370
both in marking stuff and also just like
in utilizes themselves

587
00:25:57,370 --> 00:25:59,810
there's a lot of cynicism about

588
00:25:59,810 --> 00:26:03,110
you essentially what happens to you

589
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:06,629
how you know how determined it would be

590
00:26:06,630 --> 00:26:08,950
it's really hard to

591
00:26:08,950 --> 00:26:10,930
you know when you think about you know

592
00:26:10,930 --> 00:26:12,410
liquidation that id x parties

593
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:16,240
sat stuff you know i think that anybody
really would have expected that

594
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:19,659
if somebody would have identified into
ice he's the sought a run

595
00:26:19,659 --> 00:26:22,480
in some board on on a case cheated

596
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:25,929
you make it to you it turn into a
toaster whatever whatever dates but

597
00:26:25,929 --> 00:26:28,250
somebody figure it out of it

598
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,740
that's a that's really like a larger
point you make about all these devices

599
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:34,350
has just been he sort of work under the
assumption that they're confident

600
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:41,350
and how you designer towards that

601
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,930
yeah and and

602
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:44,150
to the point about

603
00:26:44,150 --> 00:26:46,670
most of these vendors them

604
00:26:46,670 --> 00:26:47,930
poorly said that

605
00:26:47,930 --> 00:26:51,250
some of it in some of the larger banners
that he had been around our marsalis

606
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:55,480
even the people within that are doing
this stuff

607
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:59,220
tallest bag there new to this implicit
world that's not established yet for

608
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,560
them so

609
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:04,409
uh... they don't have a microsoft sir
correct that

610
00:27:04,410 --> 00:27:06,540
accustomed to dealing with

611
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:10,430
people to find one of the list of
products and have a boiled machine to

612
00:27:10,430 --> 00:27:13,900
ensure that that stuff gets fixed it
gets pushed out

613
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:17,190
right it's sue is very much like what we
used to encounter

614
00:27:17,190 --> 00:27:18,580
m_v_p_ fuse

615
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:21,679
unity in the nineties and stuff like
that you find a bargain cities website

616
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:22,860
you'd call them

617
00:27:22,860 --> 00:27:27,159
you know how i see i gave up you know
what hotel even try that

618
00:27:27,160 --> 00:27:29,460
in the nineties or something you you'd
spots like that

619
00:27:29,460 --> 00:27:30,749
and you've sent an email

620
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:33,809
into the company recall signing up and
say you know look you've got

621
00:27:33,809 --> 00:27:36,600
you know my country's executioner
website you know i'm calling you to help

622
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:38,080
you u

623
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,659
and they were just yelling

624
00:27:39,660 --> 00:27:41,770
you know what i was wrong with you

625
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:43,320
how dare you to do this

626
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:48,040
and it's a lot of its income in saudi

627
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:48,920
very much

628
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,670
we found in dealing with vendors

629
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,430
we had to almost fine

630
00:27:53,430 --> 00:27:56,100
you know or moles inside the
organization that

631
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:56,959
did get it

632
00:27:56,960 --> 00:27:59,799
they would kind of fetus good
information finally get the right person

633
00:27:59,799 --> 00:28:00,809
on the phone

634
00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:02,030
and yet

635
00:28:02,030 --> 00:28:04,049
and they'll fight your battle internal
yet

636
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:06,539
you'd send an email about uh...

637
00:28:06,539 --> 00:28:10,810
what do you know what one minor question
about sort of how did you

638
00:28:10,810 --> 00:28:12,770
signing of messages or something and

639
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:15,010
is somebody would send you a meeting
requested

640
00:28:15,010 --> 00:28:18,360
you'd you call into the the call and it
would be the chief counsel for the

641
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:21,949
company instead of the engineering yet
attack ave

642
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:26,820
admiral

643
00:28:26,820 --> 00:28:30,939
so some stuff that we looked at a
there's you have multiple types of ice

644
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:31,480
is here

645
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:32,930
right you've got

646
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:34,039
ones that really are

647
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:35,219
all just

648
00:28:35,219 --> 00:28:37,340
one prepackaged device the fact that way

649
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:42,559
but submitters have big selling points
on that they're very modular write that

650
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:45,350
the meter can fit with multiple
different types of things frank

651
00:28:45,350 --> 00:28:48,100
or bird to protect the network card for
example

652
00:28:48,100 --> 00:28:49,359
or say a

653
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:51,860
in in in some cases only sings that its

654
00:28:51,860 --> 00:28:53,559
all just ways to

655
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:57,549
interface with some sort of standardized
interface like syria right so there'll

656
00:28:57,549 --> 00:29:01,479
be obvious to protect the products that
will let you hook into your existing

657
00:29:01,479 --> 00:29:02,199
infrastructure

658
00:29:02,199 --> 00:29:07,670
and then just imagine things with it
over there

659
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:11,570
yet and so getting actually york wing if
you go back part of through like the

660
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:14,270
bidders have been in this case roughed
until refer to these things is modems

661
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:17,639
one if you'd like the internet info note
though colin and that's

662
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,650
you know and that's because

663
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:21,190
really under the hood

664
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:22,480
in a lot of cases

665
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:26,470
the the actual gets what's really going
on here is just into serial

666
00:29:26,470 --> 00:29:26,839
communication

667
00:29:26,839 --> 00:29:27,850
that the

668
00:29:27,850 --> 00:29:31,149
then may you may not be getting a
capsule universe i'm kind of other

669
00:29:31,149 --> 00:29:32,540
transporting sent you know

670
00:29:32,540 --> 00:29:35,830
ob you over the air

671
00:29:35,830 --> 00:29:39,178
it really is amo tum and if you can find

672
00:29:39,179 --> 00:29:41,790
that the right needed to write ports to

673
00:29:41,790 --> 00:29:45,540
in fact fuming either neither soldered
on the board

674
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:46,870
worrying a lot of cases in

675
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:50,379
you'd like to mention that the modular
stuff

676
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,680
the with which we

677
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:56,690
shall not main ob hasn't you know as a
ten pin wildly disliked you literally

678
00:29:56,690 --> 00:29:58,030
can talk

679
00:29:58,030 --> 00:30:00,370
you know serial the spots and

680
00:30:00,370 --> 00:30:01,929
you were able to

681
00:30:01,930 --> 00:30:03,729
used at the essentially nick

682
00:30:03,729 --> 00:30:04,620
enjoying them

683
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:09,610
so that they got what we have to really
were mercenary thing where they're right

684
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:10,780
so the

685
00:30:10,780 --> 00:30:14,269
yet so it's a basically get you've got a
meter unit

686
00:30:14,269 --> 00:30:16,070
tunic and started

687
00:30:16,070 --> 00:30:19,720
is suddenly took off of the building
your

688
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:22,330
batallion neighbor left-handed

689
00:30:22,330 --> 00:30:22,978
cut the

690
00:30:22,979 --> 00:30:24,329
at the very secure

691
00:30:24,329 --> 00:30:27,570
little metal came with the

692
00:30:27,570 --> 00:30:28,730
slight what like that

693
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:31,190
it amir are mill near fic

694
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:34,020
um... author there

695
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,370
you can take this device in in a lot of
cases

696
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:40,750
just directly interact

697
00:30:40,750 --> 00:30:43,559
so so with the air

698
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:45,350
with all types of

699
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:47,498
modular by spreading and known

700
00:30:47,499 --> 00:30:49,130
no interfaces

701
00:30:49,130 --> 00:30:51,630
you're going to be able to find such a
documentation on that figure out how to

702
00:30:51,630 --> 00:30:53,809
speak to it

703
00:30:53,809 --> 00:30:56,750
with some cases uh... i think was it

704
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:57,170
could

705
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:58,640
would be ok three

706
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,659
liberty d_p_ three start that they just
released our open-source when it stacked

707
00:31:02,659 --> 00:31:05,760
defer that just in the last couple of
months yet

708
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:08,920
and will probably see more of that as it
goes on

709
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,680
with more of

710
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,480
these types of ice is where you're gonna
be driving yourself

711
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,480
and development schemes that are wanting
to

712
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:21,440
to cut that themselves for for various
freeze-dried understand there's a uh...

713
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,039
divisional it in universe i mean that's
working

714
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:24,960
let's see what kind of

715
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,330
we tend to be more in the open sikorski

716
00:31:28,330 --> 00:31:30,990
the letters that there's a twenty three
stock

717
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:35,020
there was just really centre kochi
license in there is a gpl

718
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:37,139
article by cancer

719
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:38,770
if ross that means

720
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:40,840
you look at the end of the day

721
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,350
you know we can interact with that
device and we can write fuzz there's a

722
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:44,860
lot easier

723
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,809
fixer there's going to get better not
worse than that

724
00:31:46,809 --> 00:31:49,030
in the long

725
00:31:49,030 --> 00:31:51,480
idolized right it states here

726
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,669
place it's sort it's down here

727
00:31:53,669 --> 00:31:56,749
saturday and for disclosure types of
discussions together

728
00:31:56,749 --> 00:31:58,840
about sort of philosophy but

729
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:00,189
we would like to see

730
00:32:00,190 --> 00:32:02,539
more bugs known about and fixed

731
00:32:02,539 --> 00:32:03,460
rather than

732
00:32:03,460 --> 00:32:04,630
more bugs

733
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,259
that only say you know

734
00:32:06,259 --> 00:32:07,510
china the u_s_ government help out

735
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:11,570
yahoo is once again and that side of
things at it's it's note

736
00:32:11,570 --> 00:32:16,939
more free bus that sort

737
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:19,960
one other point six that we found with a
lot about him

738
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:23,080
you donate in talking about the demure
camper topics like that

739
00:32:23,080 --> 00:32:26,178
is that you know that usually the hugest
just would like to test the service

740
00:32:26,179 --> 00:32:28,710
uh... no caps packet

741
00:32:28,710 --> 00:32:32,520
and actually you know something that was
pretty cool that we found out

742
00:32:32,520 --> 00:32:34,360
really had no idea is that

743
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:38,340
all utilities actually applica fraud
division that does the stuff now

744
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:40,340
on they actually will be

745
00:32:40,340 --> 00:32:43,408
have a list in certain target
neighborhoods

746
00:32:43,409 --> 00:32:44,690
i guess

747
00:32:44,690 --> 00:32:46,570
aunt old people did they know

748
00:32:46,570 --> 00:32:50,700
bob don't have service an old roadrunner
might look for lights on

749
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:55,710
and so so they can get how to do that
now

750
00:32:55,710 --> 00:32:58,310
in that you know that that's a good way
that's what happens to be sweeter

751
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:01,600
slippers and i think the boxes polygamy
are often the case taking unit taking

752
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:03,330
the that load side

753
00:33:03,330 --> 00:33:04,049
and

754
00:33:04,049 --> 00:33:06,179
twice i didn't just jumping across

755
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:07,930
where the meters admin or

756
00:33:07,930 --> 00:33:10,970
that build you like to see things like
that

757
00:33:10,970 --> 00:33:16,120
physically him changing gears in a in a
and what type near to to make it read

758
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,600
slower stuff like that

759
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:21,100
in this case

760
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,889
new shunned stop

761
00:33:22,890 --> 00:33:26,000
you don't have to mess with all that
really hot foreign alike

762
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:30,750
the i'm persistently went and the
product four hundred anzio

763
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:32,870
i don't have to worry about india

764
00:33:32,870 --> 00:33:35,649
i've got five bolts on a little borg

765
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,370
there are probably just

766
00:33:37,370 --> 00:33:38,449
say for example

767
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:42,429
built a cordless drill and pop through
the cover on something it and

768
00:33:42,429 --> 00:33:44,430
you know act

769
00:33:44,430 --> 00:33:45,830
you know resistor

770
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:49,460
to the wire that's actually going to be
torie and i describe my bill by

771
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:55,980
in fifty percent

772
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,950
enough national debt

773
00:33:57,950 --> 00:33:59,779
then and so you know

774
00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:01,970
did summit was saturday doing it

775
00:34:01,970 --> 00:34:03,300
in each others are stupid

776
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:05,030
right and they've been dealing with

777
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:08,478
that type of physical attacks infected
search service for a long time

778
00:34:08,478 --> 00:34:11,609
so they've got a lot of people that are
doing things like uh...

779
00:34:11,609 --> 00:34:12,659
looking at

780
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:15,990
citrine analysist often socially going
for some of these things where it states

781
00:34:15,989 --> 00:34:19,198
they're able to get much more it vance

782
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:21,019
knowledge of what you use it looks like

783
00:34:21,018 --> 00:34:23,238
and they will still be bought your house
things look fine

784
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:25,799
right so you still have

785
00:34:25,799 --> 00:34:26,960
unique space control

786
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,949
of like real brains are looking at the
same

787
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:29,819
and i will be able to like

788
00:34:29,819 --> 00:34:31,879
to come to your house and

789
00:34:31,879 --> 00:34:33,770
if you've been xeon service

790
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:36,768
yesterday it looks like this

791
00:34:36,768 --> 00:34:41,348
it's just a big give obeyed just did you
canyon we're just drops off thats

792
00:34:41,349 --> 00:34:43,599
it's pretty obvious

793
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,479
yet it's the thing about it

794
00:34:45,478 --> 00:34:48,370
like a larger plenty of absolute one
year my son

795
00:34:48,370 --> 00:34:50,888
in general is that

796
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:52,419
instead of

797
00:34:52,418 --> 00:34:53,618
directly

798
00:34:53,619 --> 00:34:56,019
interacting with

799
00:34:56,018 --> 00:34:57,988
voltage coming from

800
00:34:57,989 --> 00:34:59,539
from the provider

801
00:34:59,539 --> 00:35:00,549
you're now

802
00:35:00,549 --> 00:35:02,049
subverting the data that their dad

803
00:35:02,049 --> 00:35:02,830
if their trust

804
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:08,640
in some wishes what that's really what
you're more interested in

805
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:11,129
in so if you can do that in a more
subtle ways

806
00:35:11,130 --> 00:35:14,020
it's not necessarily going to get picked
up the day here they absolutely and what

807
00:35:14,020 --> 00:35:15,829
it actually one of the

808
00:35:15,829 --> 00:35:18,619
reasons for the motivations for a lot of
the him

809
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:22,399
utilities in a mock is that it will give
them about a radio those conflicts

810
00:35:22,399 --> 00:35:23,380
they think they are

811
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:25,210
they will see this really ought
instructed

812
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:26,119
if they have it

813
00:35:26,119 --> 00:35:26,919
that service

814
00:35:26,919 --> 00:35:32,439
the traditional sense

815
00:35:32,439 --> 00:35:34,959
yeah

816
00:35:34,959 --> 00:35:36,919
well

817
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,629
so in in engine with all of these types
of thanks

818
00:35:39,629 --> 00:35:42,589
you have utilities that perhaps have
some would interface with our networks

819
00:35:42,589 --> 00:35:43,069
right

820
00:35:43,069 --> 00:35:46,199
so not only do you have all the things
that are state controls around trying to

821
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:48,739
keep out later people are going to want
to have it

822
00:35:48,739 --> 00:35:52,119
dio in their so keep out like consumers
for messing with the readers

823
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:55,219
they obviously have some way interact
that network

824
00:35:55,219 --> 00:35:56,740
we found that action to be

825
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:59,788
one of the most interesting places that
we looked at

826
00:35:59,789 --> 00:36:01,630
and dealing with

827
00:36:01,630 --> 00:36:04,650
nuts with the software that you tilly
has

828
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:05,219
in

829
00:36:05,219 --> 00:36:06,480
how that works

830
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:09,559
aunts or how they get their data magical
got keys they can talk to all these

831
00:36:09,559 --> 00:36:10,090
things

832
00:36:10,090 --> 00:36:12,739
and it really pulling apart

833
00:36:12,739 --> 00:36:15,260
you know in a sort of an equivalent of
the

834
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:17,179
the default account

835
00:36:17,179 --> 00:36:18,710
that problem that we have everywhere

836
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:21,190
where they may two thousand allies is
made with same town although and then

837
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:23,969
they have a password

838
00:36:23,969 --> 00:36:26,319
there's obvious problems that one gets
compromise

839
00:36:26,319 --> 00:36:28,779
right then maybe they can do whatever
they want with that

840
00:36:28,779 --> 00:36:31,609
you could have potential issues across
multiple utilities with different

841
00:36:31,609 --> 00:36:35,859
companies bingham axis each other stuff
if it's the same product

842
00:36:35,859 --> 00:36:37,979
we had

843
00:36:37,979 --> 00:36:41,848
yeah well anything from the yet from the
vendors perspective the rights of your

844
00:36:41,849 --> 00:36:45,579
songs new technology and you've got
discuss permits its new you've got in

845
00:36:45,579 --> 00:36:47,079
one's anderson

846
00:36:47,079 --> 00:36:48,300
art startups wiped

847
00:36:48,300 --> 00:36:51,829
and so they've got like five really be
customers who wanna keep apne

848
00:36:51,829 --> 00:36:54,589
and those five customers come back and
say

849
00:36:54,589 --> 00:36:56,808
you know all of our fuel guys like

850
00:36:56,809 --> 00:37:00,389
for the old leadership and they could

851
00:37:00,389 --> 00:37:03,569
voltmeter on it and see what's going on
everything now they have to log in to a

852
00:37:03,569 --> 00:37:05,069
website wet

853
00:37:05,069 --> 00:37:06,529
you this other thing

854
00:37:06,529 --> 00:37:08,089
and so

855
00:37:08,089 --> 00:37:12,199
they they end up yet rushing out these
these devices that date

856
00:37:12,199 --> 00:37:14,209
do some of the

857
00:37:14,209 --> 00:37:15,049
interaction with

858
00:37:15,049 --> 00:37:18,650
a meter or other ordered up devices

859
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:21,539
without really thinking for a lot of axo

860
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:24,640
yet we see things like signing keys

861
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:26,429
on all those

862
00:37:26,429 --> 00:37:30,449
emory we like to parallel to some of the
thoughts round

863
00:37:30,449 --> 00:37:31,869
sink like a cellular world

864
00:37:31,869 --> 00:37:34,770
so there's been talk to death on in the
past in black and a pathway

865
00:37:34,770 --> 00:37:39,380
uh... about the types of software that's
used to

866
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,759
directly access ageism cards or whatever

867
00:37:42,759 --> 00:37:43,799
and

868
00:37:43,799 --> 00:37:45,119
that's up or certainly

869
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:46,210
illegal like you can't

870
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:48,740
you know you're not allowed to have that
unless you are licensed installer

871
00:37:48,740 --> 00:37:51,220
whatever but you can find it on every
single torrent site out there if you

872
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:55,609
know what it's called in to look for a
bit so we're not in that state yet with

873
00:37:55,610 --> 00:38:00,290
this but it would seem to parallel very
closely with the type of environment

874
00:38:00,290 --> 00:38:04,300
texas area so if someone were to get a
hold of certain types of ice and certain

875
00:38:04,300 --> 00:38:08,400
types of software avenue oakland part

876
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:11,449
what's the keep after being released
becoming public and how to protect

877
00:38:11,449 --> 00:38:15,099
against that once that occurs while
you're factory in place

878
00:38:15,099 --> 00:38:20,739
yet it we've done that's portability
descent call that white box testing

879
00:38:20,739 --> 00:38:24,660
we found that we were given when we were
given access those borders he'll testify

880
00:38:24,660 --> 00:38:26,769
cystic their work

881
00:38:26,769 --> 00:38:27,229
lots of

882
00:38:27,229 --> 00:38:31,259
on documents commands that were under
the hood on if you actually

883
00:38:31,259 --> 00:38:34,759
pulled with the application to the
barber or extracted the special firmware

884
00:38:34,759 --> 00:38:37,029
that used

885
00:38:37,029 --> 00:38:38,799
you would see

886
00:38:38,799 --> 00:38:42,979
you all these commands that work known
in word document in anywhere did nobody

887
00:38:42,979 --> 00:38:45,479
thinks like you know enable

888
00:38:45,479 --> 00:38:49,899
secure you disable all signing in
australian univ mister weizman

889
00:38:49,899 --> 00:38:52,549
magical functions that were hidden under
their butt were actually hooked up to

890
00:38:52,549 --> 00:38:55,919
say it is for the daily so you are
supposed to get to it than gorgeous

891
00:38:55,919 --> 00:38:57,140
reattached it here

892
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:59,799
hardwired young people aspen's law
that's that's it

893
00:38:59,799 --> 00:39:03,519
yet just just in general observation
that that's that's a relief it's kind of

894
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:10,519
interesting

895
00:39:10,779 --> 00:39:14,019
so yeah the other side of it so the
where there is no parking on a modest is

896
00:39:14,019 --> 00:39:16,910
raw getting paid to go look at a mine

897
00:39:16,910 --> 00:39:18,069
and uh...

898
00:39:18,069 --> 00:39:21,558
if there's a lot of that going on is a
lot of conservatives visible consumers

899
00:39:21,559 --> 00:39:22,589
you know i'm there's

900
00:39:22,589 --> 00:39:25,859
they thought that i think i would like
you states out of class action lawsuits

901
00:39:25,859 --> 00:39:26,770
with it there

902
00:39:26,770 --> 00:39:28,729
questioned the accuracy of their

903
00:39:28,729 --> 00:39:30,169
their their m_r_i_

904
00:39:30,170 --> 00:39:33,370
if they're smart meter deployment their
particular utility in all these kind of

905
00:39:33,370 --> 00:39:34,699
things and so

906
00:39:34,699 --> 00:39:37,289
you know we're doing a lot of stuff with
it

907
00:39:37,289 --> 00:39:40,339
it we're talking a lot about it

908
00:39:40,339 --> 00:39:43,619
but the real money in the real driver
between all of this in in what this

909
00:39:43,619 --> 00:39:45,989
really comes down to whom we talked
about that

910
00:39:45,989 --> 00:39:49,019
what's now called green energy and all
that stuff

911
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:50,308
is about

912
00:39:50,309 --> 00:39:52,430
actually getting to a great the whole
thing

913
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:53,089
not just

914
00:39:53,089 --> 00:39:56,619
you have your house not just that little
note it's very in that we all think

915
00:39:56,619 --> 00:39:58,819
about and that they were talking about
right now

916
00:39:58,819 --> 00:40:01,690
the jenny tire architectures behind

917
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:05,630
yet it that really what that ends up
being like the end run of all that stuff

918
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:08,419
it the not the enron but the end

919
00:40:08,419 --> 00:40:09,558
of all that stuff

920
00:40:09,559 --> 00:40:12,130
is is getting all the state in one place

921
00:40:12,130 --> 00:40:13,780
and being able to then

922
00:40:13,780 --> 00:40:15,089
really calculate look

923
00:40:15,089 --> 00:40:18,430
and so that we find out is when we
talked to utility said

924
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:21,029
it basis we would have to do now is
overbought

925
00:40:21,029 --> 00:40:24,569
uh... on everything uh... insert the are
mentioned and runs here soon

926
00:40:24,569 --> 00:40:29,839
you know they were c utilities
commodities trader that sold short

927
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:31,860
a little more than eight maybe check

928
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:32,750
maybe should have

929
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,319
right answer

930
00:40:34,319 --> 00:40:37,519
supports california little darker well

931
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:39,299
that's because you know if you think
about it

932
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:40,910
the the traditional

933
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:44,779
way that the stuff that's been done very
old school and so they had you know

934
00:40:44,779 --> 00:40:47,700
interval repeated at best at what twenty
four hours you could

935
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,948
for big blue like you can if you really
have

936
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:54,339
this billion to all of the senate
something like a real time level

937
00:40:54,339 --> 00:40:56,788
and so the internet the real driver here

938
00:40:56,789 --> 00:40:58,469
if that's out there

939
00:40:58,469 --> 00:41:01,519
then you can rapidly adapt

940
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:04,979
your load and resell

941
00:41:04,979 --> 00:41:06,729
you're surplus

942
00:41:06,729 --> 00:41:10,859
two other utilities industry do stuff
like nascar

943
00:41:10,859 --> 00:41:14,259
and so that that's the ability of the
real it's a real core of this that's a

944
00:41:14,259 --> 00:41:19,059
lot of the drivers behind us

945
00:41:19,059 --> 00:41:20,979
and so openly

946
00:41:20,979 --> 00:41:21,979
somewhere

947
00:41:21,979 --> 00:41:24,549
with or without controls eventually

948
00:41:24,549 --> 00:41:26,640
that means that

949
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,699
software makes a decision about

950
00:41:28,699 --> 00:41:32,639
where power goats what we do with it

951
00:41:32,639 --> 00:41:36,339
and that stuff

952
00:41:36,339 --> 00:41:39,249
it makes meters looked really awesome

953
00:41:39,249 --> 00:41:41,209
uh...

954
00:41:41,209 --> 00:41:44,209
into metered the bigger stuff use new
technology

955
00:41:44,209 --> 00:41:47,690
that was pushed out too

956
00:41:47,690 --> 00:41:50,410
i'd area that had no footprint

957
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:56,129
didn't have existing infrastructure that
you had to bolt onto any had integrated

958
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:57,609
whenever year

959
00:41:57,609 --> 00:41:58,670
taking things like

960
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:01,349
but yet know what we we don't think
there's any way fight

961
00:42:01,349 --> 00:42:07,189
in distribution automation and really
hope that there should have you had fun

962
00:42:07,189 --> 00:42:10,949
yeah that's the great part in this
market

963
00:42:10,949 --> 00:42:14,119
in all of these things that on the
distribution in the energy management

964
00:42:14,119 --> 00:42:14,610
subside

965
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:16,249
that part

966
00:42:16,249 --> 00:42:17,029
out there

967
00:42:17,030 --> 00:42:19,149
typically already have some kind of
interface

968
00:42:19,149 --> 00:42:23,519
there are to have some kind of you some
kind of a protocol and something that's

969
00:42:23,519 --> 00:42:26,999
that's looking stuff but they may be
literally like a dialogue modem two

970
00:42:26,999 --> 00:42:29,558
thousand at some intervals whatever it
is

971
00:42:29,559 --> 00:42:36,559
but they're already that we can you have
to pull stuffing

972
00:42:36,619 --> 00:42:40,330
the alec exactly earlier most the stuff
especially men on a mission

973
00:42:40,330 --> 00:42:41,788
is

974
00:42:41,789 --> 00:42:43,980
both on serial interfaces

975
00:42:43,980 --> 00:42:48,079
known stuffed with known places took
alex likes and if you are so inclined

976
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:51,479
ways things are really integrated with
their in amman delivered licensed that

977
00:42:51,479 --> 00:42:54,779
you can use

978
00:42:54,779 --> 00:42:55,880
to dis retrofit

979
00:42:55,880 --> 00:43:00,299
your existing architecture

980
00:43:00,299 --> 00:43:04,239
permitted for back all sent except the
senior than any other networks you got

981
00:43:04,239 --> 00:43:06,789
all of the aisle centex interact with
him

982
00:43:06,789 --> 00:43:09,229
yet and it's something that would make a
point that prom

983
00:43:09,229 --> 00:43:10,589
yes most of his

984
00:43:10,589 --> 00:43:13,609
you know indeed yes that's what it's
like out there now

985
00:43:13,609 --> 00:43:14,900
in a lot of

986
00:43:14,900 --> 00:43:18,500
frequency hopping mad hatter megahertz
stuff yet zigbee category where you're

987
00:43:18,500 --> 00:43:21,419
seeing that more is actually in like my
control

988
00:43:21,419 --> 00:43:25,408
and stuff so she saw the back all of
some other tech indian usually

989
00:43:25,409 --> 00:43:28,929
short-range incited music

990
00:43:28,929 --> 00:43:31,429
com yeah yet some cases the networks are
a lot

991
00:43:31,429 --> 00:43:33,339
so you can have him

992
00:43:33,339 --> 00:43:36,630
demand automation types of things in
indecision

993
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:37,769
type traffic

994
00:43:37,769 --> 00:43:41,029
occurring on the same network as say
meaning a meter reads and things like

995
00:43:41,029 --> 00:43:42,209
that

996
00:43:42,209 --> 00:43:44,509
may or may not be problem

997
00:43:44,509 --> 00:43:45,869
it does occur whether

998
00:43:45,869 --> 00:43:46,799
vincent plans

999
00:43:46,799 --> 00:43:50,959
yeah that the vendors that are their big
in the space or selling both pieces

1000
00:43:50,959 --> 00:43:53,259
and so if you can think about you know

1001
00:43:53,259 --> 00:43:57,229
because c_i_o_'s always say that went
through to chip himself they've already

1002
00:43:57,229 --> 00:43:57,669
got

1003
00:43:57,670 --> 00:44:01,230
all the stuff out there they've already
this year my stuff in the in the better

1004
00:44:01,230 --> 00:44:02,970
city bavarian deep with

1005
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:06,839
then commence a gaggle guess what we do
d_n_a_ that also there

1006
00:44:06,839 --> 00:44:13,839
also the fact that it's it's a pretty
easy cell

1007
00:44:14,009 --> 00:44:14,369
answer

1008
00:44:14,369 --> 00:44:18,509
the when you take those differences and
you integrate that

1009
00:44:18,509 --> 00:44:22,989
and you have to enter into this thing
cereal that might be a nailed

1010
00:44:22,989 --> 00:44:24,829
you've got to nail private

1011
00:44:24,829 --> 00:44:27,809
filled one maybe

1012
00:44:27,809 --> 00:44:29,519
you have some other dot

1013
00:44:29,519 --> 00:44:31,109
some other about method

1014
00:44:31,109 --> 00:44:35,089
uh... the way that with your doing that
a lot of times is the use of radio

1015
00:44:35,089 --> 00:44:35,689
hand-off

1016
00:44:35,689 --> 00:44:37,209
uh... either too

1017
00:44:37,209 --> 00:44:43,379
either in internet dropper cereal

1018
00:44:43,379 --> 00:44:44,120
boxes and

1019
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:45,839
upon polls

1020
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:48,389
three corners

1021
00:44:48,389 --> 00:44:50,119
sometimes

1022
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:51,989
soviet like the same problems as

1023
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:53,619
uh... it'd be a my side

1024
00:44:53,619 --> 00:44:57,410
in that do you have physical access and
we start talking to

1025
00:44:57,410 --> 00:44:59,489
talking about physical access to some
used as an

1026
00:44:59,489 --> 00:45:02,439
they just keepin that what what they
could bring up as a poor you know it's

1027
00:45:02,439 --> 00:45:05,578
it's in a secure facility but we keep an
eye problem people break into stealing

1028
00:45:05,579 --> 00:45:07,139
all of our copper wire

1029
00:45:07,139 --> 00:45:09,449
so it

1030
00:45:09,449 --> 00:45:13,469
bobby series to my bet they've got us
into the physical street issues as

1031
00:45:13,469 --> 00:45:14,199
everything else

1032
00:45:14,199 --> 00:45:16,790
so even though these are not necessarily
on your house

1033
00:45:16,790 --> 00:45:17,889
under still not

1034
00:45:17,889 --> 00:45:19,719
secure locations

1035
00:45:19,719 --> 00:45:21,299
yet end

1036
00:45:21,299 --> 00:45:25,019
and the case the handoff you know that
that may literally be

1037
00:45:25,019 --> 00:45:26,479
dropping you want to land

1038
00:45:26,479 --> 00:45:29,299
that the whole lot of other

1039
00:45:29,299 --> 00:45:30,739
would you be three gear

1040
00:45:30,739 --> 00:45:34,609
and everything else is on with no other
complications

1041
00:45:34,609 --> 00:45:37,659
yahoo suicide with his glasses that or
dislike i think that's a little access

1042
00:45:37,659 --> 00:45:43,670
to put inside a building demanding an
outside

1043
00:45:43,670 --> 00:45:50,670
yet we don't think

1044
00:45:54,679 --> 00:45:58,499
yeah

1045
00:45:58,499 --> 00:46:01,259
ratso so just had a quick intrinsically

1046
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:05,330
wasn't too much time talking about this
as shawn mentioned there's lots of other

1047
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:07,400
further talks in previous years they've
covered it

1048
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:08,419
but pump

1049
00:46:08,419 --> 00:46:11,288
basie designate as reduce complexity
wifi

1050
00:46:11,289 --> 00:46:13,859
right it's made by some missing people

1051
00:46:13,859 --> 00:46:16,319
and same poem

1052
00:46:16,319 --> 00:46:20,699
say my tripoli people that that helps
define those other protocols as well

1053
00:46:20,699 --> 00:46:22,189
it's hum

1054
00:46:22,189 --> 00:46:23,680
meant to be

1055
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:26,328
mesh network over semi low

1056
00:46:26,329 --> 00:46:27,539
by defense

1057
00:46:27,539 --> 00:46:29,700
did not necessarily uh...

1058
00:46:29,700 --> 00:46:32,390
while she appears on the night not not
that close

1059
00:46:32,390 --> 00:46:33,359
but not really

1060
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:37,239
long range like the a forty-mile hop
something either

1061
00:46:37,239 --> 00:46:40,029
have a lot of simpson syntax of problems
with

1062
00:46:40,029 --> 00:46:44,029
key management or wilkie management
general and that you know these devices

1063
00:46:44,029 --> 00:46:49,159
of got its absurd keys and rather crypto
so there are issued negative known to be

1064
00:46:49,159 --> 00:46:52,509
issues around that with in over the air
to be retrieval and things of that

1065
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:53,670
nature

1066
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:55,349
depending on which implementation ec

1067
00:46:55,349 --> 00:46:58,589
uh... normally in this environment you
would only see that when it is the back

1068
00:46:58,589 --> 00:47:02,129
all like for example in say some sort of
strange d environment where they were

1069
00:47:02,129 --> 00:47:03,629
doing that

1070
00:47:03,629 --> 00:47:07,989
but in general hence margaret zigbee is
actually slightly different from the

1071
00:47:07,989 --> 00:47:10,289
degree that you may have read about er
five out of the past

1072
00:47:10,289 --> 00:47:12,939
is the stuff of this morning to profile

1073
00:47:12,939 --> 00:47:16,710
which this sort of a bolt-on on top of
the

1074
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:21,269
zigbee will outlined you know how things
work it sort of a network layer

1075
00:47:21,269 --> 00:47:24,779
than it's harder rector fit this into
like an oversight model which is how we

1076
00:47:24,779 --> 00:47:26,569
all think that

1077
00:47:26,569 --> 00:47:28,160
you can think of the as

1078
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,678
sort transport and sort of packet layer
type stuff

1079
00:47:31,679 --> 00:47:34,279
but then you've also got these set

1080
00:47:34,279 --> 00:47:37,330
allison these these different profiles
in this case part of your profile

1081
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:39,950
which type here reads with all of that
so

1082
00:47:39,950 --> 00:47:41,908
he'll both the applications faq

1083
00:47:41,909 --> 00:47:45,050
and talk about like individual functions
and what happens in the functions

1084
00:47:45,050 --> 00:47:49,140
as well as liking for special bits down
and the very bottom layers

1085
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:51,210
about how you can do prepare for example

1086
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:55,589
uh... as well as adding coleman lovers
of parked on top of it

1087
00:47:55,589 --> 00:47:56,840
we use that word

1088
00:47:56,840 --> 00:48:00,049
we we would like to be we thought we'd
we do and plug it

1089
00:48:00,049 --> 00:48:02,549
let me just

1090
00:48:02,549 --> 00:48:07,459
activity and is a uh... as software
stack of allied interface was a beat

1091
00:48:07,459 --> 00:48:08,379
and you can buy a little

1092
00:48:08,380 --> 00:48:12,309
like forty dollars a key cards that you
can program with uh... kilby supper

1093
00:48:12,309 --> 00:48:13,199
snack

1094
00:48:13,199 --> 00:48:14,439
and interface with

1095
00:48:14,439 --> 00:48:18,209
optic networks it does not have the
smart of your profile sack

1096
00:48:18,209 --> 00:48:19,450
so there you

1097
00:48:19,450 --> 00:48:22,960
and see your urine limited in what you
can you and what you can interact with

1098
00:48:22,960 --> 00:48:23,679
directly with that

1099
00:48:23,679 --> 00:48:26,699
uh... currently there's no getting open
sourced

1100
00:48:26,699 --> 00:48:29,460
ways to do any that really the best way
to do it is to just go ahead and buy

1101
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:31,790
uh... expensive cards with

1102
00:48:31,790 --> 00:48:35,538
service offered on the cat that comes
from like a digi or you know

1103
00:48:35,539 --> 00:48:37,120
one of those types of uh...

1104
00:48:37,120 --> 00:48:37,970
basically players

1105
00:48:37,970 --> 00:48:43,359
or on the you know on the other the
other out there is is obviously so that

1106
00:48:43,359 --> 00:48:45,058
stuff that travis is talked about

1107
00:48:45,059 --> 00:48:45,940
in terms of

1108
00:48:45,940 --> 00:48:48,749
who take advice sorry on you're saving
them

1109
00:48:48,749 --> 00:48:49,288
determination on

1110
00:48:49,289 --> 00:48:51,269
on the skated itself

1111
00:48:51,269 --> 00:48:54,488
if you can take my started doing it's
taking care of the proposed axonal

1112
00:48:54,489 --> 00:48:56,019
you've got to stop so

1113
00:48:56,019 --> 00:48:58,060
if you can't get get that device

1114
00:48:58,060 --> 00:48:59,779
you know that that somewhere

1115
00:48:59,779 --> 00:49:01,620
you on that board you can interact with

1116
00:49:01,620 --> 00:49:04,038
with the bus

1117
00:49:04,039 --> 00:49:08,019
you can just use that devices actually
has heard right

1118
00:49:08,019 --> 00:49:10,828
right a lot of the the early 'em

1119
00:49:10,829 --> 00:49:12,389
cbj ip sick him out

1120
00:49:12,389 --> 00:49:14,949
all had exposed buses that

1121
00:49:14,949 --> 00:49:16,899
faintly difficulties are flying across

1122
00:49:16,899 --> 00:49:20,259
so there's been a lot of uh... attack
stuff from

1123
00:49:20,259 --> 00:49:20,880
legaspi

1124
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:24,819
exp right those guys i'm talking about
how to do that i had a heart miller

1125
00:49:24,819 --> 00:49:25,869
level

1126
00:49:25,869 --> 00:49:26,989
mirror the newer devices

1127
00:49:26,989 --> 00:49:30,189
they're all coming with that integrated
on one ship so you'd have no expose

1128
00:49:30,189 --> 00:49:33,399
buses hit significantly raises that

1129
00:49:33,399 --> 00:49:34,138
difficulty level

1130
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:36,629
and then you have other chips where

1131
00:49:36,629 --> 00:49:38,499
and when we looked at

1132
00:49:38,499 --> 00:49:39,959
where in

1133
00:49:39,959 --> 00:49:42,828
bitterly none of the debug stuff is
turned off in those having seeking to

1134
00:49:42,829 --> 00:49:44,910
suppress winning the liking elementary

1135
00:49:44,910 --> 00:49:46,019
and it was given to you

1136
00:49:46,019 --> 00:49:49,169
and putting all its keys in the skies
and so you get a lot of the same

1137
00:49:49,169 --> 00:49:52,850
problems as m any early industry where
you know on paper

1138
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:54,220
effing actually got sense

1139
00:49:54,220 --> 00:49:55,848
and implementation

1140
00:49:55,849 --> 00:49:57,969
it was difficult

1141
00:49:57,969 --> 00:50:01,800
as it has progressed a lot of those
types of problems and six-foot

1142
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,009
there still are out there

1143
00:50:03,009 --> 00:50:05,389
and the problem finding budget hardware

1144
00:50:05,389 --> 00:50:06,790
you know what what what do you do

1145
00:50:06,790 --> 00:50:08,599
right do

1146
00:50:08,599 --> 00:50:10,180
unit util client explain that

1147
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:13,989
are they can make the decision to
replace every one of those devices

1148
00:50:13,989 --> 00:50:17,839
or and so it's it's a much more complex
problem can't push software patch for a

1149
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:21,330
lot of those types of issues your ten
thousand thermostats were

1150
00:50:21,330 --> 00:50:22,619
really really bad

1151
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:24,529
you need to go back

1152
00:50:24,529 --> 00:50:27,509
you needed you need to go rollet
rucksack every house and saw come out

1153
00:50:27,509 --> 00:50:27,979
with

1154
00:50:27,979 --> 00:50:30,158
either this year one

1155
00:50:30,159 --> 00:50:33,629
japan the most interesting thing about
to be that that we we liked about it is

1156
00:50:33,629 --> 00:50:35,719
that as a

1157
00:50:35,719 --> 00:50:37,589
known and understood protocol

1158
00:50:37,589 --> 00:50:39,549
if you can find a way to get onto that

1159
00:50:39,549 --> 00:50:41,119
that network right so

1160
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:44,160
that would be using tactics we talked
about where your actually marine keys

1161
00:50:44,160 --> 00:50:47,839
off of the device i'm doing something
work your you can get the necessary

1162
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:51,359
information to join a network or a
person a device on our what you've got

1163
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:52,119
that

1164
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:54,899
you're basically sitting at

1165
00:50:54,899 --> 00:50:56,979
you know aditi p_r_i_

1166
00:50:56,979 --> 00:50:58,270
for that meter

1167
00:50:58,270 --> 00:51:01,339
and four back and stuff that way
upstream from them

1168
00:51:01,339 --> 00:51:04,429
and so you don't mind of interesting
facts things like we played around you

1169
00:51:04,429 --> 00:51:07,039
know with ideas about

1170
00:51:07,039 --> 00:51:09,069
siegel injection vis-a-vis

1171
00:51:09,069 --> 00:51:11,150
and being able to interview

1172
00:51:11,150 --> 00:51:16,380
shahdol kind of interesting inputs back
up into these dick actions yes you have

1173
00:51:16,380 --> 00:51:18,410
you had multiple busy day

1174
00:51:18,410 --> 00:51:23,129
they'd you to please the court there
were all very network is things like

1175
00:51:23,129 --> 00:51:25,890
usage of load for different consumer
devices and you know

1176
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:27,868
i was arms is like

1177
00:51:27,869 --> 00:51:30,150
simple description here this is a thing
that's going to

1178
00:51:30,150 --> 00:51:30,710
essentially

1179
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:32,589
tell you

1180
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:33,479
somebody

1181
00:51:33,479 --> 00:51:37,339
i guess that matters cute the email
below through overdrew their door open

1182
00:51:37,339 --> 00:51:39,369
right so it's it's going to see these

1183
00:51:39,369 --> 00:51:43,719
in patterns of usage rossellini rises up

1184
00:51:43,719 --> 00:51:47,959
if there's there's things like average
device name all onto the pieces

1185
00:51:47,959 --> 00:51:49,609
that were being separate up a recall

1186
00:51:49,609 --> 00:51:54,499
upstream in a certain popular with web
interfaces inside until the

1187
00:51:54,499 --> 00:51:58,109
those via this web applications may or
may not have any validation

1188
00:51:58,109 --> 00:51:59,949
see that you you have

1189
00:51:59,949 --> 00:52:02,199
petition at ways to trigger bugs all of
that stack

1190
00:52:02,199 --> 00:52:06,439
right so from simple buffer overflow
type stuff on the meter itself

1191
00:52:06,439 --> 00:52:08,430
orbited by itself whatever it is

1192
00:52:08,430 --> 00:52:09,729
all the way upstream

1193
00:52:09,729 --> 00:52:13,640
so some somebody go home in a nearby
meter our team name your honor

1194
00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:16,669
thermostatic or one equals one

1195
00:52:16,669 --> 00:52:21,209
so what happens if you get a call

1196
00:52:21,209 --> 00:52:23,049
but sort of

1197
00:52:23,049 --> 00:52:24,269
in right now

1198
00:52:24,269 --> 00:52:27,038
is that we actually really like to be

1199
00:52:27,039 --> 00:52:29,099
that you know all these things said
about it

1200
00:52:29,099 --> 00:52:30,549
being open stack

1201
00:52:30,549 --> 00:52:33,519
that has had a lot of smart people look
at

1202
00:52:33,519 --> 00:52:34,669
it's

1203
00:52:34,670 --> 00:52:38,259
it's pretty well lockdown today east are
trying to dig into outset works

1204
00:52:38,259 --> 00:52:39,519
and its

1205
00:52:39,519 --> 00:52:42,538
disregard with p k i n there's going to
be implementation issues and we'll

1206
00:52:42,539 --> 00:52:44,799
probably find is on the delicious over
time

1207
00:52:44,799 --> 00:52:47,999
but it's the best thing we've seen

1208
00:52:47,999 --> 00:52:51,689
at that larry i understand you know i
get a better discussions with one

1209
00:52:51,689 --> 00:52:52,658
with both the

1210
00:52:52,659 --> 00:52:56,049
the vendor side and uh... utility side
about why

1211
00:52:56,049 --> 00:52:58,788
their practical reasons why hitting he's
not

1212
00:52:58,789 --> 00:53:02,150
shouldn't be used for other types of
transport 'em large in the same position

1213
00:53:02,150 --> 00:53:04,939
talked earlier with being able to
appointed

1214
00:53:04,939 --> 00:53:06,589
break an entire

1215
00:53:06,589 --> 00:53:07,578
marge area with

1216
00:53:07,579 --> 00:53:11,279
high levels of packet loss

1217
00:53:11,279 --> 00:53:13,509
acts or that the paper level com

1218
00:53:13,509 --> 00:53:15,399
vitaly dot that's the reason

1219
00:53:15,399 --> 00:53:18,209
it really for us in in you we feel like

1220
00:53:18,209 --> 00:53:21,609
that's that's a dissertation a benefit
to utilities

1221
00:53:21,609 --> 00:53:22,799
and in really ultimately

1222
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:26,239
to everybody

1223
00:53:26,239 --> 00:53:27,489
in our case

1224
00:53:27,489 --> 00:53:31,459
in reversing hearing like proprietary
radios that

1225
00:53:31,459 --> 00:53:33,089
your documentation and

1226
00:53:33,089 --> 00:53:35,469
vanderspeck hung up on us we ask
questions

1227
00:53:35,469 --> 00:53:37,729
uh... unit that was

1228
00:53:37,729 --> 00:53:41,959
three or four months to get to the point
that we got to the few hours basically

1229
00:53:41,959 --> 00:53:43,439
and no play that pointers

1230
00:53:43,439 --> 00:53:46,189
is that the fortifying budson helping

1231
00:53:46,189 --> 00:53:47,288
utilities in that

1232
00:53:47,289 --> 00:53:49,900
the vendors were they like it or not
fixes what's right

1233
00:53:49,900 --> 00:53:50,959
so

1234
00:53:50,959 --> 00:53:53,549
you know i'm not sure about that

1235
00:53:53,549 --> 00:53:54,390
often though that

1236
00:53:54,390 --> 00:53:56,808
know that you have an access in yet
right

1237
00:53:56,809 --> 00:54:00,049
what makes a nice yet it's being so
that'll be kind of a rift

1238
00:54:00,049 --> 00:54:02,329
where will run through

1239
00:54:02,329 --> 00:54:03,480
mc improve it's there

1240
00:54:03,480 --> 00:54:07,420
in the problem is that for proprietary
just off

1241
00:54:07,420 --> 00:54:12,519
you go through that same process for
every vendor over and over again

1242
00:54:12,519 --> 00:54:14,189
everytime

1243
00:54:14,189 --> 00:54:14,868
we know

1244
00:54:14,869 --> 00:54:16,999
for a fact that pipe

1245
00:54:16,999 --> 00:54:18,859
people acronym

1246
00:54:18,859 --> 00:54:20,880
that all of us

1247
00:54:20,880 --> 00:54:23,979
shops they do this are going around to
utility said telling of these things in

1248
00:54:23,979 --> 00:54:27,109
the other shops repellent utility the
same thing it released on the vendor

1249
00:54:27,109 --> 00:54:28,999
emily's find anybody else

1250
00:54:28,999 --> 00:54:31,868
uh... whereas with something like sixty

1251
00:54:31,869 --> 00:54:37,349
win flaws are found even if they're

1252
00:54:37,349 --> 00:54:38,409
mushroom cloudy

1253
00:54:38,409 --> 00:54:41,089
flaws and i don't think they would be
and

1254
00:54:41,089 --> 00:54:42,299
bbcwst

1255
00:54:42,299 --> 00:54:46,179
the realities that we're all gonna know
about it romantic fixed

1256
00:54:46,179 --> 00:54:48,279
even actually the mississippi one

1257
00:54:48,279 --> 00:54:50,779
but that's where the other things is
coming down the pipe

1258
00:54:50,779 --> 00:54:54,449
is certainty that adds a lot more your
components to

1259
00:54:54,449 --> 00:54:55,390
to the apple stock

1260
00:54:55,390 --> 00:54:57,700
and did abbas been a ton of time looking
at it

1261
00:54:57,700 --> 00:55:00,348
but just so that that's why it's it
seems to be primarily

1262
00:55:00,349 --> 00:55:02,339
uh... around

1263
00:55:02,339 --> 00:55:05,979
a cat stuff as far as white people
really care about there are some smother

1264
00:55:05,979 --> 00:55:07,098
under the hood

1265
00:55:07,099 --> 00:55:09,020
changes but widely it's about

1266
00:55:09,020 --> 00:55:10,759
rolling out a new feature sets

1267
00:55:10,759 --> 00:55:12,209
too

1268
00:55:12,209 --> 00:55:15,388
what can happen on a networking to talk
about like assoc was also the

1269
00:55:15,389 --> 00:55:16,920
application layer as well as

1270
00:55:16,920 --> 00:55:21,549
uh... will consider application there as
well as few transport alaska

1271
00:55:21,549 --> 00:55:25,299
there on the other side of that new
image of being the best bathroom

1272
00:55:25,299 --> 00:55:29,288
buzzing merely we really like a concept
car

1273
00:55:29,289 --> 00:55:31,819
utilities don't necessarily because
they're going to looking at the minute

1274
00:55:31,819 --> 00:55:33,829
side of that

1275
00:55:33,829 --> 00:55:37,229
but yes actually configured on the air
my son's army nurse that

1276
00:55:37,229 --> 00:55:38,538
really what you have is kind of

1277
00:55:38,539 --> 00:55:41,999
one mc the talks to neighbor area
network and other nick the talks to the

1278
00:55:41,999 --> 00:55:43,288
contrary network

1279
00:55:43,289 --> 00:55:47,749
on and that make is in a lot of cases is
a big right

1280
00:55:47,749 --> 00:55:51,049
when you would roll devices in the
device management all that week

1281
00:55:51,049 --> 00:55:54,159
yet we didn't actually putting up a lot
like one of the big things about to be

1282
00:55:54,159 --> 00:55:55,709
good news

1283
00:55:55,709 --> 00:55:58,759
elim g

1284
00:55:58,759 --> 00:56:02,509
that the key exchange pieces a battered
and it would be a risky for main static

1285
00:56:02,509 --> 00:56:05,489
him for a long time select our what what
happens

1286
00:56:05,489 --> 00:56:08,219
you know when people are taking things
in their burning accusing the device

1287
00:56:08,219 --> 00:56:10,099
because the utility controls them

1288
00:56:10,099 --> 00:56:13,249
they're doing that beforehand we can
start to keep doing it

1289
00:56:13,249 --> 00:56:16,149
and that's that for example as one of
things that set mandates

1290
00:56:16,149 --> 00:56:17,719
so that even while cc

1291
00:56:17,719 --> 00:56:20,850
wool will allow you to do dumb things
like sink use of the year

1292
00:56:20,850 --> 00:56:23,750
suppossed no you can't do that you have
to invent some sort of outside

1293
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:27,510
you know how to ban halfway to make them
for yet or trekkies obviously from

1294
00:56:27,510 --> 00:56:31,719
memory

1295
00:56:31,719 --> 00:56:33,380
talking about

1296
00:56:33,380 --> 00:56:36,540
yet what we'd like is really in the case
of the consumer to our gateway

1297
00:56:36,540 --> 00:56:39,199
what your what you're seeing is is such
a little box that

1298
00:56:39,199 --> 00:56:43,059
that boxes or the department meter the
consumer care older room stake in

1299
00:56:43,059 --> 00:56:44,049
refrigerator

1300
00:56:44,049 --> 00:56:47,009
and they had they have control over
those pieces

1301
00:56:47,009 --> 00:56:48,740
and that some separation

1302
00:56:48,740 --> 00:56:50,019
between

1303
00:56:50,019 --> 00:56:52,209
utilities network in and consumer

1304
00:56:52,209 --> 00:56:55,819
on and i kind of like a key because i'd
also tells me that

1305
00:56:55,819 --> 00:56:58,549
if you put them in a bid on

1306
00:56:58,549 --> 00:57:00,038
things like that

1307
00:57:00,039 --> 00:57:02,420
you in some cases

1308
00:57:02,420 --> 00:57:04,269
those devices later

1309
00:57:04,269 --> 00:57:05,229
on your heart

1310
00:57:05,230 --> 00:57:06,089
in in

1311
00:57:06,089 --> 00:57:07,769
there are dignity

1312
00:57:07,769 --> 00:57:10,029
ultimately if they so charles

1313
00:57:10,029 --> 00:57:12,429
your utility and in some cases

1314
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:13,549
people are

1315
00:57:13,549 --> 00:57:17,449
being offered by ca will reach a legal
to agree to this

1316
00:57:17,449 --> 00:57:19,739
that he thought he could shut off your
air conditioner

1317
00:57:19,739 --> 00:57:21,269
if they have a highland park

1318
00:57:21,269 --> 00:57:23,609
do you agree to that person tons of it

1319
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:26,639
hanukah

1320
00:57:26,639 --> 00:57:29,749
i have to stop them

1321
00:57:29,749 --> 00:57:32,038
indicative piece of the against her
daily like that you might have more

1322
00:57:32,039 --> 00:57:34,059
control

1323
00:57:34,059 --> 00:57:40,119
group what's going on

1324
00:57:40,119 --> 00:57:45,659
so she has just eight complex picture of
what that zigbee thing it's not our side

1325
00:57:45,659 --> 00:57:48,959
so yeah you can see if we lived at the
bottom habit you have a little network

1326
00:57:48,959 --> 00:57:49,440
protocol

1327
00:57:49,440 --> 00:57:52,549
and then you have these different
profiles that are built on top of it

1328
00:57:52,549 --> 00:57:54,569
right in civic like uh...

1329
00:57:54,569 --> 00:57:56,349
there were four layer like

1330
00:57:56,349 --> 00:58:00,940
deity model isn't like that

1331
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:04,049
okay so specifically to focus in on
average assesses that's one of things

1332
00:58:04,049 --> 00:58:05,999
that we've seen the most often

1333
00:58:05,999 --> 00:58:07,459
it as transport

1334
00:58:07,460 --> 00:58:11,989
for some of the interesting thing they
looked at so i'm talking about

1335
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:13,929
the way things work

1336
00:58:13,929 --> 00:58:16,079
do you think about so it

1337
00:58:16,079 --> 00:58:16,599
and

1338
00:58:16,599 --> 00:58:19,989
when we got to do this we didn't know if
a lot about our at so we learned a lot

1339
00:58:19,989 --> 00:58:22,359
over like nine months

1340
00:58:22,359 --> 00:58:24,479
as so this is a sort of a quick

1341
00:58:24,479 --> 00:58:25,629
primer on it

1342
00:58:25,629 --> 00:58:27,348
averages just means that

1343
00:58:27,349 --> 00:58:29,479
for any given like transmission

1344
00:58:29,479 --> 00:58:32,899
you're bouncing around multiple
different frequencies with advanced so

1345
00:58:32,899 --> 00:58:35,578
in this case with a nice and then select
nine oh two nine twenty-eight something

1346
00:58:35,579 --> 00:58:37,029
like that

1347
00:58:37,029 --> 00:58:42,160
they will be certain number of channels
within that

1348
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:44,719
have a seal random popping sequence

1349
00:58:44,719 --> 00:58:46,709
and so when i send a signal over

1350
00:58:46,709 --> 00:58:47,509
it'll saying you know

1351
00:58:47,509 --> 00:58:50,639
a certain number of packets and look at
it for certain amount of data middle

1352
00:58:50,639 --> 00:58:52,740
it'll hit a threshold it a packet that

1353
00:58:52,740 --> 00:58:54,660
and throw that over one individually

1354
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:58,129
and both sides are synced up as far as
what their hopping

1355
00:58:58,130 --> 00:58:58,949
patterns are

1356
00:58:58,949 --> 00:59:02,319
so usually follow some sorting out
rhythm it's like program in the firmware

1357
00:59:02,319 --> 00:59:04,329
and it'll like safe

1358
00:59:04,329 --> 00:59:05,549
take something that it knows

1359
00:59:05,549 --> 00:59:08,659
you know as a some sort of a say

1360
00:59:08,659 --> 00:59:09,850
a static value

1361
00:59:09,850 --> 00:59:13,589
and then can use that as for the driver
for some sort of algorithm tells it

1362
00:59:13,590 --> 00:59:17,430
where it needs to be and so they top
together in sequence throughout this ban

1363
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:23,330
and uh... in general i think it why so
it became an embargo to as a way to get

1364
00:59:23,330 --> 00:59:24,939
around

1365
00:59:24,939 --> 00:59:26,669
narrowband interception

1366
00:59:26,669 --> 00:59:28,920
it can be difficult

1367
00:59:28,920 --> 00:59:32,109
on in on those types of communications
because you don't know exactly where the

1368
00:59:32,109 --> 00:59:35,469
where the signals that the

1369
00:59:35,469 --> 00:59:38,059
justified an exception

1370
00:59:38,059 --> 00:59:42,789
while in erode what u or let's say even
today allot of people that are are

1371
00:59:42,789 --> 00:59:44,259
working with this kind of stuff

1372
00:59:44,259 --> 00:59:46,789
arguing on

1373
00:59:46,789 --> 00:59:49,609
little devices they say they were they
will go out and buy like the same shape

1374
00:59:49,609 --> 00:59:52,759
it's in use or decide or chip or
something along those lines and build a

1375
00:59:52,759 --> 00:59:55,669
little board that a lot of the test at
the top

1376
00:59:55,669 --> 00:59:57,669
you know what they want to talk to you

1377
00:59:57,669 --> 01:00:00,038
so that's one of the way that it's been
done for a long time now is on the way

1378
01:00:00,039 --> 01:00:03,109
that you can really interface with that
stuff

1379
01:00:03,109 --> 01:00:07,130
or short short of spinning like sixty k
on really expensive hardware

1380
01:00:07,130 --> 01:00:10,549
to do wider vendor separate

1381
01:00:10,549 --> 01:00:12,940
the overall point is that if you can
sniff like the whole

1382
01:00:12,940 --> 01:00:14,709
i send them

1383
01:00:14,709 --> 01:00:16,408
it doesn't really matter

1384
01:00:16,409 --> 01:00:18,969
necessarily what the hopping sequences

1385
01:00:18,969 --> 01:00:23,329
if i can capture them all and i can
observe it as a as occurs

1386
01:00:23,329 --> 01:00:25,910
yet it we talked about that a little bit
like it's kind of

1387
01:00:25,910 --> 01:00:31,239
dob unfortunately in w school

1388
01:00:31,239 --> 01:00:34,749
there's a lots of good or f reasons
freezing it it allows a lot of things to

1389
01:00:34,749 --> 01:00:38,529
come system say man without slamming
into each other in

1390
01:00:38,529 --> 01:00:40,759
and that's what he's you actually a lot
of other

1391
01:00:40,759 --> 01:00:42,779
you know a lot of other bands as well

1392
01:00:42,779 --> 01:00:44,520
the ee makes sense because of that

1393
01:00:44,520 --> 01:00:48,170
it also makes it pretty resilient
long-range it's not fast

1394
01:00:48,170 --> 01:00:49,209
unsurpassed

1395
01:00:49,209 --> 01:00:51,078
you know we have for example

1396
01:00:51,079 --> 01:00:51,869
on

1397
01:00:51,869 --> 01:00:55,410
looked at the end exercise snyder
menards raised area like forty mile

1398
01:00:55,410 --> 01:00:56,729
range is

1399
01:00:56,729 --> 01:00:59,509
so that's pretty awesome for him

1400
01:00:59,509 --> 01:01:03,379
so that once the wireless infrastructure
upgrade cheaply

1401
01:01:03,379 --> 01:01:04,618
but

1402
01:01:04,619 --> 01:01:08,329
you do see very much two-day even now

1403
01:01:08,329 --> 01:01:09,749
vendors that

1404
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:13,479
will you can use the phrase f h s_s_
encryption which is my favorite that's

1405
01:01:13,479 --> 01:01:16,678
precisely to actually go to the
wikipedia page prestigious s

1406
01:01:16,679 --> 01:01:19,709
there's like a bullet point on there
that specifically says that we should

1407
01:01:19,709 --> 01:01:21,308
snag that typically says

1408
01:01:21,309 --> 01:01:25,009
uh... average s_s_ is the security
option

1409
01:01:25,009 --> 01:01:26,190
it make the entire

1410
01:01:26,190 --> 01:01:27,890
you world that we've talked to

1411
01:01:27,890 --> 01:01:29,420
good things about it this way

1412
01:01:29,420 --> 01:01:31,309
that it's a global but you can't

1413
01:01:31,309 --> 01:01:32,459
says it right so

1414
01:01:32,459 --> 01:01:33,529
who cares if it

1415
01:01:33,529 --> 01:01:36,220
the trip is not good or if there's no
curtailed or whatever

1416
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:37,189
because you can't

1417
01:01:37,190 --> 01:01:39,890
rightly how are you how do you know
whatever you there's no way for you that

1418
01:01:39,890 --> 01:01:41,859
if if you could you would know how to
put back together

1419
01:01:41,859 --> 01:01:44,889
the divers it's also not a sports breck

1420
01:01:44,889 --> 01:01:46,929
asana circuit

1421
01:01:46,929 --> 01:01:47,889
and uh...

1422
01:01:47,889 --> 01:01:50,849
yes actually that particular wikipedia
page there's actually network you go

1423
01:01:50,849 --> 01:01:52,090
back to work there

1424
01:01:52,090 --> 01:01:55,720
of like no no it don't guess it now it's
not yes it is a good like deleting each

1425
01:01:55,720 --> 01:02:00,680
other and if not yet another disaster
also out there better talks given

1426
01:02:00,680 --> 01:02:02,879
accurate pasado that's issue

1427
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:05,899
specifically on average assess for
individual devices

1428
01:02:05,899 --> 01:02:07,219
and and looking at but

1429
01:02:07,219 --> 01:02:08,349
over there there's a

1430
01:02:08,349 --> 01:02:09,279
wifi juan

1431
01:02:09,279 --> 01:02:12,529
and some other stuff

1432
01:02:12,529 --> 01:02:16,429
and yes it is mostly about it's really
like good from design perspective for a

1433
01:02:16,429 --> 01:02:17,809
lot of reasons and

1434
01:02:17,809 --> 01:02:21,379
and yet that this reduces or something
that's more convenient denmark

1435
01:02:21,379 --> 01:02:23,808
intricately designed as more of a
logistical issue back to what you get

1436
01:02:23,809 --> 01:02:25,149
over long range

1437
01:02:25,149 --> 01:02:29,689
without making it easy for some it is
stop by your signal

1438
01:02:29,689 --> 01:02:31,649
it typically destiny

1439
01:02:31,650 --> 01:02:35,119
for chrissy shift key that's that's in
place with

1440
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:37,420
various flavors at that work for this
stuff is

1441
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:40,069
lots of a texan modulation schemes are
out there

1442
01:02:40,069 --> 01:02:41,819
for everything that you know from

1443
01:02:41,819 --> 01:02:45,560
like the wires are plug in your house
for your broadband or your you know your

1444
01:02:45,560 --> 01:02:46,799
television or whatever

1445
01:02:46,800 --> 01:02:49,549
to this type of environment where

1446
01:02:49,549 --> 01:02:50,530
very low throughput

1447
01:02:50,530 --> 01:02:55,210
ray long-range potentially higher fee
ranks and when you've got no such things

1448
01:02:55,210 --> 01:02:58,269
would be most commonly see is f s k

1449
01:02:58,269 --> 01:03:02,689
frequency shipping is very resilient to
being stepped on by all kinds of things

1450
01:03:02,689 --> 01:03:05,129
so we run into that more than

1451
01:03:05,130 --> 01:03:07,980
anything else it's not you know if you
will find other types of modulation

1452
01:03:07,980 --> 01:03:09,270
stance on these devices but

1453
01:03:09,270 --> 01:03:13,249
in general british a king is once again

1454
01:03:13,249 --> 01:03:17,388
yet typically are patterns a staffer
bergen's summitted like in my stuff

1455
01:03:17,389 --> 01:03:18,210
actually

1456
01:03:18,210 --> 01:03:20,579
visits dot more than actually less
driving

1457
01:03:20,579 --> 01:03:21,230
these things

1458
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:24,419
uh... you'll see some kind of algorithm
the usa

1459
01:03:24,419 --> 01:03:25,670
uh... to actually

1460
01:03:25,670 --> 01:03:28,019
you know in some cases paired up with
things like

1461
01:03:28,019 --> 01:03:29,189
some other

1462
01:03:29,189 --> 01:03:31,019
factor like the mac address in the

1463
01:03:31,019 --> 01:03:33,598
houston pieces that are or whatever

1464
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:36,519
to make the hard decisions but for what
it's like really dumb ones that are

1465
01:03:36,519 --> 01:03:37,538
disputes

1466
01:03:37,539 --> 01:03:38,729
essentially just

1467
01:03:38,729 --> 01:03:41,328
relating to serial scada

1468
01:03:41,329 --> 01:03:42,459
those are

1469
01:03:42,459 --> 01:03:43,788
yet those are things were just like

1470
01:03:43,789 --> 01:03:45,459
here's the seven hot patterns

1471
01:03:45,459 --> 01:03:47,469
and there's usually default one

1472
01:03:47,469 --> 01:03:48,510
on that's

1473
01:03:48,510 --> 01:03:49,919
just on

1474
01:03:49,919 --> 01:03:50,749
on the radio

1475
01:03:50,749 --> 01:03:52,618
that comes with a victory

1476
01:03:52,619 --> 01:03:54,519
when you read the one page setup guide

1477
01:03:54,519 --> 01:03:56,279
for it just says he'll

1478
01:03:56,279 --> 01:04:00,669
did it work okay

1479
01:04:00,669 --> 01:04:04,249
said yet the the way that we've spent a
lifetime

1480
01:04:04,249 --> 01:04:06,388
writes what year

1481
01:04:06,389 --> 01:04:07,949
that yet so

1482
01:04:07,949 --> 01:04:10,979
two major components uh... interface of
the stuff you need to have hardware

1483
01:04:10,979 --> 01:04:12,888
needed to have the software to do it

1484
01:04:12,889 --> 01:04:15,609
in that part world of

1485
01:04:15,609 --> 01:04:16,839
available or or or

1486
01:04:16,839 --> 01:04:18,379
fairly inexpensive

1487
01:04:18,379 --> 01:04:23,959
ways to interface the stuff but really
expensive meaning not fifty k right

1488
01:04:23,959 --> 01:04:28,598
universe offer radio peripheral it's a
device un comes in into versions are

1489
01:04:28,599 --> 01:04:32,589
version one version two version one is a
little bit cheaper it's older

1490
01:04:32,589 --> 01:04:35,759
it's been around longer so there's more
like example code four

1491
01:04:35,759 --> 01:04:39,569
but version two has been much wider
throughput basically that they

1492
01:04:39,569 --> 01:04:41,920
eliminated a handful bottlenecks that
land version one

1493
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:45,809
and residual life for example to sniff
the entire high cement wants

1494
01:04:45,809 --> 01:04:46,920
i'm being a major

1495
01:04:46,920 --> 01:04:50,829
make a profit yemen yet pastor clocking
and

1496
01:04:50,829 --> 01:04:54,690
different different epudu designed and
actually can you know or

1497
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:58,569
received transiting time either neat
stuff

1498
01:04:58,569 --> 01:04:59,829
but the yadda

1499
01:04:59,829 --> 01:05:01,249
the the number one thing that week

1500
01:05:01,249 --> 01:05:04,939
that we like about the team is that we
can we can grab a much wider

1501
01:05:04,939 --> 01:05:06,799
so for looking at things that are
exercised

1502
01:05:06,799 --> 01:05:10,459
we can pull beta chapter we can get the
whole operation there

1503
01:05:10,459 --> 01:05:13,140
which spree dipti

1504
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:16,390
u_s_ yet in the senate i think that
there's like there's fun example code in

1505
01:05:16,390 --> 01:05:19,719
their becomes within within a radio talk
about sex

1506
01:05:19,719 --> 01:05:23,109
that will allow you to for example smith
pager data

1507
01:05:23,109 --> 01:05:23,659
across like

1508
01:05:23,659 --> 01:05:26,609
all eighty channel two hundred twenty
channels whatever it is

1509
01:05:26,609 --> 01:05:30,549
and so it's that's not a silly if it is
that's because and

1510
01:05:30,549 --> 01:05:31,530
hopping between them

1511
01:05:31,530 --> 01:05:32,479
but

1512
01:05:32,479 --> 01:05:37,709
as i said if i carriers use different
channels like that so with this

1513
01:05:37,709 --> 01:05:39,730
one want onepass basically

1514
01:05:39,730 --> 01:05:41,130
you can grab all of the ones

1515
01:05:41,130 --> 01:05:43,089
with one of us

1516
01:05:43,089 --> 01:05:46,479
so be a radio right that's the primary
software that you used to drive this

1517
01:05:46,479 --> 01:05:47,339
stuff

1518
01:05:47,339 --> 01:05:49,019
oven source

1519
01:05:49,019 --> 01:05:50,959
that actually implements

1520
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:56,880
all of the modulation d modulation
decoding accusation all that stuff all

1521
01:05:56,880 --> 01:05:59,049
happens within wasn't software on its

1522
01:05:59,049 --> 01:06:03,839
it's primarily python with c snippets
that will

1523
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:05,119
blood not insects augusta

1524
01:06:05,119 --> 01:06:06,260
than seco

1525
01:06:06,260 --> 01:06:07,399
that will

1526
01:06:07,399 --> 01:06:09,299
drive her highly intensive stocks

1527
01:06:09,300 --> 01:06:11,259
so it's got really it

1528
01:06:11,259 --> 01:06:13,409
high need for you know

1529
01:06:13,409 --> 01:06:14,880
quick operations

1530
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:16,649
so that we put in there

1531
01:06:16,649 --> 01:06:20,719
it's dot gave very wide a fiat that will
do most of the things that you would

1532
01:06:20,719 --> 01:06:21,630
ever want to do

1533
01:06:21,630 --> 01:06:24,309
right so

1534
01:06:24,309 --> 01:06:25,869
everything from catholic

1535
01:06:25,869 --> 01:06:28,709
accusation to modulation inoculation

1536
01:06:28,709 --> 01:06:30,279
including a decoding

1537
01:06:30,279 --> 01:06:33,779
and i'd just as they did a quick
background what those are right ab

1538
01:06:33,779 --> 01:06:34,690
including a decoding

1539
01:06:34,690 --> 01:06:36,609
is about how to map

1540
01:06:36,609 --> 01:06:38,940
basically zeros and ones that like spit
out of something

1541
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:39,999
back today

1542
01:06:39,999 --> 01:06:43,189
as both ways you can do that it may
literally be better to zero one

1543
01:06:43,189 --> 01:06:45,250
and that they want to go on in his ear
zero

1544
01:06:45,250 --> 01:06:49,299
but may not have other ways to do that
as well then modulation

1545
01:06:49,299 --> 01:06:52,859
is specifically

1546
01:06:52,859 --> 01:06:53,940
that signal

1547
01:06:53,940 --> 01:06:56,179
is sent across the air

1548
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:57,690
when you collect something

1549
01:06:57,690 --> 01:06:59,849
inside you sir

1550
01:06:59,849 --> 01:07:01,189
modulation

1551
01:07:01,189 --> 01:07:01,879
wikia's

1552
01:07:01,879 --> 01:07:04,169
how information is represented within
that st

1553
01:07:04,169 --> 01:07:07,899
so africa's checking out we talked about
this for me as a to f_ as kato one we

1554
01:07:07,899 --> 01:07:12,049
must come and see because prolong range
purposes in that

1555
01:07:12,049 --> 01:07:13,680
aphis k basically means that there

1556
01:07:13,680 --> 01:07:17,490
is sort of like a specificity chale like
this pregnant that you you would focus

1557
01:07:17,490 --> 01:07:19,249
on at the center of the channel

1558
01:07:19,249 --> 01:07:22,669
and then you'll have to letter often
each side

1559
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:24,699
that basically about has been doing

1560
01:07:24,699 --> 01:07:28,899
and when you're on what like that like
that with the actress so if you were an

1561
01:07:28,899 --> 01:07:31,740
average everything the left side of that
airing on the right side of that

1562
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:33,868
dublisky collapse into un

1563
01:07:33,869 --> 01:07:38,149
you know two points better to the left
and right of senator and as it's on one

1564
01:07:38,149 --> 01:07:41,380
or the other that represents

1565
01:07:41,380 --> 01:07:46,529
right and i'd get a package of liquid
fellows are as a cave but though

1566
01:07:46,529 --> 01:07:50,650
yet what the were quite like the way i
the way i explain to people is that

1567
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:54,459
you we also understand what you think
that is forces on a wire

1568
01:07:54,459 --> 01:07:58,359
those poll system at to yet suit as
yours once

1569
01:07:58,359 --> 01:08:01,828
the different symbol john departs on
detected so if you really need the

1570
01:08:01,829 --> 01:08:04,339
savings radio

1571
01:08:04,339 --> 01:08:06,919
there's lots of ways to do it and
there's a lot more map of all there's a

1572
01:08:06,919 --> 01:08:09,339
little more complicated mix ups with
lower

1573
01:08:09,340 --> 01:08:10,229
network throughput

1574
01:08:10,229 --> 01:08:12,788
but it really is the same principle
years trying to get you try to get down

1575
01:08:12,789 --> 01:08:15,900
to unit two dates again

1576
01:08:15,900 --> 01:08:17,489
anderson cooper

1577
01:08:17,488 --> 01:08:18,318
don't work

1578
01:08:18,319 --> 01:08:20,089
disclosure eyes analysts

1579
01:08:20,089 --> 01:08:24,839
you didn't see that

1580
01:08:24,839 --> 01:08:26,448
ya'll can help

1581
01:08:26,448 --> 01:08:30,129
densities that overall point but in a
radio has way more stuff than we've ever

1582
01:08:30,130 --> 01:08:31,029
touch with this

1583
01:08:31,029 --> 01:08:33,399
and would need by and there's

1584
01:08:33,399 --> 01:08:37,159
all candidates taking something to it
from

1585
01:08:37,158 --> 01:08:39,889
uh... radio announcers like stars

1586
01:08:39,890 --> 01:08:43,190
to tapping into like in a way whether
softened

1587
01:08:43,189 --> 01:08:47,519
it's all in all kind of stuff and
built-in vocoder goa so if you don't

1588
01:08:47,520 --> 01:08:49,129
know about that

1589
01:08:49,129 --> 01:08:51,969
auditor that

1590
01:08:51,969 --> 01:08:55,118
d_j_ operations

1591
01:08:55,118 --> 01:08:59,219
so yet so essentially like if we don't
know if we have come a rough idea what's

1592
01:08:59,219 --> 01:09:00,649
going on with something

1593
01:09:00,649 --> 01:09:04,568
on distal simple ways that needed to
sample the air we look for kicks the kid

1594
01:09:04,569 --> 01:09:07,349
is close to the unitary reduced camp

1595
01:09:07,349 --> 01:09:09,779
we have real close to the signals the
strongest thing to see

1596
01:09:09,779 --> 01:09:12,539
and his wife patterns

1597
01:09:12,538 --> 01:09:14,568
n actually worked out

1598
01:09:14,569 --> 01:09:15,410
you know we've

1599
01:09:15,410 --> 01:09:18,009
in cases where we've got a control
radios

1600
01:09:18,009 --> 01:09:20,799
we where we can you know we have control
the traffic stream

1601
01:09:20,799 --> 01:09:23,618
ob you we can literally just sent

1602
01:09:23,618 --> 01:09:24,448
one character

1603
01:09:24,448 --> 01:09:25,538
wait a second

1604
01:09:25,538 --> 01:09:28,738
another character we decide and we can
see

1605
01:09:28,738 --> 01:09:29,198
visually

1606
01:09:29,198 --> 01:09:32,540
at those pics pop out and that's the hot
seat tried in what you see that

1607
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:34,658
better or people you know when depending
on

1608
01:09:34,658 --> 01:09:38,450
what about it and they used it's not
uncommon to see one just lived forever

1609
01:09:38,450 --> 01:09:40,839
rights if you watch it long enough to
get that pattern down

1610
01:09:40,839 --> 01:09:43,828
then who cares if ya graham algorithm as
you know i know what that pattern is

1611
01:09:43,828 --> 01:09:44,649
that you needed

1612
01:09:44,649 --> 01:09:50,288
to have to speak with a given bias were
listen to the midwest

1613
01:09:50,288 --> 01:09:54,949
yet what we found the yogi in terms of

1614
01:09:54,949 --> 01:09:56,759
cheating basically

1615
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:59,980
is that there's lots of places where
this information a week

1616
01:09:59,980 --> 01:10:03,199
we were dealing with in in a couple of
cases vendors that wouldn't wouldn't

1617
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:04,768
tell us anything about that

1618
01:10:04,769 --> 01:10:08,300
useless we would guess which will get
the edge of your guys like just like

1619
01:10:08,300 --> 01:10:09,369
throw grandad

1620
01:10:09,369 --> 01:10:10,230
you know visit

1621
01:10:10,230 --> 01:10:12,120
we did because they wouldn't say

1622
01:10:12,120 --> 01:10:13,639
but don't yet

1623
01:10:13,639 --> 01:10:16,729
just don't say anything if i may i ask
that

1624
01:10:16,729 --> 01:10:17,560
and he would

1625
01:10:17,560 --> 01:10:20,069
yes recall for something

1626
01:10:20,069 --> 01:10:21,840
so we have a car stereo

1627
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:25,969
what we found is that uh... we've got
some it's really neat things from patton

1628
01:10:25,969 --> 01:10:30,260
bob f_c_c_ i_d_ lookups a really good
uh... their was one case we look at a

1629
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:31,120
vendor where

1630
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:34,790
there's actually a there's a place in
europe cc application to react

1631
01:10:34,790 --> 01:10:38,189
ob we're you can say you please dumps
close information because it's

1632
01:10:38,189 --> 01:10:40,340
brighter treated him a just did it
anyway

1633
01:10:40,340 --> 01:10:41,880
so it's like the letter

1634
01:10:41,880 --> 01:10:44,520
two hundred says please don't tell
anybody or copy other than

1635
01:10:44,520 --> 01:10:47,429
and unlike the next exhibit in the
f_c_c_

1636
01:10:47,429 --> 01:10:50,110
is the argument

1637
01:10:50,110 --> 01:10:53,280
and yet so they are all in all that you
might esr obrigada everything else out

1638
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:57,768
the f_c_c_ tells us a lot about what the
radio steve

1639
01:10:57,769 --> 01:11:01,189
what we end actual get to this on a

1640
01:11:01,189 --> 01:11:03,379
victim radio here in a second

1641
01:11:03,379 --> 01:11:06,679
we also found it you looking at it

1642
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:08,680
for what it's worth

1643
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:10,109
former extraction

1644
01:11:10,109 --> 01:11:12,199
ob in this case

1645
01:11:12,199 --> 01:11:14,009
a lot of times didn't help

1646
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:17,120
because this is this is that was
something done on board so that

1647
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:18,070
it did

1648
01:11:18,070 --> 01:11:19,289
firmware will have something like

1649
01:11:19,289 --> 01:11:24,309
you drawl unicorns function that just
talks to the radio ended all that stuff

1650
01:11:24,309 --> 01:11:27,199
stopping you know a lot of pieces of
hardware

1651
01:11:27,199 --> 01:11:30,410
the for my tell us about the the

1652
01:11:30,410 --> 01:11:32,800
the larger you protocols

1653
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:36,280
that's its community on stuff the kids
radio's regional looking at

1654
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:40,599
high-seas

1655
01:11:40,599 --> 01:11:45,079
module art models on the board itself

1656
01:11:45,079 --> 01:11:46,040
that ended

1657
01:11:46,040 --> 01:11:50,039
daschle uh... you can bill called the
vendor

1658
01:11:50,039 --> 01:11:53,099
bios in and participates bragging to add

1659
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:56,739
drama job postings things like that
saying look it would be great if you had

1660
01:11:56,739 --> 01:11:58,308
specific expertise in

1661
01:11:58,309 --> 01:11:59,969
block in ileal

1662
01:11:59,969 --> 01:12:02,969
now i know what your get up to date yeah
we're looking for somebody with

1663
01:12:02,969 --> 01:12:07,360
yet with jeff escape spirits whatever
might be set

1664
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:13,259
c_s_o_ this is a this is actually on
eight digi board that is that basically

1665
01:12:13,260 --> 01:12:17,670
scada or a freeway or syria large
related huge blossom chutki bid but

1666
01:12:17,670 --> 01:12:21,130
these get used for utility kind of stuff

1667
01:12:21,130 --> 01:12:24,639
so what mostly so i believe down to the
borders there's always shielding that

1668
01:12:24,639 --> 01:12:27,349
the f_c_c_ requires

1669
01:12:27,349 --> 01:12:30,579
entities within proposed here you'll
pretty sticker

1670
01:12:30,579 --> 01:12:34,000
and on their dirty talk to the f_c_c_
eddie usually see that on the outside

1671
01:12:34,000 --> 01:12:37,329
we just look at that we walked up there
with their microphones and

1672
01:12:37,329 --> 01:12:39,568
and birthday number down on those who
are

1673
01:12:39,569 --> 01:12:41,090
if if you lose signal

1674
01:12:41,090 --> 01:12:42,399
later today

1675
01:12:42,399 --> 01:12:44,599
terribly sorry

1676
01:12:44,599 --> 01:12:46,799
but they are usually pull the f_c_c_
eddie

1677
01:12:46,799 --> 01:12:48,079
and then once we pop

1678
01:12:48,079 --> 01:12:52,228
uh... there was who pulled out of argue
for the f_t_c_ test information in this

1679
01:12:52,229 --> 01:12:55,040
case for example he tells us audrey a
strange

1680
01:12:55,040 --> 01:12:57,840
it else actually did well time for
channel

1681
01:12:57,840 --> 01:13:01,539
on and channel width and things like
that and also you know their case that

1682
01:13:01,539 --> 01:13:02,839
modulation type

1683
01:13:02,839 --> 01:13:05,269
which may or may not actually be
accurate

1684
01:13:05,269 --> 01:13:08,149
you know in some cases

1685
01:13:08,149 --> 01:13:09,090
but yet

1686
01:13:09,090 --> 01:13:12,370
what's would pop chilling opponents
vices don't look it pumps are it'd be

1687
01:13:12,370 --> 01:13:13,940
soldered i was upstairs and

1688
01:13:13,940 --> 01:13:16,759
i thought we had a screwdriver

1689
01:13:16,759 --> 01:13:18,030
if you are

1690
01:13:18,030 --> 01:13:21,728
yea if you pull that i see and hear a
lot of cases may be new magnifying glass

1691
01:13:21,729 --> 01:13:22,980
for a person like that

1692
01:13:22,980 --> 01:13:25,608
people does i see never killed in a
datasheet

1693
01:13:25,609 --> 01:13:28,209
it a lot of cases the or if i see

1694
01:13:28,209 --> 01:13:32,239
will literally tell you what for example
eight how to drive it

1695
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:34,768
on you over the bus if you wanna be back

1696
01:13:34,769 --> 01:13:39,949
but also the modulation types supported
ob the clock rates and a bit rates and

1697
01:13:39,949 --> 01:13:41,009
we d modulate

1698
01:13:41,010 --> 01:13:43,679
the stated transferred into zeros and
ones that so we need

1699
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:47,300
you all of those values to match up to
what the

1700
01:13:47,300 --> 01:13:51,799
reviewer tom sent

1701
01:13:51,799 --> 01:13:55,290
right so this is just a a staff out of
what we're talking about a m

1702
01:13:55,290 --> 01:13:56,440
mapping the entire

1703
01:13:56,440 --> 01:13:57,659
bias in there

1704
01:13:57,659 --> 01:14:00,129
so everything widow's peak she cn top

1705
01:14:00,129 --> 01:14:03,780
every one of those channel burst so
that's a verse somewhere within a hot

1706
01:14:03,780 --> 01:14:07,309
we are still listed as example
specifically focusing on one channel

1707
01:14:07,310 --> 01:14:08,769
that's the one that's got the blue

1708
01:14:08,769 --> 01:14:10,049
it's coming up right there

1709
01:14:10,049 --> 01:14:12,949
and then on the bottom side is that
being decoded

1710
01:14:12,949 --> 01:14:17,178
so focusing on on that and the channel
just for for this graphic

1711
01:14:17,179 --> 01:14:18,709
what pops up at the bottom

1712
01:14:18,709 --> 01:14:19,260
practice

1713
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:21,780
roughly zeros and ones but it's
observing coating or decoding and they

1714
01:14:21,780 --> 01:14:22,500
need to happen

1715
01:14:22,500 --> 01:14:25,179
so may not be exactly is your warmth

1716
01:14:25,179 --> 01:14:29,379
but your divert close and oftentimes
it's it's identical

1717
01:14:29,379 --> 01:14:32,570
deployments yen clock recovery it's not
great stuff

1718
01:14:32,570 --> 01:14:34,370
what's what's happened his radio is not

1719
01:14:34,370 --> 01:14:36,970
you know on the other side of this will
give us like a director chala keep it up

1720
01:14:36,970 --> 01:14:38,290
right

1721
01:14:38,290 --> 01:14:43,120
the voltage on a on a wire go very
predictably to really clear levels right

1722
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:44,519
but in the case radio

1723
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:47,200
with signal and bleeding interference
and all that

1724
01:14:47,200 --> 01:14:48,880
it's getting what they pursue

1725
01:14:48,880 --> 01:14:50,360
usually what's happening is

1726
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:53,610
aunt you're looking at the symbol rate
and in your converting back to you

1727
01:14:53,610 --> 01:14:59,089
that's going to not some number that's
closer to the report

1728
01:14:59,090 --> 01:15:00,829
sierra big candidate

1729
01:15:00,829 --> 01:15:03,290
know what that is is it

1730
01:15:03,290 --> 01:15:05,840
these are caesar

1731
01:15:05,840 --> 01:15:07,629
uh...

1732
01:15:07,629 --> 01:15:08,889
but yeah thats

1733
01:15:08,889 --> 01:15:12,189
that's kind of it on the other side of
what that's what the

1734
01:15:12,189 --> 01:15:16,840
at this mix it with the channel watching
like with a maps out

1735
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:20,030
those yet that you had talked with us a
little earlier this just assuming on one

1736
01:15:20,030 --> 01:15:21,219
individual burst

1737
01:15:21,219 --> 01:15:23,949
and what that looks like that and

1738
01:15:23,949 --> 01:15:25,049
and

1739
01:15:25,050 --> 01:15:27,330
the way so what what this is actually
drawing

1740
01:15:27,330 --> 01:15:30,300
is and averaging lots of samples

1741
01:15:30,300 --> 01:15:32,249
over you know short period of time

1742
01:15:32,249 --> 01:15:33,619
that are dead

1743
01:15:33,619 --> 01:15:36,449
showing you exactly where whites where
that signal is

1744
01:15:36,449 --> 01:15:41,239
and so it's always impossible it's
between basically these two different

1745
01:15:41,239 --> 01:15:44,280
it's averaging two two different

1746
01:15:44,280 --> 01:15:44,769
frequencies

1747
01:15:44,770 --> 01:15:51,770
that shift between two representative
dishonored

1748
01:15:54,850 --> 01:15:56,489
and so

1749
01:15:56,489 --> 01:15:58,289
ultimately only on the other side of it

1750
01:15:58,289 --> 01:16:01,509
you know what you say we could be wiped
interception

1751
01:16:01,509 --> 01:16:04,960
the average us espy's depending on how
many readers are useing in theirs

1752
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:07,569
your partisan charges if there's a lot
of traffic

1753
01:16:07,569 --> 01:16:09,619
on that we have a single sample

1754
01:16:09,619 --> 01:16:13,769
it with you today that sequential right
that the police overtime in one week

1755
01:16:13,770 --> 01:16:14,210
breakdown

1756
01:16:14,210 --> 01:16:15,429
right it it's a big

1757
01:16:15,429 --> 01:16:18,749
iptc i_p_ traffic it's got headers in
session information all that stuff there

1758
01:16:18,749 --> 01:16:21,650
we don't really carefully if we follow
the hops

1759
01:16:21,650 --> 01:16:25,169
stock necessarily wrote

1760
01:16:25,169 --> 01:16:28,318
but yet usually guided by the modulation
scheme

1761
01:16:28,319 --> 01:16:30,480
including several rate

1762
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:32,909
big indian little indian

1763
01:16:32,909 --> 01:16:33,309
odd

1764
01:16:33,310 --> 01:16:35,480
you know what's what's up

1765
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:39,369
it's really hard

1766
01:16:39,369 --> 01:16:41,330
it's again so pretty much

1767
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:44,360
once you start with your sample in i
delete a situation where you can

1768
01:16:44,360 --> 01:16:45,469
generate

1769
01:16:45,469 --> 01:16:46,290
traffic

1770
01:16:46,290 --> 01:16:50,530
bumped me where you basically that
they're doing a spending a bunch of time

1771
01:16:50,530 --> 01:16:53,159
taking those samples and

1772
01:16:53,159 --> 01:16:55,909
froing differently modulation types in
different kinds of our product based on

1773
01:16:55,909 --> 01:16:58,869
two things that you can guess for me i
scenes

1774
01:16:58,869 --> 01:17:01,839
try to extract from whatever other
sources you define to get as close as

1775
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:05,010
you can

1776
01:17:05,010 --> 01:17:12,010
wind actual data comes out then you know
that you got it right

1777
01:17:12,130 --> 01:17:16,189
uh... it dad actually a belief at this
point to that

1778
01:17:16,189 --> 01:17:17,830
you know in a lot of cases you might

1779
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:20,719
it actually with our so they're stuck
with those would be like

1780
01:17:20,719 --> 01:17:21,649
we mention that

1781
01:17:21,649 --> 01:17:23,960
there isn't a surly really easy supsac

1782
01:17:23,960 --> 01:17:24,800
yet porous

1783
01:17:24,800 --> 01:17:27,880
it we still could do a lot of testing to
see because if we could just generate

1784
01:17:27,880 --> 01:17:29,949
traffic general double purpose traffic

1785
01:17:29,949 --> 01:17:32,969
who did this really have to know

1786
01:17:32,969 --> 01:17:34,980
you know that kind of package
instructional

1787
01:17:34,980 --> 01:17:38,608
what exactly was going on

1788
01:17:38,609 --> 01:17:42,139
if we even if we have basically go with
the states are doing

1789
01:17:42,139 --> 01:17:45,150
it still gives us off

1790
01:17:45,150 --> 01:17:48,080
u_n_ obsolete especially if if there's
no other

1791
01:17:48,080 --> 01:17:52,809
uh... any other kind of time in your or

1792
01:17:52,810 --> 01:17:57,539
sequence pieces in place we can just
directly replay that it

1793
01:17:57,539 --> 01:18:03,929
than you and i don't care they'll
initially needy

1794
01:18:03,929 --> 01:18:07,360
and yet surfaces that may be the
follow-up sequences and get hit it right

1795
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:09,080
now you would

1796
01:18:09,080 --> 01:18:09,630
and uh...

1797
01:18:09,630 --> 01:18:14,469
three four six percent

1798
01:18:14,469 --> 01:18:19,169
we're out of time

1799
01:18:19,169 --> 01:18:22,769
there so they are willing to just
general other stuff with satellite and

1800
01:18:22,769 --> 01:18:26,219
writes a radius is they have something
like to be a society in authentication

1801
01:18:26,219 --> 01:18:30,199
and things like that allot of time such
as the number it's in forever

1802
01:18:30,199 --> 01:18:33,799
and doesn't do any of the validation

1803
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:35,879
either maybe something like a pro mismo

1804
01:18:35,879 --> 01:18:38,000
you know someone for reagan flip on

1805
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:43,320
also gab neutral to renew itself it may
just it for you

1806
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:50,320
mate may just allowed people to buy a
lot of the joint

1807
01:18:50,810 --> 01:18:54,739
yes opus and summary and everything we
talked about so far

1808
01:18:54,739 --> 01:18:56,759
we like standards

1809
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:59,649
real quick so that's been actually
looked at

1810
01:18:59,649 --> 01:19:04,160
people in the industry and by people
smarter than

1811
01:19:04,160 --> 01:19:08,300
pigeon a my sec go out and now and look
at some other stuff another's people

1812
01:19:08,300 --> 01:19:12,630
here that are members of a m i said we'd
like to buy tickets it's it's good work

1813
01:19:12,630 --> 01:19:17,540
where they're going

1814
01:19:17,540 --> 01:19:18,459
utilities yet

1815
01:19:18,459 --> 01:19:20,840
yet utilities really need to pledge
they're the ones that have

1816
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:23,059
the money in this in this particular
thing

1817
01:19:23,059 --> 01:19:27,449
so they're the ones that ultimately can
get things fixed

1818
01:19:27,449 --> 01:19:30,860
yet well it on the actually on the other
side of that to presumably however body

1819
01:19:30,860 --> 01:19:34,589
in this room is you from philly security
louise consumers too

1820
01:19:34,590 --> 01:19:36,609
you gas questions ob

1821
01:19:36,609 --> 01:19:39,190
with ido we were on site

1822
01:19:39,190 --> 01:19:41,309
in for a particular utility and

1823
01:19:41,310 --> 01:19:44,800
they haven't you know they've made the
rounds it would still like their contact

1824
01:19:44,800 --> 01:19:47,050
us webform

1825
01:19:47,050 --> 01:19:50,040
the persons that you know i'm just happy
to talk to

1826
01:19:50,040 --> 01:19:52,889
and ask what your questions about what
are they do it we have all the way up to

1827
01:19:52,889 --> 01:19:56,149
the c_e_o_ and all our at cellmark

1828
01:19:56,149 --> 01:19:58,039
people are paying attention

1829
01:19:58,039 --> 01:20:03,130
id so yes this questions as a consumer

1830
01:20:03,130 --> 01:20:06,570
bed yeah this is yet nervousness illini
step to sort of a different

1831
01:20:06,570 --> 01:20:09,070
i differ with regard to

1832
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:12,849
wheat which i think it it's being
basically nation state attackers and you

1833
01:20:12,849 --> 01:20:16,239
know also kind of actor electrician's
what does your two sets of

1834
01:20:16,239 --> 01:20:19,619
yeah attackers there's a difference its
problems

1835
01:20:19,619 --> 01:20:21,570
about everybody

1836
01:20:21,570 --> 01:20:23,080
enjoy the ponies i think that's cute
