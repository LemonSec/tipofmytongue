entirely different aspect of the DMCA

62
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:14,030
then we're going to be too

63
00:02:10,758 --> 00:02:15,980
about today there we're gonna be<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking</font>

64
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,540
about the<font color="#CCCCCC"> DMCA</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and the a CTA and there</font>

65
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:19,010
are two parts<font color="#CCCCCC"> the DMCA</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them which I've</font>

66
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:20,120
done research one is the one we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

67
00:02:19,010 --> 00:02:23,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">to talk about here which is takedown</font>

68
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,260
notices and the other one which I'm not

69
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:25,849
really really ready to<font color="#E5E5E5"> answer questions</font>

70
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,140
about today<font color="#E5E5E5"> and because there's some</font>

71
00:02:25,849 --> 00:02:29,298
<font color="#E5E5E5">brand new case law that's very exciting</font>

72
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:31,069
about jailbreaking iphones that was an

73
00:02:29,299 --> 00:02:33,409
interesting case that came out and this

74
00:02:31,069 --> 00:02:35,599
was in regard to the anti-circumvention

75
00:02:33,409 --> 00:02:37,010
majors that are put in for copyrights if

76
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,709
you break the anti kisser convention

77
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:40,819
majors under the dmca it's illegal even

78
00:02:39,709 --> 00:02:42,680
if you want to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the code that's</font>

79
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:44,929
on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> other side of it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and that should</font>

80
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:47,030
be fair use what we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about</font>

81
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:50,060
today are the provisions<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the</font>

82
00:02:47,030 --> 00:02:52,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">takedown notices such as if you say that</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you have a copyrighted claim and someone</font>

else has taken apart from your book or

00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:58,129
your movie and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're using</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it and</font>

86
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:00,079
they're not it's not fair use<font color="#E5E5E5"> there</font>

87
00:02:58,129 --> 00:03:04,099
don't give you proper attribution for

88
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:06,920
your work you can file a dmca 5 1 12

89
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:07,819
take now notice to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP and Chris</font>

90
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:10,608
will tell you a little bit how that

91
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:12,768
affects the ISP but the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISB to keep</font>

92
00:03:10,609 --> 00:03:14,840
their safe harbor which means that they

93
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:17,030
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be contributory sued or</font>

94
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,109
negligent for the copyrighted<font color="#E5E5E5"> material</font>

95
00:03:17,030 --> 00:03:21,379
so they have to go through some

96
00:03:18,109 --> 00:03:23,180
procedures and take it down right so

97
00:03:21,379 --> 00:03:25,819
there are elements<font color="#E5E5E5"> a notification and us</font>

98
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:27,319
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I Spees if we if we comply with those</font>

99
00:03:25,819 --> 00:03:30,379
elements<font color="#CCCCCC"> and notification then we don't</font>

100
00:03:27,319 --> 00:03:31,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">share liability with the user and then</font>

101
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:35,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's also a counter-notice procedure</font>

102
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:37,488
to allow for abusive takedown notices to

103
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:41,720
be countered I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's probably</font>

104
00:03:37,489 --> 00:03:44,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">enough to move us forward and the a CTA</font>

105
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:47,629
is kind of like the<font color="#E5E5E5"> International dmca</font>

106
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,699
and that's up and coming the a CTA if

107
00:03:47,629 --> 00:03:51,048
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> passed many countries will have</font>

108
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:53,720
chilling<font color="#E5E5E5"> effects like we have here in</font>

109
00:03:51,049 --> 00:03:55,669
the US<font color="#E5E5E5"> I believe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that the DMCA is not</font>

110

being used for the purpose for which it

111
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:59,510
was the legislation<font color="#CCCCCC"> was drafted so I'll</font>

112
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:00,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">tell you about some organizations</font>

113
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:03,018
including ours that are working<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

114
00:04:00,739 --> 00:04:04,639
either amend the DMCA through case law

115
00:04:03,019 --> 00:04:07,519
or through changing the legislation

116
00:04:04,639 --> 00:04:08,989
itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to give you some hypos</font>

117
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,019
and at the<font color="#CCCCCC"> end I'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell you if</font>

118
00:04:08,989 --> 00:04:13,639
it's real or not one of these is the

119
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:16,459
unfair corporate advantage do you think

120
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:18,380
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> use dmca takedown notices to to</font>

121
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:20,089
harm your competitor well here's the

122
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:22,039
hypo you run a software company your

123
00:04:20,089 --> 00:04:23,000
competitor has a very similar product

124
00:04:22,039 --> 00:04:23,789
they're going to launch about the same

125
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,400
time<font color="#CCCCCC"> as you</font>

126
00:04:23,790 --> 00:04:27,960
so if you're quick<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to be first</font>

127
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,690
to market that's great if you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font>

128
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:32,880
innovative product but your ISP gets a

129
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:34,350
ton of takedown notices and ISPs don't

130
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,880
like these takedown notices it's too

131
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:36,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">much you know too much to deal with they</font>

132
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:39,630
don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to have to consider</font>

133
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:40,620
the fair use aspects of it often they

134
00:04:39,630 --> 00:04:41,940
say they're not lawyers and they don't

135
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:45,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be so they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just take your stuff</font>

136
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:47,219
right down<font color="#E5E5E5"> so what happens your your</font>

137
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:49,980
companies are your pic competitor site

138
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:51,600
can go down with it for at least<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 days</font>

139
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:54,390
that's a statutory period in which we

140
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,360
take down sites or well complaints that

141
00:04:54,390 --> 00:04:59,159
we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> had to in the past so another one</font>

142
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,150
is silencing discussion of security

143
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:01,920

144
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:03,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">appropriate for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this audience so you're</font>

145
00:05:01,920 --> 00:05:05,160
a security<font color="#CCCCCC"> researcher you have some</font>

00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:08,310
stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's pretty awesome and you like</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">Oh day stuff so someone</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> else though is</font>

148
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:12,810
doing about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same research you are so</font>

149
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:14,609
what do you do to compete<font color="#CCCCCC"> with them ok</font>

150
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:16,500
you know maybe you're better that the co

151
00:05:14,610 --> 00:05:20,460
with them maybe you're not so you decide

152
00:05:16,500 --> 00:05:22,680
to use<font color="#CCCCCC"> the DMCA and same thing you flood</font>

153
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:24,659
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP with the takedown notices you</font>

154
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,190
probably think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> most of them are</font>

155
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:27,540
illegitimate but the ISP won't know

156
00:05:26,190 --> 00:05:31,380
they're not lawyers they'll take it down

157
00:05:27,540 --> 00:05:33,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you know that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so it goes down the</font>

158
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,550
last one and this is the one that's very

159
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:37,080
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is the case that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we are</font>

160
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:39,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking about here so I already give you</font>

161
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,500
a hit this this hypo is true let's say

162
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:42,659
you've been injured by medical

163
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:45,330
techniques that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're a doctor or</font>

164
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:47,040
psychologist used on you in fact maybe a

165
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:49,020
family member of yours has died from

166
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:50,220
these techniques and what how would you

167
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:53,310
feel if you weren't allowed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to put up a</font>

168
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:55,020
website commemorating you're taught your

169
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:56,160
child or a spouse who has died from

170
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:57,810
these techniques because every time you

171
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,760
mentioned the doctor's<font color="#CCCCCC"> name your ISP is</font>

172
00:05:57,810 --> 00:06:01,830
flooded with takedown notices that

website effectively<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you've set up</font>

174
00:06:01,830 --> 00:06:06,930
is down all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time so this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

175
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:08,520
case we'll talk about in which eff has

176
00:06:06,930 --> 00:06:14,250
been assisting us with some work on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

177
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:16,590
so are these factor fiction<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

178
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:18,570
a DMCA I gave you a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit about</font>

already<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the intro about what it does</font>

180
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:21,750
but it was a signed into law by

president clinton in 1998 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not</font>

183
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:25,740

and read the statutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

185
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:30,960
do that the DMCA is to protect

copyrights online it was supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

well has silenced fair use I mean you

198
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:57,770
beyond just some some of the basic stuff

199
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:59,989
<font color="#E5E5E5">that your car outputs and should you be</font>

200
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:01,490
able to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see what your car computer is</font>

201
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,750
storing about you especially in

202
00:07:01,490 --> 00:07:04,699
something that's similar to a black box

203
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:09,110
but if you go look you're violating the

204
00:07:04,699 --> 00:07:10,910
DMCA this is a staggering percentage and

205
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,770
this is what this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is that what we're</font>

206
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:14,599
seeing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> our the is pita crisps</font>

207
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:16,190
friends with thirty-seven percent of the

00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:18,650
takedown notices<font color="#CCCCCC"> Google receives are</font>

209
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:20,840
invalid we're not surprised by this but

210
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:22,429
we're surprised that some of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> law</font>

211
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">makers aren't doing more about this we</font>

212
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:25,400
need more case law we need some

213
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:28,550
legislation to be changed because a lot

214
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:31,039
of these seem to be for competitive

215
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:32,599
advantage so the hypo that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I gave you if</font>

216
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,979
you have a competitor and you want to

217
00:07:32,599 --> 00:07:35,930
take their site down effectively<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

00:07:33,979 --> 00:07:38,180
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten days at a time over and over</font>

219
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:40,580
again every<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten days you slam them with</font>

220
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:43,130
more dmca takedown notices and if

221
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:45,469
they're invalid oh well that's there's

222
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:46,880
some case law that eff is is trying to

223
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:48,440
set now in the Ninth Circuit in

224
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:50,719
California<font color="#CCCCCC"> that says that you should</font>

225
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:53,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">consider fair use if you don't this is</font>

226
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,479
Miss use under Section<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5 1 12 g of the</font>

227
00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:58,340
DMCA but problem with that is you have

228
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,289
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go to court to prove that this is</font>

229
00:07:58,340 --> 00:08:01,729
misuse you have to get an attorney most

230
00:08:00,289 --> 00:08:04,729
likely unless you want to self represent

231
00:08:01,729 --> 00:08:06,349
so this is it's very burdensome if you

232
00:08:04,729 --> 00:08:09,020
run<font color="#CCCCCC"> a company or if you just have a blog</font>

233
00:08:06,349 --> 00:08:11,030
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to handle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> all these takedown</font>

234
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:12,590
notices because most isp's will take

235
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:15,409
them down they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not like Chris's is be</font>

236
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:18,888
<font color="#CCCCCC">alright</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I talked a little bit about the</font>

237
00:08:15,409 --> 00:08:21,050
a CTA but this is has some other little

238
00:08:18,889 --> 00:08:22,610
fixtures to it such as increased

239
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:25,400
authority for searches and seizure at

240
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:27,349
borders and the cooperation<font color="#CCCCCC"> between law</font>

241
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,120
enforcement agencies so other people

242
00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:30,560
here I know a<font color="#E5E5E5"> black hat and DEF CON have</font>

243
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,849
talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> about like laptop search and</font>

244
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,380
procedures and I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to go it</font>

245
00:08:31,849 --> 00:08:37,880
really into a discussion about that but

246
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:39,409
if they if if the<font color="#CCCCCC"> a CTA</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is actually the</font>

247
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:42,229
agreement is signed with the the

248
00:08:39,409 --> 00:08:45,620
signatory<font color="#E5E5E5"> States it's going to be more</font>

249
00:08:42,229 --> 00:08:46,560
challenging to cross the border with a

250
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:49,380
laptop<font color="#CCCCCC"> that has</font>

251
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:52,800
material on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> that may or may</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not be no</font>

252
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:54,540
copyright infringing so the a CTA is

253
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,099
going no one really<font color="#CCCCCC"> knows a lot about it</font>

254
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:57,870
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is what something that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

255
00:08:56,100 --> 00:09:00,150
interesting it's all being discussed

256
00:08:57,870 --> 00:09:01,800
behind closed doors one of the ways that

257
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:03,870
we know about some of the provisions of

258
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:06,959
the a CTA<font color="#CCCCCC"> is that some documents have</font>

259
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:09,779
been leaked and it's really<font color="#CCCCCC"> a shame but</font>

260
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:11,339
a president<font color="#CCCCCC"> Obama has not he has</font>

261
00:09:09,779 --> 00:09:13,620
contributed to some of the closed-door

262
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:15,540
discussions but recently a draft was

263
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:18,089
released I believe it was in april of

264
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,589
this year and<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a think we have a</font>

265
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:22,230
link to<font color="#E5E5E5"> this in our slides but you can</font>

266
00:09:19,589 --> 00:09:24,000
go look at what the a.c.t a CTA says but

267
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:25,529
this is not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the type of legislation that</font>

268
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:28,320
<font color="#CCCCCC">we really want to be discussed behind</font>

269
00:09:25,529 --> 00:09:31,320
closed doors here are the proposed

270
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:33,690
parties to the aacta there's the draft

271
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,460
sorry April temp 2010 that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> released</font>

272
00:09:33,690 --> 00:09:37,500
to the public but before then I was

273
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:39,240
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> research from this an eff was as</font>

274
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:41,820
well by documents that we'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> found online</font>

275
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,400
that were leaked so if the AC T is

276
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:45,779
passed a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of other countries will</font>

277
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,040
have chilling<font color="#E5E5E5"> effects that we are</font>

278
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:51,060
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about here in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this presentation</font>

279
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:54,300
so a couple notes about the talk there's

280
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:57,000
a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> different ISPs and most people</font>

281
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">I think think about the last mile</font>

282
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,450
internet service<font color="#CCCCCC"> prior the people that</font>

283
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:02,430
would provide you dsl or cable access

284

00:10:02,430 --> 00:10:07,949
talking about in this talk however those

287
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:11,910
there are some some really startling

288
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:12,870
things I've spoken with people and

289
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:16,020
there's some really startling

290
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:18,420
consequences of the DMCA for for those

291
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:19,949
users as well what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> are talking about</font>

292
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:22,949
is the type of internet service provider

293
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:25,440
that is a hosting provider so they look

294
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:26,400
a lot like providing<font color="#E5E5E5"> web content you</font>

297
00:10:29,790 --> 00:10:37,410
of providers and why is the why<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this</font>

298
00:10:35,280 --> 00:10:40,319
talk even<font color="#E5E5E5"> relevant after 10 years of the</font>

301
00:10:42,330 --> 00:10:46,260
number of ISPs that don't allow for

302
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:47,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">remember I talked about</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

even allowing for this counter notice of

305
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:53,819
procedure as about three years ago we

306
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:55,140
started to see a real<font color="#E5E5E5"> ramp up in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> num</font>

307
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:57,360
of users<font color="#CCCCCC"> that were kicked off of</font>

308
00:10:55,140 --> 00:11:00,449
providers when their content clearly

309
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:01,890
should what it was fair use so I think

310
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:05,820
the abuse is getting a little bit worse

311
00:11:01,890 --> 00:11:07,500
also this particular piece<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

the ISPs really stand up<font color="#CCCCCC"> for those users</font>

342
00:12:17,310 --> 00:12:21,569

a little bit about and we should

00:12:38,550 --> 00:12:42,060
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> mention</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I like to note here</font>

that what what<font color="#CCCCCC"> project DoD is not we are</font>

00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:53,699
our current user wound up on us now so

415
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:56,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">Federici is an alleged attachment</font>

therapist which means that he treats

00:14:56,730 --> 00:15:02,430
something called reactive attachment

418
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:05,100
disorder that I guess I could try and

00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:06,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">summarize it for you is basically you</font>

420
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:08,940
know a child is deemed to not have an

00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:11,880
emotional connection to their parent and

422
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:13,350
and so they misbehave and this is called

423
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,660

then and then after all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this is done</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">after the child's been broken down they</font>

go through this process<font color="#CCCCCC"> to try and</font>

reform the bond so advocates for

bloggers from the magazine who are

takedown notices to and they have a big

512
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:50,280
legal department so they fight it but if

513
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:52,679
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> didn't have those type of legal</font>

resources going<font color="#E5E5E5"> through this procedure</font>

515
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:57,870
on your own would be just very<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult</font>

516
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:59,880
and well here we got that so takedown

517
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:02,520
notices filed the entire site comes down

518
00:18:59,880 --> 00:19:04,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">so there's no critique and any more acts</font>

519
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:06,210
stuff is down we allow for a

00:19:06,210 --> 00:19:10,230
content comes back up I upstream

522
00:19:08,760 --> 00:19:12,330
provider gets harassed and that's when

523
00:19:10,230 --> 00:19:15,210
we call the FF for some<font color="#CCCCCC"> assistance and</font>

524
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:18,210
they were fantastic<font color="#CCCCCC"> AFF has been very</font>

00:19:15,210 --> 00:19:19,560
helpful<font color="#E5E5E5"> to us they're not co-counsel but</font>

526
00:19:18,210 --> 00:19:22,290
they are have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> advising us on this</font>

527
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:24,570
case so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Federici has some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> other doctors</font>

528
00:19:22,290 --> 00:19:26,159
send more takedown notices and for the

529
00:19:24,570 --> 00:19:28,020
exact same stuff for the exact same

530
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:28,830
pages this is not what the DMCA was

531
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:30,480
intended for

532
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:32,760
yeah i just<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to point out too that</font>

533
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:34,980
our major contribution at this point to

534
00:19:32,760 --> 00:19:37,408
censorship resistance is simply that we

535
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:39,870
followed provision number<font color="#E5E5E5"> two here which</font>

536
00:19:37,409 --> 00:19:42,029
is we allowed for the user<font color="#E5E5E5"> to file a</font>

537
00:19:39,870 --> 00:19:43,768
<font color="#E5E5E5">counter notice in our experience at this</font>

538
00:19:42,029 --> 00:19:44,970
point the vast<font color="#E5E5E5"> majority of Internet</font>

539
00:19:43,769 --> 00:19:47,669
service providers aren't even allowing

540
00:19:44,970 --> 00:19:50,100
this to take place I'll give the

541
00:19:47,669 --> 00:19:52,320
exception to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google they tend to do</font>

542
00:19:50,100 --> 00:19:53,490
better with this but most of the other

543
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:56,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">Internet service providers those will</font>

544
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:58,230
show later have problems with<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so</font>

545
00:19:56,279 --> 00:19:59,940
six months goes by we're like okay great

546
00:19:58,230 --> 00:20:02,190
okay maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is fine now we're all</font>

547
00:19:59,940 --> 00:20:03,990
right and then fitter dr.<font color="#CCCCCC"> federici has</font>

548
00:20:02,190 --> 00:20:06,600
an attorney in<font color="#CCCCCC"> virginia file take no</font>

549
00:20:03,990 --> 00:20:08,730
notice<font color="#E5E5E5"> for the exam content again so</font>

550
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:09,959
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> we go again so we now decide to use</font>

551
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:11,519
that's it we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to fight this</font>

552
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:13,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">we're going to waive the safe harbor</font>

553
00:20:11,519 --> 00:20:17,250

554
00:20:13,230 --> 00:20:18,960
means that if we win<font color="#CCCCCC"> this attorneys fees</font>

555
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:20,669
on pro bono actually all the attorneys

556
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:22,110
on this have been pro bono but if we<font color="#E5E5E5"> win</font>

557
00:20:20,669 --> 00:20:23,309
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get attorneys fees cover two but</font>

558
00:20:22,110 --> 00:20:24,928
it pretty much says that if you file

559
00:20:23,309 --> 00:20:28,769
takedown notices that you know are

560
00:20:24,929 --> 00:20:31,049
fraudulent you can you could be held you

561
00:20:28,769 --> 00:20:32,940
<font color="#CCCCCC">now be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> held liable for that so the</font>

562
00:20:31,049 --> 00:20:34,470
arguments are made main court and we<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font>

563
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:35,970
dismiss for lack of personal

564
00:20:34,470 --> 00:20:38,940
jurisdiction it actually was a little

565
00:20:35,970 --> 00:20:41,100
procedural kind of like a thing in the

566
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:43,470
case<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we are working on but we are</font>

and we're now going to Virginia to

571
00:20:50,789 --> 00:20:56,760
pursue this so common abuses for this

572

573
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,330
shame because under copyright law one of

578
00:21:06,149 --> 00:21:10,080
trade off just like four patents you

579
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:11,820
must make a disclosure of the secret

581
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:15,570
if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have fair use there's some</font>

585
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:23,580
equivalent to a denial of service attack

586
00:21:20,669 --> 00:21:25,649
now I mean that's similar to the one of

noticed that has been really unfortunate

is that I this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is something that as an</font>

can pretty much tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> whoever is doing</font>

00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:22,290
we've traced IP addresses and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it looks</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">like this is related</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this case so all of</font>

614
00:22:22,290 --> 00:22:26,940
the attorneys have had some problems

615
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:29,100
with libel who associate themselves with

616
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:31,890
this case<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that's unfortunate but</font>

when we file a<font color="#E5E5E5"> counter-notice we</font>

618
00:22:31,890 --> 00:22:35,580
sometimes there's some women who are

00:22:33,870 --> 00:22:37,050
trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> hide their identities because</font>

620
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:38,580
it seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of the libel is</font>

621
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:40,500
mostly toward the female attorneys on

622
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:42,510
the case and the female plaintiffs so

623
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:45,030
we're there's a woman who would<font color="#E5E5E5"> like to</font>

type of libel that we've all experienced

626
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:52,380
and so about having to reveal her

627
00:22:51,090 --> 00:22:54,179
identity has been something<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult</font>

628
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:56,730
and in fact she decided<font color="#CCCCCC"> not to join</font>

629
00:22:54,180 --> 00:22:58,770
because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that because for the counter</font>

630
00:22:56,730 --> 00:23:01,710
notice it's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we we need to</font>

631
00:22:58,770 --> 00:23:03,960
put on there and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> isps liability this</font>

632
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:06,120
is difficult<font color="#E5E5E5"> not all as I de SPEs will</font>

633
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,440
do what Chris has done so he's done you

this and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's what project UT is all</font>

636
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:15,360
about yeah and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> more about that</font>

637
00:23:12,510 --> 00:23:17,010
later just that that linking of

638
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:18,750
disinterested third party that cares

639
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:24,420
about profit to whether or not content

640
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:25,800
stays up is just a bad idea we have lens

<font color="#CCCCCC">versus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> universal coming up this is a</font>

case that eff is working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on in</font>

643
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:31,020
California and if this case i believe is

644
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:34,770
still in the appeals process it's not

645
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:36,600
complete yet but if it when it we're

646
00:23:34,770 --> 00:23:39,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">hoping the resolution for that will be</font>

647
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:41,580
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you must consider fair use when you</font>

648
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:43,680
file the takedown notice the complicated

649
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:45,179
part of that though is to determine if

650
00:23:43,680 --> 00:23:47,190
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> fair use your most</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> likely still</font>

651
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:50,340
going to have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to court your isp is</font>

653
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,699
not but most likely not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to stand</font>

00:23:51,540 --> 00:23:54,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">up for you and Annalise</font>

655
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:56,450
stuff fair use is getting hard to

656
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:59,600
determine as well when you talk about

657
00:23:56,450 --> 00:24:02,630
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> for music with sampling and it</font>

658
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:04,429
becomes a legal argument did you take

659
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:06,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">the heart of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the copyrighted material</font>

660
00:24:04,430 --> 00:24:08,570
but in our case we found it was a lot

661
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:10,190
easier you should be able to say a

662
00:24:08,570 --> 00:24:12,350
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> sentences from a book that</font>

663
00:24:10,190 --> 00:24:13,910
someone is published or from one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

664
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:16,010
their public presentations they said

665
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:18,140
this if it's properly attributed that's

666
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:19,700
fair use if you use it and for critique

667
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:22,430
purposes it's even<font color="#CCCCCC"> as stronger</font>

668
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:24,530
protection so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to use fair use</font>

669
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:26,360
as a as a defense against the DMCA which

670
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:28,340
is a shame because it's not what it's

671
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:30,709
the DMCA was supposed to do I believe

672
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:32,959
but in our experience by 112 f is hard

673
00:24:30,710 --> 00:24:35,450
to use and we have some jurisdictional

674
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:36,710
issues with<font color="#CCCCCC"> 5</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 112 f as well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i know which</font>

675
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:38,510
i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> the jurisdictional issues are</font>

676
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:40,430
going to get interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> if there's VA</font>

677
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:42,020
<font color="#CCCCCC">ctas past because then you're talking</font>

678
00:24:40,430 --> 00:24:43,400
about takedown notices being filed from

679
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:45,200
people in other countries where<font color="#CCCCCC"> are you</font>

680
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:47,180
going to wind up resolving those cases

681
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,800
we've had<font color="#E5E5E5"> that problem already we're</font>

682
00:24:47,180 --> 00:24:50,510
getting some stuff from Australia as you

683
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,220
know if perhaps I've been<font color="#CCCCCC"> reading that</font>

684
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:53,810
Australia is becoming the censorship

685
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:55,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">therefore material is becoming really</font>

686
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:57,080
challenging so we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting some</font>

687
00:24:55,010 --> 00:24:58,850
takedown notices from Australia we're

688
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,169
thinking wow that's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be really</font>

00:24:58,850 --> 00:25:01,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">complicated you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know considering</font>

690
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:04,490
international law how and if we're going

691
00:25:01,850 --> 00:25:06,080
to respond to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that another thing to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

692
00:25:04,490 --> 00:25:08,180
I just you know when you guys leave the

693
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,280
talk and you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at news articles</font>

694
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:11,780
online is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when you see a lot of the</font>

695
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:14,210
I'm you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's great that</font>

696
00:25:11,780 --> 00:25:15,950
that there are some wins happening

697
00:25:14,210 --> 00:25:18,650
against the dmca at this point but a lot

698
00:25:15,950 --> 00:25:21,950
of them are related to fair use and just

699
00:25:18,650 --> 00:25:23,600
like lens<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus universal was but fair</font>

700
00:25:21,950 --> 00:25:26,030
use is really something that that you

701
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:29,240
need to fight in court it doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> stop</font>

702
00:25:26,030 --> 00:25:31,700
this sort of pre court you know guilty

703
00:25:29,240 --> 00:25:34,190
until proven innocent attack on people

704
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:37,250
and so it's great<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you want to defend</font>

706
00:25:37,250 --> 00:25:41,330
trust me<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this is to stay out of court</font>

707
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:45,320
period it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> time-consuming</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

708
00:25:41,330 --> 00:25:47,240
expensive it takes forever so so we need

709
00:25:45,320 --> 00:25:51,230
something that that helps<font color="#CCCCCC"> people stay</font>

710
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:52,880
out and not be legally engaged so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:06,990
we hosted them for about two weeks they

00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:08,970
were the two<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that made the sites</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">Carnegie Mellon</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> University and they had</font>

720
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:19,500
commentary on these two nonprofit

721
00:26:15,660 --> 00:26:21,600
organizations and there was you know

722
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:23,640
there's a good satire the articles were

723
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,320
funny but add<font color="#CCCCCC"> the same sort of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> look and</font>

724
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:28,770
feel the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> way you'd see like on the</font>

725
00:26:25,320 --> 00:26:31,020
daily show or colbert report anyway

726
00:26:28,770 --> 00:26:33,330
walmart and the 700 club filed dmca

727
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:35,190
takedown notices for this content of

728
00:26:33,330 --> 00:26:38,490
course you know to maintain our safe

729
00:26:35,190 --> 00:26:39,810
harbor we we said okay well the content

730
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:42,090
has to come down but<font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys can file a</font>

students their art students and they

733
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:48,600
really struggled with the idea of trying

734
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:50,940
to file this because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course it's fair</font>

735
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:53,040
use that they have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> defend and if</font>

738
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:00,960
know the legal buying of those

739
00:26:56,370 --> 00:27:04,050
organizations so so fair uses is tricky

740
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:07,200
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> tricky to use to defend this stuff</font>

741
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:09,840
so the content went offline and never

742
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,210
came back<font color="#CCCCCC"> up and so then the other one</font>

743
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:14,220
of course is project<font color="#CCCCCC"> DoD verse federici</font>

it's interesting and we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about</font>

748
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:23,040
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think people</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would find</font>

he finds all these flaws in and winds up

756
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:44,100
abusing them but just further proof that

757
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:46,919
fair use is hard to use he started and

758

761
00:27:55,110 --> 00:28:00,149

notification that one must consider fair

case again he he figures out that when

he files his takedown notices the

806
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:34,379
content goes down and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then a counter</font>

807
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:36,270

811
00:29:41,130 --> 00:29:44,820
harbor so what he does is he contacts

812
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:47,459
six of his colleagues and he has them

813
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:50,220
file dmca takedown notices for different

814
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:52,650
portions of the of the advocates for

children therapy site and as a result

the the site or parts<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the site</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

00:30:00,210 --> 00:30:03,990
like some civil trials or criminal this

820
00:30:01,890 --> 00:30:05,700
is like dodeca jeopardy when it comes to

821
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:09,990
your content it's the same stuff over

822
00:30:05,700 --> 00:30:11,310
again taken down so it's it's it's not

823
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:13,380
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> not something that you want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

826
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:22,050
disturbing trend that we see which is uh

827
00:30:18,330 --> 00:30:22,590
these backdoor takedowns and essentially

828
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:24,700
there are a couple different

829
00:30:22,590 --> 00:30:26,949
classifications of isp

830
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:29,650
in the digital<font color="#E5E5E5"> mining Copyright Act and</font>

831
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:31,960
one is as a common carrier and common

832
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:35,080
carrier ISPs share no liability with the

833
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:36,220
content<font color="#E5E5E5"> that user hosts anywhere so they</font>

834
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:38,500
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to comply with the takedown</font>

835
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:40,540
provisions they just get there safe

836
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:42,310
harbor the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> type of isp is like</font>

837
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:44,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">project</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> DoD where the content actually</font>

839
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:50,200
control of the content and so I just

840
00:30:48,370 --> 00:30:52,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to be clear that there's those two</font>

00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,580
types<font color="#E5E5E5"> of classifications now the second</font>

00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:56,110
classification of isp is required<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

843
00:30:54,580 --> 00:30:59,620
register a designated agent with the

1008
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:02,820
you know really think about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> like what</font>

1009
00:37:00,750 --> 00:37:04,950
for-profit ISPs are really going to use

1010
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:06,840
512 f to defend their users right this

1011

1013
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:14,640
years plus in court with this person and

1014
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:16,170
we just<font color="#CCCCCC"> thought that you know this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

1015
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:19,500
the right kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of case to stand up for</font>

1016
00:37:16,170 --> 00:37:23,370
and this<font color="#CCCCCC"> particular person federici has</font>

1017
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:27,570
has silenced all dissent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> his medical</font>

1018
00:37:23,370 --> 00:37:29,609
practice out on the internet period you

1019
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:32,490
cannot<font color="#E5E5E5"> find anything that talks about</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the dangers of this stuff with his name</font>

1021
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:37,169
attached at very least and and all of

1022
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:40,109
those users that he is silent have

1023
00:37:37,170 --> 00:37:43,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">silence have slowly migrated tests over</font>

1024
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:45,210
time so anyway you know we get through

1025
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:47,430
the case and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's thrown out in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> maine</font>

1026
00:37:45,210 --> 00:37:50,100
for lack of personal jurisdiction and he

1027
00:37:47,430 --> 00:37:51,450
sends<font color="#E5E5E5"> us a third takedown notice so now</font>

1028
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:53,400
we're on our third takedown notice from

1029
00:37:51,450 --> 00:37:54,930
and the thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> still really time</font>

1030
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:57,540
consuming because we have to go through

1031
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:58,529
every single<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing and say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay is you</font>

1032
00:37:57,540 --> 00:38:01,080
know is this something he's already

1033
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:02,640
noticed us for before right and there's

1034
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:03,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">no provision in the DMCA that says you</font>

1035
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:05,580
can't do this there's maybe an

1036
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:07,350
implication that you can't because of

1037
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:08,460
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10-day</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> denial of service attack but</font>

1038
00:38:07,350 --> 00:38:11,310
there's nothing in there that<font color="#E5E5E5"> says</font>

1039
00:38:08,460 --> 00:38:15,120
explicitly like this is this is you know

1040
00:38:11,310 --> 00:38:18,240
abuse of process or something and the

1041
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:20,549
using the five 112g we think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that it has</font>

1042
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:23,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> used so he can figure out who his</font>

1043
00:38:20,550 --> 00:38:24,930
online anonymous people are who are

1044
00:38:23,430 --> 00:38:26,850
critiquing him so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone has a</font>

1045
00:38:24,930 --> 00:38:28,799
handle and he can't quite<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's been</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the ISP well such as us we're</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not going</font>

1048
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:35,580
to say hey that handles this person's

1049
00:38:32,580 --> 00:38:38,340
name here is her name he's using<font color="#CCCCCC"> this we</font>

1050
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:40,140
think to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find out who she</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is so he could</font>

1051
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:42,780
also sue her for libel or something like

1052
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:44,580
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so we are finding the DMCA is being</font>

1053
00:38:42,780 --> 00:38:46,950
used to really destroy people's

1054
00:38:44,580 --> 00:38:48,900
anonymity online and as<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned a</font>

1055
00:38:46,950 --> 00:38:50,430
lot of the the female attorneys on this

1056
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:52,920
case<font color="#E5E5E5"> and the women who want to be</font>

1057
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:54,839
plaintiffs are really concerned<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

1058
00:38:52,920 --> 00:38:56,070
some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> stuff that's that's been</font>

1059
00:38:54,840 --> 00:38:58,200
<font color="#CCCCCC">going up online that we've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to</font>

1060
00:38:56,070 --> 00:39:01,470
trace has been coming back related to

1061
00:38:58,200 --> 00:39:02,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">this case most likely by attorneys or</font>

1062
00:39:01,470 --> 00:39:04,618
we've actually found

1063
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:08,250
evidence<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it might actually be some</font>

1064
00:39:04,619 --> 00:39:11,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">Russian group that um you tell them</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1065
00:39:08,250 --> 00:39:12,059
want this name<font color="#CCCCCC"> libeled and they'll libel</font>

1066
00:39:11,010 --> 00:39:14,760
it like they'll set up a fake facebook

1067
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:17,700
page like for me<font color="#CCCCCC"> for instance and it's</font>

1068
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:19,440
loaded<font color="#CCCCCC"> with Russian malware so it's that</font>

1069
00:39:17,700 --> 00:39:20,819
type of stuff you know they're not a lot

1070
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:22,049
<font color="#CCCCCC">of attorneys or plaintiffs who want to</font>

1071
00:39:20,819 --> 00:39:23,970
stand up to<font color="#CCCCCC"> that so it takes it takes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1072
00:39:22,049 --> 00:39:25,680
lot of gusto but this isn't fair where

1073
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:28,828
we're having<font color="#E5E5E5"> to if we want to counter</font>

1074
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:29,970
notice for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> this user we have to use</font>

1075
00:39:28,829 --> 00:39:31,710
you know put her identity and a

1076
00:39:29,970 --> 00:39:34,500
counter-notice I don't we're not having

1077
00:39:31,710 --> 00:39:36,180
a good time with that yeah and so this

1078
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,740
isn't required by the takedown notice

1079
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:39,690
right so there's agent wording that

1080
00:39:37,740 --> 00:39:41,098
makes the person<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's claiming their</font>

1081
00:39:39,690 --> 00:39:42,630
copyright has been in French allows them

1082
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:45,180
to hide<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind a firm or something else</font>

1083
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:48,059
there's also specifically a section 512

1084
00:39:45,180 --> 00:39:50,669
<font color="#CCCCCC">H which requires a court order in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> order</font>

1085
00:39:48,059 --> 00:39:52,950
to get the identity<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the person</font>

1086
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:54,059
however the counter notice doesn't

1087
00:39:52,950 --> 00:39:55,740
require that the counter notice

1088
00:39:54,059 --> 00:39:58,380
explicitly wants the personally

1089
00:39:55,740 --> 00:40:00,598
identifying information and so what we

1090
00:39:58,380 --> 00:40:02,369
saw and this is in a separate case like

1091
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:03,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">I said member there's a bunch of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

1092
00:40:02,369 --> 00:40:05,640
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> came to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> us this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is a totally</font>

1093
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:08,789
different domain it's a support group

1094
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:13,650
for survivors of this type of therapy

1095
00:40:08,789 --> 00:40:15,029
they so i can say she so it turns out

1096
00:40:13,650 --> 00:40:18,240
the gender of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> individual is known</font>

1097
00:40:15,029 --> 00:40:21,690
and she<font color="#E5E5E5"> runs the site stop child</font>

1098
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:24,419
tortured org and she puts up this NBC

1099
00:40:21,690 --> 00:40:26,700
video well she actually had it up on on

1100
00:40:24,420 --> 00:40:28,230
YouTube and<font color="#E5E5E5"> YouTube dmca tit and she</font>

1101
00:40:26,700 --> 00:40:29,759
didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to lose her identity so she</font>

1102
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:33,809
wasn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to counter notice so she put</font>

1103
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:36,359
it on us and and the embassy video

1104
00:40:33,809 --> 00:40:37,799
basically just talks about it's like one

1105
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:40,558
of these<font color="#CCCCCC"> hard-line videos talks about</font>

1106
00:40:37,799 --> 00:40:44,520
attachment therapy and and you know it's

1107
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:47,220
sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of like a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 2020 piece right and so</font>

1108
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:51,329
she<font color="#CCCCCC"> puts it up it's NBC's copyright it's</font>

1109
00:40:47,220 --> 00:40:53,700
not his copyright at all and he files

1110
00:40:51,329 --> 00:40:56,760
takedown notice now what she's doing

1111
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:59,399
here<font color="#CCCCCC"> is trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to compare the holding</font>

1112
00:40:56,760 --> 00:41:01,049
techniques illustrated in the video with

1113
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,910
this recent case that says these things

1114
00:41:01,049 --> 00:41:04,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">called face down takedowns they're like</font>

1115
00:41:02,910 --> 00:41:06,569
security guards and schools use them for

1116
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:08,069
kids are potentially lethal and so

1117
00:41:06,569 --> 00:41:10,630
security guards in school are no longer

1118
00:41:08,069 --> 00:41:12,730
to able to do the face down take down

1119
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:14,529
on like high schools kids right so she's

1120
00:41:12,730 --> 00:41:16,029
saying like look well this is the exact

1121
00:41:14,529 --> 00:41:17,950
same type of holding technique like

1122
00:41:16,029 --> 00:41:23,079
isn't this also<font color="#E5E5E5"> potentially lethal and</font>

1123
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:27,700
so of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course he he files a dmca takedown</font>

1124
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:29,980
notice for it and and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> we we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have to</font>

1125
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:31,899
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> the content down but this time</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when</font>

1126
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:33,849
he filed it he sort of specifically says

1127
00:41:31,900 --> 00:41:35,259
like and if this<font color="#E5E5E5"> person's going to file</font>

1128
00:41:33,849 --> 00:41:37,089
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> counter notice which he knows they're</font>

1129
00:41:35,259 --> 00:41:38,019
probably going to they better include

1130
00:41:37,089 --> 00:41:40,450
their personally identifying information

1131
00:41:38,019 --> 00:41:42,279
and that's when we found out oh wow look

1132
00:41:40,450 --> 00:41:43,720
at that the statute actually requires

1133
00:41:42,279 --> 00:41:46,539
personal identifying information for the

1134
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:48,430
counter notice and so<font color="#CCCCCC"> ultimately the</font>

1135
00:41:46,539 --> 00:41:49,990
content<font color="#CCCCCC"> states now because that our user</font>

1136
00:41:48,430 --> 00:41:53,828
wasn't willing to release your identity

1137
00:41:49,990 --> 00:41:55,479
but what she did is she wound up having

1138
00:41:53,829 --> 00:41:57,400
the content hosted on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> service called</font>

1139
00:41:55,480 --> 00:42:00,190
videoweed which is outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

1140
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:01,630
jurisdiction of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> United</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> States</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1141
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:03,880
therefore<font color="#CCCCCC"> does not need to comply with</font>

1142
00:42:01,630 --> 00:42:05,559
these sort of dmca takedown notices<font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

1143
00:42:03,880 --> 00:42:08,950
she has a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> ads that pop up when</font>

1144
00:42:05,559 --> 00:42:11,829
you go to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> page now so the liability</font>

1145
00:42:08,950 --> 00:42:13,118
is a failure<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the DMCA the it's it</font>

1146
00:42:11,829 --> 00:42:14,470
seems like what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> happening is if you</font>

1147
00:42:13,119 --> 00:42:15,849
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> a very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> passionate argument about</font>

1148
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:18,578
<font color="#E5E5E5">something and you want to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about it</font>

1149
00:42:15,849 --> 00:42:20,470
online and someone doesn't want you to

1150
00:42:18,579 --> 00:42:22,960
you use the takedown notices and it will

1151
00:42:20,470 --> 00:42:25,089
most likely come down as if you are

1152
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:28,150
using copyrighted material<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make your</font>

1153
00:42:25,089 --> 00:42:30,369
point and when<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ISPs are motivated by</font>

1154
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:33,190
profit and they're not non non profits

1155
00:42:30,369 --> 00:42:34,900
like project<font color="#E5E5E5"> DoD it's it's difficult</font>

1156
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:36,339
they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not gonna they're most likely</font>

1157
00:42:34,900 --> 00:42:38,319
night this takes too much time they're

1158
00:42:36,339 --> 00:42:40,599
not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> stand up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for you and also</font>

1159
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:42,190
we have some users that have had they've

1160
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:44,349
lost their Twitter accounts their

1161
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:46,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">Facebook accounts of those have been</font>

1162
00:42:44,349 --> 00:42:48,670
dmca tazewell those are down but at

1163
00:42:46,509 --> 00:42:51,369
least some of the content for the

1164
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:53,109
websites or blogs whatever it resides on

1165
00:42:51,369 --> 00:42:55,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">project DoD we've been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to preserve</font>

1166
00:42:53,109 --> 00:42:56,650
that while Twitter and Facebook it's

1167
00:42:55,180 --> 00:43:00,308
come right down for the same type of

1168
00:42:56,650 --> 00:43:02,440
content<font color="#CCCCCC"> so if this continues with this</font>

1169
00:43:00,309 --> 00:43:03,640
trend with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> takedown notices we think</font>

1170
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:05,559
it's it's not heading in a good

1171
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:08,230
direction yeah and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think this is just</font>

1172
00:43:05,559 --> 00:43:10,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is an important one to me just</font>

1173
00:43:08,230 --> 00:43:11,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">because you know it seems obvious to me</font>

1174
00:43:10,180 --> 00:43:13,569
that if you have a dispute<font color="#E5E5E5"> with somebody</font>

1175
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:14,950
over content<font color="#E5E5E5"> that the two most</font>

1176
00:43:13,569 --> 00:43:16,630
interested parties should really be the

1177
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:19,569
ones that that should handle that

1178
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:21,730
dispute and the second<font color="#E5E5E5"> you try and tie</font>

1179
00:43:19,569 --> 00:43:22,830
the liability of a third party that only

1180
00:43:21,730 --> 00:43:25,290
cares about

1181
00:43:22,830 --> 00:43:27,299
liability to the content you really

1182
00:43:25,290 --> 00:43:28,620
don't have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a sort of a world that's</font>

1183
00:43:27,300 --> 00:43:31,740
going to facilitate fair and open

1184
00:43:28,620 --> 00:43:33,390
discussion of anything so I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1185
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:35,100
Tiffany would say this is strongly but I

1186
00:43:33,390 --> 00:43:36,839
think fundamentally that the takedown

1187
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:39,420
provisions of the DMCA the sort of

1188
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:42,600
guilty until proven innocent approach

1189
00:43:39,420 --> 00:43:44,190
with market pressure and I don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think</font>

1190
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:45,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">this is a mistake necessarily i think</font>

1191
00:43:44,190 --> 00:43:48,750
that that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> probably the biggest failing</font>

1192
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:50,610
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> DMCA s altogether thought well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

1193
00:43:48,750 --> 00:43:53,430
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> shouldn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> say the DM saying I think</font>

1194
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:54,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">that that is a failing that's larger</font>

1195
00:43:53,430 --> 00:43:57,569
than any of the ones that we talked

1196
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:59,700
about before which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is simply</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that really</font>

1197
00:43:57,570 --> 00:44:01,110
the ISPs should not be sharing liability

1198
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:03,000
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> content just like everything</font>

1199
00:44:01,110 --> 00:44:06,570
else out there they should require a

1200
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:07,950
court order<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take it down and so I'm</font>

1201
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:10,620
not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get into too many examples</font>

1202
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:11,850
of this but I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just wanted to say</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1203
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:13,799
you know we've we've entered this de

1204
00:44:11,850 --> 00:44:16,560
facto state of censorship out on the

1205
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:21,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">internet and we've seen all of these</font>

1206
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:23,520
providers and many more<font color="#E5E5E5"> takedown people</font>

1207
00:44:21,090 --> 00:44:25,320
or users on their service not allow them

1208
00:44:23,520 --> 00:44:29,009
file a<font color="#CCCCCC"> counter notice and they've wound</font>

1209
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:30,990
up on us specifically so and this is

1210
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:34,110
WordPress godaddy network solutions a

1211
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:38,939
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other smaller providers that it</font>

1212
00:44:34,110 --> 00:44:42,570
had this happen so Ken technology fix

1213
00:44:38,940 --> 00:44:45,000
the censorship problems well there might

1214
00:44:42,570 --> 00:44:47,340
be a couple of technical solutions we're

1215
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:49,620
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to give a quick overview of torque</font>

1216
00:44:47,340 --> 00:44:51,180
and service and I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to say thank you</font>

1217
00:44:49,620 --> 00:44:53,700
to the tour folks for letting me use

1218
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:56,370
their slides or at least the images to

1219
00:44:53,700 --> 00:45:00,419
illustrate how hidden service protocol

1220
00:44:56,370 --> 00:45:01,890
works now it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to assume that</font>

1221
00:45:00,420 --> 00:45:03,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">most of you in the audience know how</font>

1222
00:45:01,890 --> 00:45:07,379
tour works in general how circuits are

1223
00:45:03,750 --> 00:45:08,940
established this is sort of like + +<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1224
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:10,830
that it's like a one step up like how

1225
00:45:08,940 --> 00:45:14,400
you can use it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to provide a service</font>

1226
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:16,770
from poor and I'm also going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font>

1227
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:18,120
about jurisdiction<font color="#CCCCCC"> topping solutions and</font>

1228
00:45:16,770 --> 00:45:19,710
then we'll talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little bit about</font>

1229
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:23,730
direct action I think you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys will have</font>

1230
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:24,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">fun with that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one so for our intensive</font>

1231
00:45:23,730 --> 00:45:30,150
purposes we're going to consider Alice

1232
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:31,680
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> the user</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and Bob to be the ISP bob</font>

1233
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:33,960
is going to create<font color="#E5E5E5"> a circuit into the</font>

1234
00:45:31,680 --> 00:45:35,919
Tor network and he's going to choose

1235
00:45:33,960 --> 00:45:37,750
three introduction points

1236
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:40,780
and then he's going to list those

1237
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:44,710
introduction points with his public key

1238
00:45:40,780 --> 00:45:46,060
into a directory server alice is then

1239
00:45:44,710 --> 00:45:49,030
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at this directory server</font>

1240
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:51,610
and for an identifier which is usually

1241
00:45:49,030 --> 00:45:54,070
something like<font color="#CCCCCC"> foo bar dot well it's not</font>

1242
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:56,590
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not an easy name it's some obscure</font>

1243
00:45:54,070 --> 00:45:58,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">identifier onion and so if you know</font>

1244
00:45:56,590 --> 00:46:01,870
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this obscure identifier onion a</font>

1245
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:03,460
priori you can go to the directory

1246
00:46:01,870 --> 00:46:06,790
server look it up get the public key<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

1247
00:46:03,460 --> 00:46:08,200
the introduction points alice is also

1248
00:46:06,790 --> 00:46:11,440
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to then pick a rendezvous point</font>

1249
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:13,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">and so she's going to create a packet</font>

1250
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:17,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's basically encrypted with the</font>

1251
00:46:13,270 --> 00:46:22,390
public key it has this this one time

1252
00:46:17,380 --> 00:46:24,610
token and she puts the the rendezvous

1253
00:46:22,390 --> 00:46:26,410
point and sends this through one of the

1254
00:46:24,610 --> 00:46:29,890
introduction<font color="#E5E5E5"> points that Bob's chosen</font>

1255
00:46:26,410 --> 00:46:35,319
which then forwards it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to Bob so Bob</font>

1256
00:46:29,890 --> 00:46:37,629
the ISP now gets that and in meets alice

1257
00:46:35,320 --> 00:46:40,690
over at the rendezvous point using the

1258
00:46:37,630 --> 00:46:42,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">one-time secret in order to you know</font>

1259
00:46:40,690 --> 00:46:44,950
Athena<font color="#E5E5E5"> Kate's Alice yes you know you</font>

1260
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:46,690
contacted<font color="#CCCCCC"> me and this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me and then</font>

1261
00:46:44,950 --> 00:46:48,129
they establish a secure encrypted

1262
00:46:46,690 --> 00:46:49,450
connection and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the important</font>

1263
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:50,560
point here is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> my arrows aren't</font>

1264
00:46:49,450 --> 00:46:53,169
really is<font color="#E5E5E5"> routing it but there's a</font>

1265
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:56,080
circuit on either side here at or

1266
00:46:53,170 --> 00:46:57,520
circuit that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to protect small</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1267
00:46:56,080 --> 00:47:00,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">guess and currently hit that with a</font>

1268
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:04,180
blinding<font color="#CCCCCC"> Tiffany so that's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1269
00:47:00,580 --> 00:47:09,069
protect the identity of both the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ISP and</font>

1270
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:11,140
the user in this case so this seems like

1271
00:47:09,070 --> 00:47:13,660
a completely workable solution for

1272
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:15,490
providing the censorship resistant

1273
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:17,560
hosting but there there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are actually</font>

1274
00:47:15,490 --> 00:47:19,479
some drawbacks to using tor I don't know

1275
00:47:17,560 --> 00:47:21,730
if any of you have used it on pure I'm

1276
00:47:19,480 --> 00:47:23,050
sure you guys have actually but if you

1277
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:24,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">use it you you make a little bit of a</font>

1278
00:47:23,050 --> 00:47:26,530
speed trade-off right so there's sort of

1279
00:47:24,670 --> 00:47:28,030
an efficiency trade-off for Chinese tour

1280
00:47:26,530 --> 00:47:31,120
in order to maintain your<font color="#CCCCCC"> anonymity or</font>

1281
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:32,950
privacy and it kind of gets a little bit

1282
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:34,720
worse because about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the buffers work if</font>

1283
00:47:32,950 --> 00:47:36,490
there's a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> file-sharing traffic or</font>

1284
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:38,169
large amounts of data<font color="#E5E5E5"> going through the</font>

1285
00:47:36,490 --> 00:47:40,930
Tor network when you're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use it</font>

1286
00:47:38,170 --> 00:47:42,400
and so what I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is kind of talk</font>

1287
00:47:40,930 --> 00:47:43,870
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> a spectrum of users right so you</font>

1288
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:46,480
have these users that are used to

1289
00:47:43,870 --> 00:47:49,779
commodity hosting and you have users

1290
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:52,120
that that if they publish their

1291
00:47:49,780 --> 00:47:53,710
their identities are released they're

1292
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:56,770
dead right<font color="#E5E5E5"> their governments will kill</font>

1293
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:58,450
them and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think in the former case the</font>

1294
00:47:56,770 --> 00:48:00,790
the you know come<font color="#E5E5E5"> out of you hosting</font>

1295
00:47:58,450 --> 00:48:02,710
providers do a good job at<font color="#E5E5E5"> offering</font>

1296
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:04,150
those services and in the latter case I

1297
00:48:02,710 --> 00:48:05,530
think tour does a really good job it

1298
00:48:04,150 --> 00:48:08,110
makes a good trade-off between try to

1299
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:11,260
publish content and also you know

1300
00:48:08,110 --> 00:48:13,030
protect the the person's identity but

1301
00:48:11,260 --> 00:48:14,200
we're in the spectrum of users we have

1302
00:48:13,030 --> 00:48:15,520
these users that we've<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> talking</font>

1303
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:18,220
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> right the ones in the abuse case</font>

1304
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:21,190
examples that that fall in between and

1305
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:23,080
and those people need<font color="#CCCCCC"> something that's</font>

1306
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:24,250
maybe still a little bit fast that looks

1307
00:48:23,080 --> 00:48:25,480
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit like traditional hosting</font>

1308
00:48:24,250 --> 00:48:29,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">but doesn't suffer all of the censorship</font>

1309
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:33,370
implications and there's a there's

1310
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:35,020
another problem with that onion

1311
00:48:33,370 --> 00:48:37,240
identifier right and that is that it's

1312
00:48:35,020 --> 00:48:39,940
it's a little bit obscure but this maybe

1313
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:42,069
not<font color="#CCCCCC"> necessarily a design flaw but</font>

1314
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:43,690
certain mathematical truth right so

1315
00:48:42,070 --> 00:48:45,580
there's this this<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing called Zukas</font>

1316
00:48:43,690 --> 00:48:47,440
conjecture which says that one of these

1317
00:48:45,580 --> 00:48:48,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">names cannot be human meaningful secure</font>

1318
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:50,650
and decentralized all at the same time

1319
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:54,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">they can only have two of these three</font>

1320
00:48:50,650 --> 00:48:56,920
elements and so there's a more friendly

1321
00:48:54,070 --> 00:48:58,780
interface to this which would make it<font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font>

1322
00:48:56,920 --> 00:49:01,690
Alice didn't have to look up the

1323
00:48:58,780 --> 00:49:05,980
identifier from the directory server

1324
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:13,240
Alice could could use a normal you know

1325
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:15,760
say foo bar dot<font color="#CCCCCC"> torta web.com and you</font>

1326
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:17,259
can through URL redirects and whatnot

1327
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,610
you can get a sort of meaningful name

1328
00:49:17,260 --> 00:49:20,740
but the second you do that of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

1329
00:49:18,610 --> 00:49:24,910
you've lost your decentralized<font color="#E5E5E5"> naming</font>

1330
00:49:20,740 --> 00:49:26,859
for something meaningful another way<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1331
00:49:24,910 --> 00:49:29,109
do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> if Chris talked about the</font>

1332
00:49:26,860 --> 00:49:30,970
technology is how about through law can

1333
00:49:29,110 --> 00:49:32,350
we do jurisdiction hopping how easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1334
00:49:30,970 --> 00:49:34,870
it to do and I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you it's not easy</font>

1335
00:49:32,350 --> 00:49:36,069
but one of the examples that I found

1336
00:49:34,870 --> 00:49:37,330
most interesting and I did a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of</font>

1337
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:38,920
research in law school about this and

1338
00:49:37,330 --> 00:49:41,770
wrote a thesis about it was Haven<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cohen</font>

1339
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:44,140
seal and I remember when Ryan Lackey I

1340
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:46,000
believe he was the CTO or CEO of Haven

1341
00:49:44,140 --> 00:49:48,910
co which is the company in cland is what

1342
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:50,170
they solve our nation or so they state

1343
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:52,450
that they are but they've given

1344
00:49:50,170 --> 00:49:55,210
presentations at<font color="#CCCCCC"> hope</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and at Def Con and</font>

1345
00:49:52,450 --> 00:49:57,129
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about here black habit what</font>

1346
00:49:55,210 --> 00:50:00,190
this was was an offshore gun platform

1347
00:49:57,130 --> 00:50:04,329
that was used during<font color="#CCCCCC"> World War Two</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1348
00:50:00,190 --> 00:50:06,160
is off the coast from the UK and a group

1349
00:50:04,329 --> 00:50:08,020
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people that were in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pirate radio at</font>

1350
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:10,450
the time it took this platform they

1351
00:50:08,020 --> 00:50:12,430
claimed by adverse possession although

1352
00:50:10,450 --> 00:50:13,509
it being that it was owned by the

1353
00:50:12,430 --> 00:50:15,069
government you can't really own

1354
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:16,420
government property by adverse

1355
00:50:15,069 --> 00:50:18,579
possession but the<font color="#E5E5E5"> UK at that point</font>

1356
00:50:16,420 --> 00:50:20,260
didn't really care the pirate radio

1357
00:50:18,579 --> 00:50:22,510
station<font color="#CCCCCC"> that actually was a big deal i</font>

1358
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:23,829
think they made a movie about they in

1359
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:25,660
the movie it was said in a boat but I

1360
00:50:23,829 --> 00:50:27,579
read it was really this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the</font>

1361
00:50:25,660 --> 00:50:30,129
inspiration<font color="#CCCCCC"> was with seal and so there's</font>

1362
00:50:27,579 --> 00:50:31,390
a king and a queen and a prince and they

1363
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:34,270
have their<font color="#E5E5E5"> own passports their own</font>

1364
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:36,578
currency stamps those this go for quite

1365
00:50:34,270 --> 00:50:38,890
quite a bit but it's quite interesting

1366
00:50:36,579 --> 00:50:41,260
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they claim that they are a</font>

1367
00:50:38,890 --> 00:50:43,750
sovereign nation and under international

law and<font color="#E5E5E5"> in law</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the sea actually</font>

1369
00:50:43,750 --> 00:50:47,800
applies to this as<font color="#CCCCCC"> well is how far off</font>

1370
00:50:45,849 --> 00:50:51,520
are they off the coast<font color="#E5E5E5"> from the UK and</font>

1371
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:53,710
at the time the UK their international

1372
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:55,089
waters were not it didn't cover the

1373
00:50:53,710 --> 00:50:56,890
platform but since then they've kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1374
00:50:55,089 --> 00:50:59,230
bumped it out if you look on a map it

1375
00:50:56,890 --> 00:51:02,890
kind of goes out around where sea land

1376
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:04,329
is and<font color="#CCCCCC"> seal and in i believe it was in</font>

1377
00:51:02,890 --> 00:51:06,160
like two thousand during like the

1378
00:51:04,329 --> 00:51:09,849
dot-com boom they decided what<font color="#CCCCCC"> they were</font>

1379
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:11,680
going to do was do internet<font color="#CCCCCC"> deck hosting</font>

1380
00:51:09,849 --> 00:51:15,130
a hosting company there and that was

called<font color="#E5E5E5"> haven co so ryan and avi went out</font>

there and set up this company<font color="#E5E5E5"> and they</font>

1383
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:21,099
had a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> servers out there they</font>

00:51:18,130 --> 00:51:25,240
claim that they would not reply or

respond to any<font color="#CCCCCC"> US subpoenas or warrants</font>

that were<font color="#CCCCCC"> issued now what's their</font>

1387
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:32,410
connection to the internet though was a

1388
00:51:30,069 --> 00:51:34,329
cable under the ocean they were saving

1389
00:51:32,410 --> 00:51:35,680
up to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get a satellite uplink</font>

1390
00:51:34,329 --> 00:51:37,180
but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I don't think that happened</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so one</font>

of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest vulnerabilities for them</font>

all their their clients it was a cable

they didn't have a I don't believe at

1397
00:51:47,230 --> 00:51:51,339
the time I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think they had a</font>

1398
00:51:48,550 --> 00:51:55,930
redundancy another<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem they had is</font>

00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:07,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the UK so they got their health care</font>

1405
00:52:06,130 --> 00:52:08,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the UK and that was something that</font>

1406
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:10,730
was a little bit weak for their

1407
00:52:08,530 --> 00:52:12,560
sovereign nation argument but

1408
00:52:10,730 --> 00:52:14,330
we one of the things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> remember</font>

1409
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:15,890
when I talked<font color="#E5E5E5"> to Ryan about this at hope</font>

1410
00:52:14,330 --> 00:52:17,240
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> this has got to be like three</font>

1411
00:52:15,890 --> 00:52:19,430
hopes ago when they did a presentation

1412
00:52:17,240 --> 00:52:22,490
is what would you do if you received a

1413
00:52:19,430 --> 00:52:25,220
subpoena and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it a wired article came out</font>

1414
00:52:22,490 --> 00:52:27,560
i believe it was in two thousand that

1415
00:52:25,220 --> 00:52:30,080
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> its claimed they had lots of guns on</font>

1416
00:52:27,560 --> 00:52:31,250
the platform<font color="#CCCCCC"> i also said that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the rooms</font>

1417
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:33,259
in which they had their servers were

1418
00:52:31,250 --> 00:52:34,609
full of argon so if you really<font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1419
00:52:33,260 --> 00:52:37,670
go<font color="#E5E5E5"> and take a box you had to put on a</font>

1420
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:39,859
mask and all that well I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't think I'm</font>

1421
00:52:37,670 --> 00:52:41,810
Ryan said the argon thing may not may

1422
00:52:39,859 --> 00:52:43,340
not have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> true but it was kind of</font>

1423
00:52:41,810 --> 00:52:47,029
just a ward off some threats and the

1424
00:52:43,340 --> 00:52:48,380
guns I think those were true it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1425
00:52:47,030 --> 00:52:50,119
difficult to get there you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to take</font>

1426
00:52:48,380 --> 00:52:53,000
a helicopter or like a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really scary boat</font>

1427
00:52:50,119 --> 00:52:55,850
ride out there but were they subpoena

1428
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:58,369
proof well I believe<font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a year ago</font>

1429
00:52:55,850 --> 00:53:01,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">year or two ago the king and queen of</font>

1430
00:52:58,369 --> 00:53:04,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">steel and wanted to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> get the UK to</font>

1431
00:53:01,490 --> 00:53:06,140
declare them a sovereign nation and they

1432
00:53:04,160 --> 00:53:07,819
had they had a petition going I believe

1433
00:53:06,140 --> 00:53:09,950
with signatures and all that they were

1434
00:53:07,820 --> 00:53:15,170
not successful and then they had a huge

1435
00:53:09,950 --> 00:53:18,529
fire and<font color="#E5E5E5"> seal and was burning and who</font>

1436
00:53:15,170 --> 00:53:22,280
came<font color="#CCCCCC"> to save them it was the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> UK Navy so</font>

1437
00:53:18,530 --> 00:53:24,020
they put out the fire and it relying on

1438
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:27,050
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> type of infrastructure with the UK</font>

1439
00:53:24,020 --> 00:53:30,109
weekend there's their jurisdiction type

1440
00:53:27,050 --> 00:53:32,570
of argument a little bit but what was

1441
00:53:30,109 --> 00:53:35,119
difficult was I i think it's it's I

1442
00:53:32,570 --> 00:53:37,580
cannot I haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> found an example at</font>

1443
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:40,280
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seal and or its servers and</font>

1444
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:41,690
places where the<font color="#CCCCCC"> u.s. is going to have</font>

1445
00:53:40,280 --> 00:53:43,100
trouble if<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have subpoenas or</font>

1446
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:45,410
warrants they want to serve on people I

1447
00:53:43,100 --> 00:53:47,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">would never say I read that it's</font>

1448
00:53:45,410 --> 00:53:51,170
subpoena proof subpoena resistant just

1449
00:53:47,930 --> 00:53:54,230
like we are censorship resistant proof

1450
00:53:51,170 --> 00:53:57,170
is difficult to say so is seal and a

1451
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:58,730
sovereign nation or not they the

1452
00:53:57,170 --> 00:54:01,220
arguments that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've seen the academic</font>

1453
00:53:58,730 --> 00:54:03,350
arguments even go as far as it's a

1454
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:05,390
platform and it's on a pile on that goes

1455
00:54:03,350 --> 00:54:07,970
into the sea and it sits on the shelf

1456
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:10,368
this is law of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this law of the sea that</font>

1457
00:54:07,970 --> 00:54:12,350
is a part of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> shell for the UK</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> now</font>

1458
00:54:10,369 --> 00:54:14,570
whether<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's connected like actually in</font>

1459
00:54:12,350 --> 00:54:17,299
the shelf or as they looked at some

1460
00:54:14,570 --> 00:54:18,830
drawings of how seal and was built but

1461
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:20,390
it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> like a boat they sank this was</font>

1462
00:54:18,830 --> 00:54:22,220
back in like what during World War two

1463
00:54:20,390 --> 00:54:24,920
ERA they sank about

1464
00:54:22,220 --> 00:54:27,589
stuff filled it so are they<font color="#E5E5E5"> their own</font>

1465
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:30,109
nation it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's hard to say but I've</font>

1466
00:54:27,590 --> 00:54:31,580
read there<font color="#E5E5E5"> was also i've mentioned</font>

1467
00:54:30,109 --> 00:54:34,250
there's a great article in wired about

1468
00:54:31,580 --> 00:54:37,190
floating islands that are in

1469
00:54:34,250 --> 00:54:40,010
international waters so jurisdiction

1470
00:54:37,190 --> 00:54:42,619
hopping in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> future maybe some way</font>

1471
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:45,800
that you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have</font>

1472
00:54:42,619 --> 00:54:46,970
censorship resistant locations but short

1473
00:54:45,800 --> 00:54:49,250
of having your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own army i suppose and</font>

1474
00:54:46,970 --> 00:54:50,750
your in-laws<font color="#CCCCCC"> it it's it's challenging it</font>

1475
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:52,640
would be challenging but right now<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

1476
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:56,030
think it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to say that anything is</font>

1477
00:54:52,640 --> 00:54:57,440
subpoena proof or jurisdiction that it's

1478
00:54:56,030 --> 00:54:59,510
its own jurisdiction that can't be

1479
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:00,590
served or found by us or whatever your

1480
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:03,859
government is that from which you

1481
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:06,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">originate but when i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> talk about this I</font>

1482
00:55:03,859 --> 00:55:07,970
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do jurisdiction</font>

1483
00:55:06,560 --> 00:55:10,490
hopping I do know there are servers

1484
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:13,399
services out there in fact we have a box

1485
00:55:10,490 --> 00:55:16,399
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Sweden right now where we're putting</font>

1486
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:17,540
some stuff such as some content about

1487
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,700
the case that we're telling you<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

1488
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:21,859
now and we're not doing it to obstruct

1489
00:55:19,700 --> 00:55:25,160
justice with<font color="#E5E5E5"> proper warrants and</font>

1490
00:55:21,859 --> 00:55:27,890
subpoenas it's it's reachable but it's

1491
00:55:25,160 --> 00:55:30,140
more difficult so<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you have a well</font>

1492
00:55:27,890 --> 00:55:31,940
it's it's possible like I said it's it's

1493
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:33,529
resistant but not proof of these

1494
00:55:31,940 --> 00:55:35,690
subpoenas and warrants being served for

1495
00:55:33,530 --> 00:55:38,119
us to turn over or<font color="#E5E5E5"> shut down content on</font>

1496
00:55:35,690 --> 00:55:40,070
a box in Sweden Iceland is also becoming

1497
00:55:38,119 --> 00:55:45,410
a country that is<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're claiming to be</font>

1498
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:47,300
a haven for data so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to talk a</font>

1499
00:55:45,410 --> 00:55:50,149
little bit about what we're working on

1500
00:55:47,300 --> 00:55:51,589
with regards to jurisdiction hopping so

1501
00:55:50,150 --> 00:55:53,119
we're pulling together a bunch of tools

1502
00:55:51,589 --> 00:55:55,430
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> are trying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to build this censorship</font>

1503
00:55:53,119 --> 00:55:57,560
resistant infrastructure and we have

1504
00:55:55,430 --> 00:55:59,419
development<font color="#E5E5E5"> nodes in San Jose we have</font>

1505
00:55:57,560 --> 00:56:01,430
them in Oakland and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we have one Sweden</font>

1506
00:55:59,420 --> 00:56:04,010
right now everything is under our

1507
00:56:01,430 --> 00:56:06,470
control but at some point in the future

1508
00:56:04,010 --> 00:56:10,670
I'll talk about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the principles of this</font>

1509
00:56:06,470 --> 00:56:13,910
that that that<font color="#CCCCCC"> needs to not be the case</font>

1510
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:15,710
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> of course our hopes are we can gain</font>

1511
00:56:13,910 --> 00:56:19,759
censorship resistant

1512
00:56:15,710 --> 00:56:23,599
hosting maybe subpoena resistance

1513
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:25,130
through this and and that really<font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

1514
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:27,230
we're talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about is something</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1515
00:56:25,130 --> 00:56:28,790
feeds that middle spectrum of users

1516
00:56:27,230 --> 00:56:34,130
right that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is the sort of stopgap</font>

1517
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:35,720
solution to to getting on something like

1518
00:56:34,130 --> 00:56:38,450
tour where everybody can use it and it's

1519
00:56:35,720 --> 00:56:41,299
functional so we call these things

1520
00:56:38,450 --> 00:56:44,480
server cells because they're named after

1521
00:56:41,300 --> 00:56:47,359
like aurilla<font color="#CCCCCC"> resistant cells such that</font>

1522
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:49,400
they have the principle that<font color="#E5E5E5"> no one cell</font>

1523
00:56:47,359 --> 00:56:52,460
is a strategic asset<font color="#CCCCCC"> that can be taken</font>

1524
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:55,580
down so you can lose<font color="#CCCCCC"> 12 n cells and</font>

1525
00:56:52,460 --> 00:56:57,170
content won't suffer interruption and so

1526
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:59,299
you can kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> see oh wait you guys</font>

1527
00:56:57,170 --> 00:57:00,920
will enjoy my diagrams this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

1528
00:56:59,300 --> 00:57:02,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">engineering paper with pencil and I</font>

1529
00:57:00,920 --> 00:57:04,070
scanned it and then through like some

1530
00:57:02,599 --> 00:57:07,339
Vizio stuff on top because I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1531
00:57:04,070 --> 00:57:10,460
bad with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Visio all right so so here's</font>

1532
00:57:07,339 --> 00:57:13,880
the internet we have V Seldin and

1533
00:57:10,460 --> 00:57:14,900
Oakland San Jose<font color="#CCCCCC"> and Sweden and they're</font>

1534
00:57:13,880 --> 00:57:20,300
connected through a virtual private

1535
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:22,369
network to data sharing so<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1536
00:57:20,300 --> 00:57:24,530
couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> principles one is distribution of</font>

1537
00:57:22,369 --> 00:57:27,349
responsibility isolation<font color="#E5E5E5"> control so an</font>

1538
00:57:24,530 --> 00:57:30,200
admin should have control only<font color="#E5E5E5"> over only</font>

1539
00:57:27,349 --> 00:57:32,450
their cell resources and the users

1540
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:34,700
should have control over the resources

1541
00:57:32,450 --> 00:57:37,910
they provide on that service as well so

1542
00:57:34,700 --> 00:57:41,180
if i'm the admin and there's a service

1543
00:57:37,910 --> 00:57:44,359
<font color="#E5E5E5">call it an HTTP service for fubar DOD</font>

1544
00:57:41,180 --> 00:57:46,098
net and it gets a takedown notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can</font>

1545
00:57:44,359 --> 00:57:48,348
<font color="#CCCCCC">actually say</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well this can't be</font>

1546
00:57:46,099 --> 00:57:50,089
hosted in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cells that I control under</font>

1547
00:57:48,349 --> 00:57:51,650
my jurisdiction so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can say okay this</font>

1548
00:57:50,089 --> 00:57:53,990
is going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be in san jose or oakland</font>

1549
00:57:51,650 --> 00:57:57,410
but it can still be provided<font color="#CCCCCC"> in sweden</font>

1550
00:57:53,990 --> 00:57:59,540
now this is in the case where we're

1551
00:57:57,410 --> 00:58:01,368
still not in control of the sweden box

1552
00:57:59,540 --> 00:58:02,839
now what the user can say hey you know

1553
00:58:01,369 --> 00:58:05,150
Sweden's way too far<font color="#E5E5E5"> away I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

1554
00:58:02,839 --> 00:58:06,650
offer<font color="#E5E5E5"> my content there and they can not</font>

1555
00:58:05,150 --> 00:58:09,349
offer that content in Sweden this is

1556
00:58:06,650 --> 00:58:11,690
sort of the case for an<font color="#E5E5E5"> Australian user</font>

1557
00:58:09,349 --> 00:58:12,980
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have that they don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to</font>

1558
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:16,070
offer the content in their country

1559
00:58:12,980 --> 00:58:18,109
because well<font color="#E5E5E5"> not you guys should pay</font>

1560
00:58:16,070 --> 00:58:19,250
attention to Australia there they're

1561
00:58:18,109 --> 00:58:21,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">getting right up there with Iran and</font>

1562
00:58:19,250 --> 00:58:25,790
North Korea as far as their internet

1563
00:58:21,470 --> 00:58:26,770
privacy laws so then the other principle

1564
00:58:25,790 --> 00:58:28,960
is that

1565
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:30,280
we should have redundancy of data<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1566
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,590
is that it needs to be in more than one

1567
00:58:30,280 --> 00:58:34,150
jurisdiction at a time and that our

1568
00:58:32,590 --> 00:58:36,850
resource should have jurisdictional

1569
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:39,610
resilience and part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the redundancy of</font>

1570
00:58:36,850 --> 00:58:43,299
data is the jurisdictional resilience

1571
00:58:39,610 --> 00:58:45,460
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> that it should enjoy jurisdictional</font>

1572
00:58:43,300 --> 00:58:47,230
diversity and there's an important thing

1573
00:58:45,460 --> 00:58:50,200
here is that no individual or

1574
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:54,940
organization should be in control of all

1575
00:58:50,200 --> 00:58:56,649
nodes of the network if they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> then in</font>

1576
00:58:54,940 --> 00:59:00,100
certain<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know something that's</font>

1577
00:58:56,650 --> 00:59:01,360
hosted in Iran or Australia<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an admin</font>

1578
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:04,210
is there and they have access to the

1579
00:59:01,360 --> 00:59:07,180
boxes<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Sweden or somewhere else then</font>

1580
00:59:04,210 --> 00:59:08,980
they can<font color="#E5E5E5"> be coerced into into releasing</font>

1581
00:59:07,180 --> 00:59:11,140
information or taking that content down

1582
00:59:08,980 --> 00:59:12,580
and so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> principle here is that you</font>

1583
00:59:11,140 --> 00:59:13,990
wind up with<font color="#E5E5E5"> different sets of</font>

1584
00:59:12,580 --> 00:59:15,400
individuals<font color="#E5E5E5"> and organizations in</font>

1585
00:59:13,990 --> 00:59:16,779
different countries all in control<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1586
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:18,820
cells that<font color="#E5E5E5"> work off the same</font>

1587
00:59:16,780 --> 00:59:20,710
infrastructure and so that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what we're</font>

1588
00:59:18,820 --> 00:59:22,300
trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to build is something that's open</font>

1589
00:59:20,710 --> 00:59:24,850
source enough that people can set it up

1590
00:59:22,300 --> 00:59:28,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">and then a community of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people that can</font>

1591
00:59:24,850 --> 00:59:29,980
join together to<font color="#CCCCCC"> to offer this and we</font>

1592
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:33,910
could<font color="#E5E5E5"> certainly as developer help so if</font>

1593
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:35,080
any of you are interested and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I think</font>

1594
00:59:33,910 --> 00:59:37,000
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys are going to like this one like</font>

1595
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:38,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">this one I'm going to go a little bit</font>

1596
00:59:37,000 --> 00:59:40,900
fast but I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do a thought</font>

1597
00:59:38,110 --> 00:59:43,660
experiment so again<font color="#CCCCCC"> I want to remind you</font>

1598
00:59:40,900 --> 00:59:46,540
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the guilty until proven innocent</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tend</font>

1600
00:59:46,540 --> 00:59:52,150
takedowns and the endless chain attack

1601
00:59:50,230 --> 00:59:55,930
and isp liability so all of these things

1602
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:58,840
are our problems that we've outlined in

1603
00:59:55,930 --> 01:00:00,580
the DMCA<font color="#E5E5E5"> so I want to pose</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a couple of</font>

1604
00:59:58,840 --> 01:00:02,440
rhetorical questions which is that what

1605
01:00:00,580 --> 01:00:05,020
if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> treated those problems what have</font>

1606
01:00:02,440 --> 01:00:07,510
we treated those failings as protocol

1607
01:00:05,020 --> 01:00:10,570
failings right so what have we actually

1608
01:00:07,510 --> 01:00:13,150
say oh this is just a protocol this

1609
01:00:10,570 --> 01:00:15,910
stuff is is vulnerable to<font color="#E5E5E5"> attack as</font>

1610
01:00:13,150 --> 01:00:18,790
we've demonstrated earlier and what have

1611
01:00:15,910 --> 01:00:20,620
we treated our our lawmakers like

1612
01:00:18,790 --> 01:00:22,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">software vendors right so we tell them</font>

1613
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:26,620
hey you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> this stuff this is the</font>

1614
01:00:22,690 --> 01:00:29,260
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> and and what if proved concept</font>

1615
01:00:26,620 --> 01:00:31,960
code could be used<font color="#E5E5E5"> to highlight dmca</font>

1616
01:00:29,260 --> 01:00:33,640
protocol flaws right so this is how

1617
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:36,520
could we you know or could we use

1618
01:00:33,640 --> 01:00:37,890
software to to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really take advantage of</font>

1619
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:39,600
these flaws<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1620
01:00:37,890 --> 01:00:41,129
show that that this stuff doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> work</font>

1621
01:00:39,600 --> 01:00:44,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the protocols that they've outlined</font>

1622
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:47,640
in the statutes are our flawed so

1623
01:00:44,640 --> 01:00:49,859
responsible disclosure most of you

1624
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:51,540
probably know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this so it requires that</font>

1625
01:00:49,860 --> 01:00:52,860
you know state of<font color="#CCCCCC"> offender releases</font>

1626
01:00:51,540 --> 01:00:54,120
buggy software and then a security

1627
01:00:52,860 --> 01:00:56,460
researcher finds some sort of

1628
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:58,710
theoretical vulnerability and forms of

1629
01:00:56,460 --> 01:01:01,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">endor the vendor chooses not to fix the</font>

1630
01:00:58,710 --> 01:01:02,670
bug so the researcher winds up releasing

1631
01:01:01,410 --> 01:01:04,080
this as a white paper whatever to the

1632
01:01:02,670 --> 01:01:06,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">public saying like hey look this could</font>

1633
01:01:04,080 --> 01:01:08,490
probably be leveraged as a<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem and</font>

1634
01:01:06,660 --> 01:01:10,799
then the vendor still does nothing maybe

1635
01:01:08,490 --> 01:01:14,790
perhaps arguing that the attack is to

1636
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:17,010
theoretical that it would never work so

1637
01:01:14,790 --> 01:01:21,300
the researcher writes<font color="#CCCCCC"> proof-of-concept</font>

1638
01:01:17,010 --> 01:01:22,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">exploit code and and then this last item</font>

1639
01:01:21,300 --> 01:01:24,510
I said the vendor must fix the bug it's

1640
01:01:22,890 --> 01:01:26,970
actually not the case they<font color="#E5E5E5"> can probably</font>

1641
01:01:24,510 --> 01:01:29,130
write a dmca takedown notice and prevent

1642
01:01:26,970 --> 01:01:32,910
the researcher from releasing this stuff

1643
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:34,770
so here's the theoretical attack we're

1644
01:01:32,910 --> 01:01:37,529
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> imagine what happens if we</font>

1646
01:01:37,530 --> 01:01:43,440
is that it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just him but that that</font>

1647
01:01:41,730 --> 01:01:45,960
all of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> things that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> he highlighted</font>

1648
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:48,150
we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to take</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> advantage</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of those</font>

1649
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:51,510
but on a mass scale right so lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1650
01:01:48,150 --> 01:01:54,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">people I want to a positive actor named</font>

1652
01:01:54,150 --> 01:01:59,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">throw together just design or maybe use</font>

1653
01:01:56,700 --> 01:02:01,439
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> bot network of nodes that can send</font>

1654
01:01:59,250 --> 01:02:03,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">well-crafted dmca takedown notices and</font>

1655
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:06,030
follow-up notices to multiple isps

1656
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:07,860
against multiple users so think of this

1657
01:02:06,030 --> 01:02:10,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">as a sort of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> web crawler that goes</font>

1658
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:13,440
around fines content creates these

1659
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:16,890
takedown notices and fires them off in

1660
01:02:13,440 --> 01:02:17,940
mass to all these ISPs so we have a

1661
01:02:16,890 --> 01:02:22,440
<font color="#E5E5E5">couple requirements one is that</font>

Mallory's identity stay hidden<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font>

1663
01:02:22,440 --> 01:02:25,680
any node that sends the takedown notices

1664
01:02:24,330 --> 01:02:27,840
cannot be tracked back to her this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1665
01:02:25,680 --> 01:02:30,600
like basic botnet work principle stuff

1666
01:02:27,840 --> 01:02:32,070
about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the nodes themselves need to</font>

1667
01:02:30,600 --> 01:02:33,660
be exposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> that can't be like behind</font>

1668
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:35,070
tour or something like that because

1669
01:02:33,660 --> 01:02:37,230
that's statistically interesting

1670
01:02:35,070 --> 01:02:39,990
information so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> abuse of takedown</font>

1671
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:42,480
notices must look like legit notices so

1672
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:43,950
you can use random looking letterhead so

1673
01:02:42,480 --> 01:02:45,570
you know say off chilling effects org

1674
01:02:43,950 --> 01:02:47,730
you can you can throw together whatever

1675
01:02:45,570 --> 01:02:51,270
you want as long as

1676
01:02:47,730 --> 01:02:52,560
there's statistically and this kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1677
01:02:51,270 --> 01:02:53,580
goes towards spam fighting right as long

1678
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:55,710
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're statistically</font>

1679
01:02:53,580 --> 01:02:58,529
indistinguishable from real takedown

1680
01:02:55,710 --> 01:03:00,510
notices so then you know you might even

1681
01:02:58,530 --> 01:03:04,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">put anonymous contact information on</font>

1682
01:03:00,510 --> 01:03:06,180
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> a prepaid cell phone or VoIP or</font>

1683
01:03:04,109 --> 01:03:11,430
something like that maybe tour access to

1684
01:03:06,180 --> 01:03:12,899
an<font color="#CCCCCC"> email account and and then when this</font>

1685
01:03:11,430 --> 01:03:14,790
thing sends notices it needs to send

1686
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:17,040
them to all<font color="#CCCCCC"> first order ISPs when I say</font>

1687
01:03:14,790 --> 01:03:18,150
first order is be I mean ISPs down at

1688
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:19,770
the leaf nodes we think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it like a</font>

1689
01:03:18,150 --> 01:03:21,000
tree although it's more like a web but

1690
01:03:19,770 --> 01:03:25,259
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about it like a tree where</font>

1691
01:03:21,000 --> 01:03:27,960
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> P is sort of have a parent you want</font>

1692
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:31,770
to send takedown notices to all those

1693
01:03:27,960 --> 01:03:33,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">first-order ISPs but you you also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

1694
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:34,440
to send them<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the enth order is Pete</font>

1695
01:03:33,119 --> 01:03:35,850
so you want to go up the chain so you

1696
01:03:34,440 --> 01:03:37,260
can do the<font color="#E5E5E5"> back door and attacks under</font>

1697
01:03:35,850 --> 01:03:40,259
certain conditions that is where the

1698
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:43,619
content is still up or or<font color="#CCCCCC"> when it goes</font>

1699
01:03:40,260 --> 01:03:45,330
down and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then comes back up so so you</font>

1700
01:03:43,619 --> 01:03:46,770
have those two conditions to send

1701
01:03:45,330 --> 01:03:47,910
takedown notices and then there's a sort

1702
01:03:46,770 --> 01:03:50,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">of side effect that's kind of</font>

1703
01:03:47,910 --> 01:03:53,009
interesting here which which amazingly

1704
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:54,960
enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> federici also highlighted which</font>

1705
01:03:53,010 --> 01:04:00,990
is that you can send a takedown notice

1706
01:03:54,960 --> 01:04:03,210
to to a search engine say Google and get

1707
01:04:00,990 --> 01:04:07,020
the content removed from the index as

1708
01:04:03,210 --> 01:04:08,700
well as the cash but the interesting

1709
01:04:07,020 --> 01:04:10,980
thing here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that Google doesn't have a</font>

1710
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:12,689
user for that content so there is<font color="#E5E5E5"> no</font>

1711
01:04:10,980 --> 01:04:14,160
counter-notice procedure right so you

1712
01:04:12,690 --> 01:04:19,230
send a takedown notice it gets removed

1713
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:20,490
from the index or or<font color="#E5E5E5"> the cash and then</font>

1714
01:04:19,230 --> 01:04:21,600
there's no user to say this was a

1715
01:04:20,490 --> 01:04:23,220
fraudulent take down so you can

1716
01:04:21,600 --> 01:04:26,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically remove the content from search</font>

1717
01:04:23,220 --> 01:04:28,830
indexes as well so I'm going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1718
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:30,480
little bit about just say we'll use your

1719
01:04:28,830 --> 01:04:34,650
man right I'll just<font color="#CCCCCC"> give you an overview</font>

1720
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:36,450
of what it<font color="#E5E5E5"> is but it's a distributed job</font>

1721
01:04:34,650 --> 01:04:40,980
processing server and you have a bunch

1722
01:04:36,450 --> 01:04:42,868
<font color="#CCCCCC">of clients that send a payload to a job</font>

1723
01:04:40,980 --> 01:04:45,810
server registered for function foo or

1724
01:04:42,869 --> 01:04:47,310
whatever and then that job server sits

1725
01:04:45,810 --> 01:04:48,720
there and workers connect to it and say

1726
01:04:47,310 --> 01:04:50,220
hey I can do job foo do you have

1727
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:52,709
anything for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me and so the workers pick</font>

1728
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:56,100
it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do the work and so all</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of this</font>

1729
01:04:52,710 --> 01:04:57,210
scales like 12 n at any point and what

1730
01:04:56,100 --> 01:04:57,600
we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is sort of Shem this</font>

1731
01:04:57,210 --> 01:04:59,550
in

1732
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:00,870
at the two connection points here where

1733
01:04:59,550 --> 01:05:02,130
the clients connect the job server that

1734
01:05:00,870 --> 01:05:03,420
workers connect to the jobs to<font color="#CCCCCC"> reassume</font>

1735
01:05:02,130 --> 01:05:06,870
that through the tor hidden service

1736
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:08,340
protocol it this is not<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it wouldn't</font>

1737
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:09,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">work out of the box but there's an</font>

1738
01:05:08,340 --> 01:05:12,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting project that we're working</font>

1739
01:05:09,480 --> 01:05:15,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">on that could make your men do this so</font>

1740
01:05:12,450 --> 01:05:16,980
so the client<font color="#E5E5E5"> API is basically you can</font>

1741
01:05:15,660 --> 01:05:18,540
write it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> whatever language you want</font>

1742
01:05:16,980 --> 01:05:21,540
and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> you sham it here at the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> arrows</font>

1743
01:05:18,540 --> 01:05:23,610
it goes the job server you have the the

1744
01:05:21,540 --> 01:05:24,779
shim for tour as well over<font color="#E5E5E5"> here and the</font>

1745
01:05:23,610 --> 01:05:26,370
workers can pick it up and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they can be</font>

1746
01:05:24,780 --> 01:05:30,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">written in whatever you want and then</font>

1747
01:05:26,370 --> 01:05:32,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">more of my fun diagrams so we have</font>

1748
01:05:30,210 --> 01:05:35,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">Mallory over here with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the little horns</font>

1749
01:05:32,250 --> 01:05:38,760
and she has a takedown notice there's a

1750
01:05:35,460 --> 01:05:41,280
tour onion network gear man server and

1751
01:05:38,760 --> 01:05:44,550
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> a bunch of zombie workers and isp</font>

1752
01:05:41,280 --> 01:05:48,240
is over here and so what what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1753
01:05:44,550 --> 01:05:52,770
happen is you or you Mallory constructs

1754
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:56,129
a statistically<font color="#CCCCCC"> intramol I should say a</font>

1755
01:05:52,770 --> 01:05:57,780
takedown notice that is basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1756
01:05:56,130 --> 01:06:00,600
same<font color="#CCCCCC"> as any other takedown notice that</font>

1757
01:05:57,780 --> 01:06:03,510
nice p would receive and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mallory fires</font>

1758
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:05,430
it off through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tour onion network</font>

1759
01:06:03,510 --> 01:06:09,450
and it lands on this gear man job server

1760
01:06:05,430 --> 01:06:12,450
and and then workers register for<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1761
01:06:09,450 --> 01:06:14,879
function so they pick it<font color="#E5E5E5"> up and so both</font>

1762
01:06:12,450 --> 01:06:16,770
the client connection from Mallory to

1763
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:20,760
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> job server and the connection from</font>

1764
01:06:16,770 --> 01:06:22,410
from gear man to the worker was was

1765
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:24,600
obscured through the tour onion network

1766
01:06:22,410 --> 01:06:26,430
and then these zombie workers

1767
01:06:24,600 --> 01:06:28,380
essentially can take that takedown

1768
01:06:26,430 --> 01:06:30,540
notice or the mass amounts of takedown

1769
01:06:28,380 --> 01:06:32,490
notices that Mallory is firing off the

1770
01:06:30,540 --> 01:06:38,940
job server and just shoot them off at

1771
01:06:32,490 --> 01:06:40,709
the ISPs<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so so if if you know we're</font>

1772
01:06:38,940 --> 01:06:42,330
working under<font color="#CCCCCC"> the current regime</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

1773
01:06:40,710 --> 01:06:45,570
ISPs are going to be shutting the stuff

1774
01:06:42,330 --> 01:06:47,520
off until they realize wow we're losing

1775
01:06:45,570 --> 01:06:51,630
<font color="#CCCCCC">a lot of users shutting this stuff off</font>

1776
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:54,420
we can no longer<font color="#E5E5E5"> really do this so the</font>

1777
01:06:51,630 --> 01:06:56,010
service provider can choose<font color="#CCCCCC"> to follow</font>

1778
01:06:54,420 --> 01:06:57,510
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> counter notice procedures but then</font>

1779
01:06:56,010 --> 01:07:02,040
there's still the 10-day denial of

1780
01:06:57,510 --> 01:07:03,240
service attack and there's you have to

1781
01:07:02,040 --> 01:07:04,590
take into account the<font color="#E5E5E5"> back door een as</font>

1782
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:06,779
well like the ISP might not even be in

1783
01:07:04,590 --> 01:07:08,520
control so ultimately<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think if the</font>

1784
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:09,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">volume was great enough right if</font>

1785
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:10,350
somebody were to actually launch this

1786
01:07:09,720 --> 01:07:12,419
type of

1787
01:07:10,350 --> 01:07:13,860
the volume<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> great enough that that</font>

1788
01:07:12,420 --> 01:07:15,450
these notices were statistically

1789
01:07:13,860 --> 01:07:17,430
indistinguishable from real notice

1790
01:07:15,450 --> 01:07:21,960
notices so you have this really bad

1791
01:07:17,430 --> 01:07:25,529
signal to noise<font color="#E5E5E5"> ratio that that isps</font>

1792
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:29,370
would be forced to ignore these notices

1793
01:07:25,530 --> 01:07:30,660
so the law becomes unenforceable ISPs

1794
01:07:29,370 --> 01:07:32,819
are no longer complying with takedown

1795
01:07:30,660 --> 01:07:35,640
notices and ultimately it needs to go

1796
01:07:32,820 --> 01:07:37,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">back to Congress</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for rewrite and so this</font>

1797
01:07:35,640 --> 01:07:39,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">is which yeah how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we fix this here</font>

1798
01:07:37,350 --> 01:07:42,509
are some recommendations the 10-day

1799
01:07:39,180 --> 01:07:44,879
denial service attack<font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't working this</font>

1800
01:07:42,510 --> 01:07:47,250
is a<font color="#CCCCCC"> problem for content the chaining</font>

1801
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:49,440
attacks<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it's the same content</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

1802
01:07:47,250 --> 01:07:50,490
file the same dmca takedown notice this

1803
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a problem</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and there should be</font>

1804
01:07:50,490 --> 01:07:56,100
liability associated with doing this

1805
01:07:51,870 --> 01:07:57,660
let's see isp liability is also a

1806
01:07:56,100 --> 01:07:59,220
problem as Chris mentioned when he was

1807
01:07:57,660 --> 01:08:01,529
<font color="#CCCCCC">talking about this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is a lot to tie</font>

1808
01:07:59,220 --> 01:08:03,390
a lot of responsibility<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the ISP at a</font>

1809
01:08:01,530 --> 01:08:05,490
time consuming liability this is a

1810
01:08:03,390 --> 01:08:07,680
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have some speech that</font>

1811
01:08:05,490 --> 01:08:10,109
you'd like<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get out there and the ISP</font>

1812
01:08:07,680 --> 01:08:11,430
really doesn't care and their<font color="#CCCCCC"> their</font>

1813
01:08:10,110 --> 01:08:17,040
profit margin it's probably<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to way</font>

1814
01:08:11,430 --> 01:08:18,450
above your what you have to say so the

1815
01:08:17,040 --> 01:08:22,109
future would basically look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1816
01:08:18,450 --> 01:08:25,590
past<font color="#E5E5E5"> all right so we'd be back to people</font>

1817
01:08:22,109 --> 01:08:27,510
having to get court orders to mitigate

1818
01:08:25,590 --> 01:08:30,870
disputes or insert to arbitrate disputes

1819
01:08:27,510 --> 01:08:33,090
between to an alleged infringer and

1820
01:08:30,870 --> 01:08:36,990
alleged copyright holder so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ISP is</font>

1821
01:08:33,090 --> 01:08:38,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">no longer in the middle of this I'm</font>
