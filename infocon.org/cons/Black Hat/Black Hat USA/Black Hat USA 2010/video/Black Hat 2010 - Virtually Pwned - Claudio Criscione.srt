00:00:00,349 --> 00:00:04,580
this is our cloud virtualization truck
the talk is called virtually all the

2
00:00:04,580 --> 00:00:09,119
time testing virtualization pleased your
wall come to a cloud of europe

3
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:15,959
christiano

4
00:00:15,959 --> 00:00:17,719
tenure there

5
00:00:17,719 --> 00:00:21,279
no okay thank you for your email

6
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:23,210
no denies that

7
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:26,230
um... levy one

8
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:30,830
is that what date

9
00:00:30,830 --> 00:00:35,089
okay right

10
00:00:35,090 --> 00:00:39,200
out to everyone i'm glad to show them
and is the local oppositely about spent

11
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,790
esteemed organisation we whole edad
lunch so i'll take these one easy and

12
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:47,570
just wake you up before they deem also
pay so

13
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:48,930
and about me

14
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:52,400
as might have guessed that i'm from
italy account to issue most likely know

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:54,150
for updates up mafia

16
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:59,350
and a crappy soccer team

17
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:03,280
means i worked as a principal consultant
in a small security fee in the bay city

18
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:05,138
mi on secured at work

19
00:01:05,138 --> 00:01:07,149
where that's my day job

20
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:11,430
and during init i_t_n_ a p_h_d_ student
for political immunol which is made on

21
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:12,970
cyclical university

22
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:17,030
where we're finishing two dozens wedding
stars and c_s_ my deep and then also

23
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:20,030
medical from britain decision of people
one of the most precious bucks

24
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:21,220
in industry

25
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:25,070
use it to be on the web obligation on
princess errors that i know that's since

26
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:27,419
a couple of years in their position
environment

27
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:28,880
and that's was signed

28
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:31,690
doing most of the time right now

29
00:01:31,690 --> 00:01:35,330
before we started like wanted to let
very week port

30
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:38,039
how many of you are in charge or use

31
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,620
or handle security

32
00:01:39,620 --> 00:01:41,890
for deposition environments

33
00:01:41,890 --> 00:01:44,110
brady raspberries

34
00:01:44,110 --> 00:01:47,369
almost everyone fight that's a
percentage or suspecting

35
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:50,350
and about that

36
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:52,440
this is actually wide

37
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,770
because preposition as bickering and i
think it's everywhere now you can find

38
00:01:56,770 --> 00:02:02,640
it the queen old whilst every large
enterprise assistance enterprise network

39
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,440
and juries are definitely net made for
security

40
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:10,109
burglars ishaan is a building block of
for your own network is a building block

41
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,159
for your own infrastructure

42
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:14,089
and it is a critical components

43
00:02:14,089 --> 00:02:17,469
of any large new deployments

44
00:02:17,469 --> 00:02:21,959
however security in berkeley fischoff at
a small sleepy address said until now

45
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:25,320
with a lot of bob or where and
management imports dogs

46
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,519
that's why a m

47
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:30,609
getting technical and talking to you
about than texting

48
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:34,209
whites are you have to break inside her
physician the stadium

49
00:02:34,209 --> 00:02:35,990
amberking certification

50
00:02:35,990 --> 00:02:37,649
there's a lot of things

51
00:02:37,649 --> 00:02:38,599
three cents

52
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:41,608
it means that you are taking the
underlying laya

53
00:02:41,609 --> 00:02:45,679
your acctually attacking what's behind
what's pounder your service

54
00:02:45,679 --> 00:02:49,090
it means most likely that you will be
able to assist or the system

55
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:49,859
locally

56
00:02:49,859 --> 00:02:53,619
it means that we will have feasible
assess as far as her position goes to

57
00:02:53,619 --> 00:02:57,639
the machines which in time a city with
the most likely able to act and if you

58
00:02:57,639 --> 00:03:01,009
can mail says the verbal machine console

59
00:03:01,009 --> 00:03:02,418
then it's came over

60
00:03:02,419 --> 00:03:06,639
it also means that you will most likely
will be able to weigh parcel ripples

61
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:10,319
nice network is his control center says
says control as a fuel

62
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:11,388
had been deployed

63
00:03:11,389 --> 00:03:14,309
so if attack it can get to divert was
ish environment

64
00:03:14,309 --> 00:03:16,879
you at least here at this point

65
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:19,790
and you also get multiple targets at
once

66
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:23,929
if i can get inside your verbal
efficient savaria your yes c_s_x_ so

67
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:25,849
whatever kind of a position using

68
00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:27,859
what most likely i will have a sense

69
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,229
to our last of machines

70
00:03:31,229 --> 00:03:32,990
that's jackpots basically

71
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,119
former thacker perspective

72
00:03:35,119 --> 00:03:36,850
historical we we'll be using

73
00:03:36,850 --> 00:03:38,989
d attacker perspective

74
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:43,179
i guess you all are for me oh week what
then testing means

75
00:03:43,179 --> 00:03:46,969
it means that you are trying to break
inside opera politician solution

76
00:03:46,969 --> 00:03:48,379
it means that you are too

77
00:03:48,379 --> 00:03:50,999
biting updates on the attacker

78
00:03:50,999 --> 00:03:53,019
thinking like he does

79
00:03:53,019 --> 00:03:55,619
if you look at their position

80
00:03:55,619 --> 00:03:57,849
a lot

81
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:01,040
staff to gain there is a lot of game he
arteries

82
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,950
and i think there's a huge benefits for
attacker to breaker for his ation and

83
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:08,570
it's almost everywhere ninety six
percent of the fortune one thousand

84
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:09,010
company

85
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:11,858
by using their position

86
00:04:11,859 --> 00:04:14,859
what's even more interesting you get a
small number

87
00:04:14,859 --> 00:04:17,289
all solutions actually deployed

88
00:04:17,289 --> 00:04:21,089
because india and idon't think also well
up there is more number of different

89
00:04:21,089 --> 00:04:22,599
solution to them find their own

90
00:04:22,599 --> 00:04:24,050
so if you manage

91
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:26,130
previn exploits with attacks

92
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:28,719
forgotten all about and over politicians
to the show

93
00:04:28,719 --> 00:04:32,530
web you get a says a lot of c_ span's
together so you can hold a lot of sees

94
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:33,270
them

95
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,830
weed a few exploits

96
00:04:34,830 --> 00:04:40,250
i don't know about you but i want to see
stem q exploits for me as more less

97
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:42,210
and if you don't know about that

98
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,229
argued appeared in bucket

99
00:04:44,229 --> 00:04:47,190
if you don't know about that as
something graduate to combat

100
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:49,929
at the flames but it's mostly religion

101
00:04:49,929 --> 00:04:51,280
this age

102
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,649
this sake

103
00:04:52,649 --> 00:04:54,660
season as thinking about virtualisation

104
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:58,110
i guess ural expecting

105
00:04:58,110 --> 00:05:00,610
that i speak about something in
particular

106
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,020
so to speak about

107
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:03,859
yet if renting the room

108
00:05:03,859 --> 00:05:04,938
this topic

109
00:05:04,939 --> 00:05:05,710
will not

110
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:07,359
the about

111
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,759
escaping the viet

112
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:11,480
first of all because i'm not able to sab

113
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,789
that said that's only three point

114
00:05:13,789 --> 00:05:16,498
there's another reason actually

115
00:05:16,499 --> 00:05:19,559
it's heading to the ad can be done it
has been done in the past so we know we

116
00:05:19,559 --> 00:05:20,390
can be done

117
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:23,010
you can go from the ripley's ayesha fun
their machines

118
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:24,840
to the off seasons

119
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:29,138
however it will be due to a backing if
we did you translate likely bubble

120
00:05:29,139 --> 00:05:31,840
design issue most likely contended that
shit

121
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:33,888
accepted without having to do

122
00:05:33,889 --> 00:05:36,120
but from up in testing perspective

123
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,450
it doesn't remind

124
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:38,779
that match

125
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:41,030
definite security perspective it s
absurd

126
00:05:41,030 --> 00:05:43,390
but if your pen testing infrastructure

127
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,909
that's not what you really interesting
in too

128
00:05:45,909 --> 00:05:50,110
what you want to do is a pen tester is
to be able to start with other theodore

129
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,770
s range

130
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:53,299
over whatever you find

131
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:54,920
that's more or less what you're trying
to do

132
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:58,110
that what i what that's at least let my
customer bony

133
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,449
iriarte nikki addresses

134
00:05:59,449 --> 00:06:02,490
at tonight's meeting old no bullpen test

135
00:06:02,490 --> 00:06:05,490
yeah most of the negatives you can get
give you the right at the address is but

136
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:06,529
that's not mad

137
00:06:06,529 --> 00:06:09,080
so what we're going to do

138
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:12,318
attacking the bergalis ishaan
infrastructure

139
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:17,120
that is we are attacking the verifies
isham solutions

140
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,990
allied week going to do that

141
00:06:20,990 --> 00:06:22,199
so i like it

142
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:23,339
is a glance

143
00:06:23,339 --> 00:06:24,999
allied planes could know

144
00:06:24,999 --> 00:06:27,069
i'm not really a lot of things to do

145
00:06:27,069 --> 00:06:31,469
well my favorites being side yelled to
pound models just bleak play an old hand

146
00:06:31,469 --> 00:06:33,279
weights and get paid at the end

147
00:06:33,279 --> 00:06:35,469
so that's what we're trying to do

148
00:06:35,470 --> 00:06:36,369
my plan

149
00:06:36,369 --> 00:06:38,169
is at least explain

150
00:06:38,169 --> 00:06:40,878
follow me here please

151
00:06:40,879 --> 00:06:42,699
letter to attacker and three park

152
00:06:42,699 --> 00:06:44,430
and again bs obvious

153
00:06:44,430 --> 00:06:47,459
so that's a pilot trying to follow

154
00:06:47,459 --> 00:06:49,409
i'll i'll be going to do that

155
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:51,319
wept the point is

156
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:53,310
india's environment india spacing

157
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,319
than testing their politicians

158
00:06:55,319 --> 00:06:59,000
what we are knocking art the toads

159
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,090
really not tools

160
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,739
too though that

161
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:05,530
most of the torture use it soooo free
size idaho nevada big discounters

162
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:08,650
they know very little about the
requisition tools at our position

163
00:07:08,650 --> 00:07:09,520
systems

164
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,219
them not to be able to add fuel

165
00:07:12,219 --> 00:07:13,379
it might depends

166
00:07:13,379 --> 00:07:16,580
by far far from the fact that i am going
to have to tell you about some of that

167
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:21,130
that's what i discovered and they didn't
so most likely be it's that as well but

168
00:07:21,130 --> 00:07:25,509
we actually need new tools to do the job
back to get the job done

169
00:07:25,509 --> 00:07:26,639
in this stark

170
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:27,770
i would be using

171
00:07:27,770 --> 00:07:31,990
i pulled out by the pedal pedal earful
some fellow hikers

172
00:07:31,990 --> 00:07:33,889
ought to show you some of that

173
00:07:33,889 --> 00:07:36,729
actuarial morse attacks they spent their
farm

174
00:07:36,729 --> 00:07:39,740
umberto exertion environments

175
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:41,289
is possible

176
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:45,060
bussell is a very position assessment or
other nicd needed by the way

177
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,949
and it's it is basically an exploit
thank you

178
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:50,319
for many flights

179
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,139
because i don't like living new tools
everyday of my life

180
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:55,430
may be developing them

181
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:56,870
but not living definitely

182
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,449
so i wanted something which i was
familiar with

183
00:07:59,449 --> 00:08:04,110
we could build on top of and which would
give me some sundar features

184
00:08:04,110 --> 00:08:06,889
i hate what they are really eight about
food

185
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:08,750
there other rather tall suspect

186
00:08:08,750 --> 00:08:12,050
they are like this person so you have to
use one of the deal tools for the job

187
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:12,460
done

188
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,748
i left with few clues

189
00:08:14,749 --> 00:08:20,059
but so what we have become is without
that our own framework home toolkit

190
00:08:20,059 --> 00:08:22,979
today wave really said

191
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:26,940
beta zero votes three that's the
thirtieth i duration of oscar with new

192
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:28,419
mothers

193
00:08:28,419 --> 00:08:34,760
obviously it was the jury that the
arsenal

194
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,700
'em

195
00:08:35,700 --> 00:08:39,160
it's a great but you can guess at the
end during the question and answer i you

196
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:42,100
can guess and i was going to get it

197
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,370
it means large anyway like me

198
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:45,910
so of

199
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:49,620
i have to say thanks a lot of ours
fellow icassp reading out meet

200
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:51,610
developing the tool

201
00:08:51,610 --> 00:08:54,670
this is but all we are going to use for
all our the most

202
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:56,130
so we wake up

203
00:08:56,130 --> 00:09:00,820
and for all the lists the stuff we will
do in the future

204
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:04,750
one think about our position is that you
have seen to see a lot of part of the

205
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:09,080
leaders around in the last year as their
weapons somebody these these close it

206
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:11,399
but not that many exploits

207
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:14,799
about who what when i try to find his
voice for the various diabetes from the

208
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:15,560
vendor list

209
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:18,239
pitted three release exploit

210
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,330
maybe in some commercial pot but don't
really think that we saw no experts

211
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:25,040
that's why i started writing books

212
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,209
this eight this is a book about that
dusting barefoot efficient but about

213
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:31,520
three papers that idea yet for the
desktop software

214
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:34,379
sewing distorted we would have had
people targeted

215
00:09:34,379 --> 00:09:35,780
we left at the mall

216
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:38,579
we led the bulls and howard it what i
get

217
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,519
is the m_ word

218
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:42,230
sorry for that

219
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:45,590
is sixty point is that the unwary xlarge
she's the most well-known bandar maybe

220
00:09:45,590 --> 00:09:49,180
day at the most complete solution but
that's an aberration and not doing here

221
00:09:49,180 --> 00:09:51,209
a weather those are the bigger targets

222
00:09:51,209 --> 00:09:53,640
so the biggest archetype shipping

223
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,760
easier to get at so that he most will be
on vmware

224
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:00,430
i played i would be presenting a
methodology as well

225
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:04,199
some point if you have to consider when
you bend test virtualization

226
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,720
which she'll morris can apply to any
berkeley fission solution all the

227
00:10:07,720 --> 00:10:09,000
exploits ivan

228
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:12,470
reading today what fun during warm-up
entice activity we have been pinned

229
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,339
their superposition solutions

230
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:16,540
season a couple of years

231
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:21,370
you can do that once you know the with
abolish

232
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:25,390
let's get to yet for south up the first
things we have to solve

233
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:29,030
is the recall of these milk with keep it
short because we don't really care about

234
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:31,939
the car we have we'll talk collection

235
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:33,850
dance where we have to

236
00:10:33,850 --> 00:10:34,790
to give is

237
00:10:34,790 --> 00:10:37,949
com after the question that will
penalties

238
00:10:37,950 --> 00:10:43,350
outlay identify their position so how do
you to know it's it's durable

239
00:10:43,350 --> 00:10:45,430
so there are some recall on

240
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:47,959
ways to do that

241
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,020
mostly you have to wait

242
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:52,720
it can be vocal

243
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,930
it's local you can check some of the
tells us telltale signs

244
00:10:56,930 --> 00:10:58,069
the make address

245
00:10:58,069 --> 00:10:59,469
you know that the it whereas gautam

246
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:02,109
uh... mac address base so you can tell

247
00:11:02,109 --> 00:11:05,179
it's a very good for machine is a bill
machine just looking at uh...

248
00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:06,560
make address

249
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,579
or you can use some hardware assess
methodologies slammed right feel and all

250
00:11:10,580 --> 00:11:12,980
the methodology switch manuel

251
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:15,939
mitten twilight effect if they're
running inside of ever machine and all

252
00:11:15,939 --> 00:11:17,339
new week my athletes

253
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:18,780
but

254
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:21,459
those are not really interesting for a
pen tester

255
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,230
because once again if you were given

256
00:11:23,230 --> 00:11:25,950
gone are the least likely addresses so
what you need to do

257
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:27,390
is to identify it

258
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:28,760
personalization solution

259
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:29,770
remotely

260
00:11:29,770 --> 00:11:32,610
so we have to be able to say ok kisses
network

261
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:36,490
and i asked is refers itial solution on
these environmental that the five-year

262
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:39,399
and these other e-mails weekly special
which i can do

263
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:42,240
these and these days by stuffed we've

264
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:45,630
this is also expect fourth if you up to
the school there

265
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,410
hebron representation

266
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:47,988
deployments

267
00:11:47,989 --> 00:11:52,469
like wait your developers building their
own barefoot addition environments for

268
00:11:52,469 --> 00:11:54,709
testing by opposes but they're not
selling you

269
00:11:54,709 --> 00:11:57,099
i guess was giving that updated

270
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,840
no one opposite so

271
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:02,830
winnie the somebody'll to duties
identifying stuff

272
00:12:02,830 --> 00:12:06,269
what we did is we built our own scanner
form exploit

273
00:12:06,269 --> 00:12:09,270
i guess you're all familiar suite the fm
exports count us

274
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:13,370
but this legally airport some very nice
feature a slight being able to set

275
00:12:13,370 --> 00:12:15,239
networks ranges so rocky ranges

276
00:12:15,239 --> 00:12:18,710
and of this kind of stuff that we
leverage it dept

277
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:21,300
first module vmware apeksha

278
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,469
that's the first module you have to know
about

279
00:12:23,470 --> 00:12:24,440
it's easiest one

280
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,960
it just to run it

281
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:30,449
exploiting some very nice or p_p_i_
which you can call

282
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:33,498
you don't get the deserts they're
showing off their vmware solution

283
00:12:33,499 --> 00:12:34,850
you are facing

284
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:37,389
so this is the first of all u_n_ going
to be a month

285
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:38,249
this a creek

286
00:12:38,249 --> 00:12:39,379
week week evil

287
00:12:39,379 --> 00:12:42,510
just left there that he will go it's not
his own e_r_ and bless me

288
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:45,870
and so you get a feeling or how they act
of social workers

289
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:49,770
so what he had we're going to israel to
the following equipment to the former

290
00:12:49,770 --> 00:12:52,799
request on a very machine running on my
computer

291
00:12:52,799 --> 00:12:57,000
running and the s sex sorry abby center
and the point

292
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:00,810
we get to the various today solve was
all the components of the aware art

293
00:13:00,810 --> 00:13:02,430
later but for now

294
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:08,969
let's just see elda modestly

295
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:12,150
metals white as you no a dozen

296
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:13,800
so what we are going to go

297
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:17,240
is just simply going to logs

298
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,100
bosco

299
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:18,769
modules

300
00:13:18,769 --> 00:13:22,509
all of us talk module star on the idea
re bustillos as soon as you don't will

301
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:25,880
be from the u_s_ i'm giving you at the
end of the presentation

302
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,300
so we are power using if you were
version

303
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:33,319
the only thing it

304
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:36,690
set air force

305
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:38,600
we said there are all skyping

306
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:40,260
so we use just one e_p_

307
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:43,740
that's the at the address of available
machine running on my computer

308
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,220
running to be center

309
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,989
so we got needs we set a bit there i pee
wee goodson

310
00:13:47,989 --> 00:13:50,870
you was uh... pjs deport and so on

311
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:52,690
and we just randy exploits

312
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:53,920
that at that door

313
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,510
and we just that that that that these
center serve eventual forwad attitude in

314
00:13:57,510 --> 00:14:01,900
the elf that's them machine which was
use it for almost all that he must

315
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,990
and which

316
00:14:02,990 --> 00:14:07,670
is basically aust on their diesel a
shuttle we'd use it as an dates

317
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:11,510
this is a vmware besh on module very to
your mother very easy to write their use

318
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:12,189
if you use

319
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,620
get addicted all the tigers

320
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,329
in the network

321
00:14:14,329 --> 00:14:17,478
so for step during dept birth with a
champagne toast

322
00:14:17,479 --> 00:14:20,410
that fueled by this that might help

323
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:23,969
okay dissected let's get back in

324
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:27,160
yep a lawful penalties

325
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:29,459
let's get back to the thought

326
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:34,900
yeah from the beginning

327
00:14:34,900 --> 00:14:36,600
so we get jim where vish

328
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,200
so we identified dos vmware machine
sales p m where

329
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,340
surveyors

330
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:46,230
what we need now is a strategy to attack
them

331
00:14:46,230 --> 00:14:49,540
welcoming it is multilayered at that
just like

332
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:50,589
this cake

333
00:14:50,590 --> 00:14:54,430
uh...

334
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:57,670
my eight maya strategy is quite seem
buckley

335
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:59,469
it's five steps

336
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:02,300
the five steps art

337
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:03,890
affect the clients

338
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:07,019
everyone is doing client-side app tox
today

339
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:08,800
it's very fashionable

340
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,279
if you haven't sold even one exploits
client-side you're not forced europe or

341
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:13,830
even better but the salmon

342
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:17,570
so the testing we are going to attack is
pipes

343
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:21,700
we study i provide sort durai proviso is
not in

344
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:23,309
meant to be

345
00:15:23,309 --> 00:15:27,069
just there later in the software layer
which doctor lee does the requisition

346
00:15:27,069 --> 00:15:30,870
but also the supporting models the
course of party modules

347
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:33,450
what you do then you look at the
supporting arguments which are all those

348
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:34,770
nice services

349
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:38,960
which are laying around opening force in
your infrastructure

350
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:41,360
that the management console

351
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,769
once you've done all of these

352
00:15:42,769 --> 00:15:44,310
you get to the internal staff so

353
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:46,930
you try to attack the local machines

354
00:15:46,930 --> 00:15:48,089
sulfur sink ferris

355
00:15:48,089 --> 00:15:49,810
the client's site

356
00:15:49,810 --> 00:15:52,560
in order to understand how we have
talked to clients

357
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,099
we have to say a little bit more about

358
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:58,780
the the clients in the brooklyn session
by a man

359
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:01,159
we all started with binary clients

360
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:04,490
very nice installation which confront in
your own computer

361
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:07,079
that everyone moved to the web
applications

362
00:16:07,079 --> 00:16:08,870
soweto tv show clients

363
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:09,820
which

364
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,440
dot really work

365
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:13,510
apparently because no we are all banker

366
00:16:13,510 --> 00:16:18,529
to by atlanta game so for vmware deputy
i client which is a windows only

367
00:16:18,529 --> 00:16:22,380
application brooks said the u_s_ accent
sent a replication which once again

368
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,990
here's above windows application

369
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:27,670
what it is also out of the source of
inspiration if you could

370
00:16:27,670 --> 00:16:29,199
we have to attack it

371
00:16:29,199 --> 00:16:31,359
binary clients

372
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,160
darwin the something with them

373
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,969
likely than i would not have

374
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:40,160
talk to you about that at least mother
weight

375
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,310
angling to present to attack on which
was his clothes at moral more less one

376
00:16:43,310 --> 00:16:44,099
year ago

377
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:48,390
but it still watching book any bearish
on all of the p_r_i_ client

378
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:50,100
it or not on the senate doc

379
00:16:50,100 --> 00:16:53,720
we have to see ldl update feature of the
i cried

380
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:54,860
works

381
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:55,930
this is a

382
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:57,529
scheme arrogance i'm sure they did

383
00:16:57,529 --> 00:17:01,589
by sneaking the traffic drew some wierd
stuff going on so i'm not sure if the

384
00:17:01,589 --> 00:17:03,370
the proper process yaar but

385
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:05,939
that's what actually happened so my
computer

386
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:09,500
physically when u tried to deliver so
you press logging in your client

387
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,299
the fencing happening

388
00:17:11,299 --> 00:17:14,770
is that the client is requesting the
server

389
00:17:14,770 --> 00:17:17,270
client slash clients not at seven oh
five

390
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,010
which is a description of file

391
00:17:19,010 --> 00:17:20,709
which the survey use it

392
00:17:20,709 --> 00:17:24,079
decided to say the client it'll client
amber shown

393
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:27,040
five ins

394
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:28,760
is my description so

395
00:17:28,760 --> 00:17:32,879
higher marshall five this is my name out
of the stuff this presentation on shaky

396
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,360
but there are some a p_i_ calls going on

397
00:17:35,360 --> 00:17:36,040
once again

398
00:17:36,040 --> 00:17:39,200
the request for the clients not accept
no fight naku white

399
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,620
and that the logging

400
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,939
okay that's what happens acctually

401
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:45,930
doubt the interesting part obviously

402
00:17:45,930 --> 00:17:46,900
the clients

403
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,100
dot x ml five

404
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:51,199
look what's inside

405
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:54,200
when some cookie racial stuff yelled
reports

406
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,240
the pressure on

407
00:17:55,240 --> 00:17:57,280
and the patch for sean that the server

408
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,270
is the clarion

409
00:17:58,270 --> 00:18:01,020
so glaring so align version three

410
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:05,850
what about you client aggression siew ok
controlled how club date on that with

411
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,399
all of you read

412
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:12,720
and please don't download that's fine
are running it on your local machine

413
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:17,030
so if by does bring that about pale t
does you can all beasley

414
00:18:17,030 --> 00:18:18,960
seem to attack that stuff

415
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:20,929
that's not what i've done

416
00:18:20,929 --> 00:18:23,489
i have developed as a module which is
call it

417
00:18:23,489 --> 00:18:25,480
the v_ i_ eureka

418
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:28,240
but yeah i don't care supply-sider taka

419
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,790
which assumes that you are able to make
in the middle of days the administrator

420
00:18:31,790 --> 00:18:33,800
so we have to be in the same network

421
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:37,690
and is is one of the good very good
results levy administrador sitting in a

422
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:41,120
defense network from the rest of the
world but like the consultants which are

423
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:42,739
visiting your infrastructure

424
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:44,580
like eprints everythign

425
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:48,990
the point is is that almost no one is
using trusted certificates

426
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,269
all of these stocks

427
00:18:50,269 --> 00:18:52,980
all music august

428
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,210
thanks god ronson s_s_ l

429
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,840
as so it should be secure

430
00:18:56,840 --> 00:19:01,240
the problem is that almost no one is the
link trusted certificates on the remote

431
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:01,909
servers

432
00:19:01,909 --> 00:19:04,900
they're all using cell sign at the ford
certificates

433
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:05,870
so what happens

434
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:06,639
is that

435
00:19:06,640 --> 00:19:11,650
i think the legal attack character just
change the certificates

436
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,220
certain crafted x ml file

437
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,850
to that clients to the administrator

438
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:20,459
added me say that we just run the
updates get overhead and then used to it

439
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:22,559
because you just last year
administrators

440
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:26,210
and if i can get your research arson
idols of the old infrastructure

441
00:19:26,210 --> 00:19:29,710
as bussing for keep in mind that that's
why it is say they're not everyone is

442
00:19:29,710 --> 00:19:30,679
checking as a sad

443
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:34,240
all of the clients like the server
version one is not checking desa set

444
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:34,730
certificates

445
00:19:34,730 --> 00:19:38,789
and leader that the other clients like
ag building sent client you will in as

446
00:19:38,789 --> 00:19:42,320
you can add nor necessarily connections

447
00:19:42,320 --> 00:19:44,669
it's not to be here for granted

448
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:47,400
this eight there is also no called
science

449
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,630
baat the users

450
00:19:48,630 --> 00:19:52,600
guess a certificate warning so this is
about thirty to get these account abt

451
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,510
there is something going on
unfortunately

452
00:19:54,510 --> 00:19:57,860
no one is using site trusted
certificates so

453
00:19:57,860 --> 00:20:01,809
so it's it is attack i can tell you some
video zero because

454
00:20:01,809 --> 00:20:04,740
their infrastructure which would be
needed to run of the stuff

455
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:09,360
as quite complicated and for another
good reason i tell you later

456
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:15,240
idler show you a video of the d_i_a_
doctor at dhaka

457
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:19,539
which

458
00:20:19,539 --> 00:20:21,820
i would assume the worst

459
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:22,980
okay so in this video

460
00:20:22,980 --> 00:20:27,570
you have on the right side by left type
the became but these

461
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:32,080
the v_ i_ client assume icn running
inside vmware itself and using time

462
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,520
leveraging unity

463
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:37,450
on the other side you have the attacker
ya did in fact uh... using metal sports

464
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:39,520
good solid

465
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,040
what we are going to do is we are going
to run

466
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,300
they'll serie

467
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,780
bus stop the eye doctor module

468
00:20:46,780 --> 00:20:48,408
the only

469
00:20:48,409 --> 00:20:50,350
army terrace we would be setting

470
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:54,100
is the local parks we are going to use a
standard they don't

471
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:54,909
this one

472
00:20:54,910 --> 00:21:00,070
the matter but they're paid ok so
emerging stunned a medal sport feature

473
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:02,480
using metaphor it is so cool

474
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:04,880
weeks at the local port

475
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:09,100
widsets assessor to that's must have

476
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:10,080
week launch

477
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,860
the several actually exploit

478
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:14,559
that the other side we're going to
connect to the v_'s for your client

479
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:17,070
we already made in the middle position
for these people

480
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:20,409
so we'd there is no need to do all they
are guide pierre peace toppled yaar

481
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:20,780
talked

482
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,379
to get into men in the middle

483
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:25,190
so what would happen is that

484
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:29,850
well illegal we get the certificate
warning so we get it

485
00:21:29,850 --> 00:21:32,790
by all of his lead at least whether we
just see

486
00:21:32,790 --> 00:21:38,790
go on with my work supporting for today
and guess what is going to be etc

487
00:21:38,790 --> 00:21:40,780
added mistake or now

488
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:45,440
guess a pop-up asking him to run they
stole ur

489
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,510
they want to write this torah or
whatever it is

490
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,190
or you want to save the stolen

491
00:21:49,190 --> 00:21:51,400
naku what's the stories all about

492
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:54,190
so what's going to happen here
presidency the rate we have a lot of the

493
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:57,289
budgeting client connecting plaza
nesting kinds of things and i would

494
00:21:57,289 --> 00:22:00,299
of his lead at least territories have
say oh yeah they have a either the

495
00:22:00,299 --> 00:22:01,870
server let me storm

496
00:22:01,870 --> 00:22:05,570
we create he exploits we create the
metaphors

497
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:06,520
they don't

498
00:22:06,520 --> 00:22:08,570
which is run then threes

499
00:22:08,570 --> 00:22:12,480
once again popup these five client
update beckett has been doubled it

500
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:16,210
would you like to restocked or no we we
don't get west it's too for that we just

501
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:19,509
be notified of that we have to restart
the client we say okay

502
00:22:19,509 --> 00:22:21,730
now i use it are very lame liking

503
00:22:21,730 --> 00:22:25,230
i had a really impaled so what he would
see

504
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:26,340
when his father papa

505
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:30,429
and of course debe ser dot just be told

506
00:22:30,430 --> 00:22:34,370
we just uploaded the exploits and it is
just a matter

507
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:36,000
of connecting

508
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,050
weed a multi employer

509
00:22:40,050 --> 00:22:41,730
bergin

510
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:46,210
except the payloads to the bike is to be
paid out we have been using

511
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:48,570
connected to the remote also give me a
stray dogs

512
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:50,050
once we go next

513
00:22:50,050 --> 00:22:55,320
we use a says shards opened the session

514
00:22:55,320 --> 00:23:02,320
gable

515
00:23:04,910 --> 00:23:06,530
and you not seen the better part

516
00:23:06,530 --> 00:23:08,020
so man

517
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:12,619
disease the plane so that's a matter
fine and of vmware p_i_ doctor attack

518
00:23:12,619 --> 00:23:13,570
blindside attacks

519
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:15,450
a lot of fun but

520
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:16,019
blacks

521
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,269
threes not free

522
00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:19,420
anything you can do is get me cesar is
going to set

523
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:22,619
the fake as a sale certificate in the
antennae

524
00:23:22,619 --> 00:23:25,439
if you're stupid you deserve it not on
that

525
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,690
man

526
00:23:27,690 --> 00:23:29,100
another way to attack

527
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,870
deborah visal

528
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:31,389
stat

529
00:23:31,389 --> 00:23:34,800
is as you say that i think the court
components

530
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:36,970
in order to understand what the court
complore inside

531
00:23:36,970 --> 00:23:41,350
ashanti view etc very short idea what
geom where environments are all about

532
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:43,330
so idea where

533
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:46,290
dot t_ pression so what you have been
side for vmware

534
00:23:46,290 --> 00:23:50,240
now him where we clearly about these
button that let's just keep it short

535
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:53,890
will you have some vessel products like
the workstation the player we shut

536
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,770
at a date not very insane from pen
testing perspective

537
00:23:56,770 --> 00:24:00,660
there will be and if you to ensure more
clients i dot doc morial new attack but

538
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:04,870
for now we're going to concentrate on
several projects which are yes x yes xie

539
00:24:04,870 --> 00:24:08,139
which is now put out a writer i believe
in the last three years

540
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:11,570
the jim were server i listed product

541
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:14,419
this is what they call the agar basil
codifies earlier

542
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:16,340
but these the act while

543
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:18,399
servers during the vietnam repetition

544
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,279
they also have a management knowledge

545
00:24:20,279 --> 00:24:22,470
which is a very close center of the
center

546
00:24:22,470 --> 00:24:25,480
which is demerits wrinkled soul which
you can use to manage all your

547
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:29,470
deployment dheeraj appointment this is
what only open test are set to go about

548
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:31,470
the verifies ation

549
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:32,139
infrastructure because

550
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:35,850
those are the targets so usually just
point to the target that shit

551
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,850
so xing birth

552
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:39,770
hi provides or laya

553
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:43,930
is some more or less is giving that
darted liberalization solution it's

554
00:24:43,930 --> 00:24:45,210
because you're shooting

555
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:47,540
wacky october physician advance

556
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:51,379
on this matter there was a very nice
exploits release of last year

557
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:54,400
which is just reported to us though so
you only have one

558
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:58,640
uh... tool to remember don't have to
dollar world one good field tools

559
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,510
and it was the guest of steel

560
00:25:00,510 --> 00:25:04,940
so i'm just saying to you that it's been
nano meaning in this planing out of

561
00:25:04,940 --> 00:25:05,679
people's stuff

562
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:06,740
but basically

563
00:25:06,740 --> 00:25:10,240
it was a pots to rap song which was
discovered by sycamore house

564
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:11,519
and present at the last year

565
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:14,879
it was about to wrestling a core
component of the other visor let's let's

566
00:25:14,879 --> 00:25:18,310
see the piper viceroy your but he's
actually a network component

567
00:25:18,310 --> 00:25:20,809
so once again what you have to do

568
00:25:20,809 --> 00:25:24,980
set must auto light on all about dated
circa and just arriving eight and it

569
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:28,080
would be able to retrieve any file a
suit user

570
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,228
so of course

571
00:25:29,229 --> 00:25:34,070
that shade oh five or any non brining
guest does it would be localized

572
00:25:34,070 --> 00:25:39,530
so he picked before sone ma all of the
aisle tedious sixty-six hyster

573
00:25:39,530 --> 00:25:43,639
this has been good news when it came out
they'd eat all taht told just on the

574
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,960
ground is as quick just on investment

575
00:25:45,960 --> 00:25:47,240
which is great

576
00:25:47,240 --> 00:25:48,419
as trade

577
00:25:48,419 --> 00:25:49,850
a weather

578
00:25:49,850 --> 00:25:52,000
i'd always threats that's

579
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:54,440
most rewarding the docs our goals

580
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:57,169
attaching all those nice components in

581
00:25:57,169 --> 00:25:58,260
all around

582
00:25:58,260 --> 00:25:59,559
them via meant because

583
00:25:59,559 --> 00:26:03,110
those aren't they love the ones which
are more likely not to be updated

584
00:26:03,110 --> 00:26:04,189
sticking pair off

585
00:26:04,190 --> 00:26:07,130
just employer forget what's going on on
those components

586
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:08,590
this is up to the resume

587
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:10,629
why have been attacking yet

588
00:26:10,630 --> 00:26:12,400
so the next step

589
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,280
will be attacking

590
00:26:14,280 --> 00:26:15,480
support

591
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:16,530
components

592
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:20,580
but he's a supporting component what it
is any no core component

593
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:22,960
which is more or less shipping by
default

594
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,940
all it you can expect to find almost
every time you know any oscillation

595
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:31,590
is always interesting attacker attacking
external components

596
00:26:31,590 --> 00:26:34,139
because you can find all sort of stuff

597
00:26:34,140 --> 00:26:36,720
insider

598
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:37,799
late it is

599
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:39,460
i started to trying to

600
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:43,330
to find a way to get inside als
components approving demo if you were on

601
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:46,090
a poor scott on abuse center server

602
00:26:46,090 --> 00:26:48,299
you will find a lot of open pores

603
00:26:48,299 --> 00:26:51,660
and for that the party want of a clue
what they are all about

604
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:56,790
mostly h_t_t_p_ h_t_t_p_ a sports doing
some salt stop somewhere toppling we'd

605
00:26:56,790 --> 00:26:59,159
we've webservices

606
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:04,070
quite a mess the yet to to attack on all
the stuff

607
00:27:04,070 --> 00:27:07,850
basically is a toxic attacking going to
tell you about unfounded during the pen

608
00:27:07,850 --> 00:27:08,799
test

609
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,100
which was frightened out of time

610
00:27:11,100 --> 00:27:13,050
mathias i had to find something quickly

611
00:27:13,050 --> 00:27:16,649
so i started browsing to a local
installation of the center

612
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:21,170
and what i found out is that threes are
very interesting component end of the

613
00:27:21,170 --> 00:27:23,950
century salacious which is not a solid
by default

614
00:27:23,950 --> 00:27:28,360
but expect to find it in any largest
alicia need worldwide isolation

615
00:27:28,360 --> 00:27:32,790
this component is the all stop the eight
feature it is the allstate manager

616
00:27:32,790 --> 00:27:36,040
this takes a component which is
responsible for deployed security

617
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:36,889
patches

618
00:27:36,889 --> 00:27:41,110
on the remote yes excessive idea six
alright

619
00:27:41,110 --> 00:27:41,539
most

620
00:27:41,539 --> 00:27:45,600
so i logged a deal being able to llp etc
the pitching components

621
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:46,860
be nice

622
00:27:46,860 --> 00:27:49,309
so what i've done at a researcher the
components

623
00:27:49,309 --> 00:27:51,100
anytime solid

624
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:54,730
but it is viable left directorate are
there some as well

625
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:58,020
because it was an update dot not stated
version objecting

626
00:27:58,020 --> 00:28:01,710
of an application server which is
distributed

627
00:28:01,710 --> 00:28:02,720
inside

628
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,730
at the application inside a component

629
00:28:05,730 --> 00:28:09,380
it's vulnerable to lump bag which is
more less i think one year old or

630
00:28:09,380 --> 00:28:12,500
something like that

631
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:15,090
actually easy to exploit

632
00:28:15,090 --> 00:28:15,668
unfortunately

633
00:28:15,669 --> 00:28:19,140
these back as well as not is as quite as
well was not available when i found when

634
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,800
i looked and i look for a bit

635
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:21,870
where try to find it

636
00:28:21,870 --> 00:28:25,030
i ask that jackie team high would not
like to thank them because they didn't

637
00:28:25,030 --> 00:28:28,340
give me approval concept so yet through
their fickle don't find a

638
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:29,790
the exploit

639
00:28:29,790 --> 00:28:31,960
so that magic srini aren't

640
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,360
is up to a very simple

641
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:34,899
is just think all that

642
00:28:34,900 --> 00:28:35,900
western market

643
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,669
which you can use

644
00:28:37,669 --> 00:28:38,890
anchor the world

645
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:42,580
every five on the center what are we got
it now

646
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,520
for funding the ltte

647
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:46,350
wet you're now reading

648
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:47,429
any file

649
00:28:47,430 --> 00:28:48,909
ono windows machine

650
00:28:48,909 --> 00:28:50,539
because v center

651
00:28:50,539 --> 00:28:52,179
ron's windows machine

652
00:28:52,179 --> 00:28:54,890
so we have a windows box

653
00:28:54,890 --> 00:28:58,049
return any fire as c_-span because this
service

654
00:28:58,049 --> 00:28:59,049
bronze as

655
00:28:59,049 --> 00:28:59,809
system

656
00:28:59,809 --> 00:29:01,370
okay what would you do

657
00:29:01,370 --> 00:29:03,159
typeset face such a sincere head of

658
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:04,390
by aidid

659
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:07,380
you can read any file a system of
halloween as a she will be looked all

660
00:29:07,380 --> 00:29:10,260
the box

661
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:13,790
yet i think that's what i told i could
just get the same file for gladly d_o_s_

662
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:17,820
and find a good read was that back up
one at a change of the password

663
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:22,960
so

664
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:26,960
we talked what really an article they
i've found is exploit the was like that

665
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,940
they couldn't use it

666
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,800
what i did

667
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:35,490
is try to find another way to use these
attacker

668
00:29:35,490 --> 00:29:36,640
now follow me

669
00:29:36,640 --> 00:29:39,080
because it's it's montreal

670
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:41,669
what it's like to go

671
00:29:41,670 --> 00:29:45,289
but try to find some way to get some
information

672
00:29:45,289 --> 00:29:46,430
to want to be sent there

673
00:29:46,430 --> 00:29:48,779
i was not interested wing the server
anymore

674
00:29:48,779 --> 00:29:52,590
i didn't want to breaking system now
just one-third the globalization severed

675
00:29:52,590 --> 00:29:54,260
the brits latisha environment

676
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,330
that was my customer was paying for sale

677
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:57,710
but what i wanted

678
00:29:57,710 --> 00:29:58,969
so what it's like to do

679
00:29:58,969 --> 00:30:00,520
i tried looking

680
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,410
so what all of the rock fires

681
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:04,840
i what i found is either we had

682
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:09,480
because there is one lq five which is
well-documented you can find it it's not

683
00:30:09,480 --> 00:30:10,920
secret

684
00:30:10,920 --> 00:30:13,100
indium way interviewers volition

685
00:30:13,100 --> 00:30:14,250
by the fort

686
00:30:14,250 --> 00:30:17,660
which stores apparent of seeing the
snippets of information

687
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:21,540
which is very nice where from a
perspective up interesting perspective

688
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:24,559
you know about the pbx the provider of
props

689
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,129
does our performance logs

690
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:27,219
took a fine if you are

691
00:30:27,219 --> 00:30:30,040
be center is watching the patio not

692
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,970
well they found inside

693
00:30:31,970 --> 00:30:35,030
work there's local stuff actually did
not allies although then just looking

694
00:30:35,030 --> 00:30:35,899
for these one

695
00:30:35,900 --> 00:30:36,740
when i followed

696
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:39,710
as i can say the d_d_t_ prizefighter
logfile

697
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:41,380
unifying the session

698
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,990
heidi basalt session eddie

699
00:30:42,990 --> 00:30:43,960
or the users

700
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:48,270
which are sloppily

701
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:50,160
where or we had to do

702
00:30:50,160 --> 00:30:52,380
is to read the file

703
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,769
my exploit might

704
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:56,900
today are exploited in a finding that
for just thought it was there

705
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,850
uh...

706
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,570
get the soap session a b

707
00:30:59,570 --> 00:31:01,030
and over the box

708
00:31:01,030 --> 00:31:03,090
just wait for that means little to
connect

709
00:31:03,090 --> 00:31:04,340
betty session a day

710
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:07,060
write a session highlander

711
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:10,480
and once again it was not null

712
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,260
because

713
00:31:12,260 --> 00:31:14,230
that's the client

714
00:31:14,230 --> 00:31:17,120
wedding a bright sort by the

715
00:31:17,120 --> 00:31:18,500
with a try to do

716
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:22,790
is to by check the client and started
you know doing that manuel e inserting

717
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:25,980
the session i demand only inside the
quiet he didn't work because there are

718
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:28,550
very tight time-outs

719
00:31:28,550 --> 00:31:32,200
zoe just end users username and password
eg intent username phosphor sale we have

720
00:31:32,200 --> 00:31:36,830
a soap session idea neither through
pride the session

721
00:31:36,830 --> 00:31:38,530
they had to get back to writing

722
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:40,090
to exploit

723
00:31:40,090 --> 00:31:42,240
for that as well

724
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,470
what are you doing

725
00:31:43,470 --> 00:31:44,420
where they need to

726
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,350
was doing just like the monkeys

727
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:50,909
you know what monkeys doing saturday
meeting

728
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:52,470
going to go

729
00:31:52,470 --> 00:31:55,050
around on the ox

730
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:55,950
well they dealers

731
00:31:55,950 --> 00:31:57,710
i brought to my own

732
00:31:57,710 --> 00:32:00,770
social rider

733
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:02,970
webpage x_-rayed stretch cold again

734
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:06,630
making a very long but it's actually
very simple what aidid is a just brought

735
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:07,590
a proxy

736
00:32:07,590 --> 00:32:12,129
which was able to emulate fake
overlooking phase and the beginning of

737
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:13,169
the connection

738
00:32:13,169 --> 00:32:14,960
we divvy i try and

739
00:32:14,960 --> 00:32:17,230
ingesting check the soap session a d

740
00:32:17,230 --> 00:32:19,420
inside the an existing session

741
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:21,389
so i could right

742
00:32:21,389 --> 00:32:24,479
they re multiuser session the problem is
was just that

743
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:28,740
the being a binary client you cannot
just you know stocks from show me the

744
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:31,200
least of machines doesn't look like that
he does to go to

745
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,020
all the states of the fina state machine
city-state of all the time

746
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:38,710
if you have to to go all the states
properly

747
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:42,890
the vmware station right a module we
just get the session i d

748
00:32:42,890 --> 00:32:45,600
i'd like to write that you and other use
our session

749
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:48,530
by faking older routine procedure

750
00:32:48,530 --> 00:32:49,960
and give you all

751
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,240
deus est added promoter

752
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:56,080
scene says it all u_n_ very lazy
highlight one-click exploits what i did

753
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,480
is i_d_

754
00:32:57,480 --> 00:32:59,720
cross said they lost to exploit

755
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:03,039
and i built idea more outpolled modules

756
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:05,780
out which you can find easily embossed

757
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:07,340
let's see how it works out

758
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:08,689
once again

759
00:33:08,690 --> 00:33:15,690
video but asked leader for me for a
pro-life email problem with it

760
00:33:17,030 --> 00:33:18,279
this is our target

761
00:33:18,279 --> 00:33:23,160
this is the third floor open but he was
anyway owned for one

762
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,379
for this stuff

763
00:33:24,379 --> 00:33:25,899
dealer issue the patch

764
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:29,400
forty jetty stuff they add to resign
update available there's a stricter gun

765
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:32,690
da world for demolition

766
00:33:32,690 --> 00:33:34,580
what's the name of economics based

767
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:38,449
and you can just apply the streets
around the streets and you will be saved

768
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:42,190
was reason i believe on the nineteen of
july

769
00:33:42,190 --> 00:33:42,999
however

770
00:33:42,999 --> 00:33:46,169
is it that we welcome any two forty
salacornia and it's not email to make

771
00:33:46,169 --> 00:33:47,460
that speech who

772
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,440
soap dispensers their it's good because

773
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:52,870
i don't believe out a lot of people are
going to push for the after to stop by

774
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:56,770
not only a lot of people so we're going
to attack disney center sabbath

775
00:33:56,770 --> 00:34:00,090
as you can see it's running on a very
poor machine

776
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:03,399
so we're going to do is we are going to
the west and our connection today just

777
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:05,190
like that means through the route

778
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:06,440
just though

779
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:10,909
pdf writes the session i_d_ inside a
large us write the festivities i dot so

780
00:34:10,909 --> 00:34:12,890
erica's that recycling flooding in

781
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:17,848
so just on their connection mappings
strange year

782
00:34:17,849 --> 00:34:19,859
below its plugins

783
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:24,080
and now that his trade or demolition f
noted knee surgeries going to

784
00:34:24,080 --> 00:34:25,768
they get to work to do his job

785
00:34:25,768 --> 00:34:29,859
which is creating folders mostly

786
00:34:29,859 --> 00:34:33,889
now there is one of the eagle id eight
which drove me nuts what i was

787
00:34:33,889 --> 00:34:36,720
preparing this video and that's the
reason why i'm not doing that liquor

788
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:37,328
life

789
00:34:37,329 --> 00:34:40,879
because their log file is not i'd like
to bring in real-time

790
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,848
so just log in and look for decision
eddie once find it

791
00:34:43,849 --> 00:34:46,440
it's for than every five minutes it's
you know

792
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,109
flush it on that he's going to five
minutes

793
00:34:48,109 --> 00:34:49,149
so not his

794
00:34:49,149 --> 00:34:52,538
it's now zero forty on the clock in

795
00:34:52,539 --> 00:34:55,110
it's it's now being printed on the peace
can you can

796
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:59,029
you should be able to see that he's got
to deny moment yeah

797
00:34:59,029 --> 00:35:00,449
so this is

798
00:35:00,449 --> 00:35:01,549
instead

799
00:35:01,549 --> 00:35:02,969
the attacker

800
00:35:02,969 --> 00:35:07,110
so this is medal sports running in the
attacker box which we're going to do it

801
00:35:07,110 --> 00:35:09,400
we're just going to use what to do some
typos

802
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:13,290
and then set the remote host i_p_o_
dress and that's the only formation dale

803
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:15,538
to power module at module actually needs

804
00:35:15,539 --> 00:35:19,399
so we set the remote if your dress

805
00:35:19,399 --> 00:35:22,400
just to prove you it's it's the right
one off it here

806
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,759
penalty can be done

807
00:35:24,759 --> 00:35:26,299
we are in the outbound module

808
00:35:26,299 --> 00:35:27,759
we on the exploit

809
00:35:27,759 --> 00:35:30,779
so what's going to happen here

810
00:35:30,779 --> 00:35:32,959
that's d exploits the module

811
00:35:32,959 --> 00:35:34,888
is going to

812
00:35:34,889 --> 00:35:38,579
goto cycled through because they rocket
is rotated so you have to find the right

813
00:35:38,579 --> 00:35:43,819
one so it's going to of loves finding
the log dialoguing dog through their

814
00:35:43,819 --> 00:35:45,589
directory traversal vulnerability

815
00:35:45,589 --> 00:35:47,749
by stood up for session i d

816
00:35:47,749 --> 00:35:52,149
get latest session a deep into his one
but yet gets delayed the session i d

817
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:53,519
amgen started

818
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:54,828
telco proxy

819
00:35:54,829 --> 00:35:58,630
starting to other proxy so what we do
know if you just go next to the local

820
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:02,119
proxy arrive the session

821
00:36:02,119 --> 00:36:06,960
so let's get to the is his death at
their best of a visit

822
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,539
and

823
00:36:08,539 --> 00:36:11,619
as you can see the attacker is going to
the next to a different servo with a

824
00:36:11,619 --> 00:36:12,410
different bought

825
00:36:12,410 --> 00:36:13,779
that's where the proxy

826
00:36:13,780 --> 00:36:14,880
is

827
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:16,449
so we just enter

828
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:19,360
this is the key word bypass me is the
key word ful

829
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:22,810
that module can and cannot o_d_s_ talked
a great you can also use these modules

830
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:26,000
disney for password but that that's not
very signal we dont alone without a

831
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,099
boxer

832
00:36:27,099 --> 00:36:30,089
this is this ever did you get warning
her for public

833
00:36:30,089 --> 00:36:31,430
its attack after all

834
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:35,109
and we can see get up there connecting

835
00:36:35,109 --> 00:36:38,170
you can see it that there are two
different sorption secession eighty

836
00:36:38,170 --> 00:36:38,739
because

837
00:36:38,739 --> 00:36:41,599
the first session at the is that what we
have to provide

838
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,399
to give the looking for a cd or

839
00:36:44,399 --> 00:36:45,770
afterwards week inject

840
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:49,549
the stolen session i_d_ as you can see

841
00:36:49,549 --> 00:36:52,659
disease six six four eight six six four
papers is is the only one

842
00:36:52,659 --> 00:36:55,410
so we start using the soil on injecting
the soil one

843
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:56,999
back inside a client

844
00:36:56,999 --> 00:36:58,479
so now the performance

845
00:36:58,479 --> 00:37:00,669
wierd more less socks on today

846
00:37:00,670 --> 00:37:03,160
powerful ruby

847
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:08,379
we will be able to start to assess the
remote aust

848
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:13,809
help us sort

849
00:37:13,809 --> 00:37:18,279
thank you

850
00:37:18,279 --> 00:37:19,920
abolition papa

851
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:23,049
not is that we are getting a straight-a
right now

852
00:37:23,049 --> 00:37:25,960
so we had just inside administrator
session

853
00:37:25,960 --> 00:37:29,400
what he'd get me straight or rocks out
where we keep it out as well

854
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:32,230
so we have to look take care of that
being weekly

855
00:37:32,230 --> 00:37:35,080
creating the user were using another
module which is not freeze it now

856
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:38,569
because most ninety percent of the time
he screws up the remote service we don't

857
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:39,809
want to use that now

858
00:37:39,809 --> 00:37:43,529
but we have to eat group to grieved for
me shown some other user to be

859
00:37:43,529 --> 00:37:44,719
administrator quite quickly

860
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:46,640
weekly otherwise we can't keep it out

861
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:48,989
but i'd say that in a pen test

862
00:37:48,989 --> 00:37:52,779
that's more or less the off ok you get
inside and how you can all pray to god

863
00:37:52,779 --> 00:37:55,979
whatever you want as administrator i
creating in your folder

864
00:37:55,979 --> 00:37:57,669
which is what administrador do

865
00:37:57,669 --> 00:38:04,669
meters of blue okay there we go bothered
and edsel

866
00:38:06,519 --> 00:38:10,379
disease the al capone madhu

867
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:11,949
is one of the ways

868
00:38:11,949 --> 00:38:13,089
which you can

869
00:38:13,089 --> 00:38:13,869
assess

870
00:38:13,869 --> 00:38:15,829
during old server

871
00:38:15,829 --> 00:38:17,299
eleven

872
00:38:17,299 --> 00:38:20,969
idaho but this some ten days ago

873
00:38:20,969 --> 00:38:23,859
that eleven what was on the plane

874
00:38:23,859 --> 00:38:25,979
it's nothing to do

875
00:38:25,979 --> 00:38:29,339
being on the plane i started doing some
research on the last their show and i'll

876
00:38:29,339 --> 00:38:32,200
be away ambition for one

877
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:33,009
something which is

878
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:36,099
quite interesting in my opinion

879
00:38:36,099 --> 00:38:38,039
i guess you all know

880
00:38:38,039 --> 00:38:41,219
tomcat right

881
00:38:41,219 --> 00:38:43,580
dot there were no still because it's
using tomcat

882
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,749
to run most of these services

883
00:38:45,749 --> 00:38:49,468
however the administration thought it
would be safer than previous versions

884
00:38:49,469 --> 00:38:51,150
well guess what congressional for one

885
00:38:51,150 --> 00:38:52,719
if thats mean enabled becky

886
00:38:52,719 --> 00:38:54,089
so it's there

887
00:38:54,089 --> 00:38:56,770
and there is a standard user which is
dealer edmy

888
00:38:56,770 --> 00:38:58,159
which is your friends

889
00:38:58,159 --> 00:39:00,249
so you know my test tree

890
00:39:00,249 --> 00:39:03,899
their password for these user as being
randomly generated

891
00:39:03,899 --> 00:39:04,989
and is

892
00:39:04,989 --> 00:39:09,389
for uppercase characters one number and
one dollar keys character

893
00:39:09,389 --> 00:39:11,639
starting with a lower key stopped or so

894
00:39:11,639 --> 00:39:15,569
i don't know how many maybe there are
like sixty millions chat different

895
00:39:15,569 --> 00:39:19,589
combinations and just being that uh...
the number making up a number by my butt

896
00:39:19,589 --> 00:39:23,799
could be possible to painters who brute
force it

897
00:39:23,799 --> 00:39:26,829
there is another thing which i would
like to point you out

898
00:39:26,829 --> 00:39:28,109
this is off

899
00:39:28,109 --> 00:39:29,869
diem where

900
00:39:29,869 --> 00:39:31,819
these entries elation running on top of

901
00:39:31,819 --> 00:39:34,090
uh... windows two thousand the debate

902
00:39:34,090 --> 00:39:36,079
or before anything else let me show you

903
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:37,839
that off i'll

904
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:42,899
disease that the peaks the provider log
which i just downloaded

905
00:39:42,899 --> 00:39:44,880
to just to look for administrator

906
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,640
you can see that

907
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:51,888
you have a lot of locks referring to
these administrators

908
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:53,650
depends on this one but

909
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:56,249
inside this book unify the sop session
he as well

910
00:39:56,249 --> 00:39:59,069
if we go hunting for them on the fight
system

911
00:39:59,069 --> 00:40:01,050
so if you want to trick on the phone
system the

912
00:40:01,050 --> 00:40:02,810
of the sees of the remark

913
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:04,019
the center aust

914
00:40:04,019 --> 00:40:09,359
you we we can see well i can't see but
you should be able to see

915
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:13,558
problem flies logistics base

916
00:40:13,559 --> 00:40:15,109
policies with from that

917
00:40:15,109 --> 00:40:17,380
the lobby situated in front of the other

918
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:18,409
vmware

919
00:40:18,409 --> 00:40:19,569
and cheese

920
00:40:19,569 --> 00:40:20,829
i can see

921
00:40:20,829 --> 00:40:22,879
is these one they were

922
00:40:22,879 --> 00:40:24,159
infrastructure

923
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:25,430
business entities

924
00:40:25,430 --> 00:40:27,149
deadlocks

925
00:40:27,150 --> 00:40:29,239
erupted

926
00:40:29,239 --> 00:40:33,619
quite interesting

927
00:40:33,619 --> 00:40:37,859
any use of the reader so any user with
actual lagos says that the center server

928
00:40:37,859 --> 00:40:39,220
and take over the surveyor

929
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:42,750
so that's one of the reasons why we have
given way correctly safe that you should

930
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:45,709
not allow local says even remoteness
process

931
00:40:45,709 --> 00:40:47,198
to divvy center

932
00:40:47,199 --> 00:40:50,719
okay so that's why i think that there is
no good reason one of the reasons at

933
00:40:50,719 --> 00:40:52,099
least

934
00:40:52,099 --> 00:40:53,160
dead i think

935
00:40:53,160 --> 00:40:54,319
analysts say is that

936
00:40:54,319 --> 00:40:57,619
there is the tom petty's volition

937
00:40:57,619 --> 00:40:59,029
d'amico

938
00:40:59,029 --> 00:41:01,829
proton fives

939
00:41:01,829 --> 00:41:04,759
vmware and infrastructure

940
00:41:04,759 --> 00:41:09,209
tomcat

941
00:41:09,209 --> 00:41:13,069
talk accusers dot examen

942
00:41:13,069 --> 00:41:14,909
let's open week multiple

943
00:41:14,909 --> 00:41:16,979
as you can see

944
00:41:16,979 --> 00:41:21,868
the vmware had mean user we got mock not
easy but increasing password

945
00:41:21,869 --> 00:41:24,069
and with this password

946
00:41:24,069 --> 00:41:25,180
we've got to do

947
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:27,029
is do you go inch your own

948
00:41:27,029 --> 00:41:31,229
brewry

949
00:41:31,229 --> 00:41:34,308
points to the remote server

950
00:41:34,309 --> 00:41:36,789
this is the standard the default

951
00:41:36,789 --> 00:41:39,849
tomcat page which you get if you can act

952
00:41:39,849 --> 00:41:44,269
to the remote parts disease vmware arced
remember one hundred fifty is a peeled

953
00:41:44,269 --> 00:41:46,459
the vmware server you just seen

954
00:41:46,459 --> 00:41:48,189
which has connected these port

955
00:41:48,189 --> 00:41:51,180
we get to the contract manager

956
00:41:51,180 --> 00:41:53,198
there should not be defunct manchuria

957
00:41:53,199 --> 00:41:55,949
but what we do is just use a v m where

958
00:41:55,949 --> 00:41:56,729
admin user

959
00:41:56,729 --> 00:42:00,989
we deposit would we just stolen which is

960
00:42:00,989 --> 00:42:03,729
let's see if i can do public bus but
they're not really

961
00:42:03,729 --> 00:42:10,729
believing that

962
00:42:13,269 --> 00:42:16,359
and it just that full control of the
center of several once again because you

963
00:42:16,359 --> 00:42:16,990
can

964
00:42:16,990 --> 00:42:18,279
abroad

965
00:42:18,279 --> 00:42:21,219
any wildfire you like the res radium
argued on

966
00:42:21,219 --> 00:42:24,229
medal sports the blues dot three deaths
ok so

967
00:42:24,229 --> 00:42:31,229
thanks once again either way

968
00:42:31,849 --> 00:42:34,679
okay that was from the plane had saw
maybe there are

969
00:42:34,679 --> 00:42:38,309
there's mari mark to do that there but
i'm not sure about that not research

970
00:42:38,309 --> 00:42:39,859
that enough

971
00:42:39,859 --> 00:42:43,299
i think there are still more covers them

972
00:42:43,299 --> 00:42:45,570
still leading dealt the management part

973
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:48,449
soul twisting dot all the management
interface

974
00:42:48,449 --> 00:42:52,959
which is what you use to world aptly
administer a your p m where server

975
00:42:52,959 --> 00:42:57,859
so there is allotted to ye are because
that's the front facing bar component

976
00:42:57,859 --> 00:43:01,890
mines you usual should not be able to
see all of this nice tops

977
00:43:01,890 --> 00:43:04,509
because your view are cbs center survey
a

978
00:43:04,509 --> 00:43:07,739
should be confined to the management
network when he came from all the rest

979
00:43:07,739 --> 00:43:10,369
of network it doesn't happen in my

980
00:43:10,369 --> 00:43:10,779
experience

981
00:43:10,779 --> 00:43:13,399
guy doesn't really add

982
00:43:13,399 --> 00:43:16,328
so what we're going to do is we're going
to attack the interface which is a lot

983
00:43:16,329 --> 00:43:18,219
of fun usually

984
00:43:18,219 --> 00:43:23,570
it's it is wet phase i think this case
so it's not like the web a sitting face

985
00:43:23,570 --> 00:43:25,300
precisely where i was told

986
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:26,729
with assessing two-face

987
00:43:26,729 --> 00:43:28,578
uh... which is

988
00:43:28,579 --> 00:43:32,059
complex complexes them which is very
hard to make seculow

989
00:43:32,059 --> 00:43:36,669
there is not lovingly particular year
when u pen testing it because it's web

990
00:43:36,669 --> 00:43:40,299
interface so you can bet that sweet or
west's father ways the fantastic guy

991
00:43:40,299 --> 00:43:41,819
three cents

992
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:42,329
butts

993
00:43:42,329 --> 00:43:45,190
there are some interesting insight in it

994
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:48,599
for response you might not have where
cross extracting attacker

995
00:43:48,599 --> 00:43:51,390
which were obviously not part of the
last of or now because nervously does

996
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:52,669
export excess s esp

997
00:43:52,669 --> 00:43:55,209
the best my knowledge

998
00:43:55,209 --> 00:43:57,609
how you are and forwarding vulnerability

999
00:43:57,609 --> 00:44:00,999
which i read the bottle once again no i
can't wait for dad's i'd like to

1000
00:44:00,999 --> 00:44:01,919
remember that

1001
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:05,589
was by the way a bunch of of updates
lived up to the web assessed

1002
00:44:05,589 --> 00:44:07,558
interface for web interface sometime ago

1003
00:44:07,559 --> 00:44:09,499
but no i can't wait for that

1004
00:44:09,499 --> 00:44:13,499
so we have to reverse that or is obama
sir

1005
00:44:13,499 --> 00:44:16,649
if the user even ever as assessed to the
law color

1006
00:44:16,649 --> 00:44:21,299
be center sees them the shot down
keyword has not been change it

1007
00:44:21,299 --> 00:44:22,749
what does it mean wet

1008
00:44:22,749 --> 00:44:26,410
it means that if you will connect
locally will be sent a machine so u get

1009
00:44:26,410 --> 00:44:26,899
assess

1010
00:44:26,900 --> 00:44:29,689
throughout this impression even to a
p_p_o_ rockley

1011
00:44:29,689 --> 00:44:32,339
you can't shut down at the pump that
sees them it which is

1012
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:34,509
because he's the managing a lot services

1013
00:44:34,509 --> 00:44:37,219
just by connecting to achieve import

1014
00:44:37,219 --> 00:44:38,549
shut down

1015
00:44:38,549 --> 00:44:39,899
the use of should not be able

1016
00:44:39,899 --> 00:44:40,690
to know

1017
00:44:40,690 --> 00:44:41,690
the keyword

1018
00:44:41,690 --> 00:44:42,839
because

1019
00:44:42,839 --> 00:44:47,229
this is setting that you know exmouth
file which is not assessable by end user

1020
00:44:47,229 --> 00:44:49,419
so thats yeah it's a leftover

1021
00:44:49,420 --> 00:44:53,279
not very use of force for pen test the
spec t_v_ shutdown defunct at server

1022
00:44:53,279 --> 00:44:56,539
annual customer shots you del so you
don't really want to do that to me bent

1023
00:44:56,539 --> 00:44:58,289
as but kitson

1024
00:44:58,289 --> 00:45:00,859
what do i tell you through the fact that
it's not a module

1025
00:45:00,859 --> 00:45:04,279
which is scored the vmware web acess boy
scout

1026
00:45:04,279 --> 00:45:09,640
bismol u_n_ has been a little bit by
from some friends by local tourney

1027
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:11,629
it's basically a u_n_ forwarding can

1028
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:13,289
which explains

1029
00:45:13,289 --> 00:45:16,789
doing most request or e multiples

1030
00:45:16,789 --> 00:45:19,170
if thats mean call if you were at
forwarding

1031
00:45:19,170 --> 00:45:23,990
is x twenty using davi center as a proxy
to perform requests

1032
00:45:23,990 --> 00:45:25,419
three multiples

1033
00:45:25,419 --> 00:45:27,699
so that's exactly what the small you das

1034
00:45:27,699 --> 00:45:30,519
de musique to exploit yet debated
strauss

1035
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:34,218
or reaching for the networks which are
he din from a pack of perspective

1036
00:45:34,219 --> 00:45:38,049
you just go next lived website uh...
what interface and use that it's a

1037
00:45:38,049 --> 00:45:41,840
perennial tata so we don't know wheatley
colony credential

1038
00:45:41,840 --> 00:45:42,890
and to perform

1039
00:45:42,890 --> 00:45:43,689
voice down

1040
00:45:43,689 --> 00:45:46,160
on the remote forced

1041
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:49,020
that's pretty nice it's well he that
also use that

1042
00:45:49,020 --> 00:45:52,869
as proxy don't world inc stuff

1043
00:45:52,869 --> 00:45:56,899
that's out that you can use for
management ideas a management interface

1044
00:45:56,899 --> 00:45:58,230
a letter management

1045
00:45:58,230 --> 00:46:00,189
is not just about

1046
00:46:00,189 --> 00:46:01,910
you know web interfaces

1047
00:46:01,910 --> 00:46:03,519
threes morning that

1048
00:46:03,519 --> 00:46:07,428
for eastside saris nice about which was
pointed to but i think team at which is

1049
00:46:07,429 --> 00:46:10,299
all about the back-end systems

1050
00:46:10,299 --> 00:46:11,369
physically

1051
00:46:11,369 --> 00:46:13,839
its use it to be that if the v_ center

1052
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:16,069
member the management consultant

1053
00:46:16,069 --> 00:46:17,839
connected to the u_s_ x however

1054
00:46:17,839 --> 00:46:22,139
he lost sir verdi i provide source to
s_s_ seo

1055
00:46:22,139 --> 00:46:24,510
send em co months so you could
administer them

1056
00:46:24,510 --> 00:46:27,569
what use it to be addicted to amend the
middle attacker

1057
00:46:27,569 --> 00:46:31,129
dropped the connection and as soon as
abuse center would reconnect to the year

1058
00:46:31,129 --> 00:46:34,420
six server he would not check for
certificates

1059
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:39,089
what it's not working anymore that's
been fed should nice more baby m where

1060
00:46:39,089 --> 00:46:40,949
they think they sinking

1061
00:46:40,949 --> 00:46:44,379
i don't have a model for that because
they discover that's three days ago or

1062
00:46:44,379 --> 00:46:45,500
something something back that

1063
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,019
so the model is not

1064
00:46:47,019 --> 00:46:49,879
radiates i gotta tell you about that in
a way

1065
00:46:49,880 --> 00:46:51,999
because it's not a bot by itself

1066
00:46:51,999 --> 00:46:55,189
once again it must be getting straight
or doing its bronc

1067
00:46:55,189 --> 00:46:58,009
how does it work

1068
00:46:58,009 --> 00:47:01,559
if you are ever ring the position of the
we may need to against

1069
00:47:01,559 --> 00:47:04,370
between the yes sex and of the center
server

1070
00:47:04,370 --> 00:47:07,930
and eat my expense because you are
abusing the saw miss pettigrew shown at

1071
00:47:07,930 --> 00:47:09,359
the network level

1072
00:47:09,359 --> 00:47:12,319
and because there are a lot of very
interesting to like lucky to perform

1073
00:47:12,319 --> 00:47:13,330
rowell attacks

1074
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,380
to the network

1075
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:15,860
soak you can do that

1076
00:47:15,860 --> 00:47:19,850
what if you can manage to many don't you
can break the connection so but this

1077
00:47:19,850 --> 00:47:21,259
entrust to reconnect back

1078
00:47:21,259 --> 00:47:24,579
to that yes x service that provides our
service

1079
00:47:24,579 --> 00:47:25,570
what he does

1080
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:28,929
it's we check for deceiver tickets if if
you get common name

1081
00:47:28,929 --> 00:47:33,249
so we make sure that these connecting to
the same old common name

1082
00:47:33,249 --> 00:47:35,288
unfortunately that's the only check

1083
00:47:35,289 --> 00:47:36,680
ideologically check for a common name

1084
00:47:36,680 --> 00:47:38,439
so you can still become a name

1085
00:47:38,439 --> 00:47:41,269
get me we still get a pop-up saying
watch out

1086
00:47:41,269 --> 00:47:44,118
the certificate is in the could not be
evaluated that's true

1087
00:47:44,119 --> 00:47:46,330
so that means steven as took maker

1088
00:47:46,330 --> 00:47:48,170
but soliciting clicks

1089
00:47:48,170 --> 00:47:50,509
it's ok reconnect to the server

1090
00:47:50,509 --> 00:47:54,429
yes to provide the root password to
connect the back-end server

1091
00:47:54,429 --> 00:47:56,489
but he just get to the root password

1092
00:47:56,489 --> 00:48:02,309
so that mean get awarded it at the root
password its fire fighting for me

1093
00:48:02,309 --> 00:48:04,249
was a good does it work

1094
00:48:04,249 --> 00:48:05,700
you have to go many middle

1095
00:48:05,700 --> 00:48:07,439
between a year six server

1096
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,849
and be center

1097
00:48:08,849 --> 00:48:12,199
you have to take the u_s_s_ ekeus x
server offline

1098
00:48:12,199 --> 00:48:14,660
but we made a middle requests enough

1099
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:18,420
you wait for a college shona by
gathering which has to manali reconnect

1100
00:48:18,420 --> 00:48:19,740
their back-end server

1101
00:48:19,740 --> 00:48:21,819
in all the best that done

1102
00:48:21,819 --> 00:48:26,389
use both bsc cs server certificate way
too many enemies or to buy three sons

1103
00:48:26,389 --> 00:48:28,959
who don't really need the defense he
pulled for that i will ever madhura

1104
00:48:28,959 --> 00:48:29,629
greedy but

1105
00:48:29,629 --> 00:48:31,109
it just result staff

1106
00:48:31,109 --> 00:48:35,720
so you get the common name just ask for
ten to the seeks a race coming

1107
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,769
useful succumbing and you get a password

1108
00:48:38,769 --> 00:48:42,249
yet that we won't be able to reconnect
though so you will have to close the

1109
00:48:42,249 --> 00:48:45,868
many amigo elected eat reconnect on
record we'll realize that there is

1110
00:48:45,869 --> 00:48:47,839
something we have going on

1111
00:48:47,839 --> 00:48:51,159
sold is once again and all the way
they're doing a pen test these i

1112
00:48:51,159 --> 00:48:54,329
discovered that doing dependence because
i know it's bitter for center

1113
00:48:54,329 --> 00:48:58,969
but it really wanted the roots boss for
the of the bank and he s sex server so

1114
00:48:58,969 --> 00:49:01,499
public attitude but this way

1115
00:49:01,499 --> 00:49:03,390
so if doing a pen test

1116
00:49:03,390 --> 00:49:04,739
you are still

1117
00:49:04,739 --> 00:49:06,029
kept getting

1118
00:49:06,029 --> 00:49:10,849
because all those guys attacks are not
working

1119
00:49:10,849 --> 00:49:12,799
if reading their favorite you know

1120
00:49:12,799 --> 00:49:16,790
now i can adept of just getting to see x
if every day as faith faith

1121
00:49:16,790 --> 00:49:17,979
for me

1122
00:49:17,979 --> 00:49:19,200
it's brooks forcing

1123
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:22,178
okay i can get in touch as brute force
it out of it

1124
00:49:22,179 --> 00:49:23,729
that's not what you can do

1125
00:49:23,729 --> 00:49:27,480
vmware looking module inside augments
white mo

1126
00:49:27,480 --> 00:49:29,029
may lead

1127
00:49:29,029 --> 00:49:31,539
we just do that we just brute force

1128
00:49:31,539 --> 00:49:34,239
their standard deal more open to cash in
mechanism

1129
00:49:34,239 --> 00:49:37,240
it's likely just assault call performed
at all keen

1130
00:49:37,240 --> 00:49:41,078
so just provide vmware loaded with at
least of usernames and passwords

1131
00:49:41,079 --> 00:49:45,599
and do that drinkers deepok is that if
you do that so remote server theories by

1132
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:48,219
the photo locality assume as i tested

1133
00:49:48,219 --> 00:49:49,789
on the route user free stunts

1134
00:49:49,789 --> 00:49:51,770
so brute forcing works pretty well

1135
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:53,829
at the same goes for administrador user

1136
00:49:53,829 --> 00:49:55,590
of look at the center seven

1137
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:57,369
so reinforcing wise

1138
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:58,799
because no one is stopping you

1139
00:49:58,799 --> 00:50:01,470
the long skirt

1140
00:50:01,470 --> 00:50:03,779
about that just to show you

1141
00:50:03,779 --> 00:50:05,999
the elite worse

1142
00:50:05,999 --> 00:50:09,779
i have a very short to be more justin to
get a feeling that the module is that

1143
00:50:09,779 --> 00:50:11,400
it's not fake

1144
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,539
this is that you are looking for

1145
00:50:13,539 --> 00:50:14,150
module

1146
00:50:14,150 --> 00:50:17,179
what he wants is just three more cost

1147
00:50:17,179 --> 00:50:21,269
a password five containing the old that
you were a password and use flames you

1148
00:50:21,269 --> 00:50:22,468
once you to test

1149
00:50:22,469 --> 00:50:25,480
uh... it's released under metaphor if
you are so just

1150
00:50:25,480 --> 00:50:27,379
set the remote ellis

1151
00:50:27,379 --> 00:50:31,700
you can do that marty traded on multiple
losses just leveraging stand out

1152
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:33,169
menace poetry tool sia

1153
00:50:33,170 --> 00:50:34,910
so we said the use of boss file

1154
00:50:34,910 --> 00:50:38,430
that is what they stop dixit

1155
00:50:38,430 --> 00:50:40,819
we're on the exploits and conveniently

1156
00:50:40,819 --> 00:50:42,880
we needed to define the password

1157
00:50:42,880 --> 00:50:46,180
at this point during two beds as you
would be waiting king coughing

1158
00:50:46,180 --> 00:50:47,990
speaking we get mister doors

1159
00:50:47,990 --> 00:50:51,509
too much on extended that you keep their
pa source for you and so on so you don't

1160
00:50:51,510 --> 00:50:55,059
need to vent to read before sitting down

1161
00:50:55,059 --> 00:50:56,199
so this is

1162
00:50:56,199 --> 00:50:57,739
gets all the way

1163
00:50:57,739 --> 00:50:59,759
to dating so yet another thing you can
do

1164
00:50:59,759 --> 00:51:03,069
the next time i hear something someone
seeing that then testing barefoot is a

1165
00:51:03,069 --> 00:51:04,319
shown means set

1166
00:51:04,319 --> 00:51:09,009
just running down the system ringgit be
angry

1167
00:51:09,009 --> 00:51:12,969
not not that missus is bad

1168
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:15,489
we just say that we can brute force that

1169
00:51:15,489 --> 00:51:18,549
three steer more to do face similar to
do

1170
00:51:18,549 --> 00:51:22,430
this is a very quick weaker run-through
internal approx

1171
00:51:22,430 --> 00:51:24,319
first internal approx main

1172
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,200
that you have already

1173
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:29,029
help david assess what other machines
are you ready able

1174
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:31,320
to get inside one of the guests sees
them

1175
00:51:31,320 --> 00:51:33,419
so from a fantastic perspective

1176
00:51:33,419 --> 00:51:34,949
you're ready

1177
00:51:34,949 --> 00:51:38,429
heritage away jsl bengal mel

1178
00:51:38,429 --> 00:51:41,569
three something like like to tell you
about these because there are

1179
00:51:41,569 --> 00:51:44,569
differences between two pen testing
guests sees them

1180
00:51:44,569 --> 00:51:48,099
and pen testing hardware be said
machines

1181
00:51:48,099 --> 00:51:51,089
well dot multiple auto escalation of
privileges

1182
00:51:51,089 --> 00:51:52,969
in therefore machines

1183
00:51:52,969 --> 00:51:54,789
those are not mine

1184
00:51:54,789 --> 00:51:57,379
better researchers than i am

1185
00:51:57,379 --> 00:52:00,670
i wait eventually frisca modules for
them as well

1186
00:52:00,670 --> 00:52:05,370
but they are mostly lower level attacks
against the cebu order operating system

1187
00:52:05,370 --> 00:52:08,930
are quite complex to run during the
panthers and you can never be sure that

1188
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:11,499
you were going to crash the candle

1189
00:52:11,499 --> 00:52:15,019
looks really something you want to do
during the pen text

1190
00:52:15,019 --> 00:52:17,288
what the legal what else is different

1191
00:52:17,289 --> 00:52:21,079
comparing bill machines and i were
machines

1192
00:52:21,079 --> 00:52:22,339
i think that the res

1193
00:52:22,339 --> 00:52:24,489
a new attacks are face here

1194
00:52:24,489 --> 00:52:26,270
because we are pleased to have

1195
00:52:26,270 --> 00:52:29,509
partners position and supporting tools

1196
00:52:29,509 --> 00:52:31,469
in this case

1197
00:52:31,469 --> 00:52:32,890
hired researching

1198
00:52:32,890 --> 00:52:36,029
all their view more towards an older law
culling stolid

1199
00:52:36,030 --> 00:52:37,440
tools on the river machines

1200
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:39,979
but is it that this one attack which is
right on time

1201
00:52:39,979 --> 00:52:40,730
which is an attack

1202
00:52:40,730 --> 00:52:42,910
i found all the v_ i_

1203
00:52:42,910 --> 00:52:43,640
hemani

1204
00:52:43,640 --> 00:52:46,569
varney brit what lies management
infrastructure

1205
00:52:46,569 --> 00:52:49,160
which basically will allow you to run it
called

1206
00:52:49,160 --> 00:52:50,339
as root

1207
00:52:50,339 --> 00:52:54,019
these money is is followed jostle as
more number produce

1208
00:52:54,019 --> 00:52:55,629
but these vmware studio

1209
00:52:55,629 --> 00:52:58,709
and that her call do you think we're
just a couple of fraud of silk

1210
00:52:58,709 --> 00:53:01,109
the attacks are faces quite small

1211
00:53:01,110 --> 00:53:05,180
but less than five hours all appliances
bills wits divorced materia

1212
00:53:05,180 --> 00:53:10,209
the point is that diesel doc requires
authentication to be carried on as root

1213
00:53:10,209 --> 00:53:13,709
it seems quite pointless i mean you have
to be routed to run called assault yeah

1214
00:53:13,709 --> 00:53:15,189
finally

1215
00:53:15,189 --> 00:53:17,690
the point is that you can also exploit
that

1216
00:53:17,690 --> 00:53:21,369
locally without any authentication so
you've had arrived any level allah

1217
00:53:21,369 --> 00:53:23,020
calabasas so the girl machines

1218
00:53:23,020 --> 00:53:24,140
and kinda account

1219
00:53:24,140 --> 00:53:25,629
that you can

1220
00:53:25,629 --> 00:53:28,118
escalator pledges to route

1221
00:53:28,119 --> 00:53:30,239
the talk is actually quite simple

1222
00:53:30,239 --> 00:53:34,499
exploits achieve server she service
where recently i've seen a very nice

1223
00:53:34,499 --> 00:53:36,209
exploit exploiting seem so ever

1224
00:53:36,210 --> 00:53:37,709
and a lot of people are researching

1225
00:53:37,709 --> 00:53:39,640
on that stuff

1226
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:42,170
it's actually very simple it's just

1227
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:43,099
shall escape

1228
00:53:43,099 --> 00:53:44,290
you escape

1229
00:53:44,290 --> 00:53:45,230
shell argument

1230
00:53:45,230 --> 00:53:48,580
that these as you can see u abt lastname
and you can set the austin this is a

1231
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:52,299
court which is use its to pump you are
the network over there for machine the

1232
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:56,080
balmy server is a local sees things a
lot of the mon which you could find in

1233
00:53:56,080 --> 00:53:59,339
the machines which come to you that what
minister them

1234
00:53:59,339 --> 00:54:03,558
it's the famous prime minister stuff
from the lost paid ok so you don't have

1235
00:54:03,559 --> 00:54:07,699
to a set of a real machines and so i
think the leverage their position

1236
00:54:07,699 --> 00:54:09,759
in this case the attack

1237
00:54:09,759 --> 00:54:12,420
easy meaning that you just have to act

1238
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:15,509
that's very nice symbol and then your
paled

1239
00:54:15,509 --> 00:54:19,319
but then it was treated equally because
he could not use space into the for the

1240
00:54:19,319 --> 00:54:24,029
toc so might we had well actually
marjorie to come out from with without a

1241
00:54:24,029 --> 00:54:28,099
very nice attack on these sorry who this
plight that has swept i've been told

1242
00:54:28,099 --> 00:54:35,099
that he was the son of client there is
no need for these encoding

1243
00:54:35,309 --> 00:54:36,859
summing up

1244
00:54:36,859 --> 00:54:39,009
we have seen a lot of the docs

1245
00:54:39,009 --> 00:54:44,619
so we can now once where to the question
we attack our position

1246
00:54:44,619 --> 00:54:49,400
gap weekend

1247
00:54:49,400 --> 00:54:53,539
we have various ways to attack in
fertilization infrastructure we camp

1248
00:54:53,539 --> 00:54:58,509
that get me clients may think it's
password or haunting demonstrator system

1249
00:54:58,509 --> 00:55:03,429
we get attack diaper vice or show
directory to wrestle of the west steer

1250
00:55:03,429 --> 00:55:07,599
we can also attacking and i check values
our session

1251
00:55:07,599 --> 00:55:11,429
on we can effectiveness racial web
interface organi attack supporting

1252
00:55:11,429 --> 00:55:12,249
services

1253
00:55:12,249 --> 00:55:16,019
so please go up stocks taking to try it
at home

1254
00:55:16,019 --> 00:55:18,678
and let me know if it works out for you

1255
00:55:18,679 --> 00:55:23,109
bust up to be toward box it is feedback
feedback where meaning that if you go

1256
00:55:23,109 --> 00:55:26,598
out and use that you're about to give me
feedback ok that's the only thing i

1257
00:55:26,599 --> 00:55:28,429
think they ask

1258
00:55:28,429 --> 00:55:30,380
soap thank you for lease agreement

1259
00:55:30,380 --> 00:55:37,380
if you have any questions

1260

those are some questions get you started
if you wish soap

1261
00:55:50,889 --> 00:55:51,799
just getting

1262
00:55:51,799 --> 00:55:56,309
this is my contact and you count all of
the star from bussell dot mabel sick dot

1263
00:55:56,309 --> 00:56:00,039
or i can provide me to that email
address or treat me keep in mind that it

1264
00:56:00,039 --> 00:56:05,660
won't be able to read anything for one
ivf gap ten days more or less

1265
00:56:05,660 --> 00:56:07,859
thank you for listening ones and

1266
00:56:07,859 --> 00:56:08,219
see you later
