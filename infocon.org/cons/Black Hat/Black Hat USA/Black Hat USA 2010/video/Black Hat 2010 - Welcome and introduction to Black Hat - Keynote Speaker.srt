14
00:00:41,410 --> 00:00:46,679
of submissions we've ever done and i'm
wearing this crazy little head thing

15
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,530
that's for a reason because today our
keynote will actually be taking some

16
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:50,879
questions

17
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,839

19
00:00:56,789 --> 00:00:58,970
uh... with microphones to take a

20
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:02,180
take questions from you guys and i'll be
moderating in the middle

21
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,380

47
00:02:34,999 --> 00:02:37,400
see there seems to be a lot of energy
there are so if you're interested in

48
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:38,279

51
00:02:45,509 --> 00:02:47,279
action

52
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:48,049
okay so

53
00:02:48,049 --> 00:02:49,479
um...

54
00:02:49,479 --> 00:02:51,260
a couple comments

55
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,809
ended just because things are sort of
happening this year that the calls for

56
00:02:53,809 --> 00:02:56,319
them again i've got this rant and i've
said

57
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:57,619
t-pain dey

58
00:02:57,619 --> 00:02:59,689
and it's

59
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:02,918
the mike sticky notes which i dislike
airmen to sort of frame larger issues

60
00:03:02,919 --> 00:03:04,359
and expose you

61
00:03:04,359 --> 00:03:07,409
to sort of a bigger world right where
all their heads down or deliver

62
00:03:07,409 --> 00:03:09,489
technical specific problems

63
00:03:09,489 --> 00:03:11,959
and every once while it's probably
pretty good to get an idea of like

64
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:14,519
what's the bigger world world operating
in

65
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:17,189
what's the larger context that we do
this for

66
00:03:17,189 --> 00:03:20,900
you know as a group for society or for
your business or for individual

67
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:21,689
advancement

68
00:03:21,689 --> 00:03:22,719
and uh...

69
00:03:22,719 --> 00:03:26,249
and so so we selected a keynote that
they would really help kind of try to

70
00:03:26,249 --> 00:03:28,168
expose you to a larger perspective

71
00:03:28,169 --> 00:03:31,680
but also i kind of want to thank your
for minute now that we've been doing

72
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,169
this for so long

73
00:03:34,169 --> 00:03:35,830
security problems that we

74
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:38,799
but fundamentally solved

75
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,900
and i cant can't really think of any i
mean he has little point solutions in

76
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,859
patch updates and things like that but

77
00:03:44,859 --> 00:03:48,329
i still can't think of any real big
things we killed like

78
00:03:48,329 --> 00:03:50,719
x twenty five security just kind of

79
00:03:50,719 --> 00:03:54,760
when away because we moved on to you
know to the internet tissue kerti

80
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,929
and uh...

81
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,849
i'm still thinking

82
00:03:57,849 --> 00:04:01,899
can we census evil securely

83
00:04:01,899 --> 00:04:03,349
i don't think so

84
00:04:03,349 --> 00:04:06,328
you know route packets securely

85
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:07,869
resolved name securely

86
00:04:07,869 --> 00:04:12,329
cally browse the web securely

87
00:04:12,329 --> 00:04:15,779
but we've got like fifty thousand a
virus vendors and twenty thousand

88
00:04:15,779 --> 00:04:18,228
widgets in

89
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:19,849
i'm trying to understand

90
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:23,740
what are the incentives why can't we
solve these larger problems are so

91
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,779
fundamental that underpinnings of
everything we do

92
00:04:26,779 --> 00:04:31,058
and up for for our country and in every
pension the world at the internet is an

93
00:04:31,059 --> 00:04:32,720
engine for innovation

94
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,309
and commerce

95
00:04:34,309 --> 00:04:35,400
and

96
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,159
yet we don't seem to want to put the
energy fourth or were incapable putting

97
00:04:39,159 --> 00:04:39,969
energy fourth

98
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,540
to secure the fundamental

99
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:44,000
uh... underpinnings

100
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,069
except

101
00:04:45,069 --> 00:04:46,959
happily today bo

102
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:49,990
in nineteen ninety nine a give a speech
it see aside during that speech

103
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,349
i was so excited

104
00:04:51,349 --> 00:04:53,498
because they've ratified the d_m_s_ sec

105
00:04:53,499 --> 00:04:54,589
artsy

106
00:04:54,589 --> 00:04:56,060
psyche

107
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:57,660
stuff first time now

108
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,710
put in a nail in the coffin of a problem
it's been hard to guess for for ever

109
00:05:00,710 --> 00:05:04,450
since its inception pretty much since
the bad guys figured out how to cash

110
00:05:04,450 --> 00:05:05,360
poison

111
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,509
and uh...

112
00:05:06,509 --> 00:05:09,719
and now it's like eleven years later and
finally i can today will be making the

113
00:05:09,719 --> 00:05:14,169
announcement that you know that the
route is officially signed

114
00:05:14,169 --> 00:05:17,058
hopefully we can now move on to the
business of implementing d_m_s_ seconds

115
00:05:17,059 --> 00:05:19,889
of just talking about d_m_s_ sec

116
00:05:19,889 --> 00:05:23,809
you'll be seen talks about are snake and
some guys have some great research about

117
00:05:23,809 --> 00:05:27,249
all the reasons why asa cell is pretty
much fundamentally broken

118
00:05:27,249 --> 00:05:31,249
in the way that we use it conducts
secure commerce online

119
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:34,770
as a cell needs to get fixed browsing
these get fixed

120
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,639
to i want you to think

121
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:38,929
about in in whatever and every year in

122
00:05:38,929 --> 00:05:43,229
how could you possibly help fix that the
underlined foundation to the internet

123
00:05:43,229 --> 00:05:46,169
and then we can build all this extra
stuff on top

124
00:05:46,169 --> 00:05:50,229
whether it's a new technology or whether
it's getting involved in another

125
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:51,400
in a project

126
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:54,159
that's helping to work on us more secure
email or

127
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,170
that's research on s pgp initiatives or
more likely in this group

128
00:05:58,170 --> 00:06:00,189
we're gonna be working on what f_
security

129
00:06:00,189 --> 00:06:03,349
uh... and back-end database curing clout
security

130
00:06:03,349 --> 00:06:05,989
amp so we don't just keep repeating the
cycle its

131
00:06:05,989 --> 00:06:08,839
you know what's what's i devote
motivational poster that

132
00:06:08,839 --> 00:06:11,400
it says you know failure only thing
consistent in

133
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,948
and your failures yourself

134
00:06:13,949 --> 00:06:15,180
and

135
00:06:15,180 --> 00:06:17,919
you know that we ought to keep doing
this we want to let's get some low

136
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:18,948
hanging fruit

137
00:06:18,949 --> 00:06:20,969
but spots along improvements

138
00:06:20,969 --> 00:06:24,859
what's all the police problems and move
on instead of

139
00:06:24,859 --> 00:06:28,469
and uncertain motor innovating we
innovate so quickly

140
00:06:28,469 --> 00:06:30,139
i can't tell if

141
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:32,819
secured promise a byproduct of
innovation

142
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:34,549
or is it just because

143
00:06:34,549 --> 00:06:37,919
breaking things is easy and solving
things as hard and by nature we we like

144
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,438
to do the immediate gratification thing

145
00:06:40,439 --> 00:06:43,759
so a lot just when you think about that
in tell me what you think of my crazy

146
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,759
might not crazy but this is something
i've been thinking about for years and i

147
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:48,709
want to finally

148
00:06:48,709 --> 00:06:54,359
talk about it a larger audience and see
what you have to say

149
00:06:54,359 --> 00:06:56,989
with that i'm going to

150
00:06:56,990 --> 00:06:59,159
introduce the introduce error

151
00:06:59,159 --> 00:07:03,020
of our keynote jane loop

152
00:07:03,020 --> 00:07:06,558
and that somebody put a lot of you are
do you know you've been in the industry

153
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:11,979
for a long time he's a serial
entrepreneur started many businesses

154
00:07:11,979 --> 00:07:15,188
some of them you may have heard of cc
mail verdi

155
00:07:15,189 --> 00:07:16,680
payment processing

156
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:19,199
accompany foley purports to

157
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,979
who is also over ten years ago started
quality sp

158
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:26,808
and it's interesting 'cause ten years
ago what it costs do they were obama

159
00:07:26,809 --> 00:07:30,189
bility susman company in nineteen ninety
nine

160
00:07:30,189 --> 00:07:33,379
and they started supporting this clip
shortly right after so for almost ten

161
00:07:33,379 --> 00:07:34,840
years they've been supporting

162
00:07:34,840 --> 00:07:37,899
black hat and the community at large

163
00:07:37,899 --> 00:07:41,770
and now twenty ten they've grown into

164
00:07:41,770 --> 00:07:45,109
that leader ninety security and
compliance management right we've added

165
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:49,089
on this management component to it and
now they've moved from uh... sort of

166
00:07:49,089 --> 00:07:50,649
uh... peanut and apt

167
00:07:50,649 --> 00:07:52,509
to uh... software-as-a-service

168
00:07:52,509 --> 00:07:56,129
they push out a lot of the stuff through
the cloud and they're really try to be

169
00:07:56,129 --> 00:07:59,580
an innovator of this security model

170
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,800
and um...

171
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,110
so with that said

172
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:05,509
i want to introduce believe courtroom

173
00:08:05,509 --> 00:08:12,509
thank you very much

174
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:21,909
okay thank you very very sorry for the
thank you for the use the insightful

175
00:08:21,909 --> 00:08:23,300
comments

176
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,999
good morning

177
00:08:24,999 --> 00:08:27,279
up black at uh...

178
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:30,799
which has different distorted about
thirteen years ago

179
00:08:30,799 --> 00:08:35,429
uh... when i was young and beautiful
like him

180
00:08:35,429 --> 00:08:36,739
the uh...

181
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:41,970
as i sincerely believe at has become the
most important events in our industry

182
00:08:41,970 --> 00:08:43,860
and this is very simply because

183
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:48,770
uh... it brings together the best mind
and i would say that most dedicated

184
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:51,410
the a researcher in security

185
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:55,360
i think today has it's very clear that

186
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:57,330
security

187
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:00,000
needs a significant community effort

188
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,870
it cannot be anymore if you companies
and a few are

189
00:09:04,870 --> 00:09:09,110
route g talented evp researchers to
solve the problem

190
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:14,400
i think it requires ptp obviously the
collaboration on the grill the state of

191
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,050
the industry

192
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:17,709
governments

193
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:20,890
and i think it's also very important
that

194
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:23,580
bay and we issue preferred leverage

195
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:26,880
the talent of the community

196
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,850
and that's obviously he's just said and
done

197
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:32,890
we need to provide the tools also for
the community

198
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:35,850
to essentially be capable of
collaborating

199
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:40,870
uh... you together and this is a
commitment of the what he stars

200
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:46,330
and with that in mind uh... it's a
really a unique privilege uniformity to

201
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:48,250
introducing our keynote

202
00:09:48,250 --> 00:09:49,660

she brings a very unique experience

204

talents not only to the work that you do

217
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:06,810
every day but to the work that we do
every day and homeland security

218
00:11:06,810 --> 00:11:12,530
i thought what i would talk about the
cause diane not of your community

219
00:11:12,530 --> 00:11:17,689
uh... a hundred and fifty years ago i
was a young signal officer in the army

220
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:20,010
who are right now you're out there

221
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:24,910
uh... iced down rock yeah thank you i
know you are out there

222
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:28,829
now i've got to do that so many might
see if you like i have no mike's

223
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:33,120
you know it's it's it's in experience
like this really something unusual you

224
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,990
know i'm going to march home and tell my
children

225
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:38,610
you know whenever you get that
ridiculous question of pia people ask

226
00:11:38,610 --> 00:11:42,090
you if you want to be in twenty years
tell 'em you don't know about wherever

227
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:45,690
it is your hope you're not limited to
what you can think of this moment

228
00:11:45,690 --> 00:11:49,130
because i can tell you twenty years ago
i would have never imagine myself

229
00:11:49,130 --> 00:11:50,910
standing here

230
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:54,420
but i thought i would talk about though
this morning is is the challenge that i

231
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,620
think we face we face it together

232
00:11:57,620 --> 00:12:02,400
what can be done about that challenge
and importantly who should do the work

233
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:07,459
i was struck twenty years ago as a young
officer in the military

234
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,380
hmmmwhen when the joint staff

235
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:14,660
came out with a document called joint
vision twenty ten

236
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:17,219
this was around nineteen ninety or so

237
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,560
uh... and it was

238
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:24,030
an expansive document about where the
military wanted to be in twenty years

239
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:25,669
and i had a real problem with it

240
00:12:25,669 --> 00:12:28,629
never basically what you have a problem
with joint there's a twenty cent it's

241
00:12:28,629 --> 00:12:30,210
missionaries in this great

242
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:34,199
but haven't you know there is no if
there's a jpg twenty ten

243
00:12:34,199 --> 00:12:36,990
but there's no end the twenty ten

244
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:39,940
there's no national vision twenty ten

245
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,820
so we have a military that knows where
wants to be in twenty years and we have

246
00:12:42,820 --> 00:12:46,960
a country that has not even asked itself
that question

247
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:49,960
but it seemed to me we needed to catch
up

248
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,950
and so what you think about what you
want to be in twenty years i suppose

249
00:12:52,950 --> 00:12:56,640
that the you know at the end of the day
you also need to think about

250
00:12:56,640 --> 00:13:00,660
how to get to the end of the day and you
need to think about where you are today

251
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:03,990
so where is the united states today what
is this country need at this moment in

252
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:05,260
its history

253
00:13:05,260 --> 00:13:08,230
man everybody will have an opinion on
that i'll give you mine

254
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:12,070
there's a country that need to safe and
secure homeland

255
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:15,690
where a country that need to dynamic
economic engine that can generate new

256
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:16,750
wealth

257
00:13:16,750 --> 00:13:19,060
where country that need strong

258
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,959
friends and neighbors

259
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,070
and were a friend where country that
needs predictable relations with others

260
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:27,710
at about the rule of law

261
00:13:27,710 --> 00:13:31,730
if these are the need to think we have
what is the role of cyber

262
00:13:31,730 --> 00:13:33,820
shabir space cyber security

263
00:13:33,820 --> 00:13:36,550
and helping to secure u_s_ interests

264
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,479
well secure them against what

265
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,060
what's a threatened

266
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:43,670
and i don't know it seems pretty
comprehensive to me you can steal ur

267
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:47,910
data you can steal ur identities you can
steal our past life and you can steal ur

268
00:13:47,910 --> 00:13:50,860
future opportunities

269
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:53,850
you can't it turns out threat though

270
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:56,040
if you never talk about things

271
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,620
as one of your colleagues said this
morning

272
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,500
you can't have a strategy of protection
you can have a strategy of the terence

273
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,770
if we don't ever talk to about

274
00:14:05,770 --> 00:14:08,310
and how we can understand it

275
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:11,780
how we can understand cyberspace

276
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:16,050
now cyberspace this commute your
community and homeland security my new

277
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,839
community has a lot in common

278
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:21,280
it a lot of brand name recognition
everybody's heard the term cyberspace

279
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:24,209
everybody's heard the term psycho
homeland security

280
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,759
not everybody knows

281
00:14:25,759 --> 00:14:28,600
what those two times for me

282
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:31,160
cyberspace zero war zone

283
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:32,800
to the marketplace

284
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,109
visitor neighborhood

285
00:14:34,110 --> 00:14:35,420
is it a school

286
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,030
a highway

287
00:14:37,030 --> 00:14:39,410
the do loop of lives combine

288
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:42,000
a playground sam box

289
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:43,460
the war zone

290
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:46,860
have a cyberspace in war zones compare

291
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:49,670
war zones wars happen somewhere

292
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:51,760
they involve somebody

293
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:53,270
geography is key

294
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:55,420
seizing and holding terrain

295
00:14:55,420 --> 00:14:58,040
force captain somewhere

296
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:01,199
cyberspace is sorted out this space-time
thing

297
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,120
nobody really gets it

298
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,260
sophomores

299
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:07,189
and lives

300
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:10,820
cyberspace nearly destroys them

301
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:13,880
war zones or all characterized

302
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,360
by a degree

303
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:18,370
to some extent or another of lawlessness

304
00:15:18,370 --> 00:15:20,460
no water

305
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,140
contested order

306
00:15:22,140 --> 00:15:23,480
alternative order

307
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,630
we're fighting about it

308
00:15:25,630 --> 00:15:28,210
cyberspace seems to be norm less

309
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:30,160
there's a difference

310
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:34,069
you know there are a lot of mythologies
about war

311
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,590
we say that if people are

312
00:15:36,590 --> 00:15:42,820
poor poverty contributes to violent
conflict

313
00:15:42,820 --> 00:15:44,130
does too

314
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:46,860
which people will kill each other

315
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,630
as well as poor people

316
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:52,820
we say that ethnicity contributes the
violence conflict

317
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:57,130
calling a conflict ethnic doesn't tell
you anything about why it's violent

318
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:00,050
it doesn't tell you anything about why
people are killing each other

319
00:16:00,050 --> 00:16:02,998
over their ethnic differences we need to
know more

320
00:16:02,999 --> 00:16:05,790
about why that is so

321
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:09,560
and fundamentally the greatest mythology
about war i suppose is that it's

322
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,380
inevitable

323
00:16:11,380 --> 00:16:13,480
wars not the weather

324
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:16,480
we should back like it is

325
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,820
so how many analogies for war

326
00:16:18,820 --> 00:16:20,329
or they're in cyberspace

327
00:16:20,329 --> 00:16:22,560
how should we think about cyberspace

328
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,219
and what can be done about the
challenges that that we face everyday

329
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:32,640
as jeff said we can access internet
weekend transit we can't shop

330
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:33,959
we campgrounds

331
00:16:33,959 --> 00:16:39,130
we can't communicate in a secure a way
that sounds pretty fundamental to me

332
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:41,030
but we do about it

333
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:44,939
again in homeland security we had these
challenges of building on the work of

334
00:16:44,940 --> 00:16:48,240
the first seven years in the creation of
the department

335
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,930
to have try and define what it means to
talk about

336
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:52,959
secure homeland

337
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:55,939
what does it mean again we had a lot of
brand name recognition

338
00:16:55,939 --> 00:17:00,009
but not many people do exactly what it
meant when you said

339
00:17:00,009 --> 00:17:01,720
homeland security

340
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:06,350
so throughout series of meetings out
beaches process sees

341
00:17:06,349 --> 00:17:09,369
and yes conversations

342
00:17:09,369 --> 00:17:10,729
conversations

343
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,630
we laid out a vision for homeland
security

344
00:17:13,630 --> 00:17:16,549
because as somebody once told me if you
don't know where you're going you're not

345
00:17:16,549 --> 00:17:18,050
likely to get there

346
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:21,889
so what we're trying to do and homeland
security

347
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:25,589
but we're trying to do is create a safe
secure brazilian place with the american

348
00:17:25,589 --> 00:17:27,270
way of life can thrive

349
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:30,590
that's the vision

350
00:17:30,590 --> 00:17:34,310
and these questions very fundamental how
do we do it

351
00:17:34,310 --> 00:17:35,899
what does it mean to be safe

352
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:38,870
what does it mean to be secure

353
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:41,760
we want the american way of life to
thrive

354
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:43,270
how we're going to do this

355
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:47,230
in the department we laid out five
essential missions for ourselves some

356
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:49,290
will be familiar someone new

357
00:17:49,290 --> 00:17:52,110
the five ascension missions are
fundamentally the first one which would

358
00:17:52,110 --> 00:17:56,570
be well known to you which is to prevent
another terrorist attack

359
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,149
prevent terrorist

360
00:17:58,150 --> 00:18:00,460
from again afflicting this country

361
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:03,210
the second mission is to secure our
borders

362
00:18:03,210 --> 00:18:06,660
and here you can begin to see the do
well in the of the homeland security

363
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:07,790
challenge

364
00:18:07,790 --> 00:18:12,220
because we don't only want to keep out
people in goods that might be dangerous

365
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:15,270
we wanna expedite legitimate trade and
travel

366
00:18:15,270 --> 00:18:19,039
because fundamentally the strength of
this country rests

367
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:23,490
on our ability to interact with the rest
of the world and to do so in safety and

368
00:18:23,490 --> 00:18:24,670
security

369
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:25,840
sewer first mission

370
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,439
is preventing terrorism

371
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,130
our second mission is securing our
borders

372
00:18:30,130 --> 00:18:33,550
the third mission is to enforce our
immigration laws

373
00:18:33,550 --> 00:18:37,250
the fourth mission that we laid out is
the cyber mission

374
00:18:37,250 --> 00:18:41,160
insuring the safety and security of
cyberspace

375
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:44,010
and a lot of people were surprised by
that

376
00:18:44,010 --> 00:18:45,720
maybe not this community

377
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,809
but a lot of people were surprised that
we thought it was a central

378
00:18:49,809 --> 00:18:53,580
to the security and safety and
resilience of the american public hand

379
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:56,149
that we have a safe secure and resilient

380
00:18:56,150 --> 00:18:57,009
cyberspace

381
00:18:57,009 --> 00:18:58,850
as well

382
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:01,799
and the fifth mission that we laid out
for ourselves

383
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:03,310
in homeland security

384
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:06,139
is to help build a resilient society

385
00:19:06,139 --> 00:19:11,750
a resilient public able to face all
threatened hazards that come our way

386
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:13,750
how are we going to do this

387
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:18,050
it's not enough simply to lay out a
vision witty one of the in twenty years

388
00:19:18,050 --> 00:19:19,770
you need a way to get there

389
00:19:19,770 --> 00:19:24,070
these five missions are are way within
each of them with identify goals it's a

390
00:19:24,070 --> 00:19:25,479
if we do this

391
00:19:25,479 --> 00:19:30,640
that means we are effective at
discharging these key missions

392
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,169
resilience

393
00:19:31,169 --> 00:19:34,260
what does it take to have a resilient
society

394
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:38,790
it takes in powered individuals capable
communities and yes in the responsive

395
00:19:38,790 --> 00:19:39,720
federal system

396
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:43,690
it's not impossible to achieve

397
00:19:43,690 --> 00:19:45,059
and we do this

398
00:19:45,059 --> 00:19:46,800
based on the simple principles

399
00:19:46,800 --> 00:19:48,470
of security

400
00:19:48,470 --> 00:19:51,290
resilience an exchange with the rest of
the world

401
00:19:51,290 --> 00:19:53,649
it's not about building borders

402
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,570
better impenetrable

403
00:19:55,570 --> 00:19:59,409
it's about interchange with the rest of
the world but doing all of these things

404
00:19:59,410 --> 00:20:03,250
for homeland security will really
require that we think differently about

405
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:06,760
ourselves and about our tools

406
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:10,400
cyber is called out as a separate
mission for homeland security

407
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,490
but in order for us to create the safe
and secure cyber environment we have to

408
00:20:14,490 --> 00:20:16,500
say dist define

409
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,809
cyber strategic space

410
00:20:18,809 --> 00:20:23,210
and here i see two very important
shaping trends

411
00:20:23,210 --> 00:20:27,799
that air-conditioning our understanding
and access to the strategic space within

412
00:20:27,799 --> 00:20:29,920
which cyber operates

413
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,000
and the first trend is this trend of
technology

414
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,190
perhaps not what you might expect

415
00:20:35,190 --> 00:20:37,409
but the other colleges tell us

416
00:20:37,409 --> 00:20:40,490
technology is putting tools within our
grasp

417
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:45,170
and the current trend is the technology
is exceeding our grass

418
00:20:45,170 --> 00:20:48,299
it is way far out in front

419
00:20:48,299 --> 00:20:49,260
society's ability

420
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:51,260
to understand adapt

421
00:20:51,260 --> 00:20:53,390
and it just some people say

422
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:55,160
i don't know if that's true

423
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:59,750
but we certainly feel as a society that
we are lagging behind the frontiers of

424
00:20:59,750 --> 00:21:02,710
technology that you deal with every day

425
00:21:02,710 --> 00:21:04,660
how long can we stand

426
00:21:04,660 --> 00:21:08,140
and what may be lighting even further
behind where our social sensibilities

427
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,950
have located us at this moment

428
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,060
our our laws

429
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:14,168
now we know that laws are always a
lagging indicator

430
00:21:14,169 --> 00:21:17,219
there are resting judgment that society
comes to

431
00:21:17,219 --> 00:21:19,110
what he confronts its problems

432
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:22,649
touch with the long reflects it
anticipates the familiar but so much

433
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:26,570
that's happening in technology is
unfamiliar to so many of us

434
00:21:26,570 --> 00:21:29,939
how long can we stand

435
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:32,040
the second trend that i see

436
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:35,300
is that there is a normative convergence

437
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,870
emerging in the world i spent most of my
life

438
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:42,610
and internationally international field
farm policy international relations

439
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:44,649
war conflict

440
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:47,360
conflict resolution war termination

441
00:21:47,360 --> 00:21:50,850
how do you rebuild a society after war
has destroyed it

442
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:54,439
and i see very clearly a normative
convergence emerging not only within our

443
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,240
own society but around the world

444
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:00,690
and that normative convergence is
centering around three things

445
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:02,820
expectations of transparency

446
00:22:02,820 --> 00:22:04,370
expectations of inclusive iti

447
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:07,219
and expectations of reciprocity

448
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:08,620
what are we going to do

449
00:22:08,620 --> 00:22:10,750
about those emerging norms

450
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:16,260
how can we abap uses of technology which
seemed to be exceeding our grasp

451
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:19,360
and the whole definition of technology
to to begin with

452
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:22,919
was defined as tools within your grasp

453
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:27,360
how do we craft this strategy that
permits the fullest exploitation of

454
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:30,280
technology while ensuring our safety

455
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:32,850
how would we historically insured our
safety

456
00:22:32,850 --> 00:22:35,439
by location

457
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:38,470
location was the dominant security
strategy

458
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:38,850
poem

459
00:22:38,850 --> 00:22:40,310
no longer

460
00:22:40,310 --> 00:22:44,149
you know it's it's interesting the state
system was formed in sixteen forty eight

461
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:48,180
so sovereigns could protect its citizens
from abroad and outsiders

462
00:22:48,180 --> 00:22:51,730
and in many places around the world
where citizens need the protection of

463
00:22:51,730 --> 00:22:55,140
outsiders from marauding sovereigns

464
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:55,670
location

465
00:22:55,670 --> 00:22:58,480
is no longer your ticket to safety

466
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,040
in cyberspace petition may be irrelevant

467
00:23:02,040 --> 00:23:06,730
in cyberspace power has no beginning and
no obvious and

468
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:09,060
tied to feel secure and what you know

469
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,419
tied to feel secure in where yaar

470
00:23:11,420 --> 00:23:15,330
it's hard to feel secure include you all

471
00:23:15,330 --> 00:23:17,919
so what is the purpose of cyber security

472
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,370
create a safe secure resilient place

473
00:23:20,370 --> 00:23:22,719
where we can thrive

474
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:27,110
secure are information and secure our
identity

475
00:23:27,110 --> 00:23:30,399
and promote the kind of awareness
innovation

476
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:34,590
and shared understanding that make us
all better off

477
00:23:34,590 --> 00:23:38,340
itachi this i think we have to depart
from the romantic notion of cyberspace

478
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:40,320
is the wild wild west

479
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:44,770
or the scary notion a cyberspace as a
combat zone

480
00:23:44,770 --> 00:23:46,330
there is a new reality

481
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:47,470
have security

482
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:50,960
of conflicts and of relationships

483
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,200
there's a contest right now

484
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,039
for the corner on the market in the
three key areas that used to define the

485
00:23:56,039 --> 00:23:59,460
role of governments the control of
lethality the control of capital in the

486
00:23:59,460 --> 00:24:02,710
control abril making

487
00:24:02,710 --> 00:24:04,890
mep hours going somewhere

488
00:24:04,890 --> 00:24:07,380
is going into private hands

489
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,490
and these changes have been fuel

490
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:13,930
by the expansion of the domain of
cyberspace

491
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,770
so what is the core question

492
00:24:15,770 --> 00:24:17,650
what will we do with this power

493
00:24:17,650 --> 00:24:19,180
in cyberspace

494
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:22,630
how will it be governed what will the
rules pete would there be rules there

495
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:24,360
will be rules

496
00:24:24,360 --> 00:24:27,049
there will be rules

497
00:24:27,049 --> 00:24:31,900
can we still hope to rely on trusted in
each other

498
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:35,930
trust in our actions in our intentions
and artifacts

499
00:24:35,930 --> 00:24:37,080
fiber spaces

500
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,060
being built on and then secure platform
to begin with

501
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:43,169
and from a governments and yes it legal
perspective

502
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:45,230
we're playing catch-up

503
00:24:45,230 --> 00:24:48,930
the goal here is not control its
confidence

504
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,840
we want to expedite the good

505
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:54,970
by preventing excluding impeding the bad

506
00:24:54,970 --> 00:24:57,390
not like the wild wild west

507
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:01,020
not a jungle out there there are no
perfect metaphor some people speak about

508
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,879
cyberspace is a global comments

509
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:07,840
uh... cyberspace seems more to me like
light

510
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,110
rather than air

511
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:13,629
it's available to all of us there are no
pets a perfect metaphor as there are no

512
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:16,980
good his historical analogies

513
00:25:16,980 --> 00:25:21,710
we may deliver some say in a just
article times i don't know

514
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:24,560
but some say we need to build now

515
00:25:24,560 --> 00:25:25,470
ecosystem

516
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:26,200
four

517
00:25:26,200 --> 00:25:31,090
the healthy enjoyment the healthy use by
all of us

518
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:34,429
do we need a culture of preparedness in
this environment

519
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:37,210
do we need a culture of resilience

520
00:25:37,210 --> 00:25:40,440
do we need a culture of prevention

521
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:42,650
i've spent a lot of my life

522
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:45,110
sinking and writing

523
00:25:45,110 --> 00:25:48,479
and being around conflict and war

524
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:52,500
the nineteen ninety-four i had
extraordinary privilege

525
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,940
of associating

526
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:56,969
with doctor david hamburg from carnegie
corporation of new york at the time and

527
00:25:56,969 --> 00:25:59,350
cyrus vance former u_s_

528
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:01,230
secretary of state

529
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:06,050
and a group of individuals who were
determined that we could do more to

530
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:07,620
prevent the outbreak

531
00:26:07,620 --> 00:26:10,159
of mass violence this spread

532
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:14,210
the renewal of mass violence once peace
has been achieved

533
00:26:14,210 --> 00:26:16,100
and we were going to do this

534
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,219
by thinking about

535
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:21,910
how we could create a preferred
environment rather than just avoid

536
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,470
bad alternatives

537
00:26:23,470 --> 00:26:26,760
so if you want to prevent people from
killing each other we need to create

538
00:26:26,760 --> 00:26:28,670
capable societies

539
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,800
societies that have representative
governance market economic activity

540
00:26:31,800 --> 00:26:35,030
robust civil society based on the rule
of law

541
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:39,710
if you want to prevent the spread of
conflict you need to create fire breaks

542
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:43,450
and if you want to create could prevent
the renewal of violence once a peace has

543
00:26:43,450 --> 00:26:44,440
been achieved

544
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:47,740
you need to create space

545
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:49,590
physical and political space

546
00:26:49,590 --> 00:26:52,699
so that peaceful efforts can succeed

547
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:56,679
the culture of prevention is one they've
built on an affirmative vision of the

548
00:26:56,679 --> 00:26:58,920
future

549
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,600
creating a better place

550
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:05,490
when the department of homeland security
want to stimulate a responsible debate

551
00:27:05,490 --> 00:27:06,780
about cyberspace

552
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:09,170
we want to participate in that debate

553
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:11,540
we want to debate on the rules of the
road

554
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:14,110
about governance how do we get it right

555
00:27:14,110 --> 00:27:15,959
what is government's role here

556
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,890
what needs doing

557
00:27:17,890 --> 00:27:20,010
and homeland security been very busy

558
00:27:20,010 --> 00:27:21,610
and cyber security

559
00:27:21,610 --> 00:27:24,580
we've identified the cyber mission as a
central

560
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:27,610
to building a safe secure resilient
place for the american way of life can

561
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:28,959
thrive

562
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:32,320
we've instituted a national cyber
challenge because we believe education

563
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,270
is important it's essential

564
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:39,260
and all the good ideas out there have
not even been thought up yet

565
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:43,210
we're developing a national price and
cyber incident response plan that will

566
00:27:43,210 --> 00:27:44,780
test in the fall

567
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:49,340
would apply nine sign to throughout the
dock of space standing up and kick

568
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:53,689
put that in advancing a trusted identity
strategy in cyberspace weekend

569
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:54,560
find a way

570
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,399
to secure ourselves

571
00:27:56,400 --> 00:27:59,540
this country can be safe

572
00:27:59,540 --> 00:28:02,360
we can protect our privacy and our
rights

573
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:05,860
we can't let open markets flourish

574
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:10,120
but we certainly in the department don't
believe we have all the answers

575
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:13,040
so it's a drag when you meet somebody
who's already knows everything he's ever

576
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,620
heard

577
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:16,489
asada

578
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:18,340
what will guide us

579
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:21,020
well our expertise guide us

580
00:28:21,020 --> 00:28:23,180
well our experience guide us

581
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:26,930
do we know the difference between our
experience in our expertise

582
00:28:26,930 --> 00:28:29,720
by the way expertise is knowing the
conditions under which ur experience is

583
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,920
relevant

584
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:34,850
can we tell the difference

585
00:28:34,850 --> 00:28:39,760
do we have the courage to challenge the
assumptions and explode the myths

586
00:28:39,760 --> 00:28:43,399
i've talked about a few of the mess that
i've experienced in my life

587
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:46,550
about war

588
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:48,510
billions of dollars have been spent

589
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:51,110
in cyberspace and as jeff mentioned

590
00:28:51,110 --> 00:28:54,209
yet none of the most fundamental
problems

591
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:56,110
of our experience in cyberspace

592
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,550
have been fixed

593
00:28:57,550 --> 00:29:01,158
he can access c_ cancer-free can transit
you can't shop

594
00:29:01,159 --> 00:29:02,690
he can talk

595
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:04,230
securely

596
00:29:04,230 --> 00:29:06,590
fundamental

597
00:29:06,590 --> 00:29:08,070
the administration

598
00:29:08,070 --> 00:29:10,290
is seeking to build a strategy

599
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:14,070
to help insure the cyber security of
this nation

600
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:18,360
it's enormously exciting to get a
challenge on this scale

601
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,070
doesn't happen

602
00:29:19,070 --> 00:29:19,980
all the time

603
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,150
in your life

604
00:29:22,150 --> 00:29:26,360
exciting to be working with people who
are at the cutting edge of the airfield

605
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:30,429
and who recognize that we all have a
role to play

606
00:29:30,430 --> 00:29:31,320
this is where

607
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,770
you won't commit

608
00:29:33,770 --> 00:29:34,690
help us

609
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:36,250
not to be destined

610
00:29:36,250 --> 00:29:38,659
to tackle these

611
00:29:38,659 --> 00:29:40,039
largest questions

612
00:29:40,039 --> 00:29:43,710
with most narrow approaches

613
00:29:43,710 --> 00:29:44,750
giasbm

614
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:49,130
as our constitution diffuses power

615
00:29:49,130 --> 00:29:52,190
in order to concentrate this nation
strength

616
00:29:52,190 --> 00:29:56,620
it will take the efforts of all of us to
ensure the security of each of us now i

617
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:58,300
am often passed

618
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,820
you've spent your whole career in
national security and now you're in

619
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:04,939
homeland security what's the difference
there a lot of differences

620
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:09,990
national security is about all of us
homeland security is about each of us

621
00:30:09,990 --> 00:30:14,370
national security is strategic
centralize top driven

622
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:19,459
homeland security is operational
decentralized bottom driven

623
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:24,400
driven from the grassroots driven from
the experience of individual human being

624
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:27,610
problems a national security scale on
the wholesale and

625
00:30:27,610 --> 00:30:29,600
they involve us all

626
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:33,459
homeland security challenges in problem
scale on the retail and each of us is

627
00:30:33,460 --> 00:30:34,690
affecting

628
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:38,030
these two of course connect

629
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:42,100
but we need strategies to deal with
problems in the homeland

630
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:44,370
and we need help

631
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:45,360
i'm told it

632
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:46,459
your community

633
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:49,680
has very good taste when it comes to
ideas

634
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,030
i've tried to offer a few

635
00:30:52,030 --> 00:30:54,590
i'm told that you're driven

636
00:30:54,590 --> 00:30:56,340
i wonder

637
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:59,389
among you can you tell the difference is
between the drivers

638
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,630
and the driven

639
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:02,850
my world

640
00:31:02,850 --> 00:31:03,709
it's important

641
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:06,590
to make that distinction

642
00:31:06,590 --> 00:31:08,379
pollsters tell us that today

643
00:31:08,380 --> 00:31:11,600
the country's about evenly divided about
a lot of things

644
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:15,590
so so many things forty eight percent
this fifty two percent at

645
00:31:15,590 --> 00:31:18,799
this is a climate that permits many
ideas

646
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:21,990
but it's also a climate that compels few

647
00:31:21,990 --> 00:31:24,470
so we might as well have the sax
satisfaction

648
00:31:24,470 --> 00:31:28,610
of thinking the hard thoughts and of
doing what is right

649
00:31:28,610 --> 00:31:29,889
my parents

650
00:31:29,890 --> 00:31:31,380
perhaps yours

651
00:31:31,380 --> 00:31:36,200
come from the greatest generation i
think you are the ablest

652
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,640
generation

653
00:31:37,640 --> 00:31:39,430
educated healthy

654
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:41,890
smart

655
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:42,740
highly mobile

656
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:43,810
and connected

657
00:31:43,810 --> 00:31:45,659
and deeply concerned

658
00:31:45,660 --> 00:31:47,960
about your fellow man

659
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:51,860
we live in an age when we know before
victims do that they'll be victims

660
00:31:51,860 --> 00:31:55,319
we live in and age when we know before
victims too

661
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:57,680
that they will be victims

662
00:31:57,680 --> 00:32:00,800
but we do about what we know

663
00:32:00,800 --> 00:32:03,080
well a hundred years ago

664
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:05,340
what'd people do about what they knew

665
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:08,270
in nineteen ten

666
00:32:08,270 --> 00:32:08,960
churchill

667
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:11,410
was thirty six years old

668
00:32:11,410 --> 00:32:15,170
franklin roosevelt was twenty eight

669
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:18,300
gandhi which forty one

670
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:23,940
mao tse tung was seventeen and she
robert oppenheimer was six

671
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:27,030
what do you do about what you know how
much time

672
00:32:27,030 --> 00:32:30,460
do we have to make the difference

673
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:32,770
ours is a very special democracy

674
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:35,310
it's born of a very deep belief

675
00:32:35,310 --> 00:32:37,850
in the corporate civil suits your to
managing

676
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:39,330
and and obligation

677
00:32:39,330 --> 00:32:42,289
to value human worth

678
00:32:42,289 --> 00:32:46,360
ours is a democracy that has been
enriched by the cultures of all the

679
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,070
world

680
00:32:47,070 --> 00:32:50,830
and fueled by the ideas of the
courageous

681
00:32:50,830 --> 00:32:53,360
built by the energy of the youth

682
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:57,570
this is our present at the creation
moment

683
00:32:57,570 --> 00:32:58,970
if you talk to people

684
00:32:58,970 --> 00:33:02,710
who do research on the brain they will
tell you this is their renaissance let's

685
00:33:02,710 --> 00:33:05,420
make it alice

686
00:33:05,420 --> 00:33:08,800
what is the vision that you see

687
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:11,770
what is the vision that you see

688
00:33:11,770 --> 00:33:14,560
i know what i want to see

689
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,080
but as i think

690
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:18,050
ernest hemingway said

691
00:33:18,050 --> 00:33:20,200
when you know what you want to say next

692
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,390
it's time to stop

693
00:33:22,390 --> 00:33:29,390
thank you very much

694
00:33:32,030 --> 00:33:32,820
fantastic

695
00:33:32,820 --> 00:33:36,700
yes

696
00:33:36,700 --> 00:33:40,570
thank you very much so i was obsolete
fantastic

697
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:42,830
just the kind of vision that i hope

698
00:33:42,830 --> 00:33:46,500
will be seen out of ths another
government andes because

699
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,290
we need to have this conversation

700
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:50,190
it's very refreshing to see

701
00:33:50,190 --> 00:33:53,200
cd knowledge so that i am a grand scale

702
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,170
so we have a couple of uh... kind of
softball questions to get things going

703
00:33:56,170 --> 00:34:00,060
on we're going to go to the audience so
not cut a couple of these out that uh...

704
00:34:00,060 --> 00:34:03,690
the chain dealt with already

705
00:34:03,690 --> 00:34:07,179
and kind of get maybe a little policy
here with with the relatively recent

706
00:34:07,179 --> 00:34:09,639
creation of the u_s_ cyber command

707
00:34:09,639 --> 00:34:12,669
where you see the responsibilities of
security being divided in this probably

708
00:34:12,668 --> 00:34:16,649
goes to the homeland security versus
national security

709
00:34:16,649 --> 00:34:18,058
division you're talking about

710
00:34:18,059 --> 00:34:20,419
and where the overlapping
responsibilities that need to be

711
00:34:20,418 --> 00:34:22,049
addressed

712
00:34:22,049 --> 00:34:24,960
so and and now homeland security an egg

713
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,179
economic defense background

714
00:34:26,179 --> 00:34:29,720
now homeland security's been given
responsibility for securing the dot gov

715
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,598
domain

716
00:34:30,599 --> 00:34:33,950
mind working very closely with the
private sector on securing dot com we

717
00:34:33,949 --> 00:34:35,448
intend to do that

718
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:39,049
harm they've division for homeland
security as i mentioned is to ensure a

719
00:34:39,049 --> 00:34:40,949
safe secure resilient place

720
00:34:40,949 --> 00:34:43,960
for the american way of life can five
the department of defense

721
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:47,940
has the responsibility for homeland
defense humbly work very closely but we

722
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,579
see clear differences

723
00:34:49,579 --> 00:34:50,259
and then

724
00:34:50,259 --> 00:34:52,659
uh... and then how do you see the states

725
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:54,919
in this picture

726
00:34:54,918 --> 00:34:56,429
you know it's uh...

727
00:34:56,429 --> 00:35:00,969
one of the extraordinary things about
homeland security now

728
00:35:00,969 --> 00:35:03,959
especially for the department of
homeland security you need a homeland

729
00:35:03,959 --> 00:35:05,089
sensibility

730
00:35:05,089 --> 00:35:06,279
home and we talk

731
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:10,319
now about in the context of homeland
security about the enterprise

732
00:35:10,319 --> 00:35:13,689
we don't think that government can do
all that needs doing we don't think the

733
00:35:13,689 --> 00:35:15,288
department can do all that needs doing

734
00:35:15,289 --> 00:35:18,689
we think there is important and vital

735
00:35:18,689 --> 00:35:25,118
state local municipal tribal in inputs
that need to contribute to our over the

736
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:26,499
security of all of us

737
00:35:26,499 --> 00:35:28,698
hum so that a key role

738
00:35:28,699 --> 00:35:33,279
and then you're talking about sort of
uh... laws as a as a trailing indicator

739
00:35:33,279 --> 00:35:35,849
band so right now we're operating
environment where there is a mismatch

740
00:35:35,849 --> 00:35:41,229
between current legislation and sort of
uh... facts on the ground as it is

741
00:35:41,229 --> 00:35:44,729
at what point you see them started
converge work we're starting to see

742
00:35:44,729 --> 00:35:47,089
loss proposed in the house and senate

743
00:35:47,089 --> 00:35:51,558
and everybody's got a cyber security
bill or something

744
00:35:51,559 --> 00:35:54,799
but you know laws of the rushed about
this or that most well-informed laws and

745
00:35:54,799 --> 00:35:59,330
so d_c_ this is like a five year ten
year transitional period or or

746
00:35:59,330 --> 00:36:02,720
uh... how do you see this played out
that the tradition of line our country

747
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:05,169
is an extraordinary thing

748
00:36:05,169 --> 00:36:09,709
calm and and the best legal minds will
tell you that law anticipates the

749
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:10,649
familiar

750
00:36:10,649 --> 00:36:11,828
uh...

751
00:36:11,829 --> 00:36:15,390
you know we've been here before maybe
add not exactly in this way and with

752
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:18,769
these actors but we have bit we've
encountered these circumstances before

753
00:36:18,769 --> 00:36:20,658
as a society

754
00:36:20,659 --> 00:36:24,339
making laws is one of the most
stabilizing attributes of our society as

755
00:36:24,339 --> 00:36:26,759
well it's a transparent process

756
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:30,809
people know how it's made will it take
time of course will take time

757
00:36:30,809 --> 00:36:33,869
at the print predictability in the
ability to anticipated

758
00:36:33,869 --> 00:36:39,369
businesses to make decisions is sorry ki
chaotic environment how can you plan

759
00:36:39,369 --> 00:36:42,630
america there are contracting aspects of
the law there are property aspects of

760
00:36:42,630 --> 00:36:43,940
the law as well

761
00:36:43,940 --> 00:36:47,830
and so we need to know what we mean when
we say ait om this

762
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:53,259
now this is mind what about resuming in
this context we need to have this

763
00:36:53,260 --> 00:36:53,930
conversation

764
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:57,259
a and in india is cyberspace where

765
00:36:57,259 --> 00:37:01,229
the ideas that a little property or or
virtual their synthetic

766
00:37:01,229 --> 00:37:04,609
in the concept of intellectual property
sale united states the west world

767
00:37:04,609 --> 00:37:08,420
compared to other cultures they don't
share that kind of belief in the value

768
00:37:08,420 --> 00:37:10,769
of intellectual property potentially
there's

769
00:37:10,769 --> 00:37:13,229
i guess that's for the international
governing bodies have to be if you're

770
00:37:13,229 --> 00:37:14,989
gonna go normative

771
00:37:14,989 --> 00:37:19,279
there needs to be a common dialogue or a
comment uh... set of expectations

772
00:37:19,279 --> 00:37:25,889
and did so how much does ths drive
better inform our international

773
00:37:25,889 --> 00:37:26,599
wellhead at

774
00:37:26,599 --> 00:37:30,930
as i mentioned you know the united
states exists as a leader in a dynamic

775
00:37:30,930 --> 00:37:34,299
world where relationships are forming
everyday

776
00:37:34,299 --> 00:37:38,390
hum or ideas are commerce are in a
change we are still

777
00:37:38,390 --> 00:37:41,890
in many ways the most attractive place
on the planning to come

778
00:37:41,890 --> 00:37:45,930
right pinto this puts a different
meaning to our borders

779
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,250
home and they put

780
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:50,699
the different burden on our ideas and on
the way

781
00:37:50,699 --> 00:37:55,099
we share them around the world by-laws
will only be one reflection of how we

782
00:37:55,099 --> 00:37:57,759
resolve those questions

783
00:37:57,759 --> 00:37:58,789
well thank you very much

784
00:37:58,789 --> 00:38:02,129
where to go to some questions in the
audience thanks

785
00:38:02,129 --> 00:38:07,078
so if we can bring up the lights

786
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:10,799
they can bring up the house white so i
can actually see people

787
00:38:10,799 --> 00:38:14,239
uh... and then well

788
00:38:14,239 --> 00:38:18,879
related who is that okay you've got one
other

789
00:38:18,879 --> 00:38:25,879
that marcus

790
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:27,839
tightened

791
00:38:27,839 --> 00:38:32,029
we seem to have a really good ability to
be galvanized into action after

792
00:38:32,029 --> 00:38:32,659
catastrophe

793
00:38:32,659 --> 00:38:34,609
pearl harbor nine eleven

794
00:38:34,609 --> 00:38:37,890
and after that we move very quickly

795
00:38:37,890 --> 00:38:39,788
to try to accomplish things

796
00:38:39,789 --> 00:38:46,129
do you think that we are going to be
able to do what we need to do

797
00:38:46,129 --> 00:38:52,400
a cyber catastrophe or in homeland
security at the water cooler

798
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:53,739
pierce a

799
00:38:53,739 --> 00:38:56,159
this is a matter of time before
something horrible happens and that's

800
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:57,979
what we're going to need

801
00:38:57,979 --> 00:39:03,598
do what we actually need to do instead
of just talk about what needs to be done

802
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,269
it although i don't have a person who
believes that this country can protect

803
00:39:06,269 --> 00:39:07,910
itself

804
00:39:07,910 --> 00:39:12,589
mohammed person who believes in the
extraordinary talent my dears expertise

805
00:39:12,589 --> 00:39:15,549
energy and commitment of the american
people

806
00:39:15,549 --> 00:39:16,979
some people talk about that

807
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:19,229
some people think it's inevitable

808
00:39:19,229 --> 00:39:21,069
that we will face

809
00:39:21,069 --> 00:39:22,599
bheji unthinkable

810
00:39:22,599 --> 00:39:24,129
haw i don't know

811
00:39:24,129 --> 00:39:28,049
i have a small child i don't know what's
inevitable

812
00:39:28,049 --> 00:39:30,939
and i think it anybody who lived through
the events of nineteen eighty nine if

813
00:39:30,939 --> 00:39:33,928
you live through the events of two
thousand one you've lost the right to

814
00:39:33,929 --> 00:39:36,229
say anything some possible

815
00:39:36,229 --> 00:39:39,410
so what will we make possible

816
00:39:39,410 --> 00:39:41,899
what will we do with what we know

817
00:39:41,900 --> 00:39:46,869
in order to deal with what we don't know

818
00:39:46,869 --> 00:39:49,299
another question

819
00:39:49,299 --> 00:39:52,939
okay will do one more regional jumps the
other side of the room

820
00:39:52,939 --> 00:39:56,769
wizard throwing stink you know and
slightly concerned and that

821
00:39:56,769 --> 00:40:00,848
the amount of specifics we've got coming
down the line don't seem to be that

822
00:40:00,849 --> 00:40:01,729
concrete

823
00:40:01,729 --> 00:40:05,368
um... there's a little of good talk
about how we should skewl things how we

824
00:40:05,369 --> 00:40:07,000
should get along things but

825
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,389
at the same time the actual

826
00:40:09,389 --> 00:40:14,009
driving force behind that doesn't seem
that strong could not be pushed forward

827
00:40:14,009 --> 00:40:17,339
you know and i have spent their that had
wanted new phrase will at least here you

828
00:40:17,339 --> 00:40:21,369
know a serial entrepreneur and i'm a
serial public service

829
00:40:21,369 --> 00:40:24,999
calm and in the public sector what you
learned is there isn't a lot of should

830
00:40:24,999 --> 00:40:27,638
there's a lot of the eight or did not

831
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:29,069
but you do

832
00:40:29,069 --> 00:40:30,799
budget failed to do

833
00:40:30,799 --> 00:40:32,929
you and help you make of the difference

834
00:40:32,929 --> 00:40:37,169
i don't think there is any question that
the administration is committee

835
00:40:37,169 --> 00:40:37,969
committee

836
00:40:37,969 --> 00:40:40,159
to elevating cyberspace

837
00:40:40,159 --> 00:40:43,999
the challenges of cyber security to
everyone's awareness and consciousness

838
00:40:43,999 --> 00:40:46,149
education is key here how do we do it

839
00:40:46,150 --> 00:40:51,359
we've launched cyber challenges in order
to promote more learning more sharing

840
00:40:51,359 --> 00:40:52,880
that new information

841
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:56,069
coming in to solve practical problems
it's only a piece of the puzzle it's

842
00:40:56,069 --> 00:40:58,649
only the beginning of the effort

843
00:40:58,649 --> 00:41:03,049
but we are committed to doing whatever
we can to harness the energy ideas and

844
00:41:03,049 --> 00:41:04,509
commitment of this group

845
00:41:04,509 --> 00:41:07,900
palmer into the public sector into
public service

846
00:41:07,900 --> 00:41:11,289
for the purposes of cyber security i
mention what we're doing on einstein tee

847
00:41:11,289 --> 00:41:12,700
let me ask colleagues here

848
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:15,489
i can talk to you about the other
programs standing up

849
00:41:15,489 --> 00:41:18,510
a national cyber incident response

850
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:23,930
capability standing up a star incident
center to be able to respond immediately

851
00:41:23,930 --> 00:41:29,049
these may be gestures in your mind we
view them as important steps down the

852
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:33,099
path of creating the secure cyber
environment

853
00:41:33,099 --> 00:41:35,920
who will take another question for the
side of the room

854
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:39,970
and then will

855
00:41:39,970 --> 00:41:42,698
we've got another ok go ahead

856
00:41:42,699 --> 00:41:46,769
when you're speaking about homeland
security priorities you had immigration

857
00:41:46,769 --> 00:41:48,240
above cyber security

858
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:52,629
are considering the second should be
immigration issue in this country and

859
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:58,479
the priority and how much howell march
the impact is with cyber arkin u

860
00:41:58,479 --> 00:42:01,269
share with the rationale behind that
prioritisation

861
00:42:01,269 --> 00:42:05,178
that's not a list of priorities shin
serology centrelink eight

862
00:42:05,179 --> 00:42:09,499
harmed by the components of the whole
dot

863
00:42:09,499 --> 00:42:13,669
okay that was a quick question let's try
another one

864
00:42:13,669 --> 00:42:20,669
i believe this gentleman over here

865
00:42:22,269 --> 00:42:25,868
given the department of homeland
security's creation of g_s_a_ which has

866
00:42:25,869 --> 00:42:29,619
been mocked by not only the united
states security profession but the whole

867
00:42:29,619 --> 00:42:30,789
world

868
00:42:30,789 --> 00:42:34,969
why should we believe that the addresses
going forward is going to protect

869
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:38,349
sideburns in something other than the
same way that

870
00:42:38,349 --> 00:42:43,209
now as to yesterday's slows down here
travel ths will now in the cyberspace

871
00:42:43,209 --> 00:42:50,209
from slowdown both commerce in the
exchange of knowledge

872
00:42:52,609 --> 00:42:55,440
crippled surprise you to learn that i
differ from your packed with your

873
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:57,710
characters a shitty essay

874
00:42:57,710 --> 00:43:01,619
of

875
00:43:01,619 --> 00:43:04,989
you know there is a there is a tension
into ality in homeland security as i

876
00:43:04,989 --> 00:43:06,649
mentioned on the board a mission

877
00:43:06,649 --> 00:43:10,069
we want to keep our people and goods
that might be dangerous but we need to

878
00:43:10,069 --> 00:43:11,060
expedite

879
00:43:11,060 --> 00:43:13,629
legitimate trading travel

880
00:43:13,629 --> 00:43:16,709
that's essential for the security of
this country it's a challenge that

881
00:43:16,709 --> 00:43:18,859
exists here we happen to believe

882
00:43:18,859 --> 00:43:23,288
that we can achieve our security we can
protect our rights

883
00:43:23,289 --> 00:43:25,199
weekend promote commerce

884
00:43:25,199 --> 00:43:28,100
unlawful interchange we can have all of
these things

885
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:32,560
but we need to engage in a debate about
how we will prioritize and how we will

886
00:43:32,560 --> 00:43:33,850
strike a balance

887
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:37,429
and the department is determined to be a
portal for that debate you know

888
00:43:37,429 --> 00:43:40,499
society seems to have a conversation
with themselves through their

889
00:43:40,499 --> 00:43:41,499
governments

890
00:43:41,499 --> 00:43:45,109
in many respects we're not talking to
each other anymore

891
00:43:45,109 --> 00:43:46,390
in many respects

892
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:49,949
we're throwing assertions back and forth
at each other

893
00:43:49,949 --> 00:43:52,440
and seeing who has the more clever
retort

894
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:56,560
who has thought of the newer idea we
need to have all these ideas we need to

895
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:01,440
extract them through our own experience
to understand wadi is we will do about

896
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,799
the problems that we face

897
00:44:03,799 --> 00:44:05,970
and that's why the termination

898
00:44:05,970 --> 00:44:07,848
whether its border security

899
00:44:07,849 --> 00:44:08,789
whether it's

900
00:44:08,789 --> 00:44:12,249
cyber security as well

901
00:44:12,249 --> 00:44:14,928
for the sake of uh... ten lupo

902
00:44:14,929 --> 00:44:15,409
round of applause
