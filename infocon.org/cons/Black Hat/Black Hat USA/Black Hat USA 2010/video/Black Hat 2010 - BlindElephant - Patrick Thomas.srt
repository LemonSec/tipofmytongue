this is the<font color="#CCCCCC"> malware fingerprinting track</font>

2
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,410
for you in the audience<font color="#E5E5E5"> just in case</font>

00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:09,129
here make sure you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the right place</font>

00:00:05,410 --> 00:00:11,620
I have the privilege today of

5
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:13,150
introducing Patrick Thomas and I say

6
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:14,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">privilege because this is one of the</font>

7
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,730
sessions I was going to come to

8
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,680
regardless<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether I was proctoring or</font>

9
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:20,440
not so glad<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys could make</font>

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:24,310
it today's presentation is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the white</font>

00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:29,230
elephant license what blind elephant

12
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:30,400
blind elfin excuse me for we going to

13
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:31,660

15
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:41,649
Patrick and I'll let him introduce a

16
00:00:33,789 --> 00:00:44,260
Tory I totally should have seen that

17
00:00:41,649 --> 00:00:46,210
coming when I named<font color="#E5E5E5"> something blind elf</font>

18
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:47,799
and it's it's going to be white elephant

19
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:50,409
in everyone's mind so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll just get used</font>

20
00:00:47,799 --> 00:00:52,870
to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay as you said we're talking</font>

21
00:00:50,409 --> 00:00:58,059
about how am i doing volume<font color="#CCCCCC"> ways oh cool</font>

22
00:00:52,870 --> 00:01:00,099
web application fingerprinting talk a

23
00:00:58,059 --> 00:01:03,129
little bit about web applications and

24
00:01:00,100 --> 00:01:05,860
the interesting challenges they have for

25
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:07,120
security some of the ways in which we

26
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:10,090
need to think about web applications

27
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:11,470
differently and then talk a little bit

28
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,780
about the existing fingerprinting

29
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:15,130
approaches that are out there talk about

30
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:17,800
some of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the problems that we have with</font>

31
00:01:15,130 --> 00:01:19,509
that some of the<font color="#CCCCCC"> reasons why that didn't</font>

32
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,130
serve some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our needs and then the</font>

33
00:01:19,510 --> 00:01:23,710
static file approach take you through

34
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:25,899
<font color="#CCCCCC">the details of how that's done and then</font>

35
00:01:23,710 --> 00:01:28,030
once we<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually had a tool that does</font>

36
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:29,920
that we said all right<font color="#E5E5E5"> let's go out and</font>

37
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:32,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">use this tool let's make some some</font>

38
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:33,880
observations of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> entire net and draw</font>

39
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:35,680
<font color="#CCCCCC">some conclusions about how people are</font>

40
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:39,699
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing with web application</font>

41
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,650
security if we have time at the end

42
00:01:39,700 --> 00:01:43,780
we'll do some Q&A and hopefully in there

43
00:01:41,650 --> 00:01:45,700
will also be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to actually run this</font>

44
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:47,020
thing on some some web apps that you

45
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:51,130
guys are running see if you're up<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

46
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:52,509
<font color="#CCCCCC">date the well-known web applications</font>

47
00:01:51,130 --> 00:01:54,520
that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this talk is about there are</font>

48
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:56,590
<font color="#E5E5E5">lots and lots of custom web applications</font>

49
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,140
out there people<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing all sorts of new</font>

50
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:00,520
stuff in-house a little one-off web apps

51
00:01:59,140 --> 00:02:02,740
we're not talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about those we're</font>

52
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:04,450
talking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of well-known off the</font>

53
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:06,789
shelf with<font color="#E5E5E5"> our open source or commercial</font>

54
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:08,560
web applications that are used in all of

55
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,929
<font color="#E5E5E5">these things people expect web apps to</font>

56
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,420
be blogging to be content management

57
00:02:10,929 --> 00:02:16,000
systems to be maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> econ</font>

58
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:19,179
all of those things but web apps are

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:22,690
very much tons<font color="#E5E5E5"> of other technology you</font>

60
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:27,010
know it emails and you say squirrelmail

61
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:28,690
or any of those PHP my admin many many

62
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:31,780
of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> things that used to be sort of</font>

63
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:33,850
large dedicated enterprise applications

64
00:02:31,780 --> 00:02:36,100
or thick client or desktop applications

65
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:38,200
for all the reasons that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we take things</font>

66
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,790
to the web are becoming web apps so when

67
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,880
we talk about web application security

68
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:45,160
it's not just simple stuff like your

69
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:47,799
company's marketing blog real serious

70
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,480
infrastructure type stuff is very much

71
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:53,380
managed in web applications right now

72
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:55,298
the typical<font color="#CCCCCC"> fly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that everyone needs</font>

73
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:57,040
these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the well-known web</font>

74
00:02:55,299 --> 00:02:58,690
applications we support in blind

75
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,880
elephant currently most of the ones on

76
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:06,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">this list I'm sure you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guys use these</font>

77
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:07,840
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> very much on a daily basis so</font>

78
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:10,000
special challenges we were talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

79
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">how our web apps different than some</font>

80
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:15,730
other stuff they're remotely accessible

81
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,500
by<font color="#E5E5E5"> nature that's the big thing any</font>

82
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:20,649
exploit that you have in a web

83
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:22,150
application is by default a remote

84
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:23,650
vulnerability and if it's on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

85
00:03:22,150 --> 00:03:25,180
intranet it's typically available to

86
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">your full internet if it's on the</font>

87
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:29,290
internet it's available to the entire

88
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">internet lots of attacks service</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font>

89
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:32,410
an interesting one you've got all the

90
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:33,880
direct attacks the injection attacks

91
00:03:32,410 --> 00:03:35,380
stuff that comes in<font color="#CCCCCC"> from the front end</font>

92
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:37,989
you've also got in direct attacks

93
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:39,430
cross-site scripting<font color="#CCCCCC"> CSRF all of those</font>

94
00:03:37,989 --> 00:03:42,519
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you're going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to bounce off</font>

95
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:43,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a legitimate user so lots of things</font>

96
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:45,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">going on in web apps lots of</font>

97
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:49,209
functionality being added quick

98
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:52,450
development cycles also these things are

99
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:54,250
phenomenally easy to set up many of<font color="#CCCCCC"> them</font>

100
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:56,798
will say you got your five minute

101
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:59,769
install your<font color="#CCCCCC"> one-click install the those</font>

102
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,910
sort of things that power users say hey

103
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:02,859
cool one<font color="#E5E5E5"> last thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I need to worry</font>

104
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:05,170
about but some of the users who wouldn't

105
00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:08,200
necessarily go and install<font color="#E5E5E5"> a web app or</font>

106
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:10,208
set up a new application will say hey it

107
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:11,679
looks<font color="#E5E5E5"> really easy or my friend told me</font>

108
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:13,600
this was really easy<font color="#E5E5E5"> go and set it up</font>

109
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">and they're not necessarily going to go</font>

110
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,469
through<font color="#E5E5E5"> the channels that they might use</font>

111
00:04:15,190 --> 00:04:18,880
to if something was really<font color="#E5E5E5"> hard if you</font>

112
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it's going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a painful several</font>

113
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,539
our process you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to set it over</font>

114
00:04:20,228 --> 00:04:25,530
to IT if you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just spin up</font>

115
00:04:22,539 --> 00:04:26,909
a database and a web app and if

116
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:31,888
minutes these are the kind of things

117
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:33,540
that fly under the radar fast release

118
00:04:31,889 --> 00:04:35,130
cycle we talked about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that for all the</font>

119
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:37,800
reasons that we like developing web apps

120
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:39,090
they have that other side from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,700
administering from the maintenance from

<font color="#E5E5E5">the security perspective this one some</font>

123
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:47,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">people may disagree I think it's</font>

124
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:49,650
actually true exploits are simpler to to

125
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:53,159
comprehend and therefore also<font color="#E5E5E5"> simpler to</font>

126
00:04:49,650 --> 00:04:55,289
create to propagate<font color="#CCCCCC"> to execute here's</font>

127
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,140
two examples of actual complete working

128
00:04:55,290 --> 00:05:01,050
exploits these are known published<font color="#CCCCCC"> ones</font>

129
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:04,560
a wordpress admin password reset and a

130
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:08,220
joomla things to file a file disclosure

131
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,690
and you know executable via or exploit

132
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,820
it will be a double you get you don't

133
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:13,740
need<font color="#CCCCCC"> i to pro you don't need any</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

134
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,000
these deeper tools that takes a little

135
00:05:13,740 --> 00:05:16,350
bit more domain knowledge to

136
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,940
understanding these exploits so there's

137
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:20,220
a lot going on in web application

138
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,780
security and of course<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything the</font>

139
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:31,979
<font color="#CCCCCC">WAC vendors are saying</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I won't reiterate</font>

all of that web<font color="#E5E5E5"> applications scanning</font>

141
00:05:31,979 --> 00:05:35,460
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cool problems going on and</font>

00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:37,050
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're lots of hard problems lots of</font>

143
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,870
really interesting research we're very

144
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:41,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">much not doing that this is what about</font>

you've got vendor published

150
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:54,570
traditional vulnerability management

151
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,890
where if you're running XP sp2 we know

you're vulnerable to all of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">different things and that's actionable</font>

154
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:01,169
that's something that you care about

155
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:03,930
whether you are a system administrator

00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:05,159
or a pen tester or an auditor or

157

something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> or whether you're</font>

building<font color="#CCCCCC"> this into tools so knowing the</font>

00:06:07,710 --> 00:06:11,880
version is good enough to infer these

<font color="#E5E5E5">definitely not as sexy as West but this</font>

162
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:18,270
works and going to talk a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font>

163
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:20,220
about why it works so discovering the

app and<font color="#E5E5E5"> the version is fingerprinting</font>

165
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:27,390
quick theory of fingerprinting we don't

166
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:29,580
need to dive too deeply into this what

167
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:33,479
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for some characteristic</font>

168
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:34,950
that identifies an individual now how we

169
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:38,919
define individual depends what we're

170
00:06:34,950 --> 00:06:40,450
doing if it's for doing criminology then

171
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:42,400
you know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the actual fingerprint</font>

172
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:43,900
this this<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing identifies me</font>

differently from this<font color="#E5E5E5"> gentleman in the</font>

177
00:06:55,330 --> 00:06:59,650
on that relies on sending slightly

178
00:06:57,430 --> 00:07:04,120
malformed packets may be several

179

180

conform and seeing which errors come

181
00:07:06,010 --> 00:07:10,780
back and often you need to try a whole

182
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,109
bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> things and then the</font>

that go away out of the source code

there<font color="#CCCCCC"> are lots of guides for doing that</font>

many applications are sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting on</font>

228
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,990
the bandwagon and saying we're going to

00:09:07,430 --> 00:09:10,550
go ahead<font color="#CCCCCC"> and provide</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a little checkbox</font>

that says strip all identifying

information and for applications that

00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:16,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">are not doing that there are people</font>

coming in third parties and providing

<font color="#E5E5E5">finally though people aren't doing this</font>

00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,740
you want to claim to be a completely

241

00:09:44,660 --> 00:09:50,660
in usually one area security were the

got some good results but it was fairly

00:09:58,400 --> 00:10:02,600
manual it didn't pin things down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:07,850
little bit less actionable what web is

257
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:09,349
doing a whole lot more is gathering an

258
00:10:07,850 --> 00:10:11,240
astonishing amount more data but they

259
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:14,000
end up pulling down so much<font color="#E5E5E5"> data that's</font>

260
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,460
really not useful for scanning large

289
00:11:10,630 --> 00:11:14,320
easy to support new apps and then if<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font>

290
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,760
asking people outside to help me with

291
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,280
that I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it very very easy</font>

292
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:19,780
for them just to help support a new app

293
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:25,390
that maybe they only<font color="#E5E5E5"> have access to all</font>

294
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:28,180
right so<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's called blind elephant and</font>

295
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:29,740
it comes from<font color="#E5E5E5"> this old Indian fable</font>

296
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:32,469
hasn't anybody heard this Indian fable a

297
00:11:29,740 --> 00:11:36,820
couple hands<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I think this is really</font>

298
00:11:32,470 --> 00:11:38,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">cool it's a number of it's a parable on</font>

299
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:41,710
the unknowable Atia of truth<font color="#CCCCCC"> the number</font>

300
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:44,050
of blind men or man in a dark room while

301
00:11:41,710 --> 00:11:46,000
touching an elephant and trying to agree

302
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:47,920
amongst themselves what it is and one of

303
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:50,890
them touch to the side of the elephant

304
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,079
says it's a wall other one grabs the leg

305
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:55,330
and says it's a tree or the trunk and

306
00:11:53,080 --> 00:11:57,220
says it's divine and they all see<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort</font>

307
00:11:55,330 --> 00:12:00,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">of this one aspect of the truth and the</font>

308
00:11:57,220 --> 00:12:02,470
the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cone aspect of it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is you you</font>

309
00:12:00,250 --> 00:12:05,680
can't truly know all of truth<font color="#CCCCCC"> in it and</font>

310
00:12:02,470 --> 00:12:07,510
it's a cool<font color="#CCCCCC"> little parable but it pissed</font>

311
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,209
me off because if they would all just

312
00:12:07,510 --> 00:12:12,100
say the things that it could possibly be

313
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:13,690
very quickly they'd come down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

314
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:17,740
can't be all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those things together</font>

315
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:19,210
but it can be this elephant oh you know

316
00:12:17,740 --> 00:12:20,710
it's a tree or an elephant<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a spear</font>

317
00:12:19,210 --> 00:12:22,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">or an elephant</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a biner an elephant</font>

318
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:24,580
you put those things<font color="#E5E5E5"> all together you</font>

319
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,520
intersect those possibilities and we

320
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:29,020
have an elephant so that is exactly what

321
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:31,569
is going<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a static file fingerprinting</font>

322
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:33,819
really no more no less so if you keep

323
00:12:31,570 --> 00:12:36,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">that in mind the rest of these</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> slides</font>

324
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:37,810
should make perfect sense and if you go

325
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:43,060
to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the code that's really all</font>

326
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:48,670
that we're doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay how do we do this</font>

327
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:50,380
preparing the data go get every possible

328
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:51,849
version<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an app that you can get your</font>

329
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:53,590
hands on whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> you go to subversion</font>

330
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:55,900
and check out<font color="#CCCCCC"> all the tags whether</font>

331
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:57,610
they've got a nice archives page and you

332
00:12:55,900 --> 00:12:59,800
just<font color="#CCCCCC"> right click and say download</font>

333
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:01,300
everything here however you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get</font>

334
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:04,089
those versions dump them<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a</font>

335
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:08,140
directory unpack them I've got some

336
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:09,190
scripts for that and then what we're

337
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:13,660
going to do is we're going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> build two</font>

338
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:15,490
tables the the data of files on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the left</font>

339
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,260
lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of data going on there lots of</font>

340
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:18,920
files gigs and gigs we're going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

341
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:20,750
compress that down too

342
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:22,310
these two things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually use to</font>

343
00:13:20,750 --> 00:13:24,860
make the decisions about fingerprinting

344
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:26,599
which end up being a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> under a</font>

345
00:13:24,860 --> 00:13:27,529
little under a<font color="#CCCCCC"> meg depending on what</font>

346
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,779
you're dealing with<font color="#E5E5E5"> so these are very</font>

347
00:13:27,529 --> 00:13:31,550
easily easy to transport those are in

348
00:13:29,779 --> 00:13:32,959
subversion and you can check those<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

349
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:35,449
and get them and play with them and see

350
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:37,339
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of data is encoded in there we</font>

351
00:13:35,449 --> 00:13:39,439
use the these data tables to answer two

352
00:13:37,339 --> 00:13:44,209
questions the first one for the<font color="#E5E5E5"> paths</font>

353
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:46,760
table is what versions will a path give

354
00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:51,619
me information on if I fetch this

355
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:56,300
particular path / resources / something

356
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:58,070
dot CSS what versions is that file

357
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:00,649
present teen and what versions does it

358
00:13:58,070 --> 00:14:05,329
differ in therefore if I fetch<font color="#E5E5E5"> that file</font>

359
00:14:00,649 --> 00:14:07,910
what kind of versions what versions if I

360
00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:10,069
hash that file will it tell me<font color="#E5E5E5"> about the</font>

361
00:14:07,910 --> 00:14:11,870
other side<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the versions table which</font>

362
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:14,060
is the exact same data grouped slightly

363
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:17,240
differently that if we want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to confirm</font>

364
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:18,768
or rule out versions we've done some

365
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,529
fingerprinting we've got it<font color="#CCCCCC"> down to we</font>

366
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:24,649
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's version 3.1 or is version 3.2</font>

367
00:14:21,529 --> 00:14:26,360
hey versions table what's a file<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

368
00:14:24,649 --> 00:14:28,699
can help break this tie what's a file

369
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:33,800
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> will give me deeper information</font>

370
00:14:28,699 --> 00:14:35,180
once I've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a small set of versions so</font>

371
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,740
here it is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit of an eye chart</font>

372
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:40,790
here don't you to worry about too much

373
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:43,310
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically WordPress every version star</font>

374
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:45,620
star<font color="#CCCCCC"> / star all the files we're</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

375
00:14:43,310 --> 00:14:48,260
chew through those<font color="#E5E5E5"> and compute hashes on</font>

376
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:49,490
those and send those to the paths table

377
00:14:48,260 --> 00:14:55,100
and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> vs. table here's what it looks</font>

378
00:14:49,490 --> 00:14:57,949
like pads table is keyed by file and the

379
00:14:55,100 --> 00:15:00,170
values are hash to version mappings and

380
00:14:57,949 --> 00:15:03,260
the versions table is versions and their

381
00:15:00,170 --> 00:15:05,360
file to hash mappings currently we're

382
00:15:03,260 --> 00:15:07,550
doing md5 we want to do some sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

383
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,350
deeper cooler stuff with this but we've

384
00:15:07,550 --> 00:15:11,569
gotten good results with with<font color="#E5E5E5"> straight</font>

385
00:15:09,350 --> 00:15:12,529
<font color="#E5E5E5">up cryptographic hashing so far so the</font>

386
00:15:11,569 --> 00:15:16,219
rest<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the stuff is future work</font>

387
00:15:12,529 --> 00:15:19,550
hopefully<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll get to that everyone</font>

388
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:22,459
good so far chewing up massive amounts

389
00:15:19,550 --> 00:15:25,219
of source input files and producing

390
00:15:22,459 --> 00:15:28,310
these two hashes tables whether these

391
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:31,550
two data tables how many files we

392
00:15:28,310 --> 00:15:32,599
talking about got currently 166 versions

393
00:15:31,550 --> 00:15:36,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">WordPress</font>

394
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:38,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">32 versions of PHP BB we're supporting a</font>

395
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:41,779
lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> different versions of these files</font>

396
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:44,720
of each of these web applications and

397
00:15:41,779 --> 00:15:46,069
many files within their got support for

398
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,959
a couple of plugins we're just I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

399
00:15:46,069 --> 00:15:50,180
doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> two right</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now to show the</font>

400
00:15:47,959 --> 00:15:52,670
technology work will add more later but

401
00:15:50,180 --> 00:15:55,219
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can you can sort of see that that</font>

402
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:56,360
explosion of different artifacts to deal

403
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:58,370
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> when we get down to plugins you</font>

404
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:02,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 1200 versions of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> WordPress plugins</font>

405
00:15:58,370 --> 00:16:05,540
that we can uniquely identify so

406
00:16:02,839 --> 00:16:07,790
fingerprinting what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> want to do</font>

407
00:16:05,540 --> 00:16:09,259
is look at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these possible files that</font>

408
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:11,240
could exist on<font color="#E5E5E5"> a remote system</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and fetch</font>

409
00:16:09,259 --> 00:16:13,040
them all that would take forever and

410
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:15,410
hundreds of megabytes and is

411
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,380
unreasonable to do what we want to do is

412
00:16:15,410 --> 00:16:21,980
surface a couple of files you know 10<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

413
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:24,620
15 files that give us lots and lots of

414
00:16:21,980 --> 00:16:26,360
information about<font color="#CCCCCC"> what's there so we</font>

415
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:28,009
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to pick files that are present in</font>

416
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:30,380
many versions because we request it and

417
00:16:28,009 --> 00:16:31,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">if we get a 404 that that hasn't helped</font>

418
00:16:30,380 --> 00:16:34,160
us it's helped us a little bit we know

files that we know it can't be<font color="#E5E5E5"> any of</font>

00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:39,439
the apps that actually contain that but

421
00:16:36,709 --> 00:16:42,018
we want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find files that exist in many</font>

422
00:16:39,439 --> 00:16:43,670
versions and also have changed from

of those sort of user documentation that

428

discuss new functionality those will

429
00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:03,920
definitely<font color="#CCCCCC"> change and that's you know no</font>

00:17:01,970 --> 00:17:06,559
trick to find those finding ones that

431
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:07,938
are really<font color="#E5E5E5"> obscure is the trick and</font>

432
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:10,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's one of the nice things about</font>

433
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:14,150
having<font color="#CCCCCC"> this again fully data-driven no</font>

434
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:15,859
human judgment process going on so

435
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:18,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">here's some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of the candidate files like</font>

436
00:17:15,859 --> 00:17:22,158
for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> for movable type</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> M tjs</font>

437
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:23,750
client jas these are all against these

438
00:17:22,159 --> 00:17:25,669
static files we're not looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at any</font>

439
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:27,890
PHP files are<font color="#CCCCCC"> not looking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at any JSP</font>

440
00:17:25,669 --> 00:17:29,270
files those kinds of interactive files

441
00:17:27,890 --> 00:17:31,909
we don't care about those those<font color="#CCCCCC"> are all</font>

442
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:34,250
blacklisted out when we start chewing

443
00:17:31,909 --> 00:17:36,770
through the the source code to produce

444
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:40,250
the data tables so here the 15 that if

445
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:42,710
you go to find a<font color="#E5E5E5"> movable type machine a</font>

446
00:17:40,250 --> 00:17:43,860
removable type app these the one that

00:17:42,710 --> 00:17:47,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">it'll get</font>

448
00:17:43,860 --> 00:17:51,899
mediawiki obviously a documentation

449
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:54,929
changelog the the heuristics to to pick

450
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:56,730
files automatically surface those and

451
00:17:54,929 --> 00:18:00,330
then some slightly less obvious ones

452
00:17:56,730 --> 00:18:01,590
lying<font color="#CCCCCC"> sync lang I don't know that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

453
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:05,309
would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have gone looking for that one</font>

454
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:09,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">early on as a as a very useful file to</font>

455
00:18:05,309 --> 00:18:12,000
fetch but it popped up there from<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

456
00:18:09,510 --> 00:18:14,640
stuff so again just hammering on that

457
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:16,440
all the data is in the code none of the

458
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:19,350
data is in the operator or<font color="#CCCCCC"> the person</font>

459
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:22,200
compiling the tables so fingerprinting

460
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:23,520
we've got these cool<font color="#E5E5E5"> data tables and we</font>

461
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:25,169
know what files we want to request from

462
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:33,870
<font color="#E5E5E5">the remote machine so we</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> go and request</font>

463
00:18:25,169 --> 00:18:36,090
them<font color="#E5E5E5"> each of those goes out some of them</font>

464
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:38,639
look at 40 threes or 404 is<font color="#E5E5E5"> based on</font>

467
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay we're fetching bunch of files we</font>

468
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:48,870
only care that we get data back<font color="#CCCCCC"> on a</font>

469
00:18:44,280 --> 00:18:50,610
decent<font color="#CCCCCC"> number of them so here and didn't</font>

470
00:18:48,870 --> 00:18:54,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">come out as large as I was hoping</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> but</font>

471
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:58,469
got versions you know the one file gave

472
00:18:54,750 --> 00:19:01,440
us version<font color="#CCCCCC"> 2 a 1 202 maybe 30 for RC</font>

473
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:05,040
something else said 251 we've got these

474
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:08,490
these sets of possibilities remember the

475
00:19:05,040 --> 00:19:11,309
elephant we intersect them and what we

476
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:13,770
have with that small area is we have

477
00:19:11,309 --> 00:19:15,570
files which there is definite concrete

478
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:21,450
evidence for the existence of that

479
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:25,620
version but no evidence<font color="#E5E5E5"> against it okay</font>

480
00:19:21,450 --> 00:19:29,220
so if for example if we done that and

481
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:30,989
got in this this inner circle here<font color="#CCCCCC"> or</font>

482
00:19:29,220 --> 00:19:33,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">this sort of inner area was too large</font>

483
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:35,790
whoops how's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> this inner area was</font>

484
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,199
too large if it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not useful enough for</font>

485
00:19:35,790 --> 00:19:39,720
our purposes whatever our purposes are

486
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,400
we can turn around<font color="#E5E5E5"> and we know remember</font>

487
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:44,250
the versions table that will allow us to

488
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:45,840
confirm or refute the existence of a

489
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:47,100
particular version so we're going to go

490
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:49,889
<font color="#CCCCCC">ahead and pick some slightly different</font>

491
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:51,299
files based on what's<font color="#E5E5E5"> in the version</font>

492
00:19:49,890 --> 00:19:53,640
table you look at the version that you

493
00:19:51,299 --> 00:19:55,320
want to confirm or refute get out a

494
00:19:53,640 --> 00:19:56,440
whole list of files<font color="#E5E5E5"> that will give you</font>

495
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:59,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">information on that version</font>

496
00:19:56,440 --> 00:20:02,200
and fetch<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and send a smaller set of</font>

497
00:19:59,500 --> 00:20:03,850
requests and ultimately your we're able

498
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:05,500
to narrow it down a bit windowing is

499
00:20:03,850 --> 00:20:08,949
turned off by default but if you turn it

500
00:20:05,500 --> 00:20:13,270
on it can attend<font color="#E5E5E5"> to reduce your your</font>

501
00:20:08,950 --> 00:20:15,670
version set by about half which is

502
00:20:13,270 --> 00:20:17,440
pretty nice since since the results are

503
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:19,300
reasonably small to begin with<font color="#E5E5E5"> so if</font>

504
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:20,380
you're if you need more accurate data

505
00:20:19,300 --> 00:20:22,149
and you're willing<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make a few more</font>

506
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:23,740
requests<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wendling is a way to do that</font>

507
00:20:22,150 --> 00:20:27,250
all using the same data that we

508
00:20:23,740 --> 00:20:30,910
collected up front this data also allows

509
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:33,370
us to do application guessing using the

510
00:20:30,910 --> 00:20:36,790
versions table we say hey surface for me

511
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:38,889
files that<font color="#CCCCCC"> exist in every single version</font>

512
00:20:36,790 --> 00:20:41,260
that's out there if not every<font color="#E5E5E5"> single</font>

513
00:20:38,890 --> 00:20:43,030
version then 99% of versions and<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll</font>

514
00:20:41,260 --> 00:20:44,590
pick up<font color="#E5E5E5"> that other one with with an</font>

515
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:46,960
additional file so we<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a very small</font>

516
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:50,770
set of files that<font color="#E5E5E5"> darn well should exist</font>

517
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:53,440
in say every version of Moodle I think

518
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:57,760
that's Moodle up there is it whatever

519
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:59,320
and so things like the the application

520
00:20:57,760 --> 00:21:01,780
logo it's been there since the beginning

521
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:04,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">of time it hasn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> changed they like it</font>

522
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:11,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">and it's staying right there in / images</font>

523
00:21:04,630 --> 00:21:14,530
logo<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so if we're doing F</font>

524
00:21:11,740 --> 00:21:15,850
discovery send those files at it one of

525
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:18,490
them should come<font color="#E5E5E5"> back with a recognized</font>

526
00:21:15,850 --> 00:21:20,110
hash and being at some version of joomla

527
00:21:18,490 --> 00:21:22,510
we can turn around and then go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

528
00:21:20,110 --> 00:21:23,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">do full-on fingerprinting against now</font>

529
00:21:22,510 --> 00:21:28,000
that we know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's joomla we can use the</font>

530
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:30,909
joomla tables to fingerprint<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

531
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,380
supporting a new application is pretty

532
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:34,150
simple as I said gather<font color="#E5E5E5"> it version you</font>

533
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:36,430
can dump in a directory chew through

534
00:21:34,150 --> 00:21:39,850
them get out two tables on the end and

535
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:41,830
then turn around and say whatever my new

536
00:21:39,850 --> 00:21:49,600
app is fingerprint using those tables

537
00:21:41,830 --> 00:21:51,310
alright so this tool is only interesting

538
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,659
if it works turns out it works pretty

539
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:55,720
well<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to go ahead and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> finger</font>

540
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:58,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">from</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> boss's website here we know</font>

541
00:21:55,720 --> 00:22:02,470
what's a happenin militant movable type

542
00:21:58,180 --> 00:22:05,050
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going to plug that in load up</font>

543
00:22:02,470 --> 00:22:07,000
those movable type data files and start

544
00:22:05,050 --> 00:22:09,010
fetching each of these each of these

545
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,060
indicator files that we care about so

546
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:13,840
you see MTG

547
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:15,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">implies this set of versions client</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Jas</font>

548
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,379
implies this set of versions and those

549
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:19,120
are pretty large sets of versions larger

550
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:21,160
than I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> like to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see but again the</font>

551
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,510
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing we care about so we're going</font>

552
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:26,380
through large sets of versions large

553
00:22:22,510 --> 00:22:30,310
sets of versions is this inner area as

554
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:33,970
long as that small any of the individual

555
00:22:30,310 --> 00:22:36,550
files can can post back many many

556
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:39,490
versions but we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> narrow down so if we</font>

557
00:22:36,550 --> 00:22:41,860
finish<font color="#E5E5E5"> this fingerprint we get out to</font>

558
00:22:39,490 --> 00:22:45,010
fingerprinting resulted in any of the

559
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:47,320
the 4.20 the 4.3 either the the regular

560
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:49,390
version or the commercial version turns

561
00:22:47,320 --> 00:22:50,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">out this is 4.23 commercial so we're</font>

562
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:57,550
doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right this has a vulnerability</font>

563
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:59,350
in it by the way sorry it does plugins

564
00:22:57,550 --> 00:23:03,010
to again same logic same approach going

565
00:22:59,350 --> 00:23:06,580
going for this we can say hey go to some

566
00:23:03,010 --> 00:23:07,840
example site and please guess and we

567
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:10,629
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's Drupal please guess what</font>

568
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:13,510
plugins it has chugga route chug along

569
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:15,550
for a few seconds and come back and<font color="#E5E5E5"> say</font>

570
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:17,590
here are all the supported plugins they

571
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:18,669
could also be running<font color="#E5E5E5"> other plugins but</font>

572
00:23:17,590 --> 00:23:19,959
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just aren't ones that we support</font>

573
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:22,390
but this is this is what we're able to

574
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:25,090
discover and then turn around and say we

575
00:23:22,390 --> 00:23:27,460
care about what version the imce plugin

576
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:31,389
is<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay cool well fingerprint</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that and</font>

577
00:23:27,460 --> 00:23:34,420
came out<font color="#CCCCCC"> with its Drupal 6 point</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> X</font>

578
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:38,770
version 1.3 of the plugin so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

579
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:40,990
go tool kind of does its job anybody run

580
00:23:38,770 --> 00:23:45,190
any of these well-known web apps any of

581
00:23:40,990 --> 00:23:46,870
Joomla or Drupal or WordPress PHP BB and

582
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:50,670
kind stuff you want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to be a</font>

583
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:50,669
<font color="#E5E5E5">guinea pig in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> white</font>

584
00:24:18,940 --> 00:24:33,040
okie dokie oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's windows we can't do</font>

585
00:24:23,380 --> 00:24:44,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">that all right what do you got somebody</font>

586
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:45,850
gotcha art renewable org and should I

587
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:49,960
guess what you're running or do you want

588
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:54,219
tell<font color="#CCCCCC"> me it's not even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a question all</font>

589
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:56,170
right<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so what this is doing is</font>

590
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:57,580
going through all of those data files I

591
00:24:56,170 --> 00:25:01,330
holds about for every supported web

592
00:24:57,580 --> 00:25:03,220
application and finding out what what

593
00:25:01,330 --> 00:25:05,139
files are likely to give us good

594
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:09,760
information on what he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> running there</font>

595
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:14,470
so it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try and send maybe two</font>

596
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:16,450
to three two to four requests for each

597
00:25:14,470 --> 00:25:21,790
supported app to see if maybe it's

598
00:25:16,450 --> 00:25:23,080
running there so i told you i would

599
00:25:21,790 --> 00:25:24,700
hopefully not send you for a cup of

600
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,290
coffee on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the actual fingerprinting</font>

601
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:32,230
guessing does take a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> longer</font>

602
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:34,840
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> i made a liar out of myself unlikely</font>

603
00:25:32,230 --> 00:25:37,120
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> i had to explain that to our</font>

difference let's try it out the way<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

620
00:26:29,870 --> 00:26:33,530
let me load this up just<font color="#CCCCCC"> to just to make</font>

621
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:42,639
sure I'm actually hitting something live

622
00:26:33,530 --> 00:26:42,639
art renewal org

623
00:26:46,350 --> 00:26:57,809
I would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> expected an error if it was</font>

624
00:26:51,090 --> 00:27:00,959
if we couldn't get there at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

625
00:26:57,809 --> 00:27:02,940
here so very cool looking blog here a

626
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:16,100
little free advertisement their little

627
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:16,100
nudity<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right man out this works</font>

628
00:27:20,870 --> 00:27:28,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">alright I will figure out our and are</font>

629
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:32,240
you hosting are you hosting this

630
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:33,890
yourself<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright making a fool of myself</font>

631
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:35,870
all right to recover a little bit of

632
00:27:33,890 --> 00:27:37,250
face here i'll go ahead and finger do a

633
00:27:35,870 --> 00:27:43,429
live<font color="#E5E5E5"> finger printer that one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i showed</font>

634
00:27:37,250 --> 00:27:46,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">you just a moment what's it shouldn't</font>

635
00:27:43,430 --> 00:27:49,820
well if is there a redirector again<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

636
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:51,530
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to burn too much time on this i</font>

637
00:27:49,820 --> 00:27:56,800
should have known<font color="#E5E5E5"> better than to tempt</font>

638
00:27:51,530 --> 00:27:56,800
the demo<font color="#E5E5E5"> gods that's all right</font>

639
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:18,720
so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is this is the one that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you just</font>

640
00:28:14,970 --> 00:28:20,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">saw on the slides but it's a little bit</font>

641
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:28,140
slow over here I think I'm running<font color="#CCCCCC"> over</font>

642
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:33,900
VPN actually so here's the each of those

643
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:35,160
version sets coming up and this could be

644
00:28:33,900 --> 00:28:36,150
multi-threaded right now it isn't we

645
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:38,340
could make all these requests in

646
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:44,430
parallel so there's a lot of speed to be

647
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:46,860
gained but it does the job<font color="#E5E5E5"> right now</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

648
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:48,060
so there there it<font color="#CCCCCC"> is it is running</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> live</font>

649
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:49,320
let me go ahead<font color="#E5E5E5"> and get through what we</font>

650
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:53,300
have and then if we get closer<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

651
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:53,300
end I'll take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a couple more shots</font>

652
00:29:00,610 --> 00:29:08,290
there we go<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so we've got this toy</font>

653
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:10,960
we assume that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it works evidence to the</font>

654
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:13,000
contrary notwithstanding did a whole

655
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,730
bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of targeted scans based on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> showed</font>

656
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:16,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">an to say or I go get a whole bunch of</font>

657
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:19,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">things that were pretty darn sure</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

658
00:29:16,900 --> 00:29:21,520
WordPress hit them get versions try and

659
00:29:19,059 --> 00:29:24,250
shake out some bugs bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of scans on</font>

660
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:26,590
that John<font color="#CCCCCC"> helped me out a lot</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is he here</font>

661
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:27,700
<font color="#E5E5E5">I told you I owe you a beer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> alright i</font>

662
00:29:26,590 --> 00:29:32,678
still owe them the beer reviews<font color="#E5E5E5"> not here</font>

663
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:35,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay then got a dump of 87 million calm</font>

664
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:37,540
domains and said<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay let's go and do</font>

665
00:29:35,530 --> 00:29:39,940
app guessing and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> fingerprinting on</font>

666
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:41,830
all of those so discover if there is a

667
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:45,130
supported out there and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> go ahead</font>

668
00:29:41,830 --> 00:29:47,320
and fingerprint it and see what versions

669
00:29:45,130 --> 00:29:49,270
there and take the results<font color="#E5E5E5"> from that and</font>

670
00:29:47,320 --> 00:30:00,070
see what interesting stuff cropped up

671
00:29:49,270 --> 00:30:02,679
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay so quick word on on these pictures</font>

672
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:04,330
you can see you notice that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there is at</font>

673
00:30:02,679 --> 00:30:07,809
the top of their there's point<font color="#E5E5E5"> eight of</font>

674
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:09,370
a host so these are version distribution

675
00:30:07,809 --> 00:30:14,110
of some app that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going to talk about</font>

676
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:16,479
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> our most recent versions here and</font>

677
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:18,428
if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're your latest betas and release</font>

678
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:20,110
candidates all the way down to stuff

679
00:30:18,429 --> 00:30:21,250
that's very<font color="#E5E5E5"> very old you know something</font>

680
00:30:20,110 --> 00:30:24,189
depending on how well the project is

681
00:30:21,250 --> 00:30:28,150
several years old or<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten years old and</font>

682
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:30,100
then across going the bars represent how

683
00:30:28,150 --> 00:30:33,640
many hosts we found running those

684
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:36,760
versions so since remember we're talking

685
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:39,010
about sets of possibilities if we

686
00:30:36,760 --> 00:30:41,260
scanned if we fingerprinted host one and

687
00:30:39,010 --> 00:30:42,879
got back we can't pin it down

688
00:30:41,260 --> 00:30:45,010
specifically but we know that it's

689
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:46,990
running one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these three versions then</font>

690
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:49,629
each of<font color="#E5E5E5"> those columns gets point three</font>

691
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:52,690
three we go and fingerprint host<font color="#CCCCCC"> two and</font>

692
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:56,320
we say the possible versions are 1.5 or

693
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:59,380
2 point 0 then we do<font color="#CCCCCC"> one over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> N to that</font>

694
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:00,909
column and then finally host three we

695
00:30:59,380 --> 00:31:04,150
actually pin it under specific<font color="#CCCCCC"> version</font>

696
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:06,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">so the full one point 0 or 1 /</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 1 to 2</font>

697
00:31:04,150 --> 00:31:08,800
that column so here's the basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

698
00:31:06,429 --> 00:31:10,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">x-ray of that previous chart so we where</font>

699
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:12,730
we are representing the fact that we we

700
00:31:10,630 --> 00:31:14,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">can only infer sort of set some</font>

701
00:31:12,730 --> 00:31:15,760
possibilities but

702
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:18,970
<font color="#CCCCCC">let's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> put all the data</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> chart and</font>

703
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:25,330
not not blow not misrepresent anything

704
00:31:18,970 --> 00:31:26,980
so okay here's what we found a whole

705
00:31:25,330 --> 00:31:30,129
bunch a whole bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> drupal machines</font>

706
00:31:26,980 --> 00:31:35,019
in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> version distribution you'll</font>

707
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:37,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">notice there's kind of this sort of</font>

708
00:31:35,019 --> 00:31:40,090
swoop here that it's very few people are

709
00:31:37,120 --> 00:31:42,908

think less than fifty percent you guys

are realists obviously more than

735
00:32:48,970 --> 00:32:55,000

00:33:00,190 --> 00:33:12,640
than 80 okay

739
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:16,658
so seventy percent there these you can

740
00:33:12,640 --> 00:33:18,159
see pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> much any any of these people</font>

me vulnerable but<font color="#E5E5E5"> these people who are</font>

these are hosting providers and package

managers that are not putting that are

751

not providing a version that is

these critical vulnerabilities this is

if you grab the slides the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual</font>

00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:53,529
vulnerabilities are in there so anybody

running a version less than 6.16 was

757
00:33:53,529 --> 00:34:03,640
vulnerable to this all<font color="#E5E5E5"> right how about</font>

00:33:56,799 --> 00:34:10,540
joomla less than fifty percent<font color="#CCCCCC"> 7a I</font>

00:34:15,310 --> 00:34:19,330
this vulnerability or something farther

763
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:21,429
down the line which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is just astonishing</font>

764
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:23,290
to me and these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> well-known published</font>

765
00:34:21,429 --> 00:34:25,659
vulnerabilities like the vendor has said

version don't run this stuff anymore and

768
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:31,119
still nine your scent ninety percent of

769
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:34,598
people don't update<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm not saying</font>

770
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:36,220
anything surprising if I say users don't

771
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:39,460
update I'm ases it be saying something a

772
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:40,928
little more surprising if I say web site

773
00:34:39,460 --> 00:34:44,230
administrators don't update but not

774
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:46,450
hugely surprising there but it's it's

775
00:34:44,230 --> 00:34:51,159
staggering to me how far<font color="#E5E5E5"> behind all of</font>

776
00:34:46,449 --> 00:34:55,799
these guys<font color="#CCCCCC"> are life right I'm not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:55,800
to pick on them too small mediawiki

778
00:35:01,340 --> 00:35:06,890
ninety-five percent at some point you

779
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:09,320
just like the numbers are<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

780
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:11,270
disappointing and and it goes up you can

781
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:13,310
see definitely the spikes when the

782
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:16,370
package from the package managers and

783
00:35:13,310 --> 00:35:17,960
the hosting providers are right here so

784
00:35:16,370 --> 00:35:19,279
if you're if you're relying on those

785
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:21,200
package managers or those hosting

786
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:26,600
providers to protect you you're very

787
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:32,779
much not being being protected well you

788
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:36,680
may be but just not soon enough<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

791
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:48,770
and ouch these guys who were who are

792
00:35:46,370 --> 00:35:50,240
right here on the you know thought you

793
00:35:48,770 --> 00:35:52,940
were running<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a really popular</font>

794
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:55,879
version as I look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this I'm trying to</font>

795
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:57,950
sort of figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out why</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people end up</font>

796
00:35:55,880 --> 00:36:00,080
being behind whether it's the pain of

797
00:35:57,950 --> 00:36:02,180
updating or whether they're chasing a

798
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:03,680
particular feature or in some cases or

799
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:06,950
something like this plugins<font color="#E5E5E5"> may be</font>

800
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:17,770
holding people back but if you're if you

801
00:36:06,950 --> 00:36:17,770
are PHP BB

802
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:25,790
so this is perhaps a little bit not fair

803
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:27,619
because the basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> the day that I did</font>

804
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:28,759
the scanning this was coming out so

805
00:36:27,619 --> 00:36:32,030
people had an upgrade<font color="#CCCCCC"> to the latest</font>

806
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:34,130
version but that's a truism of operating

807
00:36:32,030 --> 00:36:35,570
machines in the real world at some point

808
00:36:34,130 --> 00:36:39,200
awful stuff like this is going to happen

809
00:36:35,570 --> 00:36:42,260
but if I go<font color="#CCCCCC"> back and scan right now do</font>

810
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:46,368
you guys really think that that this

811
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:48,320
will have moved<font color="#E5E5E5"> above the line no its</font>

00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:15,500
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> not awful so maybe you'll</font>

822
00:37:13,190 --> 00:37:17,480
you'll risk doing the sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the change</font>

823
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:20,480
management problems of updating that or

824
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:22,040
you know if your if your CMS maybe have

825
00:37:20,480 --> 00:37:23,270
some issues you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can if you think the</font>

826
00:37:22,040 --> 00:37:24,349
upgrade process might be a little bit

827
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:30,710
hairy you can do it in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> middle of the</font>

828
00:37:24,349 --> 00:37:33,680
night but it seems<font color="#CCCCCC"> like if if something</font>

829
00:37:30,710 --> 00:37:36,170
is critical you know if PHP my admin is

830
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:39,020
your database management solution at

831
00:37:36,170 --> 00:37:41,180
your work you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> it working and you</font>

832
00:37:39,020 --> 00:37:43,759
don't touch it that<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the story</font>

833
00:37:41,180 --> 00:37:45,740
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I get from this spikes all over the</font>

834
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:48,619
place of essentially popular versions

835
00:37:45,740 --> 00:37:50,689
that people have stayed on everybody

836
00:37:48,619 --> 00:37:54,560
else had that nice curve that went kind

837
00:37:50,690 --> 00:37:59,720
of from here all the way up to here PHP

838
00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:02,210
myadmin very very much not so what do

839
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:08,419
you guys think percentage wise one

840
00:38:02,210 --> 00:38:10,580
hundred percent and and that hurts you

841
00:38:08,420 --> 00:38:13,070
know if some you can use you can use a

842
00:38:10,580 --> 00:38:15,080
blog<font color="#E5E5E5"> or something like that to get into</font>

843
00:38:13,070 --> 00:38:17,270
a site<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then pivot from there but</font>

844
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:20,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is like hey directly into your</font>

845
00:38:17,270 --> 00:38:24,619
database and it's not any better people

846
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:28,430
are sort of system administrators aren't

847
00:38:24,619 --> 00:38:31,430
doing any triage about what's you know

848
00:38:28,430 --> 00:38:33,169
what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to cause real problems it's</font>

849
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:38,149
just people don't update

850
00:38:33,170 --> 00:38:42,530
again nothing<font color="#E5E5E5"> too shocking their spit a</font>

better here's something interesting

853
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:51,079
wordpress now conventional<font color="#CCCCCC"> wisdom has</font>

854
00:38:49,339 --> 00:38:53,390
been and if you go out there<font color="#CCCCCC"> and read</font>

855
00:38:51,079 --> 00:38:55,069
that WordPress has awful security you'll

856
00:38:53,390 --> 00:38:56,839
hear people saying this over and over oh

857
00:38:55,069 --> 00:39:01,400
I couldn't possibly run<font color="#E5E5E5"> WordPress their</font>

858
00:38:56,839 --> 00:39:02,779
security is dismal but certainly<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font>

859
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,640
thing that their users are<font color="#CCCCCC"> doing is</font>

860
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:05,869
absolutely keeping<font color="#CCCCCC"> up-to-date remember I</font>

861
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:09,348
was talking back at the beginning about

862
00:39:05,869 --> 00:39:11,630
these very easy to install apps and ease

863
00:39:09,349 --> 00:39:13,760
of use ease of use ease of use<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

864
00:39:11,630 --> 00:39:16,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">there WordPress has their famous one</font>

865
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:18,500
click install and their famous one click

866
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:20,390
update and its really reliable if you

867
00:39:18,500 --> 00:39:22,220
run a wordpress you probably found out

868
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:23,930
that when a new version comes out you

869
00:39:22,220 --> 00:39:26,328
can you know maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> back up your tables</font>

870
00:39:23,930 --> 00:39:28,368
but you know you can usually expect the

871
00:39:26,329 --> 00:39:32,960
install to work and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think we see that</font>

872
00:39:28,369 --> 00:39:36,230
here I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that a rabid rabid focus on</font>

873
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:38,720
ease of use and predictability and all

874
00:39:36,230 --> 00:39:42,470
that kind of stuff truly does drive user

875
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:44,540
behavior so anyway if you're if you're

876
00:39:42,470 --> 00:39:46,730
looking for hard numbers to talk about

877
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:48,980
and if we make it<font color="#E5E5E5"> five percent easier</font>

878
00:39:46,730 --> 00:39:51,380
for users to apply patches will we see

879
00:39:48,980 --> 00:39:53,119
will we see that or you know how far do

880
00:39:51,380 --> 00:39:55,309
we have to go to get<font color="#E5E5E5"> this kind of</font>

881
00:39:53,119 --> 00:39:58,250
up-to-date nasai<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really like this</font>

882
00:39:55,309 --> 00:40:00,140
spike here as a security person I love

883
00:39:58,250 --> 00:40:01,910
to see<font color="#CCCCCC"> people running and this was the</font>

884
00:40:00,140 --> 00:40:03,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">most recent version until right before I</font>

885
00:40:01,910 --> 00:40:05,480
did the scan you can see it there in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

886
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:07,129
release candidates for three-point oh

887
00:40:05,480 --> 00:40:11,180
when I did this stand but<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is great</font>

888
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:14,780
so based on that what do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys think</font>

889
00:40:11,180 --> 00:40:17,328
for published known vulnerabilities

890
00:40:14,780 --> 00:40:19,760
against WordPress that the people are

891
00:40:17,329 --> 00:40:25,819
vulnerable less than fifty percent more

892
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:35,020
than 50 persons what's<font color="#CCCCCC"> that 65 less than</font>

893
00:40:25,819 --> 00:40:35,020
65 more than 65 tough<font color="#E5E5E5"> crowd</font>

894
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:42,578
so a couple of things could possibly

895
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:45,369
contribute to that I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think having a</font>

896
00:40:42,579 --> 00:40:47,050
helping people update really<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

897
00:40:45,369 --> 00:40:48,040
contributes to that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> other thing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

898
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:49,750
they've had it they've had a number of

899
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:51,970
vulnerabilities that had some serious

900
00:40:49,750 --> 00:40:53,530
problems with actually at one point

901
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:56,859
somebody broke in and tainted some of

902
00:40:53,530 --> 00:40:58,150
the code that<font color="#E5E5E5"> was set up for release but</font>

903
00:40:56,859 --> 00:41:00,400
they've done a pretty good job of

904
00:40:58,150 --> 00:41:02,589
helping people update telling them to

905
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:04,210
update making it very obvious in the

906
00:41:02,589 --> 00:41:05,950
administrative UI that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to</font>

907
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:08,619
update and here's how you do it so good

908
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:11,200
driving of user behavior so that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

909
00:41:08,619 --> 00:41:13,119
cool good on<font color="#E5E5E5"> WordPress for doing that</font>

910
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:15,819
good on anybody who makes it easy for

911
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:17,380
their users to stay secure on the other

912
00:41:15,819 --> 00:41:18,759
hand there is something else<font color="#E5E5E5"> that could</font>

913
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:20,890
contribute to this metric which is

914
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:23,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">WordPress doesn't have any formal</font>

915
00:41:20,890 --> 00:41:24,879
security notification policy all the

916
00:41:23,109 --> 00:41:26,859
rest of these ones that i showed you did

917
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,390
you know you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> go to joomla and look</font>

918
00:41:26,859 --> 00:41:29,470
up what all the joomla advisory go

919
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:31,328
<font color="#E5E5E5">Drupal and look up what are all the</font>

920
00:41:29,470 --> 00:41:32,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">Drupal advisors you can't for wordpress</font>

921
00:41:31,329 --> 00:41:34,869
so good on them for one thing very much

922
00:41:32,950 --> 00:41:37,629
bad on them for<font color="#E5E5E5"> another so it could be</font>

923
00:41:34,869 --> 00:41:39,309
<font color="#CCCCCC">that there is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something more recent than</font>

924
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:41,079
that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I have no way of finding out</font>

925
00:41:39,309 --> 00:41:46,359
about it I google they check some things

926
00:41:41,079 --> 00:41:49,390
but so<font color="#E5E5E5"> definitely a story of yes but no</font>

927
00:41:46,359 --> 00:41:50,859
so anybody if anybody works on<font color="#E5E5E5"> WordPress</font>

928
00:41:49,390 --> 00:41:54,940
here come up<font color="#E5E5E5"> and chat with me afterwards</font>

929
00:41:50,859 --> 00:41:57,400
I'd love to help you get you guys you

930
00:41:54,940 --> 00:41:58,809
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> going with that certainly as</font>

931
00:41:57,400 --> 00:42:00,940
vulnerability researchers as well a

932
00:41:58,809 --> 00:42:03,670
really management people make our job so

933
00:42:00,940 --> 00:42:05,319
much easier<font color="#CCCCCC"> all right so I just because</font>

934
00:42:03,670 --> 00:42:06,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">I had to pick on them a little bit i</font>

935
00:42:05,319 --> 00:42:08,859
said ok<font color="#E5E5E5"> what about medium</font>

936
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:10,990
vulnerabilities this is a medium based

937
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:14,380
on any of the the rating systems out

938
00:42:10,990 --> 00:42:15,520
there so 21.5 percent you know even<font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

939
00:42:14,380 --> 00:42:22,000
we go down to it<font color="#CCCCCC"> two mediums i think</font>

940
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:25,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is this is a if you are if you are</font>

941
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,240
an author on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> blog then somebody can</font>

942
00:42:25,180 --> 00:42:30,490
trick you into inserting script so you

943
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:33,009
know there's some<font color="#E5E5E5"> more significant</font>

944
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:36,549
conditions for this one but yeah that's

945
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:38,170
kind of kind of cool for<font color="#CCCCCC"> wordpress so</font>

946
00:42:36,549 --> 00:42:40,030
anyway hopefully contravening a little

947
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:41,410
bit of conventional wisdom and salvaging

948
00:42:40,030 --> 00:42:44,799
their their reputation there i am not

949
00:42:41,410 --> 00:42:46,240
paid by wordpress so version clusters

950
00:42:44,799 --> 00:42:49,809
obviously we said we're talking about

951
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:50,939
sets of possibilities and it makes sense

952
00:42:49,809 --> 00:42:53,280
that there are some version

953
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:55,980
that are going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> difficult to</font>

954
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:58,680
distinguish so here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of a</font>

955
00:42:55,980 --> 00:42:59,970
visualization of that any of these any

956
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:03,029
of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> lines that are going back and</font>

957
00:42:59,970 --> 00:43:05,609
forth mean that when we did these scans

958
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:08,099
there was a scan that came<font color="#CCCCCC"> up that said</font>

959
00:43:05,609 --> 00:43:14,670
hey I know its version 1.3 point 11 12

960
00:43:08,099 --> 00:43:16,680
13<font color="#E5E5E5"> 14 15 or 18 but I can't tell so that</font>

961
00:43:14,670 --> 00:43:18,599
we return that version set instead of a

962
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:20,819
specific<font color="#E5E5E5"> version so you can see from</font>

963
00:43:18,599 --> 00:43:23,520
time to time we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> these little groups</font>

964
00:43:20,819 --> 00:43:25,140
of versions that get confused more lines

965
00:43:23,520 --> 00:43:27,720
thicker lines means that happen more

966
00:43:25,140 --> 00:43:29,460
often but even in the worst case

967
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:32,730
scenario we end up pinning it down to

968
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:37,050
you know three four versions so that's

969
00:43:32,730 --> 00:43:39,690
four that's sort of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the graph of how</font>

970
00:43:37,050 --> 00:43:43,109
accurate we're often going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be 44</font>

971
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:44,970
mediawiki for<font color="#E5E5E5"> drupal found more of those</font>

972
00:43:43,109 --> 00:43:46,140
so just sort of thicker lines in general

973
00:43:44,970 --> 00:43:48,240
but you can kind of see<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

974
00:43:46,140 --> 00:43:50,490
segmentation forming don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at any</font>

975
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:56,009
individual details just look at where

976
00:43:50,490 --> 00:43:57,779
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hemispheres start coming up spit we</font>

977
00:43:56,010 --> 00:43:59,730
can do a pretty good job<font color="#E5E5E5"> on that we</font>

978
00:43:57,780 --> 00:44:01,380
generally pin it right down except for

979
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:02,849
<font color="#CCCCCC">that one cluster over</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there but you can</font>

980
00:44:01,380 --> 00:44:04,770
see that those are all release

981
00:44:02,849 --> 00:44:08,579
candidates so it's no surprise that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

982
00:44:04,770 --> 00:44:10,589
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> those confused all the time so a</font>

983
00:44:08,579 --> 00:44:12,869
couple of war stories sometimes you see

984
00:44:10,589 --> 00:44:15,540
this data and just have to go digging

985
00:44:12,869 --> 00:44:18,930
into the story behind it this is a

986
00:44:15,540 --> 00:44:21,210
wordpress blog that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> running an</font>

987
00:44:18,930 --> 00:44:22,319
astonishingly out of date version and so

988
00:44:21,210 --> 00:44:25,170
I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

989
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:28,619
a guy who's got lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of big talk about</font>

990
00:44:25,170 --> 00:44:31,079
security and Russian hackers he's vying

991
00:44:28,619 --> 00:44:32,339
for his the the sanctity of his website

992
00:44:31,079 --> 00:44:33,390
with these Russian hackers who keep

993
00:44:32,339 --> 00:44:36,509
putting stuff up on there and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said</font>

994
00:44:33,390 --> 00:44:39,299
well that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really weird fingerprint him</font>

995
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:44,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">I doesn't show but yeah he's six years</font>

996
00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:46,020
behind on his updates so I I think he

997
00:44:44,550 --> 00:44:48,900
was one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the only</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people who was that</font>

998
00:44:46,020 --> 00:44:52,380
far behind i was astonished so some some

999
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:54,540
people you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk on one side and and</font>

1000
00:44:52,380 --> 00:44:57,720
have skills but but are missing the

1001
00:44:54,540 --> 00:45:02,540
basics here are some people who actually

1002
00:44:57,720 --> 00:45:06,709
do a pretty cool blog like this was with

1003
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:07,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're you so yeah I was reading this</font>

1004
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:10,820
this post I thought it was<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

1005
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:12,350
interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> I said huh remote file</font>

1006
00:45:10,820 --> 00:45:13,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">includes I seem to recall hearing</font>

1007
00:45:12,350 --> 00:45:17,060
something about that so I'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get a</font>

1008
00:45:13,430 --> 00:45:19,490
fingerprint them<font color="#E5E5E5"> I running a Drupal 6 12</font>

1009
00:45:17,060 --> 00:45:25,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">all right uh quick let's go look up</font>

1010
00:45:19,490 --> 00:45:26,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">Drupal 6 12 yeah</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Wow so yeah you guys</font>

1011
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:31,040
have got a vulnerability in your site go

1012
00:45:26,990 --> 00:45:35,509
fix it sorry<font color="#E5E5E5"> hope it wouldn't mind being</font>

1013
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:38,029
picked on some observations<font color="#E5E5E5"> as you saw</font>

1014
00:45:35,510 --> 00:45:39,680
from that about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how it starts off sort</font>

1015
00:45:38,030 --> 00:45:43,880
of very low at the bottom and then ramps

1016
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:47,210
up to<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that bell curve within the last</font>

1017
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:49,250
you know 328 versions people's tendus

1018
00:45:47,210 --> 00:45:50,930
most of the weight is up there<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

1019
00:45:49,250 --> 00:45:53,270
top most<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the weight is in is within</font>

1020
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:56,660
that last three day versions but we've

1021
00:45:53,270 --> 00:45:58,430
found<font color="#E5E5E5"> that for security purposes that's</font>

1022
00:45:56,660 --> 00:46:00,799
not good<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough you really need to be in</font>

1023
00:45:58,430 --> 00:46:04,730
the last you know one or two or three

1024
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:07,760
versions to stay out of those those

1025
00:46:04,730 --> 00:46:10,520
vulnerabilities we see as I pointed out

1026
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:13,220
a huge spike at version provider package

1027
00:46:10,520 --> 00:46:15,710
managers and hosting services so you

1028
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:17,720
can't try you can't blindly trust those

1029
00:46:15,710 --> 00:46:19,760
to keep you up to date there is a

1030
00:46:17,720 --> 00:46:24,020
possibility some of those were back

1031
00:46:19,760 --> 00:46:26,480
porting the patches but not happening in

1032
00:46:24,020 --> 00:46:28,130
a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of cases we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go back and see if</font>

1033
00:46:26,480 --> 00:46:31,190
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> changes</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the numbers too much I don't</font>

1034
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:32,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">think it will so and also improperly</font>

1035
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:38,360
remove web apps saw this<font color="#E5E5E5"> a number of</font>

1036
00:46:32,780 --> 00:46:39,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">cases if a site installed a Drupal and</font>

1037
00:46:38,360 --> 00:46:41,330
then six months later decided they

1038
00:46:39,470 --> 00:46:43,640
wanted to go to joomla they would just

1039
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:45,770
install the new one right on<font color="#E5E5E5"> top of it</font>

1040
00:46:43,640 --> 00:46:48,650
replaced<font color="#E5E5E5"> the index PHP and call it good</font>

1041
00:46:45,770 --> 00:46:50,030
and so in their vulnerability reports

1042
00:46:48,650 --> 00:46:52,040
and their scan reports and their audits

1043
00:46:50,030 --> 00:46:53,960
they would say<font color="#E5E5E5"> yes our fun facing web</font>

1044
00:46:52,040 --> 00:46:56,600
app is up to date it's at the latest

1045
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:57,920
version entirely forgetting that there

1046
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,660
is this other thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> on there the</font>

1047
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:01,580
functionality still<font color="#E5E5E5"> exists the database</font>

1048
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:04,160
realistically is probably still intact

1049
00:47:01,580 --> 00:47:05,900
and you can go hit that code and it will

1050
00:47:04,160 --> 00:47:07,910
function perfectly fine it's just<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1051
00:47:05,900 --> 00:47:09,590
nobody normally sees it so those are

1052
00:47:07,910 --> 00:47:11,899
some things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was able to turn up</font>

1053
00:47:09,590 --> 00:47:14,580
when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you do the the app guessing and you</font>

1054
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:17,910
say huh joomla and drupal that's

1055
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:20,040
net visible test QA sites also saw

1056
00:47:17,910 --> 00:47:22,020
instances of where the the main site

1057

staging dot example calm and that site

1060
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:34,110
was very much not<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to date so if you</font>

1061
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:36,510
are not scanning yourself if you're not

1062
00:47:34,110 --> 00:47:39,630
aware of all of the properties and all

1063
00:47:36,510 --> 00:47:41,730
of the the apps that you're exposing to

1064
00:47:39,630 --> 00:47:45,720
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> world definitely first thing you</font>

1065
00:47:41,730 --> 00:47:48,450
need to become<font color="#E5E5E5"> aware of those precision</font>

1066
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:52,770
how do we do on all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of these scans all</font>

1067
00:47:48,450 --> 00:47:54,330
the machines that we hid average

1068
00:47:52,770 --> 00:47:57,180
versions that we came<font color="#E5E5E5"> up with was about</font>

1069
00:47:54,330 --> 00:47:59,819
was three versions these couple of

1070
00:47:57,180 --> 00:48:01,140
things some japanese<font color="#E5E5E5"> versions of</font>

1071
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:03,570
wordpress actually I didn't have the

1072
00:48:01,140 --> 00:48:05,400
Japanese files so that bumps those up

1073
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:07,050
but realistically if you use blind

1074
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:09,450
elephant either as a standalone tool or

1075
00:48:07,050 --> 00:48:11,430
if you're building<font color="#E5E5E5"> it into us as a</font>

1076
00:48:09,450 --> 00:48:12,720
library into some app of your own you

1077
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:15,029
should generally be able to pin things

1078
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:16,980
down<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one or two versions so that</font>

1079
00:48:15,030 --> 00:48:21,660
tends to be good<font color="#CCCCCC"> enough for our purposes</font>

1080
00:48:16,980 --> 00:48:23,850
speed I was hoping to not send you out

1081
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:28,350
to get<font color="#CCCCCC"> a cup of coffee and we do all</font>

1082
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:29,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">right the the average is six point four</font>

1083
00:48:28,350 --> 00:48:32,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">seconds six and a half</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seconds</font>

1084
00:48:29,790 --> 00:48:33,960
ninety-five percent of scans are done

1085
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:35,339
with intent ninety-five percent of

1086
00:48:33,960 --> 00:48:36,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">fingerprints are done within 10 seconds</font>

1087
00:48:35,340 --> 00:48:39,870
guessing will take you a little bit

1088
00:48:36,780 --> 00:48:41,250
longer so how do we do we're talking

1089
00:48:39,870 --> 00:48:43,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things that we want any web</font>

1090
00:48:41,250 --> 00:48:45,330
application scanner it's very generic we

1091
00:48:43,620 --> 00:48:48,330
use the<font color="#CCCCCC"> same code for all apps and</font>

1092
00:48:45,330 --> 00:48:51,029
plugins it's very fast get you done in

1093
00:48:48,330 --> 00:48:53,370
under 10 seconds hopefully low resources

1094
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:54,900
it's about that's the<font color="#CCCCCC"> average what we</font>

1095
00:48:53,370 --> 00:48:56,100
pull down from the remote<font color="#E5E5E5"> site it can be</font>

1096
00:48:54,900 --> 00:49:00,180
a little bit less a little bit more

1097
00:48:56,100 --> 00:49:02,700
accurate<font color="#E5E5E5"> to three versions pick up an ID</font>

1098
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:04,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">on ninety-eight percent of sites</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font>

1099
00:49:02,700 --> 00:49:05,939
figure out<font color="#E5E5E5"> what's what's up with that</font>

1100
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:08,610

1102
00:49:08,610 --> 00:49:13,380
removal that was what drove us down the

1103
00:49:11,340 --> 00:49:14,790
road to go to this technique so yes it

1104
00:49:13,380 --> 00:49:16,470
<font color="#CCCCCC">is absolutely resistant to hardening</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1105
00:49:14,790 --> 00:49:18,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">banner removal and then it's very easy</font>

1106
00:49:16,470 --> 00:49:20,370
to support new apps an hour or<font color="#CCCCCC"> two hours</font>

1107
00:49:18,270 --> 00:49:23,940
get everything dump it into a directory

1108
00:49:20,370 --> 00:49:25,650
unpack it and go so if you have apps

1109
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:27,569
that you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to support or help support</font>

app and completely removed sometimes

1113
00:49:32,099 --> 00:49:36,420
that can be a false positive partial or

1114
00:49:34,049 --> 00:49:38,729
manual upgrades we do<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay on catching</font>

1115
00:49:36,420 --> 00:49:40,289
these changed appt route maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> it was</font>

tool directly against<font color="#CCCCCC"> Wikipedia because</font>

1119
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:46,769
they have everything hosted on you know

1120
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:48,420
instead<font color="#CCCCCC"> of en</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> wikipedia or we look</font>

forward it's on static that<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wikipedia</font>

1122
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:53,249
<font color="#E5E5E5">and we can perhaps put in some logic to</font>

1123
00:49:50,249 --> 00:49:54,959
look at figuring that out<font color="#E5E5E5"> forked</font>

1124
00:49:53,249 --> 00:49:56,549
projects and then here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> here's the</font>

1125
00:49:54,959 --> 00:49:58,919
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last thing is the Achilles heel of</font>

1126
00:49:56,549 --> 00:50:00,599
static file fingerprinting is it's using

1127
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:03,150
cryptographic hashes so if someone

1128
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:04,619
systematically made changes to every

1129
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:07,079
single static file we wanted to fetch

1130
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:10,259
this technique as currently implemented

1131
00:50:07,079 --> 00:50:12,209
goes away completely so people don't do

1132
00:50:10,259 --> 00:50:14,009
it yet we<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually want to make that</font>

1133
00:50:12,209 --> 00:50:15,779
available I've got somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's</font>

1139
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:30,269
there's two sides of this where we are

providing tooling<font color="#E5E5E5"> on both sides so it is</font>

still figuring<font color="#E5E5E5"> out the license it will</font>

be an open source license of some point

1145
00:50:39,509 --> 00:50:42,719
will have that figure it out very<font color="#E5E5E5"> soon</font>

patches yet which<font color="#CCCCCC"> are appliance vendors</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">version they'll patch the only bit</font>

1159
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:37,820
that's needed for a critical voluntary

1160
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:40,250
etc<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you said</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you doubted that</font>

1161
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:42,860
much of that was going on but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I wonder</font>

1162
00:51:40,250 --> 00:51:45,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">how you could justify all sort of</font>

1163
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:47,180
qualify that statement<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's in other</font>

1164
00:51:45,260 --> 00:51:50,540
words you might<font color="#E5E5E5"> be overestimating the</font>

1165
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:52,520
number of vulnerable systems yes I very

1166
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:54,290
good very<font color="#CCCCCC"> much could be overestimating</font>

1167
00:51:52,520 --> 00:51:55,640
the number of vulnerable systems and and

1168
00:51:54,290 --> 00:51:57,500
maybe<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> should back off</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that and say</font>

1169
00:51:55,640 --> 00:51:58,850
it's entirely possible that some percent

1170
00:51:57,500 --> 00:52:03,440
of people are back<font color="#E5E5E5"> putting those patches</font>

1171
00:51:58,850 --> 00:52:06,020
and so I am over reporting and and that

1172
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:15,170
would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be good research to do to follow</font>

1173
00:52:06,020 --> 00:52:17,509
<font color="#E5E5E5">up on this so do some some of that or</font>

1174
00:52:15,170 --> 00:52:19,070
find people who have those hosting

1175
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:21,290
providers and check<font color="#E5E5E5"> and see if the</font>

1176
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:23,300
vulnerable stuff is in place on a couple

1177
00:52:21,290 --> 00:52:25,040
on a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of ones like four for the</font>

1178
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:26,660
the ubuntu and debian package managers

1179
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:27,980
actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> went and look to see if there</font>

1180
00:52:26,660 --> 00:52:30,020
was any back porting going on and it

1181
00:52:27,980 --> 00:52:32,660
wasn't so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i checked the i checked some</font>

1182
00:52:30,020 --> 00:52:35,240
of the package manager side anecdotally

1183
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:37,490
not statistically but<font color="#CCCCCC"> hosting and</font>

1184
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:41,180
hosting managers<font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't get I didn't</font>

1185
00:52:37,490 --> 00:52:42,770
hit<font color="#E5E5E5"> that as much certainly we can go do</font>

1186
00:52:41,180 --> 00:52:44,210
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> and I'll rerun these numbers</font>

1187
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:45,590
because I'd rather than be sort of more

1188
00:52:44,210 --> 00:52:53,090
accurate and a little more<font color="#E5E5E5"> conservative</font>

1189
00:52:45,590 --> 00:52:55,340
that'd be good<font color="#CCCCCC"> huh yes then then we have</font>

1190
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:57,550
reported<font color="#CCCCCC"> you as vulnerable where you are</font>

1191
00:52:55,340 --> 00:52:57,550
not

1192
00:53:00,640 --> 00:53:09,420
changed

1193
00:53:10,970 --> 00:53:18,680
I think there's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad guys in some</font>

1194
00:53:17,390 --> 00:53:19,910
cases are doing fingerprinting in other

1195
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:24,770
cases they're just launching the attack

1196
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:26,210
so the this this has less utility for

1197
00:53:24,770 --> 00:53:30,259
for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> people who just want to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

1198
00:53:26,210 --> 00:53:31,490
there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and own systems but if hosting</font>

1199
00:53:30,260 --> 00:53:33,800
providers are going to get really<font color="#E5E5E5"> clever</font>

1200
00:53:31,490 --> 00:53:35,029
and apply<font color="#CCCCCC"> that technique of going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1201
00:53:33,800 --> 00:53:36,680
making a trivial modification to all

1202
00:53:35,030 --> 00:53:40,370
those files that's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that could</font>

1203
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:42,350
absolutely do that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would they would nuke</font>

1204
00:53:40,370 --> 00:53:44,690
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> at sort of at the hosting provider</font>

1205
00:53:42,350 --> 00:53:46,069
level so I don't have necessarily right

1206
00:53:44,690 --> 00:53:47,900
now a recommendation on which way they

1207
00:53:46,070 --> 00:53:49,730
should<font color="#CCCCCC"> go I think the bad guys are just</font>

1208
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:52,490
going to launch<font color="#E5E5E5"> the exact same attack on</font>

1209
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:54,860
every machine they come across and and

1210
00:53:52,490 --> 00:54:03,560
see what happens so it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the lowest</font>

1211
00:53:54,860 --> 00:54:05,420
effort for them yeah on a practical note

1212
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:06,440
peaceful as this tools<font color="#E5E5E5"> got a predicated</font>

1213
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:08,300
on the availability of up-to-date

1214
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:14,000
signatures is their model yet but

1215
00:54:08,300 --> 00:54:17,480
signature sharing in place etc yes the

1216
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:19,130
the svn has signatures in it right now

1217
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:22,160
I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to figure out what the right</font>

1218
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:24,710
model is to be able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to accept signatures</font>

1219
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:26,660
from people who want to contribute so

1220
00:54:24,710 --> 00:54:28,310
these are actually just pickle files

1221
00:54:26,660 --> 00:54:30,410
right now so there is some danger and

1222
00:54:28,310 --> 00:54:32,750
just freely passing those around so I

1223
00:54:30,410 --> 00:54:35,839
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get some validation on that and</font>

1224
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:38,210
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't know what the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> right model is for</font>

1225
00:54:35,840 --> 00:54:42,440
developing sort of you know the standard

1226
00:54:38,210 --> 00:54:43,700
blind elephant<font color="#CCCCCC"> WordPress data files we</font>

1227
00:54:42,440 --> 00:54:45,890
will come<font color="#CCCCCC"> up with something I'm open to</font>

1228
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:47,540
any community suggestions or you know

1229
00:54:45,890 --> 00:54:49,100
maybe there is merging or some kind of

1230
00:54:47,540 --> 00:54:50,750
voting about this is a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> good file</font>

1231
00:54:49,100 --> 00:54:53,810
I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to try and keep the fragmentation</font>

1232
00:54:50,750 --> 00:54:55,310
down but I do want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get as many people</font>

1233
00:54:53,810 --> 00:54:56,840
contributing as possible does that

1234
00:54:55,310 --> 00:55:02,690
answer your question I didn't actually

1235
00:54:56,840 --> 00:55:04,580
see who yes Patrick I've got two

1236
00:55:02,690 --> 00:55:08,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">questions one is did you see any</font>

1237
00:55:04,580 --> 00:55:11,000
correlation between open source and cots

1238
00:55:08,090 --> 00:55:12,740
software and the second is have you

1239
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:16,250
looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at maybe putting this into a</font>

1240
00:55:12,740 --> 00:55:18,350
hosted database like ssl labs funny<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1241
00:55:16,250 --> 00:55:20,600
mention ssl labs actually I<font color="#E5E5E5"> even helped</font>

1242
00:55:18,350 --> 00:55:24,120
me out with some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the getting getting</font>

1243
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:26,580
the hosts that to scan I haven't looked

1244
00:55:24,120 --> 00:55:28,920
at doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I'm not entirely certain</font>

1245
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:30,060
where I saw you were going but if<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's a</font>

1246
00:55:28,920 --> 00:55:31,470
good<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea come up in discuss with me</font>

1247
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:32,880
afterwards because there's lots<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> other</font>

1248
00:55:31,470 --> 00:55:35,399
places<font color="#E5E5E5"> we can go with this and then the</font>

1249
00:55:32,880 --> 00:55:39,330
first part of the question was Oh

1250
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:41,010
commercial versus don't didn't really

1251
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:42,210
have access to a lot of commercial

1252
00:55:41,010 --> 00:55:43,980
software so that's why you saw that

1253
00:55:42,210 --> 00:55:45,930
these were primarily open source because

1254
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:47,880
that was easy to get to if anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> wants</font>

1255
00:55:45,930 --> 00:55:50,970
to help<font color="#E5E5E5"> me start creating more more</font>

1256
00:55:47,880 --> 00:55:55,020
fingerprint databases for that

1257
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:56,939
commercial stuff we can do that unmask

1258
00:55:55,020 --> 00:55:59,220
or we can start collecting it sort of

1259
00:55:56,940 --> 00:56:00,180
version by version by version from

1260
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:01,439
people that we know who are running

1261
00:56:00,180 --> 00:56:04,980
those versions I'm also looking at

1262
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:06,300
possibly doing the something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that will</font>

1263
00:56:04,980 --> 00:56:09,300
reach out<font color="#E5E5E5"> if it knows a little bit about</font>

1264
00:56:06,300 --> 00:56:10,890
a nap it will take a new version pull

1265
00:56:09,300 --> 00:56:12,720
the data down and incorporate that into

1266
00:56:10,890 --> 00:56:14,370
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> database so you know do it the hard</font>

1267
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:16,169
way but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> must rather do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it the easy</font>

1268
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:20,520
way if people want to people have access

1269
00:56:16,170 --> 00:56:21,840
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> that stuff so it sounds like in order</font>

1270
00:56:20,520 --> 00:56:24,180
to run this you would have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a</font>

1271
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:25,740
pretty extensive collection of all the

1272
00:56:24,180 --> 00:56:28,169
<font color="#E5E5E5">different applications you would</font>

1273
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:29,669
potentially want a fingerprint and then

1274
00:56:28,170 --> 00:56:31,470
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> the other virgins what kind of data</font>

1275
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:33,810
