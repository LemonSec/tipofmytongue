00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,529
so welcome to the 145 cyber war and

2
00:00:03,540 --> 00:00:10,800
peace talk today given by Chris Sumner

3
00:00:07,529 --> 00:00:14,129
Chris<font color="#E5E5E5"> started his career back</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in the</font>

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:17,760
dark ages of 1999 doing security

5
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:21,960
management for a fortune 100 company

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:24,449
moved from there Chris began to work

7
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,859
personally on data visualization and as

8
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:27,960
you'll soon hear actually has an

9
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,060
interesting story<font color="#E5E5E5"> about Tony Hawk so I</font>

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:31,800
thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pretty cool today he'll</font>

11
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,420
be<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about using data</font>

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,210
visualization tools<font color="#CCCCCC"> in social networks</font>

13
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:43,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">so please join me in welcoming Chris</font>

thanks for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the introduction and Chris</font>

20
00:00:53,969 --> 00:00:59,550
Sumner I started my career a little

21
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:03,000
longer ago than in 1999 but got into

22
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:04,860
security full time around then so first

23
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:07,200
of all thanks for coming today there's a

24
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:09,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">another talk about ATMs and so I'm</font>

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,510
pretty stoked that we've got such a big

26
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:15,960
audience actually thanks very much so my

27
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:19,409
talk today<font color="#E5E5E5"> is on social networking and</font>

28
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:22,979
data visualization and extending data

29
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:25,530
visualization tools to enumerate social

30
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:29,429
networks maybe a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit quicker than</font>

31
00:01:25,530 --> 00:01:35,430
them by hand or in a<font color="#E5E5E5"> non visual way</font>

32
00:01:29,430 --> 00:01:37,829
before I start I've got a disclaimer

33
00:01:35,430 --> 00:01:40,439
that I need to were to share I'm

34
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:42,869
speaking for myself not<font color="#E5E5E5"> as part of my</font>

35
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:45,508
company so if anybody knows who I work

36
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:47,610
for then it's important at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> let you</font>

37
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:49,470
know that<font color="#E5E5E5"> oh this is you know on behalf</font>

38
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:53,369
of me doesn't reflect the opinions of my

39
00:01:49,470 --> 00:01:57,990
the organization for which I work so

40
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:59,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">okay</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so what are</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you in for today first</font>

41
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,310
we're going to start with a brief

42
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:06,149
introduction<font color="#E5E5E5"> to social network analysis</font>

43
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:08,069
and brief intro to visualization about

44
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:11,009
10 or 15 minutes I'll go pretty quick

45
00:02:08,068 --> 00:02:12,549
there's a white paper with a lot of the

46
00:02:11,008 --> 00:02:15,010
science behind it

47
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:18,520
able and then going to take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

48
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:21,100
case study with Twitter and a tool

49
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:23,740
called multi go and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> finally we'll</font>

50
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:27,910
wrap up with case study and it's a

51
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:32,620
little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> darker involving Nigerian</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 419</font>

52
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:36,400
crime<font color="#E5E5E5"> versus multi go so the goals of</font>

53
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:39,520
the tour today really I guess firstly

54
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">its to to share what I've been what I've</font>

55
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:44,680
been doing a high level and give you

56
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:47,440
some<font color="#E5E5E5"> appreciation of the possibilities</font>

57
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:51,310
of data visualization in this kind of

58
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,780
field so hoping that some of you will go

59
00:02:51,310 --> 00:02:54,220
I that's pretty you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that's pretty</font>

60
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:57,430
neat I can apply this in slightly

61
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:59,800
different contexts you know and maybe

62
00:02:57,430 --> 00:03:02,590
encourages folks to go and explore a lot

63
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:05,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">of the data that's out there so that you</font>

64
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:06,910
know you can apply it over in a work

65
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:12,070
situation or for you know analyzing

66
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:14,230
networks yourself so who's to talk aimed

67
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:15,940
at just want to be clear on this in<font color="#E5E5E5"> case</font>

68
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:18,280
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> are you know coming over already</font>

69
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:21,370
got you know a significant level of data

70
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:25,000
visualization knowledge or significant

71
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:28,480
level of social networking data<font color="#CCCCCC"> mining</font>

72
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,810
knowledge so really if you fit into this

73
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:34,660
category you should be<font color="#E5E5E5"> in for a good</font>

74
00:03:31,810 --> 00:03:37,900
time I can't promise that but see me

75
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:39,820
afterwards if if it wasn't if you fit

76
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:44,140
into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next category here where</font>

77
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:45,340
you're either you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> really really</font>

78
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:47,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">experience we've had some good</font>

79
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:49,959
experience with data visualization or

80
00:03:47,230 --> 00:03:52,030
with social networking analysis then you

81
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:54,220
may get some some crossover and see how

82
00:03:52,030 --> 00:03:56,590
it can use different<font color="#CCCCCC"> techniques in kind</font>

83
00:03:54,220 --> 00:04:01,330
of different way and if you fit into the

84
00:03:56,590 --> 00:04:03,400
to the latter category you probably get

85
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:05,440
what I'm talking about already but that

86
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:06,880
may still still be something<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know in</font>

87
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:09,760
it for you so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's really what the you</font>

88
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:13,209
know who the talks aimed at so briefly

89
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:17,108
Who am I I'm obviously I'm Chris Sumner

90
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:18,880
but I signed<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to Twitter last summer</font>

91
00:04:17,108 --> 00:04:20,140
and like a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of people who sign up to</font>

92
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:22,690
Twitter the name that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want has</font>

93
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:24,880
already been taken by somebody else so I

94
00:04:22,690 --> 00:04:25,870
ended up choosing the sub my sister

95
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:27,639
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> my</font>

96
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:30,639
game at school and<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ever since has</font>

97
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:32,380
<font color="#E5E5E5">been sucky and you know it's one of</font>

98
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:37,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">those things that I sort of kind of</font>

99
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:41,050
regret now and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> never</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mind so by</font>

100
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:43,780
day a work in corporate corporate

101
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:46,030
security actually do program management

102
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:49,809
around security development<font color="#CCCCCC"> lifecycle</font>

103
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:52,299
and outside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm interested in</font>

104
00:04:49,810 --> 00:04:55,360
data analysis not usually<font color="#E5E5E5"> social</font>

105
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:59,770
networks but looking at large datasets

106
00:04:55,360 --> 00:05:01,300
visualizing that to help me understand a

107
00:04:59,770 --> 00:05:03,969
little bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the data at a high</font>

108
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:06,070
level before drilling down and since

109
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:09,280
last year really got into social<font color="#CCCCCC"> media</font>

110
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:14,020
in a pretty big way and<font color="#E5E5E5"> also def con</font>

111
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:16,388
chapter called DC 4420 in London a quick

112
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:18,698
<font color="#CCCCCC">note if you're you know if you've not</font>

113
00:05:16,389 --> 00:05:21,400
been to a local<font color="#CCCCCC"> DEFCON chapter really</font>

114
00:05:18,699 --> 00:05:23,410
worth going it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> bite sized bits of</font>

115
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:25,419
DEFCON throughout the year so you know

116
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:29,919
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that post DEFCON</font>

117
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:32,740
depression thing going on if you get

118
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,539
that like I do and a strange sequence of

119
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:40,630
events led me to appearing here so I

120
00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:42,669
you'll obviously see why shortly so<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

121
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:45,219
the introduction piece social network

122
00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:48,370
analysis a target-rich environment is

123
00:05:45,220 --> 00:05:53,169
over a problem or an opportunity

124
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:54,970
depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on which side of the you know</font>

125
00:05:53,169 --> 00:05:58,448
table you you're looking at<font color="#E5E5E5"> it from</font>

126
00:05:54,970 --> 00:06:00,880
social network analysis has<font color="#CCCCCC"> been around</font>

127
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:04,389
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> since since the Greeks but this</font>

128
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:07,900
guy here Jacob<font color="#E5E5E5"> Marino was pretty widely</font>

129
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:09,910
credited<font color="#CCCCCC"> of being so the originator of</font>

130
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:12,520
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> diagram which should be pretty</font>

131
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:14,949
familiar with<font color="#E5E5E5"> by the by the end of the</font>

132
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:16,599
talk this kind of thing so that<font color="#CCCCCC"> was</font>

133
00:06:14,949 --> 00:06:21,039
published first in New York Times in

134
00:06:16,599 --> 00:06:23,830
1933 and really he saw led the field in

135
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:26,830
understanding dynamics of social

136
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:29,169
networks so a little bit more<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font>

137
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:31,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the white paper and then a</font>

138
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:33,280
target-rich environment<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was</font>

139
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:35,169
something that I kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of figured would</font>

140
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,940
be the case but had never actually

141
00:06:35,169 --> 00:06:42,330
looked into<font color="#E5E5E5"> until I decided to you know</font>

142
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:45,540
submit a paper for the talk<font color="#E5E5E5"> a read a</font>

143
00:06:42,330 --> 00:06:48,930
report that was out this year or late

144
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:50,790
last year by Cisco stating that there

145
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:54,630
was<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like 21 exabytes of data</font>

146
00:06:50,790 --> 00:06:56,640
flowing around the world per month<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

147
00:06:54,630 --> 00:06:58,260
the amount of data<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's available now</font>

148
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,969
thats or personal information

149
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:03,960
photographs and stuff is just like

150
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:06,660
exploding so you're getting more and

151
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:10,020
more data<font color="#E5E5E5"> out there from more and more</font>

152
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:12,990
people which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you know pretty pretty</font>

153
00:07:10,020 --> 00:07:16,770
interesting if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you like exploring data I</font>

154
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:19,530
should probably get out more so<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook</font>

155
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:21,659
<font color="#E5E5E5">recently actually if you look at the</font>

156
00:07:19,530 --> 00:07:23,159
white paper it says 350 million users

157
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,440
and then before I got here said it's you

158
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,120
know hitting 500 ish million users of

159
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,740
course you know some people<font color="#CCCCCC"> may have</font>

160
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">more than one account although that's</font>

161
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:35,010
you know sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of forbidden but you know</font>

162
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:37,290
such as life then there's something else

163
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:39,690
interesting there's a bunch<font color="#E5E5E5"> of studies</font>

164
00:07:37,290 --> 00:07:41,850
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> have been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> going on Stanford have</font>

165
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:44,370
done quite a lot on this looking at what

166
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:47,280
<font color="#E5E5E5">people say and actually what people do</font>

167
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:50,700
so I kind of turned this the privacy

168
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,289
paradox and it's where the students

169
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:56,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">interviewed mostly said yeah I take</font>

170
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:58,110
privacy very seriously yet when you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

171
00:07:56,370 --> 00:08:00,060
they analyzed the behavior of these

172
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:02,430
students<font color="#E5E5E5"> on social networks like</font>

173
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:05,070
Facebook they did the opposite of what

174
00:08:02,430 --> 00:08:10,919
they said<font color="#E5E5E5"> they want to do so for example</font>

175
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:14,520
89% used their use their real name 60 or

176
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:18,690
61 percent have an identifiable photo

177
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:20,159
online and so on I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> recently you</font>

178
00:08:18,690 --> 00:08:22,860
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of the privacy concerns</font>

179
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:26,310
around<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook a lot of people are</font>

180
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,690
still what I term promiscuous you know

181
00:08:26,310 --> 00:08:30,810
they'll be friends with anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll</font>

182
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:34,020
post anything up there I mean it's a

183
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:35,250
data miners dream actually and I'll talk

184
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:37,289
a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that because</font>

185
00:08:35,250 --> 00:08:40,409
there's some seriously cool stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> going</font>

186
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:42,479
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this space and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then finally</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> saw my</font>

187
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:45,390
personal favorite really there's a great

188
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,210
paper it's a pretty pretty big paper by

189
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:49,620
a guy called Daniels olive and called

190
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:52,000
her you know I've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> nothing to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hide</font>

191
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">and over misunderstandings of</font>

192
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,930
the sea and<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind of goes along with</font>

193
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:58,750
the whole privacy paradox of people

194
00:08:55,930 --> 00:09:02,140
putting more and more stuff out there so

195
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:04,390
we've got social network analysis and

196
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:06,130
now we've got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> target-rich environment</font>

197
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:07,449
so previously you know and when the

198
00:09:06,130 --> 00:09:11,080
Greeks are looking at this sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of stuff</font>

199
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:14,380
you know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> all by hand and now</font>

200
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:17,080
obviously you've got a stack a great

201
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:19,510
stack of data available that you can

202
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:22,540
explore very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> quickly as will see a</font>

203
00:09:19,510 --> 00:09:26,500
you know a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> later so what's</font>

204
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:28,750
the problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> well your searches your</font>

205
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:31,150
online activity isn't all that and you

206
00:09:28,750 --> 00:09:32,650
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> anonymous essentially and that's</font>

207
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:35,949
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably not a great surprise to anyone</font>

208
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:40,300
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> room but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> was so</font>

209
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:43,780
the cater for this lady<font color="#E5E5E5"> Thelma Arnold I</font>

210
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:46,449
won't read the AOL number but in a

211
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:48,339
roughly two thousand six AOL published a

212
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:50,980
you know a bunch of their sort search

213
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:53,320
strings and think it was again it's the

214
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:56,620
new york times they must be into social

215
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:58,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">analysis they'd actually gone taking a</font>

216
00:09:56,620 --> 00:10:01,600
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the data for this AOL use of</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">4417 what have you and they're</font>

218
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:06,100
<font color="#CCCCCC">determined that it was just lady in</font>

219
00:10:03,339 --> 00:10:07,210
georgia this Thelma Arnold because of

220
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,580
the searches<font color="#CCCCCC"> that she was looking</font>

221
00:10:07,210 --> 00:10:12,370
because that you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> she was looking at</font>

222
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:14,860
dog kennels and stuff like that for you

223
00:10:12,370 --> 00:10:16,360
know you can see she's got<font color="#E5E5E5"> a dog so all</font>

224
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:17,920
of this stuff that's out there this I've

225
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:20,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">got nothing to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hide what could possibly</font>

226
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:24,069
go wrong isn't all that anonymous even

227
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:26,230
<font color="#CCCCCC">if the data is a non mais de neve real</font>

228
00:10:24,070 --> 00:10:28,240
names taken out it's still<font color="#E5E5E5"> highly</font>

229
00:10:26,230 --> 00:10:31,600
possible for people to link that back to

230
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:35,170
it to an individual so we've got a lot

231
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:39,190
of data and you've got a lot of noise

232
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:40,719
really the opportunity here is how do

233
00:10:39,190 --> 00:10:43,300
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> find the interesting stuff just a</font>

234
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,850
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit quicker and you can do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

235
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:47,800
as I hope to<font color="#CCCCCC"> show today quickly</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is by</font>

236
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:49,510
you know data mining techniques like

237
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:52,719
screen scraping I don't know if<font color="#E5E5E5"> anyone</font>

238
00:10:49,510 --> 00:10:54,460
saw the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Michael shrink talk at Def Con</font>

239
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,080
last year if you didn't go<font color="#E5E5E5"> on to the</font>

240
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:58,240
archives and have a look at<font color="#E5E5E5"> that because</font>

241
00:10:56,080 --> 00:11:01,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">that's an absolutely fantastic talk</font>

242
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,130
around you know obtaining data through

243
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:04,959
screen scraping obviously you've got to

244
00:11:03,130 --> 00:11:05,350
be aware of the robots.txt and what have

245
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,270
you

246
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:09,820
named entity recognition and data

247
00:11:07,270 --> 00:11:13,210
visualization<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll talk just briefly</font>

248
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:15,070
about those two right<font color="#CCCCCC"> now so named</font>

249
00:11:13,210 --> 00:11:17,200
entity recognition is really parsing

250
00:11:15,070 --> 00:11:19,690
data to it extract and classify

251
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:22,180
information it differs from saw

252
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:24,220
meta-analysis because it classifies the

253
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:26,920
you know the data are not one particular

254
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:29,320
type very similar but it's like you know

255
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:33,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so here's an example</font>

256
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:37,390
Greg brought 300,000 shares of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> gap</font>

257
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:40,270
completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> random idea here in 2010 and</font>

258
00:11:37,390 --> 00:11:44,110
this is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it ends up looking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

259
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:46,300
this it's kind of a the example was

260
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:47,620
pretty much from<font color="#E5E5E5"> Wikipedia but now what</font>

261
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:50,439
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see here is that you've almost</font>

262
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:54,460
got saw an<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML format where it's picked</font>

out the name a quantity an organization

265
00:11:58,390 --> 00:12:01,900
that's what it's like you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

00:11:59,740 --> 00:12:03,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">Google around for named entity</font>

267
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,260

268
00:12:03,430 --> 00:12:07,329
the university of stanford and the

269
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:12,010

00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:19,480
pass data to that and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> use</font>

it and we'll see a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit more about</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">the power</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of what you can do here data</font>

anybody read this book or familiar with

00:12:57,910 --> 00:13:04,689
model so almost<font color="#CCCCCC"> a three step process get</font>

288
00:13:01,210 --> 00:13:06,730
the data tidy it up<font color="#E5E5E5"> output it to some</font>

289
00:13:04,690 --> 00:13:10,480
sort of file or you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> XML CSV</font>

290
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:13,300
whatever and then render it so iterative

291
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,370
and he talks about that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this book and</font>

292
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:17,430
uses the processing software which you

293
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:19,920
can download how to play with it

294
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:21,839
is fantastic<font color="#E5E5E5"> but it's this last point</font>

295
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,120
really that wanted to home in on which

296
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,310
is where<font color="#E5E5E5"> you see a big gap in a number</font>

297
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,750
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> tools out there is interacting with</font>

298
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:30,390
the data so the whole<font color="#CCCCCC"> process of</font>

299
00:13:27,750 --> 00:13:32,790
generating a data set and<font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font>

300
00:13:30,390 --> 00:13:34,800
interacting with the data<font color="#E5E5E5"> and do you</font>

301
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:37,170
know doing that in a sort of a loop

302
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,750
means that you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to leave the</font>

303
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:41,189
graphical user interface whereas what

304
00:13:39,750 --> 00:13:43,440
I'm going to talk about today<font color="#E5E5E5"> shows you</font>

305
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:48,120
at all where you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't leave that don't</font>

306
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:50,550
necessarily leave the<font color="#E5E5E5"> GUI so for tools</font>

307
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:51,990
there's a number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them I just put a</font>

308
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:53,819
few one here I could you know you could

309
00:13:51,990 --> 00:13:56,910
go on as a great website out there

310
00:13:53,820 --> 00:14:01,950
called sec this org it's got a whole

311
00:13:56,910 --> 00:14:03,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">bunch of tools on there I picked a few</font>

312
00:14:01,950 --> 00:14:08,160
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> I liked and it played around with</font>

313
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:09,750
but going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to focus on multi go so the</font>

314
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,420
first<font color="#E5E5E5"> question really is well will you</font>

315
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:14,610
know what what is multi go so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going</font>

316
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:15,959
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go through this bit pretty quickly</font>

317
00:14:14,610 --> 00:14:17,610
because I'm going to talk about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

318
00:14:15,959 --> 00:14:22,290
you'll get<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea through the rest of</font>

319
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:25,050
the talk but briefly it's a tool for you

320
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:30,209
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> information gathering and seeing</font>

321
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:33,569
visualizing information in a graphical

322
00:14:30,209 --> 00:14:36,150
graphical way there's a infrastructure

323
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:38,520
components and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> show a quick example</font>

324
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:42,209
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so you can look at dns records</font>

325
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:44,430
IP addresses<font color="#E5E5E5"> urls mail records what have</font>

326
00:14:42,209 --> 00:14:47,550
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> and there's a human part where you</font>

327
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:49,979
can look<font color="#CCCCCC"> for mentions of people</font>

328
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:51,569
telephone numbers and you know what have

329
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:53,400
you and link all of those sorts of

330
00:14:51,570 --> 00:14:55,290
relationships together<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'll show you</font>

331
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:58,110
more<font color="#CCCCCC"> about that but it's just a quick</font>

332
00:14:55,290 --> 00:15:01,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">snapshot but the most exciting thing</font>

333
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:04,260
about multi go is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's extendable by</font>

334
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:06,060
design so whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> you get out of it</font>

335
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:09,390
just quick show of hands actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> who's</font>

336
00:15:06,060 --> 00:15:12,150
use multi you go and you will get this

337
00:15:09,390 --> 00:15:16,050
and right now so it's extendable by

338
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:20,790
design so you can write your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own what</font>

339
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:24,630
called local transforms<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go and do</font>

340
00:15:20,790 --> 00:15:27,379
whatever it is you want i'll talk more

341
00:15:24,630 --> 00:15:30,499
about that and<font color="#E5E5E5"> show you what i did in</font>

342
00:15:27,379 --> 00:15:32,989
in our case study so if you haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> used</font>

343
00:15:30,499 --> 00:15:36,799

let you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a play around with it and</font>

354
00:16:02,779 --> 00:16:07,849
there's also a full client version which

smaller<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's not really that important</font>

365
00:16:30,709 --> 00:16:36,319
but I picked out six domains completely

366
00:16:33,709 --> 00:16:41,089
at random so I went<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know leg at</font>

allows you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to do so I figured it'd be</font>

371
00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:53,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">neat to see out of these domains you</font>

372
00:16:49,369 --> 00:16:56,209
know who's sharing MX records so you can

373
00:16:53,569 --> 00:16:59,209
see this I've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> security geek down at</font>

374
00:16:56,209 --> 00:17:00,858
the bottom which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> my website and then</font>

375
00:16:59,209 --> 00:17:03,409
you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got a number of these other</font>

376
00:17:00,859 --> 00:17:06,860
entities all sharing the same MX records

377
00:17:03,409 --> 00:17:08,148
from from godaddy well you can explore a

378
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:09,349
little bit further<font color="#E5E5E5"> and actually last</font>

379
00:17:08,148 --> 00:17:13,188
night<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was playing around with this</font>

380
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:15,469
looking at say the the<font color="#CCCCCC"> websites that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

381
00:17:13,189 --> 00:17:18,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">associated with those addresses and then</font>

382
00:17:15,470 --> 00:17:20,750
looking at the email<font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses that were</font>

383
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:22,458
found on those websites and then looking

384
00:17:20,750 --> 00:17:24,980
at the email<font color="#E5E5E5"> addresses on those websites</font>

385
00:17:22,459 --> 00:17:29,029
that appeared on other websites and you

386
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:30,529
could see interesting relationship

387
00:17:29,029 --> 00:17:32,600
because a lot of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> email addresses</font>

388
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:35,929
listed on all of those sites also

389
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:38,000
appeared on attrition org so if you knew

390
00:17:35,929 --> 00:17:38,820
nothing about you know what's been going

391
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:41,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">on</font>

392
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:44,580
at least on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter with regards to</font>

393
00:17:41,370 --> 00:17:46,979
discussion around lagaa you'd have

394
00:17:44,580 --> 00:17:50,850
spotted that that relationship pretty

395
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:53,639
pretty quickly so<font color="#E5E5E5"> moving a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> guess neatly</font>

396
00:17:50,850 --> 00:17:56,580
onto to Twitter<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mention it I sort of</font>

397
00:17:53,639 --> 00:18:01,350
joined Twitter about about a<font color="#E5E5E5"> year ago</font>

398
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:05,759
started following two people initially

399
00:18:01,350 --> 00:18:08,519
one was ryan<font color="#E5E5E5"> Russell it's pretty</font>

400
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:14,009
interesting guy he<font color="#CCCCCC"> and another chap was</font>

401
00:18:08,519 --> 00:18:20,340
was this guy here Tony Hawk us

402
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:22,080
skateboarder so what Tony likes to do I

403
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,820
didn't follow him for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> reason I</font>

404
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:27,210
found that<font color="#CCCCCC"> out while I was following him</font>

465
00:20:56,549 --> 00:21:00,780
I was like no it really is Tony Hawk

466

he's verified by twit is anybody here

467
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:04,200

like to buy you a really big drink was

469
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:11,940

470
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:15,179
of it anyway because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i figured well you</font>

471
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:16,320
know yeah it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> got to be really some</font>

472
00:21:15,179 --> 00:21:18,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">twitter and he's got the little blue</font>

473
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:20,879
tick so what you know it's got so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

474
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:25,530
is the box that was sent to me in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the in</font>

475
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:28,260
the post so i sent this clue to to Tony

476
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:31,410
which<font color="#E5E5E5"> I thought was pretty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> awesome</font>

477
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:33,870
actually so guarded by a fearsome troll

478
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:36,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">Northwest from a house where you might</font>

479
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:41,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">have to pay money</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to pass an escape book</font>

480
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:44,399
skateboard park so the money to pass

481
00:21:41,340 --> 00:21:46,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">house</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> toll house there's a toll house</font>

482
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:49,950
near where we live if you go Northwest

483
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:51,929
you pass a skate park and<font color="#CCCCCC"> where we're</font>

484
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:56,190
might be guided by a fierce and troll

485
00:21:51,929 --> 00:21:58,320
but under under a bridge so I thought

486
00:21:56,190 --> 00:22:00,840
awesome clue bridge

487
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:03,509
it occurred to me<font color="#CCCCCC"> that people might spot</font>

488
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:05,158
a package and think that<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok some sort</font>

489
00:22:03,509 --> 00:22:08,429
that somebody's you know from a

490
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:10,470
terrorist cell is trying to blow up one

491
00:22:08,429 --> 00:22:15,750
of the most important bridges in the

492
00:22:10,470 --> 00:22:18,210
village so I had some concerns about

493
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:21,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">that but I went about it anyway and</font>

494
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:23,669
suddenly clue out<font color="#E5E5E5"> now this guy here is a</font>

495
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:25,230
bit of a legend actually he'd been

496
00:22:23,669 --> 00:22:27,360
following Tony Hawk as well and was

497
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:29,429
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> more excited than I was that</font>

498
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,309
there was going to be this Twitter on in

499
00:22:29,429 --> 00:22:35,789
the UK so he actually drove up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

500
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:38,908
morning to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know so Beijing stoke</font>

501
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:41,309
the town where I live in<font color="#CCCCCC"> basingstoke and</font>

502
00:22:38,909 --> 00:22:43,379
he camped out basically all<font color="#CCCCCC"> day waiting</font>

503
00:22:41,309 --> 00:22:45,360
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> Tony to send this tweet I mean I</font>

504
00:22:43,379 --> 00:22:48,149
could have actually gone and taken the

505
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:51,629
board to London so they're they're years

506
00:22:48,149 --> 00:22:55,979
camping out in his car and eventually

507
00:22:51,629 --> 00:22:57,449
after an epic quest he found it<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'd took</font>

508
00:22:55,980 --> 00:23:00,149
the liberty of adding a little bit of

509
00:22:57,450 --> 00:23:02,580
camouflage to the package so that random

510
00:23:00,149 --> 00:23:04,649
dog walkers wouldn't wouldn't find it so

511
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:08,100
that was<font color="#E5E5E5"> his tweet that Kevin camo</font>

512
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:10,620
netting<font color="#CCCCCC"> Europe a bad man but as you can</font>

513
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:13,439
see he<font color="#CCCCCC"> was really amped to get the to</font>

514
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:16,289
get<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Tony Hawk package and this is</font>

515
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:19,019
this is what was in it I added<font color="#CCCCCC"> the UK</font>

516
00:23:16,289 --> 00:23:21,360
flag because well I felt like it on the

517
00:23:19,019 --> 00:23:26,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">somehow the hackers for charity that all</font>

518
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:29,250
sticker got on there too Tony likes

519
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:30,960
hackers so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously with you all</font>

520
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:35,429
established them on Twitter so I've got

521
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:38,730
a life I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see a map of where</font>

522
00:23:35,429 --> 00:23:41,970
all of these packages went who hid them

523
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:44,639
and who found them so I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that'd</font>

524
00:23:41,970 --> 00:23:46,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">be fairly straight forward thing to do</font>

525
00:23:44,639 --> 00:23:49,110
on a nerdy Sunday afternoon I thought

526
00:23:46,950 --> 00:23:51,090
right well all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the people like myself</font>

527
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:54,479
who hid decks were all friends on

528
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:58,199
twitter with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hiding it account the</font>

529
00:23:54,480 --> 00:24:01,590
finders all were meant to tweet<font color="#CCCCCC"> I found</font>

530
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:03,809
one when they found one so that should

531
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:07,620
be<font color="#CCCCCC"> easy to find you know easy to analyze</font>

532
00:24:03,809 --> 00:24:10,750
as well and Tony sends out found

533
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:14,709
wherever by whoever

534
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:16,450
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> hashtag</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> th-th so there's a problem</font>

535
00:24:14,710 --> 00:24:18,520
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> that not all of the hiders were</font>

536
00:24:16,450 --> 00:24:23,140
friends of hiding it some<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them were</font>

537
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:25,120
tony hawk's personal friends almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> none</font>

538
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:27,610
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the finders actually followed the</font>

539
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:28,959
instructions they will put the USB stick

540
00:24:27,610 --> 00:24:30,219
that came with the package in their

541
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:35,320
computer but none of them followed the

542
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:37,090
instructions and Tony himself really

543
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:39,129
didn't follow his own instructions I

544
00:24:37,090 --> 00:24:42,610
verso skateboarders what you're going to

545
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:44,350
do so I thought right I reach out to

546
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:46,719
Twitter because I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> about you</font>

547
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:50,530
<font color="#CCCCCC">guys but instead of doing Google stuff</font>

548
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:53,050
now now I asked Twitter and you know you

549
00:24:50,530 --> 00:24:55,210
get a nice very you know response from

550
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:58,060
that so I asked why does anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

551
00:24:55,210 --> 00:25:00,040
the quick way to get information you

552
00:24:58,060 --> 00:25:01,629
know out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of Twitter nobody</font>

553
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,760
mentioned search because I should have

554
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:07,330
looked at that so see previous comment

555
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:09,129
about needing<font color="#CCCCCC"> to find another career and</font>

556
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:11,379
I got a response room from this guy

557
00:25:09,130 --> 00:25:14,590
who's part of you know turns up to the

558
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:18,610
DC 4420 the DEF CON chapter meetings and

559
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:20,620
he said multi go can do that you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

560
00:25:18,610 --> 00:25:23,409
and I'm thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> more tiga</font>

561
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:24,550
what's that so you know we had some

562
00:25:23,410 --> 00:25:26,380
discussion he said oh it's data

563
00:25:24,550 --> 00:25:28,600
visualization go and have a look on data

564
00:25:26,380 --> 00:25:33,010

565
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:35,320
about this brilliant so<font color="#CCCCCC"> i downloaded</font>

566
00:25:33,010 --> 00:25:37,720
multi go had a bit of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

567
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:41,770
thought right so here's my hypothesis

568
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:44,650
which for the record my hypothesis for

569
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:49,450
anything generally you know disregard it

570
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:50,860
<font color="#CCCCCC">i figured that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the hiders and the people</font>

571
00:25:49,450 --> 00:25:52,840
that found the skateboards would have

572
00:25:50,860 --> 00:25:56,439
some sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of social interaction like hey</font>

573
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:58,540
congratulations i hit the board or you

574
00:25:56,440 --> 00:26:00,550
know something like that and i thought

575
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:02,170
by finding those interactions socially

576
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:06,490
I'd be able to arrive at a<font color="#E5E5E5"> google map</font>

577
00:26:02,170 --> 00:26:10,360
and that would be a piece of cake so

578
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:15,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">started off by getting a list of the</font>

579
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:19,629
hiders in in<font color="#CCCCCC"> twitter with multi go so i</font>

580
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:22,310
Wiss through this a little bit but give

581
00:26:19,630 --> 00:26:26,480
you some idea of what we<font color="#E5E5E5"> did so</font>

582
00:26:22,310 --> 00:26:29,270
first issue that you've got is that you

583
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:32,750
have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> derive what's called an entity</font>

584
00:26:29,270 --> 00:26:34,940
these things here are entities so

585
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:41,270
started off with a phrase it's called a

586
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:43,400
phrase and i typed in at hiding it which

587
00:26:41,270 --> 00:26:45,530
you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see sort of arrowed arrowed up</font>

588
00:26:43,400 --> 00:26:47,090
there and then when you right click on

589
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:48,710
that you get a number of options<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

590
00:26:47,090 --> 00:26:50,840
are particular to the entity<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you've</font>

591
00:26:48,710 --> 00:26:54,860
got on<font color="#E5E5E5"> one of them was you know</font>

592
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:56,870
searching<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter so this is what a</font>

593
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:58,459
transform looks like a built-in

594
00:26:56,870 --> 00:27:01,459
transform that means it comes with the

595
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:07,670
tool you can look at all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the tweets</font>

596
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:10,580
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> have the phrase hiding it in so I</font>

597
00:27:07,670 --> 00:27:14,060
did that and you get a bunch of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

598
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:16,580
things called twit apps or Twitter

599
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:19,280
affiliations they look like purple

600
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:22,310
prickly things I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think now in version 3</font>

601
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:25,340
of the tool it's a different logo but

602
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:28,760
you get the idea so these are tweets

603
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:33,379
actually is essentially and from there

604
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:35,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can convert that to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> previous on two</font>

605
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:41,390
twits actually this is how you convert

606
00:27:35,450 --> 00:27:43,670
the tweet to an<font color="#E5E5E5"> actual person or Twitter</font>

607
00:27:41,390 --> 00:27:46,640
affiliation as it's called in in multi

608
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:49,400
go so you right click on that and then

609
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:53,150
do do<font color="#CCCCCC"> that conversion and you can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> select</font>

610
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:55,100
that for the whole array of people so

611
00:27:53,150 --> 00:27:56,810
you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just do you know for one at a</font>

612
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:59,990
time you can just select that that whole

613
00:27:56,810 --> 00:28:04,820
bunch and eventually then you'll arrive

614
00:27:59,990 --> 00:28:08,840
here with you know with Twitter<font color="#E5E5E5"> no the</font>

615
00:28:04,820 --> 00:28:11,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">Twitter affiliation entity so that's</font>

616
00:28:08,840 --> 00:28:13,699
basically how to get the derived that

617
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,649
the node it's in the the white paper

618
00:28:13,700 --> 00:28:17,360
sort step-by-step so if you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

619
00:28:15,650 --> 00:28:19,040
experiment with it the other way you can

620
00:28:17,360 --> 00:28:21,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it which is highlighted by the red</font>

621
00:28:19,040 --> 00:28:22,970
box in the corner it sort of take one

622
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:27,410
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've already having to modify it</font>

623
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:30,110
that tends to to work as well at least

624
00:28:27,410 --> 00:28:32,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">for twitter so now you know we can we</font>

625
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:34,520
can get going<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually really start and</font>

626
00:28:32,360 --> 00:28:35,370
take a look at well who are the friends

627
00:28:34,520 --> 00:28:37,710
are

628
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:40,020
hiding it so again you've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

629
00:28:37,710 --> 00:28:41,430
concept of a transform<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you're</font>

630
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:44,580
<font color="#CCCCCC">looking at the friends of this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> person</font>

631
00:28:41,430 --> 00:28:48,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">and you can generate that get a nice big</font>

632
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:51,750
list with little thumbnails of you know

633
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:54,300
what the people look like<font color="#E5E5E5"> and then you</font>

634
00:28:51,750 --> 00:28:57,450
can perform<font color="#CCCCCC"> that operation are you know</font>

635
00:28:54,300 --> 00:29:00,809
on all<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them people again so you can</font>

636
00:28:57,450 --> 00:29:04,320
select all there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> 83 there you have to</font>

637
00:29:00,809 --> 00:29:07,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">trust me on that you can select all 83</font>

638
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:12,178
and run the same transform on all 83

639
00:29:07,290 --> 00:29:14,010
people so I picked me that's that's me

640
00:29:12,179 --> 00:29:15,540
right there and if you see the top

641
00:29:14,010 --> 00:29:18,059
<font color="#CCCCCC">right-hand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> corner there's a little red</font>

642
00:29:15,540 --> 00:29:20,100
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know red box that gives you the</font>

643
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:21,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">ability to navigate so if you've got</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> big</font>

644
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:25,080
graphs you can navigate around<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

645
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:27,360
around the graphs using that box<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

646
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:30,960
then home in on it and the the screen in

647
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:34,709
the middle so I chose I wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

648
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:36,570
all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the tweets that I wrote I mainly</font>

649
00:29:34,710 --> 00:29:39,150
shown you one I could have<font color="#E5E5E5"> applied that</font>

650
00:29:36,570 --> 00:29:46,110
transform to every single entity at the

651
00:29:39,150 --> 00:29:47,550
same time so I did that and then then

652
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:49,949
that's when I noticed<font color="#E5E5E5"> that things</font>

653
00:29:47,550 --> 00:29:53,760
weren't happening quite as I expected so

654
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:56,880
I'd get like 12 results but I know I you

655
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:58,470
know I know I tweeted about I had 50 or

656
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:02,309
something tweet so I was like what's

657
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:04,260
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> on this is kind of weird actually</font>

658
00:30:02,309 --> 00:30:06,870
<font color="#CCCCCC">quite a lot of exploration on why that</font>

659
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:08,790
was weird I thought well maybe it's

660
00:30:06,870 --> 00:30:11,159
because I'm relatively new and not that

661
00:30:08,790 --> 00:30:13,440
interesting so I try you know Tony Hawk

662
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:17,130
so you know I looked at his tweet

663
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:19,800
nothing at all so I emailed the guys in

664
00:30:17,130 --> 00:30:21,240
South Africa who wrote the tool by now

665
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:25,620
they must have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been thinking I wish this</font>

666
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:27,240
English guy would just go away<font color="#CCCCCC"> and they</font>

667
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:28,949
tried to<font color="#E5E5E5"> reproduce it and have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the same</font>

668
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:31,260
challenges and digging a little bit

669
00:30:28,950 --> 00:30:34,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">deeper we noticed that twitter has got</font>

670
00:30:31,260 --> 00:30:38,010
some limitations in search so it's

671
00:30:34,980 --> 00:30:41,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty well documented you know out</font>

672
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:43,610
there what Twitter search was<font color="#CCCCCC"> the API</font>

673
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:47,210
came from another

674
00:30:43,610 --> 00:30:50,809
organization called<font color="#E5E5E5"> summarize and it</font>

675
00:30:47,210 --> 00:30:54,260
indexes or maintains the index at least

676
00:30:50,809 --> 00:30:55,610
for about two weeks roughly and some

677
00:30:54,260 --> 00:30:57,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">people aren't indexed to also the</font>

678
00:30:55,610 --> 00:30:59,059
<font color="#E5E5E5">challenge i had was Tony Hawk wasn't</font>

679
00:30:57,080 --> 00:31:00,530
indexed at all and I was only<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font>

680
00:30:59,059 --> 00:31:04,160
the tweets had written in the last two

681
00:31:00,530 --> 00:31:07,639
weeks so a bit of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a challenge there and</font>

682
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:11,870
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is where this thing came</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in handy</font>

683
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:14,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">because roll off</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the guy who essentially</font>

684
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:16,699
set up at server from San supposed he

685
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:18,710
said dude you should try local

686
00:31:16,700 --> 00:31:21,260
transforms you can write your<font color="#CCCCCC"> own code</font>

687
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:22,940
I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> thinking you've got the wrong</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> guy I</font>

688
00:31:21,260 --> 00:31:24,919
don't write can't play around with pearl

689
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:27,740
now and again he said but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know if</font>

690
00:31:24,919 --> 00:31:30,260
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can write you know if you can call a</font>

691
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:33,679
script or<font color="#E5E5E5"> a program and you can pass</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

692
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:35,360
input<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can generate output to</font>

693
00:31:33,679 --> 00:31:39,919
standard output then you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> write a</font>

694
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:41,870
local transform which was which was

695
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:44,360
pretty pretty interesting and compelling

696
00:31:41,870 --> 00:31:49,280
so I set about it by thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> right well</font>

697
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:52,219
<font color="#CCCCCC">I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> try this with with pearl and have a</font>

698
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:54,168
look at the Twitter API now I bought

699
00:31:52,220 --> 00:31:56,480
this book but actually I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

700
00:31:54,169 --> 00:31:57,980
use it that much because there's a you

701
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:01,940
know a huge set of Twitter API

702
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:06,080
documentation online which you can

703
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:09,260
search for but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not one API it's</font>

704
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:11,510
three API so forget the Search API that

705
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:17,120
we mentioned from summarize and just

706
00:32:11,510 --> 00:32:21,020
focus on the other REST API which allows

707
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:23,090
you to use commands you know call calls

708
00:32:21,020 --> 00:32:26,030
like this essentially and this is where

709
00:32:23,090 --> 00:32:30,530
you'd be you know extracting the tweets

710
00:32:26,030 --> 00:32:32,480
from somebody and you've got an entity

711
00:32:30,530 --> 00:32:34,970
value there which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> the person that</font>

712
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:38,929
you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> to to grab the tweets</font>

713
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:40,970
from if anybody wants the you know the

714
00:32:38,929 --> 00:32:43,460
code for playing around with this sort

715
00:32:40,970 --> 00:32:43,940
of stuff<font color="#E5E5E5"> I plan to just put it on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

716
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:47,240
you know

717
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:52,009
on my website which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is security geek but</font>

718
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:53,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">that either threes so you can you know</font>

719
00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:56,179
<font color="#E5E5E5">you can do a lot playing around with</font>

720
00:32:53,750 --> 00:32:58,549
that's not all plain sailing either

721
00:32:56,179 --> 00:33:00,110
there are some things which I wish were

722
00:32:58,549 --> 00:33:03,470
implemented in the Twitter API that

723
00:33:00,110 --> 00:33:05,389
there are like searching by date and

724
00:33:03,470 --> 00:33:09,799
stuff like that you kind of have to make

725
00:33:05,389 --> 00:33:12,500
that yourself but<font color="#CCCCCC"> purlin lwp you know</font>

726
00:33:09,799 --> 00:33:14,360
really work pretty well so there's a

727
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:19,909
couple more gotchas here as well though

728
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:24,379
you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> this 202 limit so when you</font>

729
00:33:19,909 --> 00:33:27,740
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> r under the API call you'll get</font>

730
00:33:24,379 --> 00:33:30,469
200 tweets back so if you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font>

731
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:33,830
look at 400 tweets for example you

732
00:33:30,470 --> 00:33:37,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's to API calls well that was an</font>

733
00:33:33,830 --> 00:33:38,539
issue you couldn't search by date so I

734
00:33:37,159 --> 00:33:40,610
couldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> say I want to get all of the</font>

735
00:33:38,539 --> 00:33:45,080
tweets between these dates I had to

736
00:33:40,610 --> 00:33:49,039
derive the dates by looking each tweet

737
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:51,439
has got an ID associated with it and you

738
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:54,230
can see a time so you pull a tweet with

739
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:56,029
an ID<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at the time and you know and</font>

740
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:57,919
then sort<font color="#CCCCCC"> of figure out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> let's say</font>

741
00:33:56,029 --> 00:34:00,470
there's you know excellent go to another

742
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:02,570
tweet ID guess that say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay well this</font>

743
00:34:00,470 --> 00:34:06,889
is between two dates that that<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of</font>

744
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:10,099
works but there's a maximum history I

745
00:34:06,889 --> 00:34:13,819
haven't actually tested how how rigid

746
00:34:10,099 --> 00:34:18,409
<font color="#E5E5E5">that is but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 3200 tweet history and</font>

747
00:34:13,819 --> 00:34:21,500
you're limited to 150<font color="#E5E5E5"> API calls per hour</font>

748
00:34:18,409 --> 00:34:23,510
by default so as<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see if you've</font>

749
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:24,980
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> 100</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> people which is quite easy in a</font>

750
00:34:23,510 --> 00:34:27,619
graph like this because you're exploring

751
00:34:24,980 --> 00:34:30,109
vast sets of data and you're running

752
00:34:27,619 --> 00:34:33,710
those transforms on all of those<font color="#E5E5E5"> people</font>

753
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:37,219
in this rather small example here you'd

754
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:40,339
<font color="#CCCCCC">have 100 people I'd be looking at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> making</font>

755
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:42,739
38<font color="#E5E5E5"> API calls</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> per person end up</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with you</font>

756
00:34:40,339 --> 00:34:47,359
know 300<font color="#E5E5E5"> API calls that's already blown</font>

757
00:34:42,739 --> 00:34:50,328
my my limit with with Twitter so I'd

758
00:34:47,359 --> 00:34:52,909
<font color="#CCCCCC">have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to do that over two hours and</font>

759
00:34:50,329 --> 00:34:55,879
that's where<font color="#CCCCCC"> white listing comes in you</font>

760
00:34:52,909 --> 00:35:01,009
can<font color="#CCCCCC"> go from 158</font>

761
00:34:55,879 --> 00:35:03,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">i calls to 20,000 in an hour so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you have</font>

762
00:35:01,009 --> 00:35:04,910
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that via twitter but they</font>

763
00:35:03,410 --> 00:35:07,220
were pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> good with that said you know</font>

764
00:35:04,910 --> 00:35:09,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm security consultants and looking</font>

765
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:10,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">into you know data analysis and what</font>

766
00:35:09,410 --> 00:35:12,890
have you and I'd<font color="#E5E5E5"> like</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be whitelisted</font>

767
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:15,710
please I thought<font color="#CCCCCC"> that'd take forever or</font>

768
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:17,900
I've getting know and you know and they

769
00:35:15,710 --> 00:35:20,750
said yeah sure he here you go basically

770
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:23,900
which then meant that I could<font color="#E5E5E5"> run some</font>

771
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:26,809
pretty large graphs so ok back to the

772
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:28,789
back to the story I wanted to<font color="#E5E5E5"> see who'd</font>

773
00:35:26,809 --> 00:35:31,670
actually won these you know when these

774
00:35:28,789 --> 00:35:35,839
skateboards so what did I picked<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font>

775
00:35:31,670 --> 00:35:38,869
Tony Hawk and then I ran the tweet the

776
00:35:35,839 --> 00:35:40,730
the transform that I've written to pull

777
00:35:38,869 --> 00:35:45,470
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tweets of people he mentioned</font>

778
00:35:40,730 --> 00:35:48,349
here so these are all of my local

779
00:35:45,470 --> 00:35:52,279
transforms get tweet<font color="#CCCCCC"> one two and three</font>

780
00:35:48,349 --> 00:35:54,859
and date search between certain IDs and

781
00:35:52,279 --> 00:35:59,809
pull out<font color="#CCCCCC"> all of the tweets</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that had</font>

782
00:35:54,859 --> 00:36:03,348
either the word found in there or had

783
00:35:59,809 --> 00:36:06,650
you know and at mentioned so Twitter

784
00:36:03,349 --> 00:36:08,480
user names are at<font color="#E5E5E5"> username so you can</font>

785
00:36:06,650 --> 00:36:11,180
pull them out with a regular<font color="#CCCCCC"> expression</font>

786
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:14,059
really easily and basically I display

787
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:15,919
those and discard everything else they

788
00:36:14,059 --> 00:36:17,269
had written so I wasn't particularly

789
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,829
interested in what<font color="#E5E5E5"> he'd had for</font>

790
00:36:17,269 --> 00:36:20,779
breakfast<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I was interesting if he</font>

791
00:36:18,829 --> 00:36:24,740
was you know corresponding with someone

792
00:36:20,779 --> 00:36:26,329
through Twitter so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is what it what</font>

793
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:28,459
it ends up looking like so for example

794
00:36:26,329 --> 00:36:31,789
one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of those at one on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the top left hand</font>

795
00:36:28,460 --> 00:36:36,289
corner that was found<font color="#CCCCCC"> atlanta</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at you</font>

796
00:36:31,789 --> 00:36:37,730
know blah blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah basically and that</font>

797
00:36:36,289 --> 00:36:40,640
would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a similar story for each</font>

798
00:36:37,730 --> 00:36:43,309
of those so potentially in that set of

799
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:46,220
data are the people who<font color="#E5E5E5"> will need</font>

800
00:36:43,309 --> 00:36:49,400
skateboards as you go a little bit

801
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:51,439
further and run the you know run more of

802
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:53,180
those transforms on a wider and wider

803
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:55,910
data set then you can start<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

804
00:36:53,180 --> 00:36:58,190
relationships building between these

805
00:36:55,910 --> 00:37:00,230
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> who's spoken to who in this case</font>

806
00:36:58,190 --> 00:37:02,089
you'll see Tony's<font color="#CCCCCC"> talked to a few people</font>

807
00:37:00,230 --> 00:37:03,650
and those people have also been people

808
00:37:02,089 --> 00:37:06,440
that were hiding stuff so there's some

809
00:37:03,650 --> 00:37:08,359
relationship obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> there and as you</font>

810
00:37:06,440 --> 00:37:10,430
go further than you know the map get

811
00:37:08,359 --> 00:37:13,249
a little bit more complex if you you

812
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:15,348
know if you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at it closely top</font>

813
00:37:13,249 --> 00:37:17,180
right-hand corner to navigate again it's

814
00:37:15,349 --> 00:37:20,539
a you know great way of tackling that

815
00:37:17,180 --> 00:37:27,440
and you end up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with one of these which</font>

816
00:37:20,539 --> 00:37:30,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">is a big graph I decided I'd have a bit</font>

817
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:34,700
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a go at running more and more</font>

818
00:37:30,829 --> 00:37:37,190
transforms so I set off a you know a

819
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:40,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">transform on a big data set and went out</font>

820
00:37:37,190 --> 00:37:42,200
running about<font color="#E5E5E5"> half way around late at</font>

821
00:37:40,009 --> 00:37:44,690
six mile loop it occurred to<font color="#E5E5E5"> me that</font>

822
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:46,249
this was all happening on some servers

823
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:49,099
in South Africa and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they might be</font>

824
00:37:46,249 --> 00:37:51,769
getting a little bit pissed off so

825
00:37:49,099 --> 00:37:56,509
around back home pretty quickly and saw

826
00:37:51,769 --> 00:38:01,368
this and you can't do a lot with with a

827
00:37:56,509 --> 00:38:03,349
map like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> really so what you need to</font>

828
00:38:01,369 --> 00:38:06,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is prune that basically and you can</font>

829
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:08,390
look<font color="#E5E5E5"> for you can look</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for entities that</font>

830
00:38:06,710 --> 00:38:10,880
don't correspond of anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else and</font>

831
00:38:08,390 --> 00:38:14,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">just cut them out so pruning your data</font>

832
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:16,819
set is a you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> sort of big activity</font>

833
00:38:14,210 --> 00:38:19,009
in a multi go but you can get<font color="#CCCCCC"> that then</font>

834
00:38:16,819 --> 00:38:21,079
down and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can get a pretty nice graph</font>

835
00:38:19,009 --> 00:38:24,799
and here you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> see you've got hiding</font>

836
00:38:21,079 --> 00:38:26,509
it it's the the dot at the top left hand

837
00:38:24,799 --> 00:38:28,460
corner<font color="#E5E5E5"> you've got Tony Hawk you've got</font>

838
00:38:26,509 --> 00:38:30,529
somebody following at hiding it you've

839
00:38:28,460 --> 00:38:31,759
got somebody who Tony's mentioned and

840
00:38:30,529 --> 00:38:33,829
you've got some car you know

841
00:38:31,759 --> 00:38:35,210
correspondence between those two so

842
00:38:33,829 --> 00:38:37,339
there's something<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on there and you</font>

843
00:38:35,210 --> 00:38:38,660
can explore them and just end up with

844
00:38:37,339 --> 00:38:42,140
the data set people<font color="#E5E5E5"> who've been</font>

845
00:38:38,660 --> 00:38:45,348
communicating there's another view here

846
00:38:42,140 --> 00:38:46,910
that you'll see in in multi go and just

847
00:38:45,349 --> 00:38:49,039
to highlight where the lines are there

848
00:38:46,910 --> 00:38:53,149
you can see pretty much<font color="#E5E5E5"> the same sort of</font>

849
00:38:49,039 --> 00:38:55,069
thing again if you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at guess</font>

850
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:56,660
you know right now you might be thinking

851
00:38:55,069 --> 00:38:58,819
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> how does the speed things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> up while</font>

852
00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:00,920
you apply edge waiting then you can see

853
00:38:58,819 --> 00:39:05,480
essentially who are the who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are the top</font>

854
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:07,670
talkers in that Twitter event and here

855
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:11,509
you'll see Tony or hiding it in to run

856
00:39:07,670 --> 00:39:13,489
case but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what on earth if I've</font>

857
00:39:11,509 --> 00:39:15,289
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> going on about well if you look at</font>

858
00:39:13,489 --> 00:39:17,480
look here then you'll see there's mean

859
00:39:15,289 --> 00:39:19,099
as its of a guy<font color="#E5E5E5"> Stephen Gill and missed</font>

860
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:20,390
your own case well Jerome case you might

861
00:39:19,099 --> 00:39:23,329
be scratching you had thinking what

862
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:26,299
your own<font color="#E5E5E5"> case well I didn't even know he</font>

867
00:39:34,099 --> 00:39:40,250
tweeting and and you know before<font color="#CCCCCC"> I used</font>

868
00:39:38,000 --> 00:39:43,339
this this graph i didn't i didn't know

869
00:39:40,250 --> 00:39:45,950
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> it hadn't occurred to me to look so</font>

870
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:47,660
if you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> analyzing an event you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can see</font>

00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:49,038

872
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:51,049
people at the event so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could apply</font>

873
00:39:49,039 --> 00:39:52,880
that here<font color="#CCCCCC"> to you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to black out for</font>

874
00:39:51,049 --> 00:39:55,038
example or to<font color="#CCCCCC"> DEFCON or what have you</font>

875
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:58,369
and see maybe where the big bus was

876
00:39:55,039 --> 00:40:01,400
without actually having to attend so you

877
00:39:58,369 --> 00:40:03,319
know you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to be limited to to</font>

878
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:07,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">Twitter you can just search you know</font>

879
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:10,190
websites for fur names for example so

880
00:40:07,010 --> 00:40:14,839
this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> what the guy is a look like I</font>

881
00:40:10,190 --> 00:40:17,690
put that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in so lessons learned they've</font>

882
00:40:14,839 --> 00:40:19,788
got three lessons learned the first<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

883
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:21,890
which the perturbed<font color="#E5E5E5"> guides really</font>

884
00:40:19,789 --> 00:40:24,859
instilled was plan what you're what

885
00:40:21,890 --> 00:40:26,900
you're doing have an idea about<font color="#CCCCCC"> how</font>

886
00:40:24,859 --> 00:40:28,880
you're going to go about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it before you</font>

887
00:40:26,900 --> 00:40:32,509
go about it otherwise you can generate a

888
00:40:28,880 --> 00:40:36,019
lot of a lot of mess the next thing if

889

<font color="#E5E5E5">you're using multi go is if you've got</font>

this this setting here for speed and

891
00:40:38,690 --> 00:40:43,579
accuracy if that bar is over to the left

892
00:40:41,299 --> 00:40:48,200
you get less results so it's good for

893
00:40:43,579 --> 00:40:49,430
testing out your transforms and when

894
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:51,169
you've got<font color="#CCCCCC"> that working and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're happy</font>

if you're ever thinking I'm not getting

897

898
00:40:55,640 --> 00:41:00,740
probably because you've got that bar

899
00:40:57,289 --> 00:41:04,309
slid over to the to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> left and the</font>

third third sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of slide with lessons</font>

901
00:41:04,309 --> 00:41:08,509
learned is that these local transforms

902
00:41:05,990 --> 00:41:11,720
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> apply these to a great deal more</font>

903
00:41:08,509 --> 00:41:14,509
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> Twitter right you know you can</font>

what the relationships are there if

you're in an enterprising you want to

use this<font color="#CCCCCC"> perhaps</font>

910
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:27,960
you know vulnerability testing fantastic

911
00:41:26,400 --> 00:41:30,000
we'll have you consider the server

912
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:32,849
platform so you running transforms in

913
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:35,040
your own enterprise and if you're going

914
00:41:32,849 --> 00:41:37,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">to explore Twitter then I'd seriously</font>

915
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:40,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">recommend taking a look at applying for</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">white listing so did it help</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> me get a</font>

917
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:52,710
map saw sort of but not really my wife

918
00:41:47,280 --> 00:41:54,540
was expecting our first child so what we

919
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:56,339
ended up doing was we you know we went

920
00:41:54,540 --> 00:41:58,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">to the hospital waiting for the chap two</font>

921
00:41:56,339 --> 00:42:00,509
were to arrive took a bunch of printouts

922
00:41:58,710 --> 00:42:03,180
and stuff like that and did it<font color="#E5E5E5"> all by</font>

923
00:42:00,510 --> 00:42:06,599
hand in the end because<font color="#E5E5E5"> I totally failed</font>

924
00:42:03,180 --> 00:42:09,540
and ran out of time but you could see

925
00:42:06,599 --> 00:42:11,490
some<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the relationships but this this</font>

926
00:42:09,540 --> 00:42:14,160
was what we ended up doing in the end so

927
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:16,379
I just wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come clean with that</font>

928
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:18,480
but I don't know how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> of you've seen</font>

929
00:42:16,380 --> 00:42:21,300
this because<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a similar concept</font>

930
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:24,900
but using processing by a guy called

931
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:26,520
juror if you've not seen this go<font color="#E5E5E5"> Google</font>

932
00:42:24,900 --> 00:42:28,530
around for just landed the concept here

933
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:31,740
<font color="#E5E5E5">was that people on Twitter you know</font>

934
00:42:28,530 --> 00:42:33,960
saying are you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> just landed in Las</font>

935
00:42:31,740 --> 00:42:36,689
Vegas wheels down Las Vegas you know

936
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:39,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">made it to Las Vegas</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or what have you so</font>

937
00:42:36,690 --> 00:42:41,910
what he<font color="#E5E5E5"> did he analyzed he got the</font>

938
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:43,828
Twitter profile of where they identified

939
00:42:41,910 --> 00:42:47,368
the location use something called meta

940
00:42:43,829 --> 00:42:49,859
<font color="#CCCCCC">Carter which pulls out the location and</font>

941
00:42:47,369 --> 00:42:54,000
gives you a geographical grid reference

942
00:42:49,859 --> 00:42:55,560
so you know and looks at where they

943
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,060
landed where they said<font color="#E5E5E5"> they're landed</font>

944
00:42:55,560 --> 00:42:58,828
whether you know saw<font color="#E5E5E5"> whether where the</font>

945
00:42:57,060 --> 00:43:01,349
name was passed that through meta Carter

946
00:42:58,829 --> 00:43:03,030
and got a grid reference map that in in

947
00:43:01,349 --> 00:43:06,000
processing and generated this pretty

948
00:43:03,030 --> 00:43:08,280
neat visual of where<font color="#E5E5E5"> people were going</font>

949
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,520
and flying to within within a data set

950
00:43:08,280 --> 00:43:12,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">so i talked about multi go but you know</font>

951
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:19,410
you can apply<font color="#E5E5E5"> this with different tools</font>

952
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:24,029
also<font color="#E5E5E5"> with with twitter you know use the</font>

953
00:43:19,410 --> 00:43:25,980
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> api stuff and i'll share this this</font>

954
00:43:24,030 --> 00:43:29,400
isn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> digital equipment corporation it</font>

955
00:43:25,980 --> 00:43:31,619
said disasters emergency charity in the

956
00:43:29,400 --> 00:43:35,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">in the UK and they were looking at</font>

957
00:43:31,619 --> 00:43:38,220
analyzing their social media activity

958
00:43:35,579 --> 00:43:40,440
for the haiti disaster

959
00:43:38,220 --> 00:43:42,149
they wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to see how</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> many tweets they</font>

960
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,770
were<font color="#CCCCCC"> making how many of those tweets</font>

961
00:43:42,150 --> 00:43:46,619
were being retweeted and stuff like that

962
00:43:43,770 --> 00:43:49,470
so with those same API calls i was able

963
00:43:46,619 --> 00:43:51,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">to apply</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that generate you know generate</font>

964
00:43:49,470 --> 00:43:53,098
these graphs but if you're looking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at</font>

965
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:56,340
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in a sort of more professional way</font>

966
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:59,010
check out row feeder by a guy called

967
00:43:56,340 --> 00:44:05,730
<font color="#CCCCCC">damon portese it's a really sweet</font>

968
00:43:59,010 --> 00:44:08,849
product so onto onto another use case

969
00:44:05,730 --> 00:44:11,099
really probably focus a little bit more

970
00:44:08,849 --> 00:44:14,520
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the Nigerian crime aspect here rather</font>

971
00:44:11,099 --> 00:44:17,580
than rather than<font color="#CCCCCC"> multi multi go just but</font>

972
00:44:14,520 --> 00:44:19,980
uh this<font color="#E5E5E5"> guy's pretty famous in in</font>

973
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:23,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">Nigeria's wrote a song basically about</font>

974
00:44:19,980 --> 00:44:29,250
419 scamming called I go chop your

975
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:33,030
dollar and he's pretty popular so I got

976
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:39,150
involved with this because a friend lost

977
00:44:33,030 --> 00:44:43,859
a laptop to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a scam on a certain auction</font>

978
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:46,109
site and wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to well you know work</font>

979
00:44:43,859 --> 00:44:49,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">with the police and try and you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

980
00:44:46,109 --> 00:44:52,740
the laptop back basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> well I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

981
00:44:49,619 --> 00:44:55,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">know how is in in the US but in the UK</font>

982
00:44:52,740 --> 00:44:58,410
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> police are quite disjointed in their</font>

983
00:44:55,560 --> 00:45:01,410
approach<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this sort of thing so</font>

984
00:44:58,410 --> 00:45:06,960
depending<font color="#E5E5E5"> on who you call first your</font>

985
00:45:01,410 --> 00:45:09,660
crime log can get held up so if you ever

986
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:11,970
send anything to a legitimate dress

987
00:45:09,660 --> 00:45:14,490
better to try and<font color="#E5E5E5"> call the police in</font>

988
00:45:11,970 --> 00:45:17,879
<font color="#E5E5E5">that jurisdiction rather than your local</font>

989
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:19,410
one I explain a little bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> more so quick</font>

990
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:21,720
disclaimer some of the names dates

991
00:45:19,410 --> 00:45:24,299
images and stuff have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been changed to</font>

992
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:27,959
set well basically so<font color="#CCCCCC"> they get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bumped</font>

993
00:45:24,300 --> 00:45:32,760
off on the way home so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my friend</font>

994
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:34,800
who lost her lost her laptop she put it

995
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:36,869
on an auction site this actually

996
00:45:34,800 --> 00:45:39,119
sequence of events is pretty pretty

997
00:45:36,869 --> 00:45:40,830
common for scammers right now but I'm

998
00:45:39,119 --> 00:45:44,670
sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> they'll move migrate get a little</font>

999
00:45:40,830 --> 00:45:46,810
bit bit better it got bought quickly the

1000
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:49,780
Buy Now price so

1001
00:45:46,810 --> 00:45:52,779
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> sorts of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> may be a telltale giveaway</font>

1002
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:56,380
that you're about to get scammed she

1003
00:45:52,780 --> 00:45:59,620
exchanged emails with with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the buyer and</font>

1004
00:45:56,380 --> 00:46:01,480
it seemed okay at least the she'd

1005
00:45:59,620 --> 00:46:02,770
checked<font color="#E5E5E5"> I should actually go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> on to check</font>

1006
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:06,040
that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> address she was sending it to</font>

1007
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:09,910
was a valid address and it was so she

1008
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:11,860
was in a little bit skeptical and then

1009
00:46:09,910 --> 00:46:16,810
she got a notification from paypal

1010
00:46:11,860 --> 00:46:20,590
except it wasn't from paypal at all and

1011
00:46:16,810 --> 00:46:23,560
then she got a notification for our she

1012
00:46:20,590 --> 00:46:25,930
sent the laptop to<font color="#E5E5E5"> a valid address and</font>

1013
00:46:23,560 --> 00:46:28,450
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> she got notification that the</font>

1014
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:30,250
account that<font color="#CCCCCC"> she had been dealing with</font>

1015
00:46:28,450 --> 00:46:35,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> auction site had been</font>

1016
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:37,030
compromised you know so it was then that

1017
00:46:35,290 --> 00:46:39,790
it dawned on her that you know she'd

1018
00:46:37,030 --> 00:46:43,240
just sent this like expensive<font color="#E5E5E5"> package to</font>

1019
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:46,180
a valid address and began panicking a

1020
00:46:43,240 --> 00:46:50,919
little bit and you know contacted the

1021
00:46:46,180 --> 00:46:53,529
police because you knew I worked in

1022
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:56,500
security and had a relationship with

1023
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:58,390
with the<font color="#E5E5E5"> police locally she asked if</font>

1024
00:46:56,500 --> 00:47:00,160
there's anything I could do to point her

1025
00:46:58,390 --> 00:47:03,250
in the right<font color="#CCCCCC"> direction or point the</font>

1026
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:05,799
<font color="#CCCCCC">police in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the right direction to people</font>

1027
00:47:03,250 --> 00:47:08,620
that could help so another hypothesis as

1028
00:47:05,800 --> 00:47:11,140
I thought well if you've got the if

1029
00:47:08,620 --> 00:47:13,270
<font color="#E5E5E5">you've got the scammer dude and you've</font>

1030
00:47:11,140 --> 00:47:16,000
got<font color="#CCCCCC"> the address that they sent the</font>

1031
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:17,680
package to<font color="#E5E5E5"> then should be</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> possible to</font>

1032
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:23,200
get reacquainted with the laptop and

1033
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:26,169
hopefully ensure that<font color="#E5E5E5"> justice is is done</font>

1034
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:29,680
notice<font color="#CCCCCC"> that there's no cake there so</font>

1035
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:30,910
first of all where is our scammer so my

1036
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:33,970
initial thought was well the first thing

1037
00:47:30,910 --> 00:47:35,379
<font color="#E5E5E5">I want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do is is you know get the IP</font>

1038
00:47:33,970 --> 00:47:39,040
address<font color="#E5E5E5"> and see if they're based in the</font>

1039
00:47:35,380 --> 00:47:42,340
UK or something like that<font color="#E5E5E5"> so the trouble</font>

1040
00:47:39,040 --> 00:47:47,170
was scammer users you know web-based

1041
00:47:42,340 --> 00:47:50,590
mail so getting headers was somewhat of

1042
00:47:47,170 --> 00:47:52,600
a challenge but I figured that this

1043
00:47:50,590 --> 00:47:55,900
might be a reasonable approach so you

1044
00:47:52,600 --> 00:48:00,440
can sign<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a free blog site with</font>

1045
00:47:55,900 --> 00:48:05,089
with logs and post an image up there

1046
00:48:00,440 --> 00:48:08,690
let's say then you can send the spammer

1047
00:48:05,089 --> 00:48:10,609
an email as rather compelling email I

1048
00:48:08,690 --> 00:48:13,550
hey I've got this other laptop do you

1049
00:48:10,609 --> 00:48:16,700
want to check<font color="#E5E5E5"> this out and embed that in</font>

1050
00:48:13,550 --> 00:48:21,380
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> email they click on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the email and</font>

1051
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:25,490
essentially after some time you'll get

1052
00:48:21,380 --> 00:48:30,470
the you'll get the IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> from from</font>

1053
00:48:25,490 --> 00:48:32,629
which it came now you might also want to

1054
00:48:30,470 --> 00:48:35,240
go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> see Jeremiah Grossman talk</font>

1055
00:48:32,630 --> 00:48:39,260
because I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's talking about some</font>

1056
00:48:35,240 --> 00:48:42,950
browser exploits that you can you can

1057
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:45,109
use that'll pull out data from you know

1058
00:48:42,950 --> 00:48:48,230
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sort of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> auto populate</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> forum</font>

1059
00:48:45,109 --> 00:48:49,848
thing go<font color="#CCCCCC"> see his talk I've not seen it</font>

1060
00:48:48,230 --> 00:48:51,230
but that's what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm reading that will</font>

1061
00:48:49,849 --> 00:48:53,480
give you things like first name last

1062
00:48:51,230 --> 00:48:56,569
name all sorts of interesting stuff so

1063
00:48:53,480 --> 00:48:58,280
we got the IP address<font color="#E5E5E5"> but if you see</font>

1064
00:48:56,569 --> 00:49:01,759
what he's doing maybe there's more<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

1065
00:48:58,280 --> 00:49:04,670
can do and unsurprisingly the IP address

1066
00:49:01,760 --> 00:49:09,619
turned out to be in this<font color="#E5E5E5"> place Lego sin</font>

1067
00:49:04,670 --> 00:49:11,599
in Nigeria so it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> yeah okay that's</font>

1068
00:49:09,619 --> 00:49:13,790
definitely it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> come to a legitimate</font>

1069
00:49:11,599 --> 00:49:15,740
address in the UK but whoever this

1070
00:49:13,790 --> 00:49:18,170
camera is his I'm a routing is traffic

1071
00:49:15,740 --> 00:49:21,078
through vegas or is there and i figured

1072
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:25,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">that probably actually is there so we</font>

1073
00:49:21,079 --> 00:49:28,760
had NS as the nigerian scammer he also

1074
00:49:25,579 --> 00:49:30,170
likes her american comedians and he was

1075
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:33,920
going by the alias of<font color="#CCCCCC"> Larry</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Cable</font>

1076
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:35,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">Guy or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> something like that had an email</font>

1077
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:36,680
address and then we knew that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1078
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:39,079
package had gone to somebody called

1079
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:43,430
Alice it was placed in a town in the UK

1080
00:49:39,079 --> 00:49:45,410
called Newcastle I don't know in the

1081
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:48,049
u.s. if you've got a site like this but

1082
00:49:45,410 --> 00:49:50,029
192 dot com enables you to put in names

1083
00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:52,130
of people and it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you the</font>

1084
00:49:50,030 --> 00:49:53,720
addresses that they not<font color="#CCCCCC"> only live up but</font>

1085
00:49:52,130 --> 00:49:55,910
the previous addresses they've lived out

1086
00:49:53,720 --> 00:49:57,770
and a whole bunch more other information

1087
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:59,210
so the thought would put the name of

1088
00:49:57,770 --> 00:50:00,710
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> person in it will show that they</font>

1089
00:49:59,210 --> 00:50:02,420
live at that address you know and who

1090
00:50:00,710 --> 00:50:06,410
else they live with and you know so job

1091
00:50:02,420 --> 00:50:07,700
done but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it didn't work because the</font>

1092
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:09,430
person who was at that dress had

1093
00:50:07,700 --> 00:50:12,129
probably been been

1094
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:13,509
been renting so you didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the you</font>

1095
00:50:12,130 --> 00:50:15,730
know didn't get the real name so that

1096
00:50:13,510 --> 00:50:20,650
that approach initial approach failed

1097
00:50:15,730 --> 00:50:22,480
then figured well just some information

1098
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:26,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">gathering on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> google see where these</font>

1099
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:29,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">people have got you know profiles so be</font>

1100
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:33,490
bone myspace and of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course facebook</font>

1101
00:50:29,710 --> 00:50:36,880
whole bunch of stuff out<font color="#E5E5E5"> there so you</font>

1102
00:50:33,490 --> 00:50:39,970
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> there for well maybe have an</font>

1103
00:50:36,880 --> 00:50:44,200
explorer with with multi go so this guy

1104
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:46,089
here<font color="#E5E5E5"> dominic white or at singe on</font>

1105
00:50:44,200 --> 00:50:49,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">Twitter's wrote some really useful</font>

1106
00:50:46,089 --> 00:50:55,000
<font color="#E5E5E5">facebook transforms for Marty go</font>

1107
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:57,759
<font color="#E5E5E5">Facebook have got it</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> in their terms of</font>

1108
00:50:55,000 --> 00:51:00,339
services you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know not to do this I want</font>

1109
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:03,490
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be you know clear about that but he's</font>

1110
00:51:00,339 --> 00:51:06,790
got some and they're published out there

1111
00:51:03,490 --> 00:51:09,700
written in Python using mechanizing

1112
00:51:06,790 --> 00:51:13,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">beautiful soup to you know interact with</font>

1113
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:16,058
with facebook so figured okay let's

1114
00:51:13,750 --> 00:51:17,890
let's take a look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we've got</font>

1115
00:51:16,059 --> 00:51:19,809
three<font color="#E5E5E5"> results back for Alice actually</font>

1116
00:51:17,890 --> 00:51:22,029
we've got a whole lot more results back

1117
00:51:19,809 --> 00:51:24,549
for Alice but you don't need to to see

1118
00:51:22,030 --> 00:51:28,240
that because<font color="#CCCCCC"> the purpose</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

1119
00:51:24,549 --> 00:51:32,410
to show<font color="#E5E5E5"> you the approach we took so but</font>

1120
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:34,419
which one is the real real ass well did

1121
00:51:32,410 --> 00:51:36,700
a transform of facebook to facebook

1122
00:51:34,420 --> 00:51:38,680
friends and saw you know that she had a

1123
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:40,058
number of friends they all have a number

1124
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:41,649
of friends and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then it's like yeah but</font>

1125
00:51:40,059 --> 00:51:44,859
which one's a real one let's take a look

1126
00:51:41,650 --> 00:51:48,849
at the location of those people so ran a

1127
00:51:44,859 --> 00:51:51,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">cobbled-together transform which</font>

1128
00:51:48,849 --> 00:51:54,460
identified the location based on their

1129
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:56,799
facebook profile as being here you'll

1130
00:51:54,460 --> 00:51:58,750
see that she had a lot of friends in

1131
00:51:56,799 --> 00:52:01,270
lagos and a lot of friends in

1132
00:51:58,750 --> 00:52:02,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">Newcastle's so it was a good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> chance that</font>

1133
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:05,440
that was going to be the person out of

1134
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:09,970
all of the Alice's that we were you know

1135
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:12,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">we were looking for so an awful lot of</font>

1136
00:52:09,970 --> 00:52:13,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">stuff in the public profile as well see</font>

1137
00:52:12,460 --> 00:52:15,369
if you actually get quite a lot of

1138
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:19,779
information it certainly looked like

1139
00:52:15,369 --> 00:52:21,860
this was our man well I lady so at<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1140
00:52:19,780 --> 00:52:26,360
point I mentioned<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you know</font>

1141
00:52:21,860 --> 00:52:29,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">facebook</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Terms of Service do read them</font>

1142
00:52:26,360 --> 00:52:31,490
there's this guy here Pete worden who's

1143
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:34,370
done I don't know how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> people are</font>

1144
00:52:31,490 --> 00:52:37,759
familiar but this blew my mind actually

1145
00:52:34,370 --> 00:52:43,460
he built his own sore facebook profile

1146
00:52:37,760 --> 00:52:45,560
search engine which was used a hundred

1147
00:52:43,460 --> 00:52:49,490
machine cluster running Hadoop for about

1148
00:52:45,560 --> 00:52:51,830
ten dollars an hour and he crawled

1149
00:52:49,490 --> 00:52:53,810
<font color="#CCCCCC">Facebook this was I think maybe a year</font>

1150
00:52:51,830 --> 00:52:57,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">and a bit ago something like that and</font>

1151
00:52:53,810 --> 00:53:01,940
ended up obtaining 220 million profiles

1152
00:52:57,320 --> 00:53:04,880
from from facebook in about 10<font color="#E5E5E5"> hours</font>

1153
00:53:01,940 --> 00:53:09,200
that cost him about one hundred dollars

1154
00:53:04,880 --> 00:53:13,190
so the ability to crawl and obtain vast

1155
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:18,799
data sets is<font color="#CCCCCC"> is has never really been</font>

1156
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:22,160
been easier but he<font color="#E5E5E5"> ran into a lot legal</font>

1157
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:24,290
trouble with with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook and they're</font>

1158
00:53:22,160 --> 00:53:27,080
pretty clear so really the talk is aimed

1159
00:53:24,290 --> 00:53:29,270
at sharing this particular we

1160
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:31,819
particularly with folks in law

1161
00:53:29,270 --> 00:53:33,920
enforcement who'd be able to you know

1162
00:53:31,820 --> 00:53:36,710
approach<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook legitimately to do</font>

1163
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:39,110
these kinds of searches so don't go and

1164
00:53:36,710 --> 00:53:40,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this without asking nicely and bless</font>

1165
00:53:39,110 --> 00:53:42,260
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to get on the wrong end of</font>

1166
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:44,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">Facebook he'll think you're a little bit</font>

1167
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:47,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">more a little bit more thoroughly than</font>

1168
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:49,610
nigerian scammers even in terms of

1169
00:53:47,180 --> 00:53:53,450
following up so yeah he got 220 million

1170
00:53:49,610 --> 00:53:55,640
which boggled my mind really<font color="#E5E5E5"> did all</font>

1171
00:53:53,450 --> 00:53:58,460
sorts of announces with it check out

1172
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:59,990
Pete wardens website and you can see

1173
00:53:58,460 --> 00:54:04,880
some of the some of the stuff he's done

1174
00:53:59,990 --> 00:54:07,819
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're amazing so okay so information</font>

1175
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:09,500
available to<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so if folks have got</font>

1176
00:54:07,820 --> 00:54:11,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you guys probably know this</font>

1177
00:54:09,500 --> 00:54:14,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're previously set to everybody then</font>

1178
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:16,220
bingo you're in you can crawl pretty

1179
00:54:14,300 --> 00:54:19,130
much anything fascinating and lots of

1180
00:54:16,220 --> 00:54:24,439
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> do that if not you can only do so</font>

1181
00:54:19,130 --> 00:54:26,930
much without being a friend sort of so

1182
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:30,260
how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we get to the the good stuff in</font>

1183
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:32,359
people's profiles well there's a couple

1184
00:54:30,260 --> 00:54:34,130
of ways you can approach this so the

1185
00:54:32,360 --> 00:54:34,820
social zombies talk that's been at

1186
00:54:34,130 --> 00:54:36,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">DEFCON</font>

1187
00:54:34,820 --> 00:54:40,310
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> Connor and whatnot you can create</font>

1188
00:54:36,890 --> 00:54:42,740
bad applications facebook applications

1189
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:44,990
and get<font color="#E5E5E5"> people to use them and then you</font>

1190
00:54:42,740 --> 00:54:47,330
can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> Facebook query language pretty</font>

1191
00:54:44,990 --> 00:54:50,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">well too you know obtain this data so</font>

1192
00:54:47,330 --> 00:54:53,390
there's at least two talks on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> social</font>

1193
00:54:50,450 --> 00:54:57,859
zombies topic you know go and<font color="#E5E5E5"> check them</font>

1194
00:54:53,390 --> 00:55:01,670
out for ideas or you could make friends

1195
00:54:57,860 --> 00:55:05,210
with people and then adopt singes

1196
00:55:01,670 --> 00:55:07,970
approach with<font color="#CCCCCC"> Python and mechanized and</font>

1197
00:55:05,210 --> 00:55:09,470
<font color="#E5E5E5">for that one see Satan is on your your</font>

1198
00:55:07,970 --> 00:55:11,839
friends list and actually there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a talk</font>

1199
00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:15,379
later this afternoon think by Tom Ryan

1200
00:55:11,840 --> 00:55:18,410
might give some good ideas you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know as</font>

1201
00:55:15,380 --> 00:55:20,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">well or you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can follow this guy on</font>

1202
00:55:18,410 --> 00:55:23,899
<font color="#E5E5E5">Twitter he's got a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> website's well the</font>

1203
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:26,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">Harmony guy you know he's identified you</font>

1204
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:29,540
know number<font color="#E5E5E5"> of floors over the last year</font>

1205
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:30,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">what you know with Facebook but if</font>

1206
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:32,600
you're smart there's you know there's

1207
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:36,380
probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> other ways you can you know</font>

1208
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:38,089
approach it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I opted for an easy</font>

1209
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:40,880
approach of sort just making some new

1210
00:55:38,090 --> 00:55:45,320
friends really so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea here is that</font>

1211
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:47,480
you'd create a credible account and

1212
00:55:45,320 --> 00:55:51,080
again take a look<font color="#CCCCCC"> at the talk a bit</font>

1213
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:52,970
later on tonight for<font color="#CCCCCC"> maybe more about</font>

1214
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:56,240
how you're doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that and then build up</font>

1215
00:55:52,970 --> 00:55:57,350
your identity slowly so you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got you</font>

1216
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,660
know something credible some

1217
00:55:57,350 --> 00:56:03,020
interactions on your wall photos and

1218
00:55:59,660 --> 00:56:04,490
stuff like that don't go directly for

1219
00:56:03,020 --> 00:56:06,020
your target<font color="#CCCCCC"> because they'll be like how</font>

1220
00:56:04,490 --> 00:56:07,939
somebody's trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to friend me who's got</font>

1221
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:10,310
nothing on there you know for facebook

1222
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:12,740
profile and they've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> no friends so</font>

1223
00:56:10,310 --> 00:56:15,980
the approach<font color="#CCCCCC"> is really joined sort of</font>

1224
00:56:12,740 --> 00:56:19,220
groups<font color="#CCCCCC"> university schools similar to</font>

1225
00:56:15,980 --> 00:56:22,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">once at your target has got friends of</font>

1226
00:56:19,220 --> 00:56:25,459
friends and then finally home in on on

1227
00:56:22,250 --> 00:56:26,810
your target if they've got<font color="#E5E5E5"> over a</font>

1228
00:56:25,460 --> 00:56:29,630
thousand friends and a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people</font>

1229
00:56:26,810 --> 00:56:32,210
have then basically they're easy and

1230
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:33,770
their friend anyone so they're great

1231
00:56:32,210 --> 00:56:35,690
targets<font color="#CCCCCC"> I also found that</font>

1232
00:56:33,770 --> 00:56:39,140
demographically at least between the UK

1233
00:56:35,690 --> 00:56:41,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">Nigeria Nigerians at least that I made</font>

1234
00:56:39,140 --> 00:56:42,049
friends<font color="#E5E5E5"> with were a lot more eager to</font>

1235
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:46,070
become friends<font color="#CCCCCC"> and people</font>

1236
00:56:42,050 --> 00:56:47,930
in the UK and take your time so i think

1237
00:56:46,070 --> 00:56:51,440
the talk tonight will show how this was

1238
00:56:47,930 --> 00:56:54,589
done over like 28 days I didn't have 28

1239
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:57,680
days so and I wasn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1240
00:56:54,590 --> 00:56:59,090
bothered about being noisy or not so I

1241
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:02,480
basically went through all<font color="#CCCCCC"> that in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about</font>

1242
00:56:59,090 --> 00:57:07,190
two hours and it still worked much to my

1243
00:57:02,480 --> 00:57:10,160
surprise so if you're impatient like me

1244
00:57:07,190 --> 00:57:14,810
can can work so you can<font color="#CCCCCC"> automate this as</font>

1245
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:17,210
well if you've seen the tool imacros<font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font>

1246
00:57:14,810 --> 00:57:19,430
I opus it was in Michael strengths

1247
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:21,860
talked last year don't have a look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

1248
00:57:19,430 --> 00:57:23,299
it's brilliant but you need to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

1249
00:57:21,860 --> 00:57:24,500
careful on<font color="#E5E5E5"> how quickly you're adding</font>

1250
00:57:23,300 --> 00:57:26,330
friends and stuff like that especially

1251
00:57:24,500 --> 00:57:27,800
like on Twitter because if you see

1252
00:57:26,330 --> 00:57:29,569
something adding friends at a rapid rate

1253
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:31,520
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> knots and you'll get your account</font>

1254
00:57:29,570 --> 00:57:33,050
suspended and you have to wait for ages

1255
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:37,130
and then you'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> have no friends when you</font>

1256
00:57:33,050 --> 00:57:40,490
get back and stuff like that so so okay

1257
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:45,200
making friends you know with people on

1258
00:57:40,490 --> 00:57:48,109
facebook so this was this was one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the</font>

1259
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:57,500
responses i got at which point i thought

1260
00:57:48,110 --> 00:58:00,170
i've been busted basically so I said I'm

1261
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:01,910
a friend of Alice's just getting started

1262
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:04,070
with facebook because I didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a</font>

1263
00:58:01,910 --> 00:58:08,810
lot on there I might<font color="#E5E5E5"> have added a few</font>

1264
00:58:04,070 --> 00:58:11,690
too many people<font color="#E5E5E5"> something sorry and and</font>

1265
00:58:08,810 --> 00:58:14,000
that was it<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically yeah well you know</font>

1266
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:18,740
alice is my best friend so you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1267
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:20,600
we're cool brilliant so you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

1268
00:58:18,740 --> 00:58:22,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">was pretty</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> much how it went only a few</font>

1269
00:58:20,600 --> 00:58:23,870
people ever came back<font color="#E5E5E5"> and said hey do I</font>

1270
00:58:22,220 --> 00:58:29,120
actually know you and you know usually

1271
00:58:23,870 --> 00:58:30,589
yeah that worked most of the time or you

1272
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:32,029
could see parties that had been to on

1273
00:58:30,590 --> 00:58:33,320
their Facebook profiles and whatnot so

1274
00:58:32,030 --> 00:58:34,490
yeah I was at this party but I was a

1275
00:58:33,320 --> 00:58:37,610
little<font color="#CCCCCC"> bit drunk so I might got your</font>

1276
00:58:34,490 --> 00:58:39,770
name wrong so this was how went about

1277
00:58:37,610 --> 00:58:44,690
getting a map of interesting people's

1278
00:58:39,770 --> 00:58:47,360
get the friends in you know this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1279
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:49,460
essentially the pseudocode for you know

1280
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:52,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">running you're running your sort of</font>

1281
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:53,829
multi go approach get the location if

1282
00:58:52,460 --> 00:58:56,319
the location is

1283
00:58:53,829 --> 00:59:00,069
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Nigeria Lagos in a bunch of other</font>

1284
00:58:56,319 --> 00:59:04,450
Nigerian places then scrape or past the

1285
00:59:00,069 --> 00:59:06,729
the wall posts download them download

1286
00:59:04,450 --> 00:59:08,919
photos if the wall posts containing

1287
00:59:06,729 --> 00:59:13,118
trusting phrases and you you know you

1288
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:16,569
get to see a lot of those then<font color="#E5E5E5"> download</font>

1289
00:59:13,119 --> 00:59:18,789
those and if<font color="#CCCCCC"> there if they you know</font>

1290
00:59:16,569 --> 00:59:21,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically tick any of those flags and</font>

1291
00:59:18,789 --> 00:59:23,890
pipe them back into<font color="#CCCCCC"> timati go and add</font>

1292
00:59:21,670 --> 00:59:25,359
them to the to the map so like we did

1293
00:59:23,890 --> 00:59:27,609
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Tony Hawk thing where we just</font>

1294
00:59:25,359 --> 00:59:30,729
wanted to tweets where he said you know

1295
00:59:27,609 --> 00:59:33,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">and his name we just wanted the</font>

1296
00:59:30,729 --> 00:59:34,808
interesting people back from from multi

1297
00:59:33,009 --> 00:59:39,609
go that may have had something to<font color="#E5E5E5"> do</font>

1298
00:59:34,809 --> 00:59:40,690
with<font color="#E5E5E5"> being a nigerian scammer so you</font>

1299
00:59:39,609 --> 00:59:43,808
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is essentially what it looks</font>

1300
00:59:40,690 --> 00:59:45,759
like get friends of people you'll see a

1301
00:59:43,809 --> 00:59:47,529
big map start to emerge you do that

1302
00:59:45,759 --> 00:59:50,829
multiple times<font color="#E5E5E5"> you end up with something</font>

1303
00:59:47,529 --> 00:59:52,690
a little bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> like this the bigger</font>

1304
00:59:50,829 --> 00:59:54,039
dots are more interesting so you do a

1305
00:59:52,690 --> 00:59:57,009
bit of pruning that we<font color="#CCCCCC"> mentioned the</font>

1306
00:59:54,039 --> 00:59:59,589
small box at the bottom of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the UK people</font>

1307
00:59:57,009 --> 01:00:01,599
and you end up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a relationship that</font>

1308
00:59:59,589 --> 01:00:04,029
looks a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more like this so the</font>

1309
01:00:01,599 --> 01:00:05,890
big dots are the<font color="#E5E5E5"> major players they're</font>

1310
01:00:04,029 --> 01:00:07,539
all interconnected around the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the edge</font>

1311
01:00:05,890 --> 01:00:09,308
and connected between themselves and

1312
01:00:07,539 --> 01:00:11,380
then they got<font color="#E5E5E5"> people that they connect</font>

1313
01:00:09,309 --> 01:00:12,819
to in the middle so the idea here is

1314
01:00:11,380 --> 01:00:15,699
that you can then<font color="#E5E5E5"> start drilling down on</font>

1315
01:00:12,819 --> 01:00:18,670
these people<font color="#CCCCCC"> and exploring further so</font>

1316
01:00:15,699 --> 01:00:21,130
he'd get interesting facebook updates

1317
01:00:18,670 --> 01:00:24,640
like 7k in<font color="#E5E5E5"> five days which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is kind of</font>

1318
01:00:21,130 --> 01:00:26,559
interesting you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> and looking through</font>

and you know communicating with each

other so<font color="#CCCCCC"> how about something a little</font>

1345
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:38,259
bit more dodgy well there were pictures

1346
01:01:36,550 --> 01:01:40,330
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit like this although not like</font>

1347
01:01:38,260 --> 01:01:41,890
this because if you google you know a

1348
01:01:40,330 --> 01:01:43,630
duffel bag with money then you'll see

1349
01:01:41,890 --> 01:01:47,080
where it got the image from but there

1350
01:01:43,630 --> 01:01:48,490
were similar images let's say some of

1351

more more wealth so then things got a

1357
01:02:03,670 --> 01:02:06,550
little bit more dodgy and that's when I

1358
01:02:05,260 --> 01:02:07,960
thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> well actually maybe I'll stop</font>

1359
01:02:06,550 --> 01:02:10,540
digging around and just leave this up to

1407
01:04:17,079 --> 01:04:21,940
brilliant so now we've got some more

1408
01:04:20,319 --> 01:04:24,579

1409
01:04:21,940 --> 01:04:26,289
between Alice and thus Cameron Nigeria

1410
01:04:24,579 --> 01:04:27,789
which we didn't have before so this was

1411
01:04:26,289 --> 01:04:31,119
of course interesting to the police who

1412
01:04:27,789 --> 01:04:32,950
you know how'd anecdotal evidence or had

1413
01:04:31,119 --> 01:04:34,630
an idea that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this was happening me but</font>

1414
01:04:32,950 --> 01:04:38,499
didn't have anything to actually tie or

1415
01:04:34,630 --> 01:04:43,119
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> together so then they had this</font>

1416
01:04:38,499 --> 01:04:48,069
link with this UK scammer who was also

1417
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:49,690
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know closely related to Alice and so</font>

1418
01:04:48,069 --> 01:04:52,359

1461
01:06:36,780 --> 01:06:41,310
suppose hypothetically is you could pile

1462
01:06:39,840 --> 01:06:44,940
all of the information that you've<font color="#CCCCCC"> found</font>

1463
01:06:41,310 --> 01:06:46,710
and put it in a blog post and also

1464
01:06:44,940 --> 01:06:48,390
create<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe a facebook fan site and</font>

1465
01:06:46,710 --> 01:06:53,400
encourage all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of their friends</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to join</font>

in a couple of days time or something

1470
01:06:59,130 --> 01:07:02,910
Google bit of in dates this and you'll

1471
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:06,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">never get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> rid of it very easily you</font>

1472
01:07:02,910 --> 01:07:07,470
could do that right hypothetically and

1473
01:07:06,030 --> 01:07:09,390
then you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow up with a call i</font>

1474
01:07:07,470 --> 01:07:11,250
don't know about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the US but in the UK</font>

1479
01:07:21,609 --> 01:07:25,869
it's been<font color="#CCCCCC"> a little misunderstanding</font>

1480
01:07:22,839 --> 01:07:28,150
that's uh you know how do you get the

1481
01:07:25,869 --> 01:07:29,890
scammers dollars into<font color="#E5E5E5"> your bank well</font>

1482
01:07:28,150 --> 01:07:31,119
cash obviously is going to be tricky

1483
01:07:29,890 --> 01:07:33,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">because where are you going to exchange</font>

1484
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:34,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">the cash oh yeah meet me here yeah just</font>

01:07:34,839 --> 01:07:38,619
especially not those people<font color="#CCCCCC"> with guns</font>

1487
01:07:36,220 --> 01:07:40,390
because they kind of scare me and then

1488
01:07:38,619 --> 01:07:43,329
bank well what do you do the bank give

1489

01:07:43,329 --> 01:07:47,950

1491
01:07:46,270 --> 01:07:50,140
be linked to an individual not a great

1492
01:07:47,950 --> 01:07:51,879
idea Western Union you're going to have

1493

to give<font color="#E5E5E5"> them a name or a fake ID or</font>

sense if you were to do which I<font color="#E5E5E5"> must</font>

1498
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:04,599
certificates because you can get them

1499
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:06,640
then email to like just an email<font color="#E5E5E5"> address</font>

1500
01:08:04,599 --> 01:08:08,619
and nobody's any of your wiser job<font color="#E5E5E5"> done</font>

you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're limited to was it five</font>

1502
01:08:08,619 --> 01:08:12,640
hundred dollars or something like that

1503
01:08:09,820 --> 01:08:15,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">that'd probably be the only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> way you go</font>

1504
01:08:12,640 --> 01:08:16,479
to a scammer and say actually here's how

1505
01:08:15,010 --> 01:08:17,799
it like my money back or<font color="#E5E5E5"> you could say</font>

1506
01:08:16,479 --> 01:08:19,718
just go to the police<font color="#CCCCCC"> and hand by</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1507
01:08:17,799 --> 01:08:25,028
laptop<font color="#CCCCCC"> we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have the laptop so</font>

1508
01:08:19,719 --> 01:08:27,250
health warnings yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> i wouldn't</font>

1509
01:08:25,029 --> 01:08:30,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">recommend do it or completely you know</font>

1510
01:08:27,250 --> 01:08:32,799
anonymize this if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are going to do it</font>

1511
01:08:30,189 --> 01:08:36,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">are you limited to generally to public</font>

1512
01:08:32,799 --> 01:08:38,500
information read the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Terms of Service</font>

1513
01:08:36,339 --> 01:08:40,120
because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> Facebook are very tight on</font>

1514
01:08:38,500 --> 01:08:43,210
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> wealth</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of information but they're</font>

1515
01:08:40,120 --> 01:08:45,488
very tight so<font color="#E5E5E5"> really law enforcement or</font>

1516
01:08:43,210 --> 01:08:49,930
if you're you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know in a corporation go</font>

1517
01:08:45,488 --> 01:08:54,580
through legitimate channels you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

1518
01:08:49,930 --> 01:08:59,080
tough friend up with your own account at

1519
01:08:54,580 --> 01:09:02,469
<font color="#CCCCCC">your own risk you'd need to be nuts to</font>

1520
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:04,180
do that really but then setting up the

1521
01:09:02,469 --> 01:09:05,920
second account would also be a violation

1522
01:09:04,180 --> 01:09:08,080
of terms of service so you perhaps

1523
01:09:05,920 --> 01:09:09,640
wouldn't want to do that either so maybe

1524
01:09:08,080 --> 01:09:11,469
you could convince another friend who

1525
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:13,450
just happens to you know live in the

1526
01:09:11,469 --> 01:09:16,540
same house as you have a different<font color="#CCCCCC"> name</font>

1527
01:09:13,450 --> 01:09:18,219
<font color="#E5E5E5">to do that work with law enforcement and</font>

1528
01:09:16,540 --> 01:09:21,069
keep on the<font color="#CCCCCC"> right side of you know where</font>

1529
01:09:18,219 --> 01:09:22,630
things are<font color="#E5E5E5"> at and if you wanted to do</font>

1530
01:09:21,069 --> 01:09:23,870
any of that you'd have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to break terms of</font>

1531
01:09:22,630 --> 01:09:28,609
service so

1532
01:09:23,870 --> 01:09:31,340
you know so wrapping up the talk mining

1533
01:09:28,609 --> 01:09:36,410
data has got more accessible than ever

1534
01:09:31,340 --> 01:09:38,540
before visualization can help you home

1535
01:09:36,410 --> 01:09:39,950
in that's the key point really because

1536
01:09:38,540 --> 01:09:42,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">you might be sitting here thinking why I</font>

1537
01:09:39,950 --> 01:09:44,569
can do all this stuff anyway but it's

1538
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:47,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">going to help you home in on interesting</font>

1539
01:09:44,569 --> 01:09:49,490
relationships and finally things like

1540
01:09:47,630 --> 01:09:51,560
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting the metadata or named</font>

1541
01:09:49,490 --> 01:09:54,559
entity recognition that can help you

1542
01:09:51,560 --> 01:09:56,510
really classify information combination
