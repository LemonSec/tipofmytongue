1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,529
so the talk today and you know when Mike

2
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,080
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I thought</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about putting this talk</font>

3
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:09,030
together we we<font color="#CCCCCC"> spent a lot of time</font>

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:13,469
speaking with folks about their careers

5
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:16,650
a lot of folks are very good at what

6
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:18,419
they do and their profession and there

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,970
might be great pen testers or great risk

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:25,320
managers but a lot of<font color="#E5E5E5"> times what</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> happens</font>

9
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:27,840
is that in the throes of your job you

10
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:30,810
stop thinking about yourself you stop

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:32,308
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about what's the future</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and I</font>

12
00:00:30,810 --> 00:00:34,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">think a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of times those things kind</font>

13
00:00:32,308 --> 00:00:36,809
<font color="#E5E5E5">of way on your satisfaction people get</font>

14
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,519
into ruts and I think that when it comes

15
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:42,149
<font color="#E5E5E5">down</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to it you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really have to start</font>

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:44,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking about your career as if you</font>

17
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:48,149
were running<font color="#E5E5E5"> your own company because at</font>

18
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:50,190
the end of times you are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the biggest</font>

19
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:51,899
money-making vehicle that you have it's

20
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:54,089
bigger than any investment it's bigger

21
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:56,850
than the stock market real estate

22
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,920
obviously real estate but I mean

23
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:01,530
especially<font color="#E5E5E5"> in Vegas there you go but I</font>

24
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,500
mean it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the one investment that you</font>

25
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:08,189
really control and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think that if</font>

26
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:11,220
people took a more business focused

27
00:01:08,189 --> 00:01:15,389
approach to managing their careers

28
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:17,610
satisfaction would increase compensation

29
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:20,400
would increase and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you would probably</font>

30
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:24,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">get to where you want to go a lot</font>

31
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,790
quicker Michael Gerber the famous author

32
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:30,600
of a book called the e-myth writes a lot

33
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:31,530
about entrepreneurship and says that one

34
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,089
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the biggest problems for</font>

35
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:36,360
entrepreneurs and both both Lee and I

36
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:38,820
are entrepreneurs so we you know live

37
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,229
this daily one of the biggest problems

38
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:42,449
that most entrepreneurs face is getting

39
00:01:40,229 --> 00:01:44,280
stuck working in their business too much

40
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:46,950
and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> working on their business and up</font>

41
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,600
so you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you're a pen tester you</font>

42
00:01:46,950 --> 00:01:52,259
spend all your time doing pen tests and

43
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,539
<font color="#CCCCCC">you don't spend</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your time doing sales</font>

44
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:57,570
doing marketing doing finance doing

45
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:00,840
operations because it's so I mean we<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

46
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:02,669
do our thing and if that's a problem for

47
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,070
entrepreneurs who really you know are

48
00:02:02,670 --> 00:02:07,049
aware that a business has all that that

49
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:09,959
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an issue it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> even more of a</font>

50
00:02:07,049 --> 00:02:13,110
problem for us you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> as practitioners</font>

51
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:13,710
most of<font color="#E5E5E5"> us work in our jobs almost</font>

52
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,530
exclusively

53
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,600
how often do you go to work<font color="#E5E5E5"> and think</font>

54
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:23,400
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do my tasks today I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need to</font>

55
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:25,470
work on<font color="#E5E5E5"> my career you don't you go and</font>

56
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:26,610
you go do your thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> for however much</font>

57
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:30,060
time and then you come home and you're

58
00:02:26,610 --> 00:02:32,130
done but that becomes a problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> because</font>

59
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,770
that becomes you know you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> progress</font>

60
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:37,170
over the course of 30 or<font color="#E5E5E5"> 40 years</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

61
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:41,220
frankly that was something we could have

62
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:43,140
done a long time ago but security is

63
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,790
really changing and we've said it for

64
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,339
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> last couple of years wherever we've</font>

65
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,380
talked our industry is<font color="#E5E5E5"> undergoing a sea</font>

66
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:51,120
change partially because the economy is

67
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:54,120
bad but also partially because we're

68
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,980
growing<font color="#E5E5E5"> up you know it's changed</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a whole</font>

69
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,320
lot in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> last</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> few years and we see</font>

70
00:02:55,980 --> 00:03:01,590
then then you know the job of the future

71
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:03,510
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next five years changing even more</font>

72
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:05,520
than<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's changed to this point and I</font>

73
00:03:03,510 --> 00:03:07,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">think the most important thing about the</font>

74
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:10,920
future is that<font color="#E5E5E5"> time remains a constant</font>

75
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:14,040
in everybody's career and the<font color="#CCCCCC"> future</font>

76
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:16,049
will eventually get here so the time to

77
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,720
start planning for the future is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

78
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:20,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">now and if you start looking at some</font>

79
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,670
components you know we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> not in our</font>

80
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:26,609
parents workforce your companies are not

81
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:29,880
<font color="#E5E5E5">making the investments necessary in</font>

82
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:32,430
their people so investing in building

83
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:37,590
your careers is something that is your

84
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:39,450
responsibility and if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look around if</font>

85
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:43,170
you look<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the people in the room</font>

86
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:46,019
everybody wants the same thing how many

87
00:03:43,170 --> 00:03:47,940
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> would aspire to be either a chief</font>

88
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:53,190
security architect or chief information

89
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:54,420
security officer in this room I mean how

90
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:58,230
many would aspire to be an entrepreneur

91
00:03:54,420 --> 00:04:00,329
<font color="#E5E5E5">of some sort so basically everybody</font>

92
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:03,119
wants if you look around we all want the

93
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:05,520
same thing so think about who you're

94
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,410
competing with you're competing with

95
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:09,870
everybody else in the room just like<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

96
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:13,109
business in business the product vendors

97
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:16,320
compete the services vendors compete the

98
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:19,080
car manufacturers compete so when you

99
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:21,540
start thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it is that if the</font>

100
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:24,479
companies aren't going to care about how

101
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:27,130
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> get there it really becomes your</font>

102
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:30,250
responsibility and<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're undertaking</font>

103
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:32,890
and the differentiators are going away

104
00:04:30,250 --> 00:04:34,660
you know when i got my<font color="#E5E5E5"> i said this on a</font>

105
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:37,960
podcast i was on yesterday when i got my

106
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:39,220
cissp<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was cissp no number eleven</font>

107
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:42,310
thousand or something it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

108
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:45,400
low number and nobody really<font color="#E5E5E5"> had one so</font>

109
00:04:42,310 --> 00:04:48,880
cissp was a differentiator there's 60

110
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:50,590
that there's 67,000 CSS peas at this

111
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,350
point everybody is everybody feeling

112
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:55,390
special now yeah that's exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually</font>

113
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:57,460
brought up we're gonna change his slide

114
00:04:55,390 --> 00:04:59,380
at some point to be a deli counter with

115
00:04:57,460 --> 00:05:02,140
those little ticket number things your

116
00:04:59,380 --> 00:05:05,260
number 67,000 now serving yeah now

117
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:07,180
serving number 67,000 how does you know

118
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:08,890
it's there's no college football ranking

119
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:12,010
system that says this person's number

120
00:05:08,890 --> 00:05:14,050
two and this person's number 67,000 it

121
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:17,890
doesn't mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything anymore it's the</font>

122
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:19,810
price of<font color="#CCCCCC"> admission it's a signal of your</font>

123
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:21,940
interest in the industry and of a

124
00:05:19,810 --> 00:05:24,100
moderately baseline level of competence

125
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:27,370
it means you read a book that's not a

126
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:30,190
bad thing but it's not a differentiator

127
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:33,250
it's not going to help get you where you

128
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:35,620
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go alone it's going to be a</font>

129
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:38,500
component but<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not going to be the</font>

130
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:40,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">only thing and went in the past it was</font>

131
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,510
enough now it's just a ticket to the

132
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,040
party and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's like I mean we've our</font>

133
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:48,010
industry is especially prone to this

134
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:50,020
it's it's like<font color="#E5E5E5"> you you know what you</font>

135
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:51,400
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is move to the point where</font>

business for myself well most of those

143
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:08,830
people just end up as contractors you

144
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:10,390
know they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> not really in business</font>

factor in making business decisions so

237
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:12,470
you start thinking about all these

238
00:10:10,430 --> 00:10:14,270
different components just as if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you are</font>

243
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:30,199
that's almost exactly right that's what

244
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:32,270
we saw we did a big serve a two year and

245
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:37,160
a half ago now and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> what our</font>

00:10:32,270 --> 00:10:38,510

249
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,010
more likely better off than the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

the room you make more<font color="#E5E5E5"> money you're</font>

253
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:55,769

254
00:10:53,000 --> 00:10:57,959
not making the mistake that

255
00:10:55,769 --> 00:10:59,670
the correlation implies causality I'm

256
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:01,469
not saying if you write a plan you're

257
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:02,729
suddenly going to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be better off but for</font>

258
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:06,119
some reason the people who plan are

259
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:07,980
better off don't know why<font color="#CCCCCC"> but I have a</font>

260
00:11:06,119 --> 00:11:09,509
hunch that if you know where you're

261
00:11:07,980 --> 00:11:12,360
going you end up getting there more

262
00:11:09,509 --> 00:11:14,040
often if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know that I'd be really</font>

263
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:18,089
happy if I had a job where<font color="#CCCCCC"> I didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

264
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:19,860
to travel if you thought that out you

265
00:11:18,089 --> 00:11:23,699
can seek that out if you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it</font>

266
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:28,350
out you don't get there ultimately you

267
00:11:23,699 --> 00:11:29,699
need to if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> really want to run your</font>

00:12:12,569 --> 00:12:19,559
happens but a plan gives you focus and a

288
00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:20,819
reference point with which to navigate

289
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:21,990
the decisions you're going to make so

290
00:12:20,819 --> 00:12:23,849
think about when you're building your

293
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:29,459
<font color="#E5E5E5">share our hands we all thought of maybe</font>

294
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:31,290
what our ultimate career goals are

295
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:33,239
that's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> great place to start when</font>

296
00:12:31,290 --> 00:12:35,040
you're building a plan think about the

297
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:36,990
destination that you want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> go towards</font>

298
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:39,509
and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> just have to start getting</font>

299
00:12:36,990 --> 00:12:41,100
honest<font color="#E5E5E5"> with yourself you have to really</font>

300
00:12:39,509 --> 00:12:44,699
take a good look in the mirror<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

301
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:48,419

other people think of your skills and

305
00:12:53,459 --> 00:12:59,939
then you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to take a look and you say</font>

306
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:02,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> let's do a gap assessment if I want</font>

be qualified for my for my for my<font color="#CCCCCC"> long</font>

313
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:26,290
of think about your competition because

314
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:32,050
they're thinking the same exact thing

315
00:13:26,290 --> 00:13:34,540
the idea is this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> career has</font>

316
00:13:32,050 --> 00:13:38,319
an ultimate destination but their

317
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:41,110
destinations along the way and different

318
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:44,680
making the right decisions about which

319
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:47,470
jobs you take which type of companies

320
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:49,839
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you work in there should be a</font>

321
00:13:47,470 --> 00:13:52,420
strategy towards that there should be a

322
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:54,579
method to that madness so we will

323
00:13:52,420 --> 00:13:57,430
ultimately lead you where you want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go</font>

324
00:13:54,579 --> 00:13:59,079
and there's so many different<font color="#E5E5E5"> directions</font>

325
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:03,399
that you can take<font color="#E5E5E5"> in information</font>

326
00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:07,120
security that it's it's generally very

327
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:09,550
easy to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get lost it's very easy to take</font>

328
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,230
a position where you don't pick up any

you found that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the job that you've taken</font>

333
00:14:18,339 --> 00:14:24,850
is basically the same job<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you left</font>

334
00:14:21,310 --> 00:14:27,008
and it's just that you've maybe have

335
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:28,089
gotten a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit more money maybe</font>

you start laying those things out and

432
00:19:04,520 --> 00:19:14,000
start basing your decisions upon those

433
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:15,410

00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:10,280
and you have to decide is that deal

worth taking to be misaligned to be off

455

the the current path to be taken aside

456

so<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to know your priorities and</font>

457
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:18,139
you have to know what trade-offs you're

of times people have big goals right I

461
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:27,830
mean it's easy to<font color="#CCCCCC"> have a big goal but</font>

462
00:20:25,820 --> 00:20:30,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> hard to achieve the goal</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

465
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:39,110
more people aspire to have that goal I

466
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:42,439
will tell<font color="#E5E5E5"> you this is that you know I</font>

467
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:44,870
it's one of these items where when you

468
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:46,850
look at it you know the more you're

469
00:20:44,870 --> 00:20:49,520
willing to sacrifice and put into

470
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:52,040
something probably<font color="#CCCCCC"> the more reward</font>

471
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:53,750
you're going to get so you start

472
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:55,460
thinking about that in terms of your

473
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:58,640
career and you start thinking about what

474
00:20:55,460 --> 00:21:02,030
you're willing to do is that if getting

475
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:04,730
to where<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to go requires you to</font>

476
00:21:02,030 --> 00:21:06,500
travel around the world and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

477
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:09,230
important for you to<font color="#CCCCCC"> be home to pick up</font>

478
00:21:06,500 --> 00:21:12,800
your<font color="#CCCCCC"> kids from school it's probably</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

479
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:14,510
going to align so you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> figure out</font>

480
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:16,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">what's important to you and align it</font>

481
00:21:14,510 --> 00:21:19,850
that way<font color="#E5E5E5"> and be honest with what you're</font>

482
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:21,800
willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> put in because generally what</font>

483
00:21:19,850 --> 00:21:24,169
it is it you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> garbage in garbage out</font>

484
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:27,050
right so if you start thinking about

485
00:21:24,170 --> 00:21:29,690
your career in those ways you have to

486
00:21:27,050 --> 00:21:32,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">then by aligning where the direction you</font>

487
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:34,130
want ahead with what's important to you

488
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:36,260
you're more apt to get better

489
00:21:34,130 --> 00:21:38,930
satisfaction you're more apt to

490
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:41,930
accomplish a realistic career goal so

491
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:46,370
well as the question what matters to you

492
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:47,990
and when we did<font color="#E5E5E5"> it when we did our one</font>

take less money<font color="#CCCCCC"> for what and what would</font>

501
00:22:09,110 --> 00:22:15,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">you I thought the results of this was so</font>

502
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:18,139
we're interesting right I mean we got

503
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:20,930
about was a 460 respondents me to offer

504
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:23,450
we did this over two months in the

505
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:25,100
spring of this year and the number one

506
00:22:23,450 --> 00:22:26,870
answer you guys will<font color="#CCCCCC"> see the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> chart at</font>

507
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:29,840
forty-nine percent people they said I

508
00:22:26,870 --> 00:22:32,540
would give up money to<font color="#CCCCCC"> save my ass I</font>

509
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:34,370
thought that<font color="#E5E5E5"> number would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be bigger I</font>

510
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:36,830
would give up salary to save my ass

511
00:22:34,370 --> 00:22:37,909
generally speaking but only forty-nine

512
00:22:36,830 --> 00:22:41,210
percent so I thought that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was a</font>

513
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:44,150
lot of confidence out there but the only

514
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:46,430
thing that was next was training in

515
00:22:44,150 --> 00:22:49,520
education forty-seven percent but

516
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:53,570
statistically almost a dead heat that

517
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:56,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">people said is that getting more skills</font>

518
00:22:53,570 --> 00:23:00,590
training<font color="#E5E5E5"> and education or is almost</font>

519
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:03,440
equivalent to saving your ass we're an

520
00:23:00,590 --> 00:23:04,699
interesting industry like that and the

521
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:07,940
other three you know the<font color="#E5E5E5"> next three</font>

522
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:09,650
things<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know between we're all real</font>

523
00:23:07,940 --> 00:23:13,520
quality of life issues right I mean

524
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:15,920
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically work fewer hours more vacation</font>

525
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:18,170
which are definitely to me I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> are</font>

526
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:19,520
the same thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> and you're the ability to</font>

527
00:23:18,170 --> 00:23:21,710
telecommute have some better beYOU know

528
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:23,060
work-life balance you think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

529
00:23:21,710 --> 00:23:25,010
though is that when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start thinking</font>

530
00:23:23,060 --> 00:23:27,350
<font color="#CCCCCC">about your career</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in salary that people</font>

531
00:23:25,010 --> 00:23:30,650
are driven by things that<font color="#E5E5E5"> make them feel</font>

532
00:23:27,350 --> 00:23:33,350
better that get them smarter but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

533
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:36,530
have to identify what's important to you

534
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:39,409
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> is your business each business has</font>

535
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:40,850
different priorities you managing your

536
00:23:39,410 --> 00:23:44,150
career are going to have<font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

537
00:23:40,850 --> 00:23:46,010
priorities than your neighbor so once

538
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:48,950
you've figured out priorities it's time

539
00:23:46,010 --> 00:23:52,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">to talk about product development it's</font>

540
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:55,310
time to<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your skills and this</font>

541
00:23:52,910 --> 00:23:56,780
is where you know we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to sound</font>

542
00:23:55,310 --> 00:23:57,889
like the standard<font color="#E5E5E5"> career people we're</font>

543
00:23:56,780 --> 00:23:59,000
going to talk about skills and

544
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:02,120
certifications and all that kind of

545
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:06,110
stuff but it goes beyond just talking

546
00:24:02,120 --> 00:24:08,600
about skills if you think about it like

547
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:10,610
running a business how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you guys</font>

548
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:13,340
are on the product side of this industry

549
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:16,428
work for a vendor or have worked<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font>

550
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:19,999
vendor at some point

<font color="#CCCCCC">mm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> okay about 10 maybe a little more</font>

552
00:24:19,999 --> 00:24:28,159
percent so product management what do

they<font color="#E5E5E5"> do what's the product manager do</font>

00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:40,159
anyone right they sit down and they

555
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:43,789
figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out all the all the features of</font>

556
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:45,649
what a product needs and it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

557
00:24:43,789 --> 00:24:47,330
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the bells and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> whistles it's not</font>

558
00:24:45,649 --> 00:24:49,639
just how the product is developed but

559
00:24:47,330 --> 00:24:51,408
it's the whole product it's what how do

560

562
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:59,570
whole package it's the same thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> when</font>

563
00:24:57,649 --> 00:25:02,418
it comes to you it's not<font color="#CCCCCC"> just a question</font>

564
00:24:59,570 --> 00:25:03,918
of what certs do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I need and what book do</font>

different and you see this if you look

601
00:26:42,440 --> 00:26:45,140
at products through the market it's part

602
00:26:43,850 --> 00:26:48,110
of the brand identity as part of the

603
00:26:45,140 --> 00:26:50,059
product identity and you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> make</font>

all of these decisions about your

talk more<font color="#E5E5E5"> about that later when we get</font>

00:26:58,549 --> 00:27:04,250
your skill matrix right I mean we<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

610
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:06,350
have very hard skills we're good at

technology we understand risk management

612
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:10,760
we understand frameworks but we start

613
00:27:08,900 --> 00:27:12,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">thinking about a skill matrix and start</font>

614
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:16,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking about the skill matrix is not</font>

615
00:27:12,650 --> 00:27:19,370
just your experience and your skills but

616
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:21,470
the ability<font color="#CCCCCC"> to correlate those skills</font>

617
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:26,418
and then to communicate it to others

618
00:27:21,470 --> 00:27:29,750
that can make a difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> so it's the</font>

619
00:27:26,419 --> 00:27:33,110
combination of understanding who you are

620
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:36,740
what you're doing and your ability to

621
00:27:33,110 --> 00:27:41,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">then leverage these experiences to build</font>

622

a case<font color="#E5E5E5"> to make it that your product is a</font>

624
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:48,260
cases so when you start thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

625
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:50,900
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> career start thinking about</font>

626
00:27:48,260 --> 00:27:53,629
leveraging your experiences on top of

627
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:56,299
<font color="#E5E5E5">each other because when you come down to</font>

628
00:27:53,630 --> 00:28:01,429
<font color="#CCCCCC">it is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you eventually want to get to</font>

629
00:27:56,299 --> 00:28:03,950
a point where to build these skills you

630
00:28:01,429 --> 00:28:05,780
want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to make sure you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't repeat you</font>

631
00:28:03,950 --> 00:28:07,760
want to make sure<font color="#E5E5E5"> that your skills the</font>

632
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:11,360
return on your investments are not

633
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:14,929

634
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:16,189
people<font color="#E5E5E5"> will pay for certain skills so</font>

635
00:28:14,929 --> 00:28:17,630
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it for a second think of it</font>

636
00:28:16,190 --> 00:28:19,669
let's use an example from our industry

637
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:23,630
you're an antivirus company your

638
00:28:19,669 --> 00:28:26,150
semantics we all know that they<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

639
00:28:23,630 --> 00:28:29,570
have signatures for every virus why not

640
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:32,150
the good you could<font color="#CCCCCC"> hire a thousand</font>

641
00:28:29,570 --> 00:28:34,070
signature developers and you could make

642
00:28:32,150 --> 00:28:36,980
a massive team and you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend a huge</font>

643
00:28:34,070 --> 00:28:38,750
amount of money to make sure that you

644
00:28:36,980 --> 00:28:40,250
had all the signatures or at least as

645
00:28:38,750 --> 00:28:43,490
close to all as statistically possible

646
00:28:40,250 --> 00:28:44,929
but there's no point B

647
00:28:43,490 --> 00:28:46,550
<font color="#CCCCCC">as they couldn't possibly sell the</font>

648
00:28:44,929 --> 00:28:49,340
product for enough it wouldn't be enough

649
00:28:46,550 --> 00:28:54,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">of a competitive advantage to sell the</font>

650
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:57,050
product enough to justify the spin same

651
00:28:54,530 --> 00:29:00,050
thing in working on<font color="#E5E5E5"> your strengths you</font>

652
00:28:57,050 --> 00:29:02,270
can only be so good at one thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> before</font>

653
00:29:00,050 --> 00:29:05,750
it stops mattering before it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the you</font>

654
00:29:02,270 --> 00:29:07,550
know you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> only be you can only be a</font>

655
00:29:05,750 --> 00:29:12,080
great researcher to a certain point

656
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:16,100
before being any better at it doesn't

657
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:17,840
get you any more sales<font color="#E5E5E5"> effectively well</font>

658
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:19,610
the other thing is<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that more as</font>

659
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:23,928
more and more people acquire the same

660
00:29:19,610 --> 00:29:25,760
skill you know people talk in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

661
00:29:23,929 --> 00:29:28,190
times in sports they'll talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the</font>

662
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:31,429
value over an average player so in other

663
00:29:28,190 --> 00:29:32,870
words if<font color="#CCCCCC"> the average centerfielder never</font>

664
00:29:31,429 --> 00:29:35,809
liked baseball but if you like the

665
00:29:32,870 --> 00:29:39,050
average center fielder hits 275 and hits

666
00:29:35,809 --> 00:29:41,270
10 home runs and drives in 60 runs well

667
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:43,669
that's the average person so if you to

668
00:29:41,270 --> 00:29:46,820
build that the next<font color="#E5E5E5"> step you're not</font>

669
00:29:43,670 --> 00:29:49,670
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about well how much added value</font>

670
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:52,340
is if my center fielder hit 280 hit 15

671
00:29:49,670 --> 00:29:53,990
home runs and drove in 85 runs so it's

672
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:57,320
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you start thinking yourself</font>

673
00:29:53,990 --> 00:30:00,020
about what's the added incentive to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

674
00:29:57,320 --> 00:30:02,389
better is my time best spent getting

675
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:06,200
better at something I'm already good at

676
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:08,300
or is<font color="#E5E5E5"> my time better spent focusing on</font>

677
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:11,690
things in areas that I'm deficient in

678
00:30:08,300 --> 00:30:14,090
and getting them to a point where they

679
00:30:11,690 --> 00:30:16,520
become skills where I take a weakness

680
00:30:14,090 --> 00:30:18,860
and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> drive it to become a skill because</font>

00:30:16,520 --> 00:30:22,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">when you start thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about when you</font>

able to do that is by proving to others

that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have the additional skills</font>

712
00:31:50,659 --> 00:31:57,380
story of Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla

713
00:31:54,289 --> 00:31:59,570
and how they were sort of intertwined

714
00:31:57,380 --> 00:32:02,149
why does everybody know Edison and

715
00:31:59,570 --> 00:32:04,879
nobody knows Tesla it's because Edison

716
00:32:02,149 --> 00:32:08,330
was a great salesperson they were both

717
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:11,809
great inventors<font color="#CCCCCC"> but Edison sold his</font>

718
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:13,610
ideas and Tesla sat in a lab and came up

719
00:32:11,809 --> 00:32:18,230
with crazy stuff and was the traditional

00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:29,750
being a crackpot admired by a few his

sales we<font color="#E5E5E5"> sometimes think especially in</font>

724
00:32:29,750 --> 00:32:36,799
the more lofty sort of academic ways of

725
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:38,960
that we often<font color="#E5E5E5"> get around black hat and</font>

of those sad but but true facts of life

730
00:32:48,380 --> 00:32:51,740
that you can be the smartest person<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

response to an ad in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> local club you</font>

787
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:29,470
know newspaper classifieds a resume is a

788
00:35:25,210 --> 00:35:31,990
sales letter a resume is a sales letter

789
00:35:29,470 --> 00:35:34,569
that says hey I might be calling on you

790
00:35:31,990 --> 00:35:35,828
later you all dealt with salespeople at

791
00:35:34,569 --> 00:35:39,279
some point if you've walked through this

792
00:35:35,829 --> 00:35:40,630
conference they get your email address

793
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:43,420
when they scan your badge and then they

794
00:35:40,630 --> 00:35:44,650
send you something that's exactly<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">you're doing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> when you're sending a</font>

00:35:48,550 --> 00:35:51,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">everybody being your potential customer</font>

798
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:55,450
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know one of the things</font>

799
00:35:51,970 --> 00:35:59,109
that people forget is that they go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

800
00:35:55,450 --> 00:36:01,689
places or they put themselves in

801
00:35:59,109 --> 00:36:03,670
position where they don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have unique</font>

802
00:36:01,690 --> 00:36:06,910
skills where you know they<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to speak</font>

803
00:36:03,670 --> 00:36:08,800
at a security conference as opposed to

804
00:36:06,910 --> 00:36:11,500
if you wanted to become<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> chief</font>

805
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,720
information security officer in the

806
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:16,089
<font color="#CCCCCC">health care industry instead of speaking</font>

807
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:17,950
in a security event you might want to

808
00:36:16,089 --> 00:36:21,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">start gravitating to go to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> healthcare</font>

809
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:23,259
events so the<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea is this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that you</font>

810
00:36:21,190 --> 00:36:25,690
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go to places when you're selling</font>

811
00:36:23,260 --> 00:36:29,140
<font color="#CCCCCC">yourself to places where you are the</font>

812
00:36:25,690 --> 00:36:32,050
unique one you go to places where you

813
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:34,509
are the oddity where people where you

814
00:36:32,050 --> 00:36:37,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">have information that people can't get</font>

815
00:36:34,510 --> 00:36:40,630
anywhere else in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> room you become</font>

816
00:36:37,420 --> 00:36:42,190
that expert you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about it when you</font>

817
00:36:40,630 --> 00:36:43,839
<font color="#E5E5E5">have a product need and there is a</font>

818
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:45,970
solution that really will solve your

819
00:36:43,839 --> 00:36:49,089
problem you might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that calls</font>

820
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:51,250
the salesperson I mean how easy would it

821
00:36:49,089 --> 00:36:53,230
be to interview for a position if

822
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:54,609
somebody called<font color="#E5E5E5"> you up and said hey we</font>

823
00:36:53,230 --> 00:36:57,430
have an opening and we think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you'd be</font>

824
00:36:54,609 --> 00:37:00,190
perfect for it not much<font color="#CCCCCC"> of an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interview</font>

825
00:36:57,430 --> 00:37:02,649
process right how much different is that

826
00:37:00,190 --> 00:37:05,410
then if you just send your resume to

827
00:37:02,650 --> 00:37:08,109
some blind website and you know you're

828
00:37:05,410 --> 00:37:11,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">one of 150 people in the black hole of</font>

830
00:37:11,950 --> 00:37:18,759
you think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> seek</font>

there selling yourself and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know you</font>

833
00:37:20,619 --> 00:37:25,119
could sell yourself in ways where just

834
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:27,129
by volunteering yourself getting out

835
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:29,890
there and trying to<font color="#E5E5E5"> help others help</font>

836
00:37:27,130 --> 00:37:31,760
people in your current<font color="#CCCCCC"> companies solve</font>

837
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:35,600
security problems

838
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:38,660
go beyond your job descriptions build

839
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:43,069
friends within your organization that

840
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:45,170

about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what people are going to think</font>

about<font color="#CCCCCC"> you in that your job if you become</font>

the person that they count on to help

844
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:58,010
them solve security problems think about

845
00:37:56,180 --> 00:38:00,919
when the next internal promotion comes

846
00:37:58,010 --> 00:38:03,440
up and they ask others who do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think</font>

847
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:05,780
we<font color="#CCCCCC"> should give it to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> well if an</font>

market you know market awareness Carol

881
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:17,828
managing perception I think those are

882
00:40:15,759 --> 00:40:20,049
all good answers I mean you know I mean

883
00:40:17,829 --> 00:40:23,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">to me you know selling</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is almost the act</font>

884
00:40:20,049 --> 00:40:25,630
and marketing is almost the method right

885
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:27,368
I mean that's how I look kind of look at

886
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:30,220
it<font color="#CCCCCC"> I kind of look at you know marketing</font>

887
00:40:27,369 --> 00:40:32,229
really becomes you know marketing might

888
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:35,410
be the bow and the nice wrapping paper

889
00:40:32,229 --> 00:40:36,848
on top of the actual package itself so I

890
00:40:35,410 --> 00:40:37,930
you know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about marketing you</font>

891
00:40:36,849 --> 00:40:40,329
know you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to really talk about</font>

892
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:42,729
branding and building the brand oh

893
00:40:40,329 --> 00:40:44,170
you'll companies spend millions and

894
00:40:42,729 --> 00:40:48,009
billions<font color="#E5E5E5"> and billions of dollars to</font>

895
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:51,130
build that brand and ultimately that's

896
00:40:48,009 --> 00:40:54,609
all about one thing the purpose of

897
00:40:51,130 --> 00:40:56,589
marketing is really simple and<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

898
00:40:54,609 --> 00:40:58,808
measure a successful marketing program

899
00:40:56,589 --> 00:41:02,558
in my opinion as somebody who does a lot

900
00:40:58,809 --> 00:41:05,380
of marketing by one thing how many leads

901
00:41:02,559 --> 00:41:08,559
do you have marketing is lead generation

902
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:11,739
how many leads how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people out there</font>

903
00:41:08,559 --> 00:41:13,569
are aware of what you do and<font color="#E5E5E5"> are</font>

904
00:41:11,739 --> 00:41:16,450
interested<font color="#E5E5E5"> enough to talk to you about</font>

905
00:41:13,569 --> 00:41:20,229
it that's when sale starts sales starts

906
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:23,439
when the lead shows up as<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lee says you</font>

907
00:41:20,229 --> 00:41:24,968
know that's when the act starts but

908
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:27,849
marketing is the act of creating

909
00:41:24,969 --> 00:41:30,339
awareness in all the people who could

910
00:41:27,849 --> 00:41:32,589
potentially<font color="#CCCCCC"> be interested in you about</font>

911
00:41:30,339 --> 00:41:34,839
what you do about<font color="#E5E5E5"> what your product is</font>

912
00:41:32,589 --> 00:41:36,759
but they're in marketing is also a big

913
00:41:34,839 --> 00:41:39,369
difference between<font color="#CCCCCC"> an unqualified lead</font>

914
00:41:36,759 --> 00:41:41,559
just that email<font color="#CCCCCC"> that gets sent and a</font>

915
00:41:39,369 --> 00:41:44,739
qualified lead somebody who can actually

916
00:41:41,559 --> 00:41:46,239
<font color="#CCCCCC">have an impact on your</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> career so you</font>

917
00:41:44,739 --> 00:41:48,099
know your high school best friend who's

918
00:41:46,239 --> 00:41:51,430
not in this industry is an unqualified

919
00:41:48,099 --> 00:41:54,130
lead sure the chief security officer at

920
00:41:51,430 --> 00:41:57,788
a major fortune 500 company would<font color="#CCCCCC"> be a</font>

921
00:41:54,130 --> 00:42:00,969
very qualified<font color="#E5E5E5"> lead exactly so I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ask you</font>

922
00:41:57,789 --> 00:42:04,450
to think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it how many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people who</font>

923
00:42:00,969 --> 00:42:06,969
are your potential customer know of you

924
00:42:04,450 --> 00:42:08,649
and know what you do and I would bet

925
00:42:06,969 --> 00:42:12,009
that most of your answers are probably

926
00:42:08,650 --> 00:42:14,680
pretty small you're not out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

927
00:42:12,009 --> 00:42:16,239
I'm not suggesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you be one of</font>

928
00:42:14,680 --> 00:42:18,339
those guys that hits<font color="#E5E5E5"> the news every two</font>

929
00:42:16,239 --> 00:42:21,279
or three years who takes out a billboard

930
00:42:18,339 --> 00:42:21,910
in Times Square saying hire me because

931
00:42:21,279 --> 00:42:23,650
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all her</font>

932
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:25,210
those random stories peppered through

933
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:26,500
the news every couple of years somebody

934
00:42:25,210 --> 00:42:29,049
does something really random like that

935
00:42:26,500 --> 00:42:32,470
and I'm not suggesting that<font color="#CCCCCC"> you go put</font>

936
00:42:29,049 --> 00:42:34,240
up a glory you know a glamour website up

937

for yourself with you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> pictures of</font>

stuff that you've done<font color="#E5E5E5"> but figure out</font>

how to market figure<font color="#CCCCCC"> out how to reach</font>

941
00:42:42,369 --> 00:42:48,400
those people and make them aware of what

942
00:42:44,650 --> 00:42:51,760
you do obviously you can do the kind of

943
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:53,470
stuff we do speaking blogging writing

944
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:55,510
but maybe you're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> that kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of person</font>

945
00:42:53,470 --> 00:43:01,180
maybe you're the kind of person that

946
00:42:55,510 --> 00:43:06,130
goes out to events and markets one on

947
00:43:01,180 --> 00:43:10,569
one you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> figure out how to go out</font>

948
00:43:06,130 --> 00:43:13,420
and get those people aware of what is

949
00:43:10,569 --> 00:43:15,069
your brand who you are and what you do

950
00:43:13,420 --> 00:43:16,900
you know you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start</font>

951
00:43:15,069 --> 00:43:19,990
thinking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about businesses marketing</font>

952
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:22,599
right you start<font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

953
00:43:19,990 --> 00:43:25,629
slogans packaging you know just being

954
00:43:22,599 --> 00:43:26,920
kind of known for something and instead

955
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:28,569
<font color="#E5E5E5">of thinking about all the you know the</font>

956
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:30,339
different brands that we get hammered on

957
00:43:28,569 --> 00:43:32,619
you know with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Super Bowl</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I always</font>

958
00:43:30,339 --> 00:43:34,538
<font color="#E5E5E5">think I mean this kind of sounds crazy</font>

959
00:43:32,619 --> 00:43:37,779
and I'll probably get some bad reaction

960
00:43:34,539 --> 00:43:40,539
but that company godaddy with their bold

961
00:43:37,779 --> 00:43:43,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">super bowl ads I mean they're tasteless</font>

962
00:43:40,539 --> 00:43:46,750
and they're not you know but in a very

963
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:48,669
short period of time that's the brand

964
00:43:46,750 --> 00:43:51,250
that's been associated with godaddy

965
00:43:48,670 --> 00:43:53,529
that's the type of<font color="#CCCCCC"> thing that I equate</font>

966
00:43:51,250 --> 00:43:55,089
is there you know trashy super bowl ad

967
00:43:53,529 --> 00:43:58,329
that's the first thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> I would think</font>

968
00:43:55,089 --> 00:44:00,038
about right so when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about when</font>

969
00:43:58,329 --> 00:44:02,140
you talk about branding you start have

970
00:44:00,039 --> 00:44:06,010
to think about how you want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be</font>

971
00:44:02,140 --> 00:44:08,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">perceived and that perception can be</font>

972
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:11,770
very easy I mean it could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> very easy</font>

973
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:14,649
to<font color="#CCCCCC"> talk about branding yourself within</font>

974
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:17,200
the context of your job within the

975
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:19,779
context of your local<font color="#E5E5E5"> community</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

976
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,788
peer groups and within the context of

977
00:44:19,779 --> 00:44:25,660
the information security community at

978
00:44:21,789 --> 00:44:28,779
large you know there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> so many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> different</font>

979
00:44:25,660 --> 00:44:31,960
groups that people can volunteer I mean

980
00:44:28,779 --> 00:44:34,970
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about in new york we have a very</font>

981
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:36,500
active owasp chapter and

982
00:44:34,970 --> 00:44:38,419
there's a guy that runs the<font color="#CCCCCC"> OWASP</font>

983
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:40,430
community in New York a guy named Tom

984
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:43,460
Brennan I just think of<font color="#E5E5E5"> him as mr. o oz</font>

985
00:44:40,430 --> 00:44:46,220
I mean everything<font color="#CCCCCC"> about oh us he's</font>

986
00:44:43,460 --> 00:44:47,810
always involved with and you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font>

987
00:44:46,220 --> 00:44:50,149
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of equate so I had a question</font>

988
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:51,590
about web application security he

989
00:44:50,150 --> 00:44:53,720
probably the first guy i'm going to call

990
00:44:51,590 --> 00:44:54,980
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> if he doesn't have the answer he</font>

991
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:56,870
probably knows somebody who's going to

992
00:44:54,980 --> 00:44:58,400
get me that answer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and i'm going to be</font>

993
00:44:56,870 --> 00:45:01,040
able to kind of interact with him that

994
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:03,230

<font color="#CCCCCC">matter if you choose not to decide you</font>

00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:41,930

song lyric you know you have a brand

1011

brand is and to work towards that brand

1015
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:58,190
or do you choose<font color="#CCCCCC"> to just let it happen</font>

1027
00:46:27,380 --> 00:46:32,570
the financial guy Dave Ramsey and he

1028
00:46:29,180 --> 00:46:36,859
often<font color="#E5E5E5"> says if you were hired by you you</font>

would<font color="#CCCCCC"> bet the answer for most of us in</font>

1033
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:47,959
the room as yet now I'm not<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to</font>

1034
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:48,900
stand up here and give you a whole bunch

1035
00:46:47,960 --> 00:46:52,110
of budget advice

1036
00:46:48,900 --> 00:46:55,230
go read Dave Ramsey or Suze Orman or

1037
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:57,240
something but you don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just get to</font>

1038
00:46:55,230 --> 00:46:59,340
think about the income you got to think

1039
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:03,120
about the out go<font color="#E5E5E5"> to that's part of the</font>

1040
00:46:59,340 --> 00:47:05,340
P&L for you Inc well one of the key

1041
00:47:03,120 --> 00:47:07,650
reasons that the outcome or how you

1042
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:10,500
budget and manage your life is important

1043
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:12,780
is because if you're under financial

1044
00:47:10,500 --> 00:47:17,070
duress you cannot make good decisions

1045
00:47:12,780 --> 00:47:19,860
all your decisions will be colored

1046
00:47:17,070 --> 00:47:22,680
because you have to focus on money as

1047
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:26,160
opposed to focusing on things that might

1048
00:47:22,680 --> 00:47:27,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">be better for you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and you know Mike and</font>

1049
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:29,190
I just we just did<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we talked about</font>

1050
00:47:27,600 --> 00:47:31,710
that survey we pull that data from

1051
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:33,600
beforehand I mean we found some things

1052
00:47:31,710 --> 00:47:34,560
and I'm with this<font color="#E5E5E5"> will be easy just be</font>

1053
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:37,020
show of hands we're not going to ask

1054
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:39,120
anybody say anything so we asked a

1055
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:40,470
couple key questions and one of the

1056
00:47:39,120 --> 00:47:45,839
questions<font color="#CCCCCC"> we asked for is in</font>

1057
00:47:40,470 --> 00:47:47,939
relationship to other people in IT do

1058
00:47:45,840 --> 00:47:51,120
you think that have the same experience

1059
00:47:47,940 --> 00:47:54,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">that you do because you are a security</font>

1060
00:47:51,120 --> 00:47:57,029
professional how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> people believe</font>

1061
00:47:54,120 --> 00:48:03,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">that they're entitled to earn a bit more</font>

1062
00:47:57,030 --> 00:48:05,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">money how many people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that they're</font>

1063
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:10,290
entitled to earn a whole bunch<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font>

1064
00:48:05,820 --> 00:48:14,700
money so it's a very<font color="#E5E5E5"> small</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> percentage</font>

1065
00:48:10,290 --> 00:48:17,009
right here so in our survey fifty

1066
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:19,649
percent of the respondents said that

1067
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:22,560
they felt that they were entitled to

1068
00:48:19,650 --> 00:48:24,600
earn a bit more<font color="#E5E5E5"> money thirty-three</font>

1069
00:48:22,560 --> 00:48:26,640
percent of the respondents said that

1070
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:29,400
they were entitled to earn a lot more

1071
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:31,259
money so eighty-three percent of the

1072
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:34,320
folks that responded to our survey

1073
00:48:31,260 --> 00:48:37,200
thought that because they were<font color="#E5E5E5"> security</font>

1074
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:39,660
professional they deserve<font color="#CCCCCC"> to earn more</font>

1075
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:44,220
just because<font color="#CCCCCC"> they did security</font>

1076
00:48:39,660 --> 00:48:45,420
unfortunately most companies don't think

1077
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:47,399
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> does that yeah I mean I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1078
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:49,890
any HR functions that think that<font color="#E5E5E5"> way now</font>

1079
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:54,690
they used to but<font color="#E5E5E5"> not now how many people</font>

1080
00:48:49,890 --> 00:48:58,970
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're underpaid I'm sure hands I</font>

1081
00:48:54,690 --> 00:49:02,510
mean people think they're overpaid okay

1082
00:48:58,970 --> 00:49:03,980
little honesty right to our survey said

1083
00:49:02,510 --> 00:49:06,020
sixty percent of the information

1084
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:08,510
security professionals thought that they

1085
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:10,850
were underpaid three percent said

1086
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:13,490
thought that they were overpaid that's

1087
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:15,319
about<font color="#E5E5E5"> right in this room so how many</font>

1088
00:49:13,490 --> 00:49:18,620
people<font color="#CCCCCC"> got it salary increase last year</font>

1089
00:49:15,320 --> 00:49:21,740
how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many people were happy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> with their</font>

1090
00:49:18,620 --> 00:49:23,210
salary increase last year how many<font color="#CCCCCC"> by</font>

1091
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:26,390
right how<font color="#E5E5E5"> many people</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> were disappointed</font>

1092
00:49:23,210 --> 00:49:30,830
with their salary increase very good

1093
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:33,680
fifty percent of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this people in our</font>

1094
00:49:30,830 --> 00:49:36,110
survey were disappointed in their salary

1095
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:41,000
increase and only<font color="#E5E5E5"> ten percent were</font>

1096
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:43,100
pleasantly surprised<font color="#E5E5E5"> five to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one so if</font>

1097
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:45,710
you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can tell you that the things</font>

1098
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:47,810
that I saw in that survey made me feel

1099
00:49:45,710 --> 00:49:50,330
one thing just<font color="#E5E5E5"> the common thread of the</font>

1100
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:53,270
data was that there's a perception

1101
00:49:50,330 --> 00:49:56,360
problem in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our market and whether that</font>

1102
00:49:53,270 --> 00:49:58,250
perception problem is self-created or

1103
00:49:56,360 --> 00:50:01,190
it's a poor job of management

1104
00:49:58,250 --> 00:50:03,920
communication it's one<font color="#E5E5E5"> of those two</font>

1105
00:50:01,190 --> 00:50:06,770
things so when you start thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1106
00:50:03,920 --> 00:50:09,980
compensation what you really<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

1107
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:13,070
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> about is how you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> mark yourself to</font>

1108
00:50:09,980 --> 00:50:16,040
the market and when I say<font color="#E5E5E5"> mark-to-market</font>

1109
00:50:13,070 --> 00:50:17,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">we heard that a lot in the financial</font>

1110
00:50:16,040 --> 00:50:20,840
crisis but when you start thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about</font>

1111
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:23,510
marking to market right how are<font color="#CCCCCC"> you paid</font>

1112
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:26,540
in relationship to others that have the

1113
00:50:23,510 --> 00:50:30,110
same jobs that have the same skills in

1114
00:50:26,540 --> 00:50:35,150
the same industry in the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> location</font>

1115
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:38,420
you have to find a way to get that<font color="#E5E5E5"> data</font>

1116
00:50:35,150 --> 00:50:42,370
feel free to talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> to your friends about</font>

1117
00:50:38,420 --> 00:50:42,370
some of these items question

1118
00:51:00,490 --> 00:51:05,618
and what that comes down to is

1119
00:51:02,530 --> 00:51:07,150
ultimately customer selection if you're

1120
00:51:05,619 --> 00:51:08,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">thinking about it as a business when you</font>

1121
00:51:07,150 --> 00:51:10,180
start writing a business plan you start

1122
00:51:08,650 --> 00:51:13,300
talking about<font color="#E5E5E5"> who your target market is</font>

1123
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:16,359
and who your ideal customer is<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

1124
00:51:13,300 --> 00:51:19,240
I know for one of my businesses that my

1125
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:21,850
ideal customer is the person that really

1126
00:51:19,240 --> 00:51:23,618
cares about deep technical security if

1127
00:51:21,850 --> 00:51:25,990
someone's just looking to check a box I

1128
00:51:23,619 --> 00:51:28,570
don't want them as a customer and I will

1129
00:51:25,990 --> 00:51:31,450
turn them down if you're working in if

1130
00:51:28,570 --> 00:51:32,890
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> want to be paid well as a security</font>

1131
00:51:31,450 --> 00:51:34,720
person you probably want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> work in an</font>

1132
00:51:32,890 --> 00:51:36,700
organization that cares and puts a whole

1133
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:38,950
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of value towards security right it's</font>

1134
00:51:36,700 --> 00:51:40,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">it you know and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it clears it up when you</font>

1135
00:51:38,950 --> 00:51:42,430
think about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this as a customer</font>

1136
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:43,840
relationship because ultimately some

1137
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:45,160
customers are willing to<font color="#E5E5E5"> spend a bunch</font>

1138
00:51:43,840 --> 00:51:49,600
of money on something and some aren't

1139
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:51,700
and if your goal is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> sell your product</font>

1140
00:51:49,600 --> 00:51:53,589
if you're selling a high price premium

1141
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:56,589
product you know you're not marketing

1142
00:51:53,590 --> 00:51:58,690
you're not marketing Ferraris to a low

1143
00:51:56,590 --> 00:52:02,290
income you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> to a low income</font>

1144
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:05,109
neighborhood your marketing Ferraris to

1145
00:52:02,290 --> 00:52:07,300
rich people if you want to sell<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1146
00:52:05,109 --> 00:52:09,490
product which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is you at a very high</font>

1147
00:52:07,300 --> 00:52:11,920
price<font color="#E5E5E5"> you market it to people who have a</font>

1148
00:52:09,490 --> 00:52:13,390
<font color="#E5E5E5">lot of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> money to spend and who are</font>

1149
00:52:11,920 --> 00:52:15,220
looking to spend it on that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1150
00:52:13,390 --> 00:52:17,020
thing yeah i<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean i think that you know</font>

1151
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:19,810
when it<font color="#E5E5E5"> comes down to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it to one of the</font>

1152
00:52:17,020 --> 00:52:23,259
<font color="#E5E5E5">other things that to me to expand upon</font>

1153
00:52:19,810 --> 00:52:26,080
your point John is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that when you have I</font>

1154
00:52:23,260 --> 00:52:28,570
mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> who's fault really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1155
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:32,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">information security is not valued in</font>

1156
00:52:28,570 --> 00:52:35,290
your organization I mean if that happens

1157
00:52:32,350 --> 00:52:37,779
to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> your situation you might look at</font>

1158
00:52:35,290 --> 00:52:40,420
who's ever leading that organization at

1159
00:52:37,780 --> 00:52:43,720
doing a<font color="#E5E5E5"> very poor job of communicating</font>

1160
00:52:40,420 --> 00:52:46,810
to the people who determine the

1161
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:50,109
commitment the budgets of information

1162
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:52,690
security by being<font color="#CCCCCC"> able to demonstrate</font>

1163
00:52:50,109 --> 00:52:57,520
the importance which goes back to sales

1164
00:52:52,690 --> 00:53:00,430
so if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about that right you</font>

1165
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:03,070
have to be able in your job you should

1166
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:05,350
be talking to your management about why

1167
00:53:03,070 --> 00:53:07,000
security is important I don't say<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1168
00:53:05,350 --> 00:53:07,900
hey look if we don't do this the you

1169
00:53:07,000 --> 00:53:09,130
know we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be on the cover of</font>

1170
00:53:07,900 --> 00:53:10,540
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> New York</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Times and the building's</font>

1171
00:53:09,130 --> 00:53:11,589
going to you know why the hacker is

1172
00:53:10,540 --> 00:53:12,729
going to come in and we're going to

1173
00:53:11,589 --> 00:53:15,849
is our brand and all that other stuff

1174
00:53:12,729 --> 00:53:19,029
but you might be<font color="#CCCCCC"> able</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to talk</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font>

1175
00:53:15,849 --> 00:53:21,670
significantly and you might get more

1176
00:53:19,029 --> 00:53:23,140
commitment but you know when<font color="#E5E5E5"> you start</font>

1177
00:53:21,670 --> 00:53:24,789
thinking about marketing your<font color="#E5E5E5"> skills</font>

1178
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:27,430
right you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> start</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thinking about</font>

1179
00:53:24,789 --> 00:53:31,989
like if I become better quicker can I

1180
00:53:27,430 --> 00:53:35,558
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> more money how will getting better</font>

1181
00:53:31,989 --> 00:53:39,130
help accelerate my earnings in business

1182
00:53:35,559 --> 00:53:41,049
we call it a forecast right I wouldn't

1183
00:53:39,130 --> 00:53:44,200
and the other thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> is this if I don't</font>

1184
00:53:41,049 --> 00:53:47,109
get better on my skills worth less I

1185
00:53:44,200 --> 00:53:49,058
mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> think about like when people were</font>

1186
00:53:47,109 --> 00:53:51,788
no in when I started recruiting in the

1187
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:54,579
<font color="#E5E5E5">mid-90s if I found somebody who had had</font>

1188
00:53:51,789 --> 00:53:56,890
firewall experience checkpoint firewall

1189
00:53:54,579 --> 00:54:00,309
experience that was real hot I mean I

1190
00:53:56,890 --> 00:54:04,359
could people would pay tons of money for

1191
00:54:00,309 --> 00:54:06,489
that now having firewall experiences

1192
00:54:04,359 --> 00:54:08,019
like a substance I it's expected that if

1193
00:54:06,489 --> 00:54:09,819
you're a network engineer that you'll

1194
00:54:08,019 --> 00:54:14,769
know how<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal with firewalls it's a</font>

1195
00:54:09,819 --> 00:54:18,099
you know it's an it's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a line item</font>

1196
00:54:14,769 --> 00:54:19,598
on the job it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not the job</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> itself so if</font>

1197
00:54:18,099 --> 00:54:22,239
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about that think about the</font>

1198
00:54:19,599 --> 00:54:24,309
skills that you're known for today what

1199
00:54:22,239 --> 00:54:27,309
the market value of those skills are now

1200
00:54:24,309 --> 00:54:31,089
and what the market value of those

1201
00:54:27,309 --> 00:54:32,950
skills might be in three years is there

1202
00:54:31,089 --> 00:54:34,420
going to be more need for those skills

1203
00:54:32,950 --> 00:54:38,859
or they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be less need for</font>

1204
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:42,579
your skills and and ultimately you get

1205
00:54:38,859 --> 00:54:45,219
to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> choices about how your customers</font>

1206
00:54:42,579 --> 00:54:46,660
are<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to pay you part of</font>

1207
00:54:45,219 --> 00:54:49,029
understanding your own financial

1208
00:54:46,660 --> 00:54:50,649
situation is understanding how much

1209
00:54:49,029 --> 00:54:52,599
compensation I need do I want<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be a</font>

1210
00:54:50,650 --> 00:54:54,759
high priced product right now or will I

1211
00:54:52,599 --> 00:54:57,130
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a little less while I develop that</font>

1212
00:54:54,759 --> 00:55:00,369
version 2 point 0 it's it's funny where

1213
00:54:57,130 --> 00:55:01,749
we're a very education driven industry

1214
00:55:00,369 --> 00:55:04,269
as we saw earlier you know the

1215
00:55:01,749 --> 00:55:05,950
forty-seven percent want more training

1216
00:55:04,269 --> 00:55:09,999
and for only<font color="#E5E5E5"> forty-nine percent want to</font>

1217
00:55:05,950 --> 00:55:13,058
keep their job most people in our

1218
00:55:09,999 --> 00:55:14,799
industry will take less to be to develop

1219
00:55:13,059 --> 00:55:17,619
their product more because it's a very

1220
00:55:14,799 --> 00:55:20,710
product development oriented industry

1221
00:55:17,619 --> 00:55:22,690
you know I always use accounting as my

1222
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:25,430
example the rules of accounting haven't

1223
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:28,369
changed much in the last hundred years

1224
00:55:25,430 --> 00:55:30,259
the rules of information security at you

1225
00:55:28,369 --> 00:55:32,750
know if you were if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you still knew only</font>

1226
00:55:30,260 --> 00:55:35,599
what you knew in 2005 you would be

1227
00:55:32,750 --> 00:55:36,349
completely useless to your employer you

1228
00:55:35,599 --> 00:55:37,849
know you wouldn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know anything about</font>

1229
00:55:36,349 --> 00:55:39,800
wireless networks you wouldn't think

1230
00:55:37,849 --> 00:55:42,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">about mobile devices you wouldn't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know</font>

1231
00:55:39,800 --> 00:55:44,240
about data leak prevention<font color="#E5E5E5"> I could</font>

1232
00:55:42,349 --> 00:55:48,050
probably name I know a lot about pique

1233
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:50,479
pique I you know a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> about you but</font>

1234
00:55:48,050 --> 00:55:53,569
think about it<font color="#E5E5E5"> our industry changes so</font>

1235
00:55:50,480 --> 00:55:54,650
rapidly we're actually I it we're a

1236
00:55:53,569 --> 00:55:56,210
funny industry because if you think

1237
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:58,550
about where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> security holes are</font>

1238
00:55:56,210 --> 00:56:00,319
they're always in the new product not a

1239
00:55:58,550 --> 00:56:01,849
whole lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of security holes in the</font>

1240
00:56:00,319 --> 00:56:04,160
products<font color="#CCCCCC"> that work you know that have</font>

1241
00:56:01,849 --> 00:56:06,200
been developed for 17 years actually

1242
00:56:04,160 --> 00:56:09,230
there was a great talk here yesterday<font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

1243
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:10,819
the ntlm nonce vulnerability that had

1244
00:56:09,230 --> 00:56:14,089
been<font color="#E5E5E5"> in every version of windows back to</font>

1245
00:56:10,819 --> 00:56:17,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">windows 3.51 how often does that happen</font>

1246
00:56:14,089 --> 00:56:20,089
you very rarely hear of a vol<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10</font>

1247
00:56:17,750 --> 00:56:22,099
versions of a product because stuff gets

1248
00:56:20,089 --> 00:56:23,450
worked out so our industry always lives

1249
00:56:22,099 --> 00:56:25,190
at the front of the threat vector it

1250
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:27,140
always lives at the newest<font color="#CCCCCC"> technology</font>

1251
00:56:25,190 --> 00:56:28,760
which means you get obsolete real quick

1252
00:56:27,140 --> 00:56:30,170
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't keep up and I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think the</font>

1253
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:31,579
thing<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you have to do is that when</font>

1254
00:56:30,170 --> 00:56:33,740
you start<font color="#CCCCCC"> looking at</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> your skills going</font>

1255
00:56:31,579 --> 00:56:36,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">back to that is thinking about which</font>

1256
00:56:33,740 --> 00:56:38,689
skills you can leverage<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you remain</font>

1257
00:56:36,290 --> 00:56:41,779
relevant and become more<font color="#E5E5E5"> relevant and</font>

1258
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:43,910
those don't have to always be technical

1259
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:46,760
skills a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of them could be leadership</font>

1260
00:56:43,910 --> 00:56:48,230
and business skills so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> it always</font>

1261
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:50,390
kind of then comes back to and this one

1262
00:56:48,230 --> 00:56:51,770
of my favorite quotes you know I don't

1263
00:56:50,390 --> 00:56:53,299
even<font color="#E5E5E5"> know the guy who said it but I just</font>

1264
00:56:51,770 --> 00:56:54,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">think it's a great quote right says you</font>

1265
00:56:53,299 --> 00:56:57,980
know you<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't get what you deserve you</font>

1266
00:56:54,650 --> 00:57:00,290
get what you negotiate and I think

1267
00:56:57,980 --> 00:57:03,500
there's some just general examples of

1268
00:57:00,290 --> 00:57:08,869
talking about how<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can negotiate</font>

1269
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:11,299
better for yourself and I mean I think

1270
00:57:08,869 --> 00:57:13,369
<font color="#E5E5E5">that the key component in negotiations</font>

1271
00:57:11,299 --> 00:57:15,440
everybody thinks it's an adversarial

1272
00:57:13,369 --> 00:57:17,210
situation like when I deal with people I

1273
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:19,490
say well well what<font color="#E5E5E5"> were you earning at</font>

1274
00:57:17,210 --> 00:57:21,740
your past job and boy why does my client

1275
00:57:19,490 --> 00:57:23,359
was your company need to know that well

1276
00:57:21,740 --> 00:57:26,450
they need to know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that because they're</font>

going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be making some decisions so you</font>

1278
00:57:26,450 --> 00:57:31,549
have to be<font color="#E5E5E5"> able to start thinking</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1279
00:57:29,089 --> 00:57:34,700
negotiation in a way where you're

1280
00:57:31,549 --> 00:57:37,609
humanizing the discussions where you're

<font color="#E5E5E5">being you're taking a very candid and</font>

1286
00:57:47,690 --> 00:57:53,810
skills are and I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that what happens</font>

1287
00:57:51,170 --> 00:57:55,670
is this is that a lot of people believe

1288
00:57:53,810 --> 00:57:59,000
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's these hidden mists and</font>

1289
00:57:55,670 --> 00:58:02,960
negotiation compensation where the best

1290
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:04,790
practices are really honesty if you know

1291
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:07,220
you need<font color="#E5E5E5"> a certain amount of money to</font>

1292
00:58:04,790 --> 00:58:09,890
take<font color="#E5E5E5"> a job you need to let</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> people know</font>

1293
00:58:07,220 --> 00:58:11,990
<font color="#E5E5E5">that i need that amount of money to take</font>

1294
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:14,750
the job there really shouldn't be any

1295
00:58:11,990 --> 00:58:17,390
surprises and if you start thinking

1296
00:58:14,750 --> 00:58:20,390
about your career goal and the business

1297
00:58:17,390 --> 00:58:24,920
goal if money is important to you you

1298
00:58:20,390 --> 00:58:28,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">have</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to figure out what that career goal</font>

1299
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:31,880
really pays not what you saw on some

1300
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:34,430
website not what you know some broad

1301
00:58:31,880 --> 00:58:36,680
based website puts out about oh yeah if

1302
00:58:34,430 --> 00:58:38,089
you're a security manager in New York

1303
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:40,759
City<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> should be earning two hundred</font>

1304
00:58:38,090 --> 00:58:42,980
thousand dollars that is completely<font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

1305
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:46,610
the case but there's a ton of bad data

1306
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:49,280
out there so you have to come<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a</font>

1307
00:58:46,610 --> 00:58:51,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">good understanding of what these jobs</font>

1308
00:58:49,280 --> 00:58:53,300
pay and if you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you want to</font>

1309
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:54,860
make two hundred thousand dollars<font color="#CCCCCC"> a year</font>

1310
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:59,210
and you pick a career goal that's only

1311
00:58:54,860 --> 00:59:02,090
going to max out about 125 or 130 you

1312
00:58:59,210 --> 00:59:04,730
got a problem you either have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to adjust</font>

1313
00:59:02,090 --> 00:59:07,430
how you're living or you have to adjust

1314
00:59:04,730 --> 00:59:10,160
your goal so that goes back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that</font>

1315
00:59:07,430 --> 00:59:12,290
alignment right I mean I also think this

1316
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:13,549
is that depending<font color="#CCCCCC"> on where you are in</font>

1317
00:59:12,290 --> 00:59:16,490
your career you're going to make

1318
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:18,350
different compensation decisions I think

1319
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:21,109
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> as our standard rule of thumb is</font>

1320
00:59:18,350 --> 00:59:24,680
that if you're early in your career

1321
00:59:21,110 --> 00:59:27,620
never take a job because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of money always</font>

1322
00:59:24,680 --> 00:59:30,080
take a job because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of experience for</font>

1323
00:59:27,620 --> 00:59:33,740
acceleration to work with smart people

1324
00:59:30,080 --> 00:59:37,040
later in your career your goals might

1325
00:59:33,740 --> 00:59:39,830
change and money might be important you

1326
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:41,960
might want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to think about all those</font>

1327
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:45,770
decisions that you've made along the way

1328
00:59:41,960 --> 00:59:48,500
prepare you for a job where you can

1329
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:51,390
command larger compensation the better

1330
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:53,730
your skills the more leverage you have

1331
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:57,180
but you can never overplay your hand I

1332
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:58,470
feel like good i can<font color="#CCCCCC"> say that in Vegas</font>

1333
00:59:57,180 --> 01:00:00,750
you know there's a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of poker rooms</font>

1334
00:59:58,470 --> 01:00:03,209
out here right but overplaying your hand

1335
01:00:00,750 --> 01:00:05,940
means is that you think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're</font>

1336
01:00:03,210 --> 01:00:07,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">smarter than you really are you think</font>

1337
01:00:05,940 --> 01:00:10,140
that they need you<font color="#CCCCCC"> more than you need</font>

1338
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:14,339
them you think you're that<font color="#E5E5E5"> much better</font>

1339
01:00:10,140 --> 01:00:17,879
than option B you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what Miss</font>

1340
01:00:14,339 --> 01:00:20,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">Congeniality doesn't look so bad and you</font>

1341
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:22,349
have to understand that is that when you

1342
01:00:20,460 --> 01:00:25,769
get into one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of these discussions about</font>

1343
01:00:22,349 --> 01:00:28,740
compensation and negotiation you really

1344
01:00:25,769 --> 01:00:31,709
need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to know</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> kind of where you sit in a</font>

1345
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:34,589
relationship to others how badly do you

1346
01:00:31,710 --> 01:00:38,010
want to acquire the experience<font color="#E5E5E5"> and how</font>

1347
01:00:34,589 --> 01:00:43,049
important that experience is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

1348
01:00:38,010 --> 01:00:46,049
ultimate<font color="#E5E5E5"> long-term goal you didn't</font>

practice but you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what there's a way</font>

1371
01:01:36,869 --> 01:01:41,430
decision after that but you have to

1372
01:01:39,599 --> 01:01:44,640
<font color="#CCCCCC">think about you have to negotiate like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

people<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you understand that alright</font>

1378
01:01:55,349 --> 01:02:01,170
the last part<font color="#E5E5E5"> of most org charts is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Rd</font>

1379
01:01:58,529 --> 01:02:01,890
and when we're talking about R&D we're

1380
01:02:01,170 --> 01:02:03,720
not talking<font color="#E5E5E5"> about it the way most</font>

1381
01:02:01,890 --> 01:02:04,750
security companies do it everything more

1382
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:08,200
like

1383
01:02:04,750 --> 01:02:11,080
orgy where there's actually the thought

1384
01:02:08,200 --> 01:02:13,930
of real investment you see it on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1385
01:02:11,080 --> 01:02:15,880
news that<font color="#E5E5E5"> GE allocates two hundred</font>

million dollars to research and

01:02:15,880 --> 01:02:22,090
development which basically means how do

1388
01:02:18,580 --> 01:02:23,950
I go out<font color="#CCCCCC"> and find new stuff how do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I put</font>

1389
01:02:22,090 --> 01:02:27,340
new stuff in the pipeline that will be

1390
01:02:23,950 --> 01:02:29,710
part of the product in 3 4 5 10<font color="#E5E5E5"> years</font>

1391
01:02:27,340 --> 01:02:32,380
<font color="#CCCCCC">that will continue</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to make my business</font>

career your career<font color="#E5E5E5"> is going to fail</font>

1395
01:02:40,030 --> 01:02:46,060
that's going to be your exit strategy

1396
01:02:41,290 --> 01:02:48,160
failure redundancy mediocrity and I

1397
01:02:46,060 --> 01:02:50,710
think the common thing is this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font>

1398
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:53,080
you know any time you make an investment

01:02:50,710 --> 01:02:55,660
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> your career and the way I define in a</font>

1400
01:02:53,080 --> 01:02:57,880
career investment might be anything by

1401
01:02:55,660 --> 01:03:00,460
it could be a certification it could be

1402
01:02:57,880 --> 01:03:02,380
education it could be training it could

1403
01:03:00,460 --> 01:03:04,300
be something completely off the wall

1404
01:03:02,380 --> 01:03:06,280
that gives you a common linkage with

1405
01:03:04,300 --> 01:03:08,410
someone it could be golf lessons it

1406
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:10,180
could be wine tasting now those might be

1407
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:13,180
a little bit more fun than getting a

1408
01:03:10,180 --> 01:03:15,700
cissp or<font color="#E5E5E5"> as an certification but you</font>

that specialization over others so so

1453
01:05:33,010 --> 01:05:39,190
question so when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> are deciding that</font>

1454
01:05:36,310 --> 01:05:41,230
did you decide more to take to focus on

an MBA type of a skill program as

1457
01:05:43,390 --> 01:05:55,150

01:05:58,570 --> 01:06:03,880
education investments you know you start

1462
01:06:01,450 --> 01:06:06,339
have to think about you know what<font color="#E5E5E5"> is the</font>

1463
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:08,770
branding of that investment and what

1464
01:06:06,340 --> 01:06:12,220
other people care and think about that

1465
01:06:08,770 --> 01:06:14,470
branding right<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> mean if you went and</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">order here but I mean but if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you start</font>

1468
01:06:16,690 --> 01:06:19,570
thinking about like if somebody<font color="#E5E5E5"> got it</font>

1469
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:21,490
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm not going to i'm</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> not making</font>

1470
01:06:19,570 --> 01:06:22,930
judgments when<font color="#E5E5E5"> i say this but i want</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

1471
01:06:21,490 --> 01:06:25,779
to think<font color="#E5E5E5"> just i'm going to say some</font>

1472
01:06:22,930 --> 01:06:28,569
things if you were interviewing<font color="#E5E5E5"> for a</font>

1473
01:06:25,780 --> 01:06:30,460
position and you had one candidate who

1474
01:06:28,570 --> 01:06:33,880
had a master's degree from the

1475
01:06:30,460 --> 01:06:35,920
university of phoenix and you had

1476
01:06:33,880 --> 01:06:39,550
another candidate who had a master's

1477
01:06:35,920 --> 01:06:41,410
degree from any Ivy League school what

1478
01:06:39,550 --> 01:06:46,600
would you think of the branding of those

1479
01:06:41,410 --> 01:06:50,170
two different masters programs would you

1480
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:51,970
have<font color="#CCCCCC"> any Predis preconceived notions</font>

1481
01:06:50,170 --> 01:06:55,000
when the person walked in the door if

1482
01:06:51,970 --> 01:06:59,379
you only had to choose one person to

1483
01:06:55,000 --> 01:07:02,020
interview who would you interview right

1484
01:06:59,380 --> 01:07:03,580
so you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about the branding</font>

1485
01:07:02,020 --> 01:07:05,020
of the investments the best way you can

1486
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:07,840
<font color="#E5E5E5">think about before you make an</font>

1487
01:07:05,020 --> 01:07:10,750
investment if I had somebody and I met

1488
01:07:07,840 --> 01:07:14,650
them who had this investment what would

1489
01:07:10,750 --> 01:07:16,240
be my blink reaction to that person you

1490
01:07:14,650 --> 01:07:17,350
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think about that with your</font>

1491
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:19,359
career because you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spend</font>

01:07:25,270 --> 01:07:30,850
you go out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and plunk down money and</font>

1496
01:07:27,940 --> 01:07:33,550

1501
01:07:40,810 --> 01:07:44,710
saying is that you have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> calculate</font>

1502
01:07:42,220 --> 01:07:49,029
return on investment you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to</font>

calculate your ROI now your return on an

1504
01:07:49,030 --> 01:07:55,300
investment might be more than financial
