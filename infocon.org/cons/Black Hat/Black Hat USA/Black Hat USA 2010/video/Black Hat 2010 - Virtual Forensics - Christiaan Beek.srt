<font color="#E5E5E5">through body to this talk about future</font>

8
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:35,910
forensics I did it this talk as well at

00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:38,760
blackhat you you in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Barcelona this year</font>

10
00:00:35,910 --> 00:00:40,468
but there are some new stuff in it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

11
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,079
updated some slides and some new

12
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:45,120
investigations results how absolutely

13
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,910
interesting for you so this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,110
introduce myself a little bit more then

16
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,539
we will discuss about traditional vs

17
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:57,660
virtual forensics the challenges we face

18
00:00:54,539 --> 00:01:01,620
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> real time and middle bitching about</font>

00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:04,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">your citrix</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and vmware windows 7 and the</font>

20
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:08,280
summary and i will give some opportunity

21
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:11,189
for questions so so you might have

22
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,229
<font color="#E5E5E5">noticed but i'm from the netherlands so</font>

23
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:15,508
yesterday<font color="#E5E5E5"> i traveled about 24</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> hours to</font>

24
00:01:13,229 --> 00:01:18,030
get here<font color="#CCCCCC"> so i have a little bit jet lag</font>

25
00:01:15,509 --> 00:01:20,220
you have the greatest soccer<font color="#CCCCCC"> fans</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the</font>

26
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:24,320
world<font color="#CCCCCC"> i asked her to join me but she</font>

27
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:24,320
refused and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> warned you</font>

28
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:31,710
if you have any comments on montauk we

29
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:35,460
know how to kick so this is<font color="#E5E5E5"> where I</font>

30
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:37,440
started when<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was 12 the Commodore 64</font>

31
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:40,530
in amiga that i'm joined the silicon

32
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:42,210
graphics and all that's why i started

33
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:45,780
and got the virus about computers<font color="#CCCCCC"> in</font>

34
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:47,850
forensics and hacking so then we have a

35
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:50,130
duty in the netherlands so I joined the

36
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:52,140
Navy for a couple of years<font color="#E5E5E5"> the right</font>

37
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:54,750
sides i joined the boarding team as well

38
00:01:52,140 --> 00:02:01,170
I fight against drugs in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Caribbean</font>

39
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:03,330
area so yeah squirt phone<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then I was</font>

40
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:06,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">at a point what should</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I do I've been</font>

41
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:07,590
studying theology as well and I should

42
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:11,039
yeah I was interested in computers and

43
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:13,920
security and so I decided to<font color="#CCCCCC"> go for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

44
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,200
security<font color="#CCCCCC"> job and meanwhile in my free</font>

45
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:19,290
time my wife<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I take care for</font>

46
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:22,679
homeless people and foster children so

47
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's a little bit what we do and this</font>

48
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:27,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">is my biggest hobby I like</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to play with</font>

49
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:30,120
synthesizers all really the old ones but

50
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,850
they are<font color="#E5E5E5"> quite expensive so so now i'm</font>

51
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:35,160
using<font color="#E5E5E5"> the digital ones but</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i hope one of</font>

52
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:37,230
time to have some<font color="#CCCCCC"> real arts and that</font>

53
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,959
kind of stuff and mouth if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know what</font>

54
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:41,790
I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking about so the session is not</font>

55
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,580
about a negative talk about

56
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:46,410
virtualization recent results<font color="#E5E5E5"> show that</font>

57
00:02:44,580 --> 00:02:48,600
about sixty percent of the Dutch

58
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:51,480
companies have already virtualization in

59
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:55,560
their company mostly free and where r e

60
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:57,929
cigs citrix so yeah we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to face</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

61
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:00,390
it's real and we are facing it during

62
00:02:57,930 --> 00:03:03,000
investigations as well so we have to

63
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:06,299
learn about<font color="#E5E5E5"> it I'm not sponsored by any</font>

64
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:09,060
of the vendors especially a Microsoft I

65
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:10,590
have to give my talk to them before I

66
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,530
would speak about it because there are

67
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:15,959
very afraid<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I would enclose some</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> or</font>

68
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:19,050
disclose some things and actually I do

69
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:21,780
one but they agreed<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can i could</font>

70
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:23,790
mention it sir and i'm not talking about

71
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:27,360
<font color="#E5E5E5">using a virtual machine as a forensic</font>

72
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:30,750
research platform see a lot of malware

73
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,910
and analysts they are using<font color="#E5E5E5"> VMware</font>

74
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:35,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">Workstation to build windows XP</font>

75
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:38,910
environment to test a malware for

76
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:43,410
example but<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is talk not about</font>

77
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:48,510
ok this is yes this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is now all right</font>

78
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:51,390
traditional vs virtual forensics in a

79
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:53,850
traditional way forensic researchers who

80
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:56,700
are used to go to accompany acquire a

81
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:58,650
computer a laptop get the<font color="#CCCCCC"> disk out make</font>

82
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:01,230
a nice copy of it right provide

83
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:03,300
protection and well that's it<font color="#CCCCCC"> you know</font>

84
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:05,670
exactly where the data is or if it's

85
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:07,890
physically in your hands and the problem

86
00:04:05,670 --> 00:04:10,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">nowadays is if that the companies have</font>

87
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:13,589
large and large storage areas storage

88
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:18,089
networks virtual environments fede eyes

89
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:20,010
and yeah you're facing problems have you

90
00:04:18,089 --> 00:04:22,349
<font color="#E5E5E5">ever been to this if you're going to an</font>

91
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:25,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">equerry of data and you walk into that</font>

92
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:27,810
company you see a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of well storage</font>

93
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:29,940
areas like this and just<font color="#E5E5E5"> wondering</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

94
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:34,290
which this do<font color="#CCCCCC"> I need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to have or</font>

95
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:36,630
otherwise whereas my data so what are

96
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:39,300
<font color="#E5E5E5">the challenges I think I believe is what</font>

97
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:41,130
to expect if you're at a site if you

98
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:43,740
keep with you with all the stuff and

99
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:46,950
right to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> protection devices your</font>

100
00:04:43,740 --> 00:04:49,620
laptops and all kind of stuff what to

101
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:52,409
face if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have a really large VMware</font>

102
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,780
farm for example which tools can you use

103
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:57,210
because what's very important is for

104
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:59,700
forensic research is that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the tools you</font>

105
00:04:57,210 --> 00:05:01,770
use you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can prove what you have done</font>

106
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:04,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">that your audit trail your forensic</font>

107
00:05:01,770 --> 00:05:07,320
process is real you can explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> what</font>

108
00:05:04,830 --> 00:05:10,050
you've done to the judge but not all

109
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,810
tools which you use normally in I say

110
00:05:10,050 --> 00:05:15,780
normal digital forensics you can use in

111
00:05:12,810 --> 00:05:19,260
virtual forensics an example for its<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

112
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:23,669
case if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> are doing a vmdk or research</font>

113
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:26,430
or any case will show some results but

114
00:05:23,669 --> 00:05:28,620
it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> work</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because the code the</font>

115
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:31,560
source code<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vmdk file format is</font>

116
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:33,810
closed and I talked to the<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys from</font>

117
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:34,980
guidance this morning as well from what

118
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:37,830
are you doing about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and they said</font>

119
00:05:34,980 --> 00:05:39,600
well yeah we have problems<font color="#E5E5E5"> with the</font>

120
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:42,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">casual free and where that I didn't</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

121
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:44,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">to disclose their codes so you have to</font>

122
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:46,260
work around I will show you later on and

123
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:49,410
tell you later<font color="#CCCCCC"> on what kind of</font>

124
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:52,659
techniques I use therefore where is the

125
00:05:49,410 --> 00:05:54,940
data warehouse it who owns the data

126
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:58,210
very important for example<font color="#CCCCCC"> a Dutch law</font>

127
00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:00,640
is you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to own the data you need to</font>

128
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:03,250
own the machines before we can acquire

129
00:06:00,640 --> 00:06:05,500
acquire the data so that's I don't know

130
00:06:03,250 --> 00:06:08,110
how it is in<font color="#CCCCCC"> US but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for us is that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

131
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:10,960
law which forensic techniques can you

132
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:13,360
<font color="#CCCCCC">use can we use traditional forensic</font>

133
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,969
techniques or I can also use nuclear

134
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:19,270
things like a carving data carving on

135
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:22,570
memory forensics on virtual forensics oh

136
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:26,650
and what about jurisdiction and we'll

137
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:30,370
give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> some examples so what must be</font>

138
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:32,679
acquired I don't know if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> just</font>

139
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:35,140
recognize this but I've had a case once

140
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:38,050
when we were there at a location it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

141
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:40,930
a huge farm of data and the local

142
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:43,720
Department of Justice representative

143
00:06:40,930 --> 00:06:46,030
said well I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything to be taken</font>

144
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:48,670
away which is<font color="#E5E5E5"> like oh my god but it's</font>

145
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:51,369
<font color="#CCCCCC">VMware</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> i don't care i want to see disks</font>

146
00:06:48,670 --> 00:06:53,860
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> we ended up with a truckload of</font>

147
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:56,500
computers and servers and well actually

148
00:06:53,860 --> 00:06:59,290
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> company what couldn't work</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font>

149
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:04,420
month so you can yeah you can imagine

150
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:08,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">how the impact this for the business so</font>

151
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:11,650
and where is my data this is a<font color="#E5E5E5"> statement</font>

152
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:14,710
of Microsoft's to director of the

153
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:16,780
Netherlands studying about a<font color="#CCCCCC"> sewer and</font>

154
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:19,599
<font color="#CCCCCC">you know to know a new virtualization</font>

155
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:22,150
platform of Microsoft that although you

156
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:23,560
ask I want only the data to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be stored in</font>

157
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:25,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">my own country for example in the</font>

158
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:27,190
Netherlands actually they make one copy

159
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:29,380
for the Netherlands one copy is going to

160
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:32,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">Ireland and another copy of the data I</font>

161
00:07:29,380 --> 00:07:34,960
share in India or maybe in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> US so</font>

162
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,280
yeah<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's really a problem I think we</font>

163
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:41,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">should really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> focus on that one as well</font>

164
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:41,460
so where is my evidence

165
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:47,600
one of the latest developments<font color="#CCCCCC"> of Joanna</font>

166
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:49,969
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> cosca and I don't know if you know</font>

167
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:52,610
her she's very good<font color="#E5E5E5"> about virtualization</font>

168
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:55,610
she wrote about<font color="#E5E5E5"> the blue pill red pill</font>

169
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:58,010
but hypervisor security and actually she

170
00:07:55,610 --> 00:08:00,080
is developing our with another

171
00:07:58,010 --> 00:08:03,380
researcher and forgot the name but a new

172
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:06,740
cubes OS virtualization platform and

173
00:08:03,380 --> 00:08:10,250
actually what you see in<font color="#CCCCCC"> that OS yet for</font>

174
00:08:06,740 --> 00:08:13,040
every function for example an office

175
00:08:10,250 --> 00:08:15,320
function you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> own</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> virtual</font>

176
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:21,050
machine so if you're processing word or

177
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:22,550
file or Excel you got an office vm for

178
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:26,060
example if you go on for internet you

179
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:28,400
<font color="#CCCCCC">have an internet</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> vm so it's very safe</font>

180
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:31,970
way they try to make<font color="#E5E5E5"> a kind of sandbox</font>

181
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:34,880
technique to protect your<font color="#E5E5E5"> computer but</font>

182
00:08:31,970 --> 00:08:38,030
what if<font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to get our evidence for</font>

183
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:43,880
example so let's really be going to be a

184
00:08:38,030 --> 00:08:46,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">problem portable VMs I don't know if</font>

185
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,980
anyone<font color="#E5E5E5"> has ever worked at this point or</font>

186
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:52,069
seeing these ones just should USB stick

187
00:08:48,980 --> 00:08:55,670
and your vm is on it and every data is

188
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:58,640
in at vm if it's if it's written or file

189
00:08:55,670 --> 00:09:00,469
protected it can't open it you can't get

190
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:02,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">any</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> data out of it so you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have a really</font>

191
00:09:00,470 --> 00:09:04,310
a problem so we really have to

192
00:09:02,900 --> 00:09:06,199
understand how these techniques works

193
00:09:04,310 --> 00:09:10,250
and what is the latest technique and

194
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:11,330
what can we face<font color="#CCCCCC"> fede is the latest</font>

195
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:15,770
trends we see in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> netherlands</font>

196
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:19,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">desktops out of the wallet and there's</font>

197
00:09:15,770 --> 00:09:22,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">to host it to the cloud but I fear if</font>

198
00:09:19,730 --> 00:09:26,570
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have an incident</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay who owes the</font>

199
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:30,319
data it's the clouds company and which

200
00:09:26,570 --> 00:09:32,750
OS or which vm do you need I don't know

201
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:34,640
that's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> difficult this really what</font>

202
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:37,640
we need to understand that's why I'm

203
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:40,580
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> pleased to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> give this talk it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not</font>

204
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:43,550
only<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show what I'm researching at but</font>

205
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:46,610
also for the community to give a shout

206
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:51,479
and to call for please help and together

207
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:54,300
we can focus this problem and work on<font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

208
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:57,149
what about jurisdiction that<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an</font>

209
00:09:54,300 --> 00:10:00,389
example someone with gathering child

210
00:09:57,149 --> 00:10:03,959
porn using different cloud resources to

211
00:10:00,389 --> 00:10:07,410
put on his data you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> several</font>

212
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:10,768
jurisdictional precincts so how do you

213
00:10:07,410 --> 00:10:15,389
get the evidence do you know your limits

214
00:10:10,769 --> 00:10:16,769
where you're going to contact so there

215
00:10:15,389 --> 00:10:19,350
really needs to understand the

216
00:10:16,769 --> 00:10:21,870
technology I really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to understand</font>

217
00:10:19,350 --> 00:10:23,940
the implementations of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the products how</font>

218
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:25,589
its implemented and where you can find

219
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:28,199
the data which is valuable for your

220
00:10:25,589 --> 00:10:32,160
research which files are interesting

221
00:10:28,199 --> 00:10:34,829
which tools can we use<font color="#E5E5E5"> and well how</font>

222
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,930
those tools are acting in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the future</font>

223
00:10:34,829 --> 00:10:39,479
environment and really can you<font color="#E5E5E5"> explain</font>

224
00:10:36,930 --> 00:10:42,569
the working of your tool in the court I

225
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:44,970
once I was in a court was really great

226
00:10:42,570 --> 00:10:48,180
was doing the contract<font color="#CCCCCC"> controller a</font>

227
00:10:44,970 --> 00:10:51,089
research and one of the experts was

228
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:52,560
asked can you explain about<font color="#CCCCCC"> ND 57 and</font>

229
00:10:51,089 --> 00:10:54,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">the guy went up to the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> boards and just</font>

230
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,670
wrote down the complete mathematical

231
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:59,519
formula and the just which is like okay

232
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:01,589
<font color="#E5E5E5">I believe Europe you understanding the</font>

233
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:03,660
material but how many<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the forensic</font>

234
00:11:01,589 --> 00:11:05,430
research is you face in court are just a

235
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:08,969
tool guys they know how the Tool Works

236
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:12,989
with the deeper levels of os or the file

237
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:15,420
system they can't<font color="#CCCCCC"> explain to you and if</font>

238
00:11:12,990 --> 00:11:16,440
you can't explain about file systems how

239
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,870
do you think<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're going to explain</font>

240
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:23,069
<font color="#E5E5E5">about virtual forensics about virtual</font>

241
00:11:18,870 --> 00:11:27,899
file systems and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to develop an</font>

242
00:11:23,069 --> 00:11:30,569
approach I don't know if people are here

243
00:11:27,899 --> 00:11:33,149
but recently a single<font color="#CCCCCC"> asst has released</font>

244
00:11:30,569 --> 00:11:34,829
a book about forensic research in the

245
00:11:33,149 --> 00:11:37,290
cloud environment or virtual environment

246
00:11:34,829 --> 00:11:40,949
and I've read<font color="#E5E5E5"> the book and it's a nice</font>

247
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:42,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">overview but it didn't give the hens for</font>

248
00:11:40,949 --> 00:11:46,290
how to research if you're in law

249
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:50,910
enforcement what we need what we do face

250
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:53,370
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't tell</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about it so what's a</font>

251
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:56,719
good initiative but I think it has to<font color="#E5E5E5"> go</font>

252
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:56,720
further and must go further

253
00:11:57,130 --> 00:12:02,710
so which decisions well in the past we

254
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:05,829
always pull the plug from machine to

255
00:12:02,710 --> 00:12:10,210
<font color="#CCCCCC">pull out</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the plug get out the disk copy</font>

256
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:12,280
it take it to your lab research it but I

257
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:14,920
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are now visiting a company</font>

258
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:16,600
and you are doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> a pull the plug of a</font>

259
00:12:14,920 --> 00:12:21,370
vmware server I don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> think you're going</font>

260
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:23,410
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be happy</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and in the meantime there</font>

261
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:25,840
are a lot of life forensics techniques

262
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:29,020
which have developed for example memory

263
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:31,330
forensics file carving there's so much

264
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:32,980
full available data in the life

265
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:36,310
environments which processes are running

266
00:12:32,980 --> 00:12:41,050
a memory but how are<font color="#E5E5E5"> you getting those</font>

267
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:44,829
out<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the virtual memory so the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> next</font>

268
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:48,099
part of my demo and presentation will be

269
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:49,870
about citrix<font color="#CCCCCC"> VMware and windows 7 and</font>

270
00:12:48,100 --> 00:12:52,420
which files are interesting for use

271
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:54,850
which tools can you use for<font color="#E5E5E5"> it and what</font>

272
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:59,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">are the hiccups and what it would be</font>

273
00:12:54,850 --> 00:13:02,290
what we need for the<font color="#CCCCCC"> future so citrix</font>

274
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:05,230
well<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> think everyone knows citrix and</font>

275
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:07,240
there are many<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways to implement it but</font>

276
00:13:05,230 --> 00:13:08,560
<font color="#CCCCCC">I know in a couple of years ago when</font>

277
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:10,330
someone told me full you have to do an

278
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,530
investigation and that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the company has a</font>

279
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:15,070
Citrix environment i would just like

280
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:18,069
over oh<font color="#E5E5E5"> no because</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they knew only</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

281
00:13:15,070 --> 00:13:21,490
system profile the registry maybe some

282
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:25,390
log files that's it I couldn't copy a

283
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:27,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">disk or something like that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so you</font>

284
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:28,510

just to be sure you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can better be sure</font>

302
00:14:17,759 --> 00:14:25,769
to copy more data then you have to go

back often<font color="#E5E5E5"> you don't have that chance so</font>

00:14:25,769 --> 00:14:29,850
what what are<font color="#CCCCCC"> the interesting files for</font>

00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:34,199
citrix the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Lost Lagoon file for example</font>

306
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:36,540
as a data I could client configuration

lock a default it's not enabled of

00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:47,730
<font color="#E5E5E5">valuable file you ever have and although</font>

311
00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:49,259
the latest internet explorer and the

00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:51,329
<font color="#CCCCCC">Google browsers make it difficult for us</font>

313
00:14:49,259 --> 00:14:54,600
there are still tools and still ways to

314
00:14:51,329 --> 00:14:57,508
get data out of it citrix actually

315
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:59,279
access gateway logs it's really nice if

316
00:14:57,509 --> 00:15:03,179
you have those and if the radius locks

317
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:05,160
and the time the time<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ntp service is</font>

318
00:15:03,179 --> 00:15:08,129
running correctly in that company you

319
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:10,319
can<font color="#E5E5E5"> really create a great time line and</font>

320
00:15:08,129 --> 00:15:12,509
that's one of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> first things</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i always</font>

321
00:15:10,319 --> 00:15:14,399
<font color="#E5E5E5">create after I've done did the checksums</font>

322
00:15:12,509 --> 00:15:18,389
for example I always create a timeline

323
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:20,699
for my data it tells you so much but

324
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:24,509
then again<font color="#E5E5E5"> in virtual environments I</font>

325
00:15:20,699 --> 00:15:27,029
hope that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the timeline will be</font>

326
00:15:24,509 --> 00:15:31,410
representative that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> NTP is running</font>

327
00:15:27,029 --> 00:15:34,049
correctly so which tools can use for

328
00:15:31,410 --> 00:15:38,969
citrix well actually the normal tools

329
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:42,360
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> ftk imager nks and the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> university</font>

00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:37,980
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> converting again the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> theme decayed</font>

427
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:40,200
fell and I got the same error and I

428
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:42,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">asked the guys about some guidance about</font>

429
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:45,300
it and well they couldn't reconstruct

430
00:20:42,330 --> 00:20:47,879
either so you<font color="#CCCCCC"> see well losing files in</font>

431
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:50,399
your investigation is killing itself so

432
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:54,120
in case it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not always working for free</font>

433
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:56,700
and where files well mls indeedy well

434
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:59,909
normal tools roll through<font color="#CCCCCC"> the MDK</font>

435
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:01,920
actually you can reconstruct<font color="#E5E5E5"> a DD file</font>

436
00:20:59,910 --> 00:21:04,440
to a few medical file formats and then

437
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:08,070
open it in life you so you can open<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

438
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:10,920
eos but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm mounting car fit for most or</font>

439
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:13,080
falter racket so well I love to do for

440
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:15,330
carving it's one of my favorites

441
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,850
research items in my investigations

442
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:23,820
because it always gives you extra data

443
00:21:17,850 --> 00:21:26,100
and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is what i try to mention early</font>

444
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:28,710
before we need each other in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

445
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:30,449
community and<font color="#CCCCCC"> we're looking for tools</font>

446
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:33,630
for investigation about virtual

447
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:38,220
forensics and<font color="#E5E5E5"> there are not many</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of them</font>

448
00:21:33,630 --> 00:21:40,800
and actually I this tool it's a snap

449
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:42,990
compared<font color="#CCCCCC"> snapshot tool by siren actually</font>

450
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:45,810
I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in an anti-malware forum</font>

451
00:21:42,990 --> 00:21:48,810
someone who was investigating malware

452
00:21:45,810 --> 00:21:50,460
and you did something with the VMware

453
00:21:48,810 --> 00:21:53,129
Workstation build up the environment

454
00:21:50,460 --> 00:21:55,530
where the snapshot infected his computer

455
00:21:53,130 --> 00:21:57,330
affected the made another snapshot and

456
00:21:55,530 --> 00:21:59,820
he wrote a tool to compare

457
00:21:57,330 --> 00:22:02,879
shells it is<font color="#E5E5E5"> really great if</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you have</font>

458
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:04,770
reconstructed out of your image a couple

459
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:08,940
of snapshots you can compare<font color="#E5E5E5"> them I</font>

460
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:12,300
wanted this one for someone we wish at

00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:14,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">the child born on his laptop and I don't</font>

463
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:19,260

466
00:22:21,510 --> 00:22:29,310
malware to say hey the malware did it so

467
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:31,469
yeah it's up to us then to prove that's

468
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:34,080
not a malware but actually by themselves

469
00:22:31,470 --> 00:22:37,830
are downloading<font color="#E5E5E5"> this stuff so this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

470
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:39,030

471
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:40,679
of my talk I will<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you the link to</font>

472
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:42,540
my<font color="#CCCCCC"> site there's a paper about this</font>

473
00:22:40,680 --> 00:22:44,940
presentation it's not on your city run

474
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:49,710
but in the papers are also the links for

475
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:54,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">the tools</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I mentioning well if you have</font>

476
00:22:49,710 --> 00:22:55,710
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> vm m file the great tool is member so</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Chris best you can use the normal for</font>

478
00:22:55,710 --> 00:22:59,820
forensic research but if you have the

479
00:22:57,510 --> 00:23:03,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">vmail file well actually you can use for</font>

480
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:06,389
<font color="#CCCCCC">your research as well for men parsers</font>

481
00:23:03,090 --> 00:23:09,149
sorry you can use<font color="#CCCCCC"> it as well and this is</font>

482
00:23:06,390 --> 00:23:11,550
this example you see a evil bert no

483
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:18,750
threat dot excellent piece of malware<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

484
00:23:11,550 --> 00:23:20,909
found in the memory running and this is

485
00:23:18,750 --> 00:23:23,760
another great tool<font color="#E5E5E5"> i recently discovered</font>

486
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:25,890
this one and testing with it it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> open</font>

487
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:30,120
<font color="#CCCCCC">VMS drivers it's actually</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> java written</font>

488
00:23:25,890 --> 00:23:31,620
and but you just do a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it for</font>

489
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:35,729
their for example if you see the command

490
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:40,260
line on top of my slide you see what I'm

491
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:44,940
mounting a vm file system which is<font color="#CCCCCC"> a DD</font>

492
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:46,440
and just by putting and the info he

493
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:49,770
shows you all the information about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

494
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:51,990
image but another on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the top of sorry</font>

495
00:23:49,770 --> 00:23:54,300
and the bottom of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my slide you see vmdk</font>

496
00:23:51,990 --> 00:23:57,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">fume is a metadata</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> or log files actually</font>

497
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:59,669
you can on the file copy or<font color="#E5E5E5"> path or size</font>

498
00:23:57,090 --> 00:24:02,129
position you can be thought for example

499
00:23:59,670 --> 00:24:05,160
a file copy or path you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can see where</font>

500
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:07,230
the files in the vmdk are structured and

501
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:09,090
actually can restore them so it's a

502
00:24:07,230 --> 00:24:10,559
really great tool for<font color="#E5E5E5"> restoring data out</font>

503
00:24:09,090 --> 00:24:14,309
of your fee in decay

504
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:16,470
and I brought a small script if i

505
00:24:14,309 --> 00:24:20,850
<font color="#E5E5E5">restore it it goes through md5 checksum</font>

506
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:26,009
or sha-1 checks on sirens that's easy

507
00:24:20,850 --> 00:24:29,219
windows seven who is using windows seven

508
00:24:26,009 --> 00:24:33,690
here can see some hands a lot of them

509
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:41,370
and who is using the XP Mode to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

510
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:45,539
the exploit mode they didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> allow me</font>

511
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:47,279
get to tell well if we start<font color="#E5E5E5"> already and</font>

512
00:24:45,539 --> 00:24:49,649
you saw<font color="#CCCCCC"> that VHD file format was</font>

513
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:51,149
included in the system<font color="#E5E5E5"> so you see the</font>

514
00:24:49,649 --> 00:24:56,248
operating system with a<font color="#CCCCCC"> virtual</font>

515
00:24:51,149 --> 00:24:59,100
component in it so you can mount you VHD

516
00:24:56,249 --> 00:25:01,740
files you can read only do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

517
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:04,769
mountain you also can boot from a VHD

518
00:25:01,740 --> 00:25:06,840
file and actually this system backup is

519
00:25:04,769 --> 00:25:09,840
made infinity formats and they're

520
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:13,259
currently a lot of tools around in which

521
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:16,110
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> amount p XD i will show you</font>

522
00:25:13,259 --> 00:25:18,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">later on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a small demo about it how to</font>

523
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:22,529
mount it how to carve for example data

524
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:25,168
out of it so it's really easy and PhD is

525
00:25:22,529 --> 00:25:27,690
so structured<font color="#CCCCCC"> that you can use it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in any</font>

526
00:25:25,169 --> 00:25:30,360
case<font color="#E5E5E5"> and you can also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> use it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in ftk as</font>

527
00:25:27,690 --> 00:25:33,570
well and for<font color="#CCCCCC"> example here</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I've mounted</font>

528
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:36,029
the VHD file with ftk and on the left

529
00:25:33,570 --> 00:25:38,730
side it's bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> small but I thinking you</font>

530
00:25:36,029 --> 00:25:41,249
can see it she actually does<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

531
00:25:38,730 --> 00:25:46,679
structure of my desk and you can get the

532
00:25:41,249 --> 00:25:51,629
data out of it so it's really nice so

533
00:25:46,679 --> 00:25:57,119
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'll</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> show a little demo so I've made a</font>

534
00:25:51,629 --> 00:26:01,678
little test image and I say it's already

535
00:25:57,119 --> 00:26:04,580
mounted so that amount it's a tool

536
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:04,580
called to a gizmo

537
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:13,139
just a mount image and I said of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course</font>

538
00:26:08,190 --> 00:26:21,380
because we are forensics readout try

539
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:21,380
better I said<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay yep so</font>

540
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:34,200
so I well normally I use other tools but

541
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:40,620
to do one quickly<font color="#CCCCCC"> I grabs to recover my</font>

542
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:47,040
files<font color="#E5E5E5"> Carver</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> recover drive I said this</font>

543
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:51,510
one awesome like a drive recovery start

544
00:26:47,040 --> 00:26:55,530
and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see that it's searching on my</font>

545
00:26:51,510 --> 00:26:59,280
PhD file for a deleted or lost files

546
00:26:55,530 --> 00:27:03,510
there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> one</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> thing about recover my files</font>

547
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:04,889
it will<font color="#E5E5E5"> show now the actual file names</font>

548
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:06,540
on the left side later on when it's

549
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:09,299
finished it says<font color="#E5E5E5"> something like</font>

550
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:11,428
reconstructed files so the original file

551
00:27:09,299 --> 00:27:16,950
name is<font color="#E5E5E5"> disappearing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it's disappeared so</font>

552
00:27:11,429 --> 00:27:19,910
that's this terrible but so you see here

553
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,910
on the<font color="#E5E5E5"> left side here</font>

554
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:33,520
so you see it's quite fast lonely<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

555
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:44,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">would choose a photo reckons it's a</font>

556
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:49,260
great tool for for carving data so it's

557
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:49,260
almost there let's complete it

558
00:27:52,570 --> 00:28:01,509
you see over here see some pictures<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

559
00:27:55,690 --> 00:28:04,179
got out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> my file but nothing</font>

560
00:28:01,509 --> 00:28:10,769
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting I was last year in Senegal</font>

561
00:28:04,179 --> 00:28:10,769
so you see pictures here proofs<font color="#CCCCCC"> Nayar</font>

562
00:28:19,630 --> 00:28:27,850
so you can see actually multi<font color="#CCCCCC"> PhD some</font>

563
00:28:23,950 --> 00:28:30,610
data carving is quite easy then my

564
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:34,030
favorite topic the exploit exploit mode

565
00:28:30,610 --> 00:28:36,310
well XP mode is used for application all

566
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:39,250
the applications actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> what it does</font>

567
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:40,510
if you say<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I want to use XP Mode it</font>

568
00:28:39,250 --> 00:28:44,380
grabs a piece of your hard disk

569
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:46,180
installation<font color="#E5E5E5"> of virtual pc installation</font>

570
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:48,640
of windows XP service pack<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 and</font>

571
00:28:46,180 --> 00:28:51,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually when</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you install an application</font>

572
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:54,100
in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> XP Mode that publishes in your</font>

573
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:57,970
windows seven there's<font color="#CCCCCC"> one thing I</font>

574
00:28:54,100 --> 00:29:01,689
discovered the moment you choose for

575
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:04,420
installing windows XP Mode it actually

576
00:29:01,690 --> 00:29:06,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">it grabs a piece of your hard disks but</font>

577
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:09,730
it doesn't reformat it so if you have

578
00:29:06,910 --> 00:29:12,640
someone if you're acquiring a computer

579
00:29:09,730 --> 00:29:15,340
for example with XP<font color="#CCCCCC"> mode please the VHD</font>

580
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:18,670
file the carpet<font color="#CCCCCC"> mr. could</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> be very useful</font>

581
00:29:15,340 --> 00:29:20,590
information<font color="#CCCCCC"> in it I've told Microsoft</font>

582
00:29:18,670 --> 00:29:22,660
about it that's it would be more nice to

583
00:29:20,590 --> 00:29:26,679
format or wipe the file before

584
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:31,120
installing the XP service pack 3 in it

585
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:33,790
but maybe in next service pack and one

586
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:36,729
of the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> things is that automatic</font>

587
00:29:33,790 --> 00:29:39,520
updates or the firewall and windows XP

588
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:43,240
is not enabled and underwater everything

589
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:45,550
is shared for<font color="#E5E5E5"> 307 at a system level so</font>

590
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:47,860
that's why I call it exploit mode

591
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:50,470
because if you're capable of writing

592
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:53,469
some piece of malware that's discovering

593
00:29:50,470 --> 00:29:56,680
hey it's running XP Mode you are able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

594
00:29:53,470 --> 00:30:00,820
publish a keylogger for example in the

595
00:29:56,680 --> 00:30:04,480
XP then you're there so it could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

596
00:30:00,820 --> 00:30:06,550
nice tech factor but I've mentioned this

597
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:10,540
to Microsoft and I hope they<font color="#E5E5E5"> will pick</font>

598
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:15,639
up this one as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well so what are</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

599
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:18,610
files of interest HD of<font color="#CCCCCC"> course the vmc</font>

600
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:20,320
the configuration file touching more

601
00:30:18,610 --> 00:30:23,949
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> which disks are in the machine</font>

602
00:30:20,320 --> 00:30:26,470
network the safe state fel you can

603
00:30:23,950 --> 00:30:32,170
compare<font color="#CCCCCC"> it with a snapshot of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> VMware</font>

604
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:33,290
file and a few UD<font color="#CCCCCC"> the undo disc kind of</font>

605
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:36,050
restore

606
00:30:33,290 --> 00:30:37,430
function and the default location you

607
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:39,710
see on the on the bottom of<font color="#E5E5E5"> my slide</font>

608
00:30:37,430 --> 00:30:41,930
that's mostly did where it's situated

609
00:30:39,710 --> 00:30:47,810
you can read it also in my paper as well

610
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:50,660
so how do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the HD is has been</font>

611
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:52,760
used is enabled and you have to

612
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:57,530
investigate the fume see file you can

613
00:30:52,760 --> 00:31:01,760
see that there's some code era 1856 3103

614
00:30:57,530 --> 00:31:05,690
through 99 well I've noticed that<font color="#E5E5E5"> ok</font>

615
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:09,590
2010 is the year that the rest<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

616
00:31:05,690 --> 00:31:11,690
code well I'm simply<font color="#CCCCCC"> not know what it</font>

617
00:31:09,590 --> 00:31:14,360
actually means it has something to do

618
00:31:11,690 --> 00:31:16,070
with the date<font color="#CCCCCC"> and time but I've asked</font>

619
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:18,020
Microsoft about it what does<font color="#CCCCCC"> it mean</font>

620
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:20,030
because every<font color="#CCCCCC"> time you generate a few GD</font>

621
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:22,850
file it gives you this kind of DAB code

622
00:31:20,030 --> 00:31:24,320
when I can't explain yet so that's what

623
00:31:22,850 --> 00:31:26,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">is one of the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things I'm working at but</font>

624
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:27,980
I must be a complete aware of it so if

625
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:32,780
anyone knows the answer for me today I

626
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:36,530
would be very very<font color="#E5E5E5"> happy so little</font>

627
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:37,760
summary<font color="#E5E5E5"> of my talk yeah virtualized</font>

628
00:31:36,530 --> 00:31:41,990
environments can make forensic research

629
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:44,090
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> tough job a virtualization of</font>

630
00:31:41,990 --> 00:31:47,960
house application is impressive it will

631
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:50,990
scatter the evidence and<font color="#CCCCCC"> on purposely I</font>

632
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:54,080
mentioned only<font color="#E5E5E5"> the word cloud once in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> my</font>

633
00:31:50,990 --> 00:31:55,910
talk you can imagine if you're talking

634
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:58,610
about the clouds<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I use the example</font>

635
00:31:55,910 --> 00:32:01,250
from the child porn spreading about

636
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:05,959
different platforms for example<font color="#E5E5E5"> a zoo or</font>

637
00:32:01,250 --> 00:32:09,890
from amazon<font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have a challenge</font>

638
00:32:05,960 --> 00:32:11,240
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> to understand</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> everything the rapidly</font>

639
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:13,610
changing technique is difficult

640
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:15,770
especially for law enforcement because

641
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:18,260
we have so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you don't have one</font>

642
00:32:15,770 --> 00:32:22,700
case at a time normally six or seven and

643
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:25,490
<font color="#CCCCCC">every</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> time you have to go to a new</font>

644
00:32:22,700 --> 00:32:27,200
location and to acquire data at your

645
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:29,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">face with not a kind of the challenge</font>

646
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:32,270
then it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> VMware but how is it</font>

647
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:34,970
configures where so it's quite a

648
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:36,530
challenge and actually I think for

649
00:32:34,970 --> 00:32:39,740
myself it's very difficult to cope<font color="#CCCCCC"> with</font>

650
00:32:36,530 --> 00:32:41,690
these for every time investigator put

651
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:44,540
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> you need to research it how does it</font>

652
00:32:41,690 --> 00:32:46,400
work can I reconstruct that's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

653
00:32:44,540 --> 00:32:49,490
fear<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> taking time from your</font>

654
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:54,950
gation because you have to explain<font color="#E5E5E5"> it in</font>

655
00:32:49,490 --> 00:32:56,630
court as well so for the future<font color="#E5E5E5"> I really</font>

656
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:59,210
believe we need more research on vm

657
00:32:56,630 --> 00:33:01,280
there was one of the guys I forgot<font color="#E5E5E5"> his</font>

658
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:02,960
name but maybe he seen it here in the

659
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:06,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">audience as well and he wrote me about</font>

660
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:09,950
my about<font color="#E5E5E5"> this presentation and he said</font>

661
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:13,670
well keep on spread this word because I

662
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:15,410
think we really underestimate this in

663
00:33:13,670 --> 00:33:19,010
our research<font color="#CCCCCC"> and we need</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to publish</font>

664
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:23,750
about it and we really need forensic

665
00:33:19,010 --> 00:33:27,530
proof tools for our research without

666
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:31,730
tools we can't cope with this and well

667
00:33:27,530 --> 00:33:33,560
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is my slide investment Barcelona</font>

668
00:33:31,730 --> 00:33:36,050
would it<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a nice next topic for</font>

669
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:37,940
blackheads and well if you receive coded

670
00:33:36,050 --> 00:33:40,399
called me<font color="#E5E5E5"> just like I would you like to</font>

671
00:33:37,940 --> 00:33:44,240
speak on in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Las Vegas of a city yes of</font>

672
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:46,670
course just<font color="#E5E5E5"> to spread the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> word and what</font>

673
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:50,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">I mentioned before the books I've seen</font>

674
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:53,270
out about forensic research and virtual

675
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:55,910
fertilization environments they're good

676
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:58,460
they're good start I think we need

677
00:33:55,910 --> 00:34:01,040
really need a book about which tools can

678
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:04,670
we use how to investigate so well

679
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:06,379
actually and trying to write one but if

680
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:12,740
someone<font color="#E5E5E5"> is interested to help me out</font>

681
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:16,220
well would be great so i will now

682
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:20,859
reserve some time for questions and have

683
00:34:16,219 --> 00:34:20,859
<font color="#E5E5E5">a do some water</font>

684
00:34:24,699 --> 00:34:30,189
so light of the materials where the

685
00:34:28,389 --> 00:34:33,970
tools that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> sell here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> apply</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to some of</font>

686
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:36,730
the most<font color="#E5E5E5"> common BM vendors VMware some</font>

687
00:34:33,969 --> 00:34:37,868
of the things we have windows seven what

688
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:39,520
can you share about some of the other

689
00:34:37,869 --> 00:34:43,089
players<font color="#E5E5E5"> that are coming in like such as</font>

690
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:45,369
citrix xenserver well actually when you

691
00:34:43,089 --> 00:34:48,399
look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> four tools for investigating</font>

692
00:34:45,369 --> 00:34:50,800
well actually free and where they have

693
00:34:48,399 --> 00:34:55,179
some tools but there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are not focused on</font>

694
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:56,859
research or reason like this one they're

695
00:34:55,179 --> 00:34:58,480
<font color="#E5E5E5">not focused on that one so a lot of</font>

696
00:34:56,859 --> 00:35:00,730
thoughts you<font color="#CCCCCC"> see is actually written by</font>

697
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:03,070
that just guys like working the law

698
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:04,089
enforcement or facing the problem and

699
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:10,140
<font color="#E5E5E5">they write</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it write them by themselves</font>

700
00:35:04,089 --> 00:35:10,140
through was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> question up there I think</font>

701
00:35:16,540 --> 00:35:23,170
Christian Christian have you had anybody

702
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,520
challenge the forensic validity of an

703
00:35:23,170 --> 00:35:25,990
image that's been brought up in<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

704
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:31,270
machine other than the<font color="#CCCCCC"> one that was</font>

705
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:32,859
created on well actually I've heard a

706
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:35,830
case about in Netherlands that the judge

707
00:35:32,860 --> 00:35:37,960
said like okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a copy of a virtual</font>

708
00:35:35,830 --> 00:35:40,150
machine just<font color="#E5E5E5"> like you mentioned earlier</font>

709
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:42,580
before it is copied so I accept it<font color="#E5E5E5"> as an</font>

710
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:46,120
evidence but it was not a right

711
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:48,580
protected copied so I when I think we

712
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:52,569
also have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> shall we the judge for</font>

713
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:55,330
example how it's how you can prove or

714
00:35:52,570 --> 00:35:57,100
that it's really evidence but yeah it's

715
00:35:55,330 --> 00:36:02,200
difficult to prove with the current

716
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:04,299
tools it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> really difficult for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me I</font>

717
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:07,660
worked most with<font color="#E5E5E5"> yet the checksums</font>

718
00:36:04,300 --> 00:36:11,920
that's the thing i have other thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

719
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:18,759
have to<font color="#CCCCCC"> use and 2f to wait till</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> there's</font>

720
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:22,120
better how about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the use of snapshots in</font>

721
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:25,060
case of forensic investigations first

722
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:26,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">question and second question does it</font>

723
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:31,420
<font color="#E5E5E5">make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sense to make snapshots instead of</font>

724
00:36:26,950 --> 00:36:34,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">a DD image for example it depends</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on</font>

725
00:36:31,420 --> 00:36:37,510
your case for example if you have

726
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:40,150
snapshots I use them for reconstruction

727
00:36:37,510 --> 00:36:41,890
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you have for example a DD what</font>

728
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:43,900
you're mentioning and you can open it in

729
00:36:41,890 --> 00:36:48,460
Live View and then you can make snapshot

730
00:36:43,900 --> 00:36:50,470
for example to investigate us but to

731
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:52,810
wish<font color="#CCCCCC"> to save from okay which is best</font>

732
00:36:50,470 --> 00:36:58,959
yeah it depends on your new research in

733
00:36:52,810 --> 00:37:00,880
your case for<font color="#E5E5E5"> evidence of the court it's</font>

734
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:03,310
<font color="#E5E5E5">really important that you can explain</font>

735
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:04,570
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> a DD is or what a snapshot is if</font>

736
00:37:03,310 --> 00:37:06,400
you can explain<font color="#CCCCCC"> that one and a</font>

737
00:37:04,570 --> 00:37:10,900
difference and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can say why you use</font>

738
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:14,740
it then it's ok yeah they<font color="#E5E5E5"> will check</font>

739
00:37:10,900 --> 00:37:17,290
something that yeah you mentioned that

740
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:18,669
the system backup format with v HD that

741
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:25,210
also apply to the volume<font color="#E5E5E5"> shell copies</font>

742
00:37:18,670 --> 00:37:31,770
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> sure</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> one not sure I</font>

743
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:31,770

744
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:34,470

747
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:52,879

00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:59,570
