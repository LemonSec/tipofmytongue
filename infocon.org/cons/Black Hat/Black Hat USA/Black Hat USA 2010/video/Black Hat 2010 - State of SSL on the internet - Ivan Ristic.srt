1
00:00:00,979 --> 00:00:04,919
annexed attack a master missus and then
turn it in twenty two am and it's

2
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:08,480
presented by even restrict director
engineering for one application

3
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,349
farrell's himself course

4
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:16,939
please do one more time to time

5
00:00:16,939 --> 00:00:18,699
until

6
00:00:18,699 --> 00:00:21,640
so i'm going to talk today about

7
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:25,189
as his cell and in particular about our
survey

8
00:00:25,189 --> 00:00:29,230
uh... all how exercise currently use on
the internet

9
00:00:29,230 --> 00:00:32,140
what you can see on the screen right now
you did end up

10
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:37,519
although it's slightly misleading i_t_n_
i have a lot fifty slides which is way

11
00:00:37,519 --> 00:00:38,440
too many

12
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:40,690
so i'm pretty much going to be

13
00:00:40,690 --> 00:00:43,980
skip through the first half of the
talking they despise there for you to

14
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:45,070
use later

15
00:00:45,070 --> 00:00:48,789
and then i'll spend most of my time on
the actual survey results which are

16
00:00:48,789 --> 00:00:49,970
ready fascinating

17
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:52,949
it all printed slides in disarray which
are

18
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:54,310
pop information

19
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:59,500
and we will go through every jingle of
those slides and will comment on the on

20
00:00:59,500 --> 00:01:00,970
the results

21
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:02,140
uh...

22
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:03,550
so

23
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:06,610
this quickly about myself to do

24
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:08,970
reason why you should listen to me com

25
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:13,300
have spent quite a few years working
security right now i a by now

26
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:16,140
uh... and basically what i like to do is

27
00:01:16,140 --> 00:01:18,720
become a topic it's not really

28
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,390
very popular are covered by other people
and it looks beautiful intuitive

29
00:01:23,390 --> 00:01:24,659
try to figure out

30
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:28,580
why in a way i do it is a is a way of
uh... educating myself because there's

31
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:32,130
no better way to learn about the
technology him

32
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:38,240
that had to go deep into american
gerry's about so this is how i came to

33
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,729
we're going to sell it as a
year-and-a-half ago two years ago i

34
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:44,060
i wanted to revisit the topic

35
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,140
and i realize it actually does so little

36
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:52,450
recon so little information about us to
sell all dept for people who are not

37
00:01:52,450 --> 00:01:55,670
necessarily interest in the protocol
selvan in using it

38
00:01:55,670 --> 00:02:00,310
and one thing led to another so what
have entry happen to me is that

39
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:04,930
we started i_d_c_ research effort which
we called as a civil ops

40
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:08,470
which is just just edit for website
non-commercial

41
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:11,159
effort where we tried to make sense of
fsl

42
00:02:11,159 --> 00:02:13,459
so the senate and i'll be talking today

43
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,639
is about uh...

44
00:02:14,639 --> 00:02:18,389
uh... i vowed that the making sense
about as a self

45
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:22,429
so if you've got to this is the last
website you'll find that we have

46
00:02:22,429 --> 00:02:27,019
a number of interesting projects for
example the screen you can see the s_l_

47
00:02:27,019 --> 00:02:28,069
failed model

48
00:02:28,069 --> 00:02:32,328
which is very helpful if you want to
understanding which wastes estelle can

49
00:02:32,329 --> 00:02:33,709
fail

50
00:02:33,709 --> 00:02:37,969
and their other projects most of the
interesting one is the essence of rating

51
00:02:37,969 --> 00:02:39,259
guides

52
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:43,358
one in the first things i realized when
submitted looking dresses days this

53
00:02:43,359 --> 00:02:46,289
month is very difficult actually for
normal people

54
00:02:46,289 --> 00:02:49,409
people who are not better so i expect to
understand

55
00:02:49,409 --> 00:02:53,569
a particular server is configured well
or not so this is how the esa

56
00:02:53,569 --> 00:02:55,319
celebrating died was born

57
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:56,668
and the idea was to

58
00:02:56,669 --> 00:02:59,079
uh... have a

59
00:02:59,079 --> 00:03:01,919
basin methodology to basically sum up

60
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:06,739
a configuration of a particular cecil
server into a great

61
00:03:06,739 --> 00:03:08,689
and as you'll see later on

62
00:03:08,689 --> 00:03:13,930
uh... uh... dead dead dead good thing
about doing dishes that your view if you

63
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,580
give people a single

64
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:17,669
great which is a letter from a draft

65
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:19,579
it's very easy for them to understand

66
00:03:19,579 --> 00:03:21,840
if they're doing things well even

67
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,379
even he did not dont know much about
that so itself

68
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:29,279
now the guides is not an attempt to kind
of

69
00:03:29,279 --> 00:03:32,789
come up with a perfectly accurate grade

70
00:03:32,789 --> 00:03:37,668
but the seats in the east main purpose
he just to convey in meaning

71
00:03:37,669 --> 00:03:39,500
and a lot less to compare

72
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:41,999
the concentration of different

73
00:03:41,999 --> 00:03:42,959
asl service

74
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,569
and point to say which surveys better
curve becca configured

75
00:03:47,569 --> 00:03:52,138
who also want to be a rating guide is
not a cobbler easy doesn't looking the

76
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:53,189
costs

77
00:03:53,189 --> 00:03:57,369
interoperability issues or performance
issues of us to sell

78
00:03:57,369 --> 00:04:02,029
which sought to make a what would make
it into a much larger projects

79
00:04:02,029 --> 00:04:05,799
so the thing about this is the grading
guide that we basically use it is a

80
00:04:05,799 --> 00:04:09,999
foundation for assessment engine and i
think this is the best part about

81
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:12,160
edguez is a lobster website

82
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:12,960
which is

83
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:18,039
the free assessment tool we have people
who are you can go to do

84
00:04:18,039 --> 00:04:22,140
website ticking typing the domain and of
all the o_s_s_ ill server

85
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:26,150
and then the pool will actually go
inspect the proof you really are as to

86
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:27,739
sell configuration

87
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:29,530
and tell you everything

88
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:31,609
did you need to know about it so

89
00:04:31,610 --> 00:04:33,430
uh... i have some

90
00:04:33,430 --> 00:04:35,559
partial screenshots off for you

91
00:04:35,559 --> 00:04:37,559
here so you can see that

92
00:04:37,559 --> 00:04:40,629
the goal of this assessment tool
instigated a great

93
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:42,869
so a decade ago as you can find out

94
00:04:42,869 --> 00:04:43,930
what's going on

95
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:47,209
and then also you will begin full
details

96
00:04:47,209 --> 00:04:51,189
of every single aspect although of the
s_l_ corporation

97
00:04:51,189 --> 00:04:53,710
i met him we have about

98
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:56,359
talk on the date the points that we
collect about

99
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,240
from every asses so sir

100
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,870
and they had to test the self-described
compare has it so i think

101
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:04,499
is about two thousand pockets of two
hundred

102
00:05:04,499 --> 00:05:06,580
acting should be connections and

103
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:11,609
two hundred fifty kilobytes of data that
we exchanged with every estes ill server

104
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:13,009
that we text

105
00:05:13,009 --> 00:05:17,649
furthermore we will also looking to all
the services division find a single

106
00:05:17,649 --> 00:05:19,039
domain name

107
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,310
and will point request is deceased inc
along dot

108
00:05:24,310 --> 00:05:28,970
so part of a hot what will magda my
reason for being here today is that we

109
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:32,020
want to raid emily speaking raise
awareness about

110
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,709
as the stillness configuration problems

111
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:38,839
and we will want to get there's many
people as possible to visit our online

112
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:39,360
website

113
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:41,400
and best thereon uh...

114
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,750
their own asides

115
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:46,380
uh... however we also realized that's

116
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:47,419
uh...

117
00:05:47,419 --> 00:05:48,329
we

118
00:05:48,329 --> 00:05:52,129
no one has widow piece into how s
israelis use worldwide

119
00:05:52,129 --> 00:05:54,910
and then we decided to use the same
assessment engine

120
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:56,520
that we have

121
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:00,998
and to run it against as many as a
self-service service as possible

122
00:06:00,999 --> 00:06:05,099
to beauty assessment aging is just so
it's not that rebuilt das the one that

123
00:06:05,099 --> 00:06:06,469
we have on line

124
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:09,659
we probably spent i hear perfecting

125
00:06:09,659 --> 00:06:14,399
because it's at least one think looking
at bringing to the tradition of the

126
00:06:14,399 --> 00:06:15,979
i_o_c_'s and

127
00:06:15,979 --> 00:06:19,859
building something from that as an
entirely another problem actually

128
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:22,239
looking at how things work in real life

129
00:06:22,239 --> 00:06:24,979
so that the longer periods

130
00:06:24,980 --> 00:06:28,879
omg of during which the engine was
online

131
00:06:28,879 --> 00:06:32,910
allowed us to really identify israel
time real life issues

132
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:39,840
i think is then before it we com
undertake i_r_s_'s self-serving

133
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:41,630
and listen let's uh...

134
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:45,409
that's a very quick introduction into as
a cell obs

135
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:45,990
having

136
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,920
the next session of the section

137
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,710
uh... my presentation is about

138
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:55,180
finding guesses are serviced aspect of
course the challenge is how do you

139
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:58,600
defined the service because there is a
single registry

140
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,589
of service on the internet

141
00:07:00,589 --> 00:07:04,960
and aware of this race in which you can
go about doing this at different levels

142
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:05,930
can

143
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:11,999
abu large batches of i_t_t_ before
address space you can crawl dean tent

144
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:16,279
can be of the search engine seeking
kettlebell old buildings victor out

145
00:07:16,279 --> 00:07:17,180
there

146
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,759
are you can use the main images trations

147
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,409
and then look at each end digital domain
name is steve for those who sell and so

148
00:07:23,409 --> 00:07:27,680
on is hopeful another approach for
example is to use a browser toolbar

149
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,129
which would basically catches sheet

150
00:07:30,129 --> 00:07:32,689
where at where ya pues this out

151
00:07:32,689 --> 00:07:34,829
uses a browsing

152
00:07:34,829 --> 00:07:38,929
down early speaking neither of these
approaches east is perfect

153
00:07:38,929 --> 00:07:43,429
it's probably best to combine all of
them did not have to to get the best

154
00:07:43,429 --> 00:07:45,840
best possible our coverage

155
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:49,989
generally speaking it may not be ever
possible to build a a complete list of

156
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,399
all i cecil service on the internet

157
00:07:52,399 --> 00:07:58,119
because uh... there is sometimes the way
to the mapping is not always want to

158
00:07:58,119 --> 00:07:59,020
want to a sample

159
00:07:59,020 --> 00:08:00,830
a single

160
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:05,198
as a source or even today with their
choices so hosting is not possible

161
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,949
yeah i can actually serve multiple

162
00:08:07,949 --> 00:08:11,879
size them up multiple certificates in
general you can everybody

163
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:14,739
to be sure that you're seeing everything

164
00:08:14,739 --> 00:08:18,919
soak for the heart of the surveyor we
decided to go with the domain and

165
00:08:18,919 --> 00:08:23,779
registration simply because that was
that quickest and most predictable way

166
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:28,030
in which we could get to a large number
of the main aim is to nest so servers

167
00:08:28,030 --> 00:08:30,339
so what time is included with

168
00:08:30,339 --> 00:08:36,059
and collected the complete list of dot
com dot on dot net dot t_ full bc and

169
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:37,458
u_s_ domain names

170
00:08:37,458 --> 00:08:41,039
and he got the raised about one hundred
twenty million dollars

171
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:41,900
which

172
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:46,310
because we know there's about soccer
less than two hundred million registered

173
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:47,739
domain names worldwide

174
00:08:47,740 --> 00:08:50,430
our courage is about fifty seven percent

175
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:54,079
and i think we got smallest is now
almost all

176
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:57,780
stockwell domain names but in the survey
we do need to use

177
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:59,650
any of the country-specific

178
00:08:59,650 --> 00:09:02,670
help around the name their names

179
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:07,140
also is an additional data set we looked
at the top one million most popular

180
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:07,730
websites

181
00:09:07,730 --> 00:09:12,500
uh... which is the least bitches
combined and published by alexander

182
00:09:12,500 --> 00:09:12,970
you

183
00:09:12,970 --> 00:09:17,790
this these are the least obvious will
give you give us a much smaller number

184
00:09:17,790 --> 00:09:19,329
of essential services

185
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:23,770
however in a sense that that the city's
more meaningful because these are size

186
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:26,840
people actually basically

187
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:32,080
and uh... because the the did this it
was one hundred twenty million and

188
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,360
because there are certain pages actually
takes a long time to assess a service

189
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,730
what we've been in this area we had paid
very light-weight response

190
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:44,330
and in bed for spots we wanted to

191
00:09:44,330 --> 00:09:48,100
just identified those service and the
maintenance of active and that the

192
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:54,500
running better sell so this section of
the talk is actually ai sort of a m

193
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:58,209
survey wording a survey which will give
it to give you some idea of how

194
00:09:58,209 --> 00:10:01,890
menu domain names there are and how dare
dare use

195
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:06,740
and so for the likely possibility of a
simple assessment

196
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:11,570
program which basically use as fuel
brackets as possible

197
00:10:11,570 --> 00:10:15,200
doesn't complete a nazi even a single es
iso handshake

198
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,540
because we had so many domain names
discount we managed to be able to a

199
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:24,010
single process tool that's used two
thousand threads

200
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:30,220
acronym parallel it allowed us to
achieve a speed of about one thousand

201
00:10:30,220 --> 00:10:31,870
diminish the second

202
00:10:31,870 --> 00:10:36,400
and we're just going to go to bed one
and out there which allowed us to risk

203
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:41,380
on all of the one hundred twenty million
the mansion about them out

204
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:43,639
this christmas pecan pie would be

205
00:10:43,639 --> 00:10:47,120
further improvements gorazde wasn't with
recent

206
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,610
to do that because what they had was
fast enough

207
00:10:50,610 --> 00:10:52,300
and here are the results

208
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,728
uh...

209
00:10:53,729 --> 00:10:56,300
basically almost one-quarter of all
domain names

210
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,540
uh... indian respond i did because there
was a problem would be an ass

211
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:02,319
or because there was no

212
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,180
server racing on by the court a cute

213
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,540
portable for three

214
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,259
so with this left us with about ninety
two million domain names

215
00:11:10,259 --> 00:11:14,970
and then we continued to derail unveiled
in today's results and narrow down the

216
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:17,380
numbers as we go on further

217
00:11:17,380 --> 00:11:20,300
because armed all for the surveys to
find

218
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:25,490
dole certificates and cecil services are
actually use ful idealistic and people

219
00:11:25,490 --> 00:11:27,560
with the people intended to use

220
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:32,359
so hard logic was that if we look at
certificates that we get and compared

221
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,969
the naming the certificates

222
00:11:33,969 --> 00:11:36,189
with the domain name it we are looking
at

223
00:11:36,189 --> 00:11:39,199
and if there's a match between these two
names then when they found the city

224
00:11:39,199 --> 00:11:42,449
could be that we can look into into
deeper

225
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:45,430
so we looked into the active dominance

226
00:11:45,430 --> 00:11:47,829
most of them almost all all of them

227
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:50,100
have responded port eighty

228
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:54,350
and only about once a lot more than a
third responded to on part four four

229
00:11:54,350 --> 00:11:55,240
three

230
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:59,620
but even those that responded both
political ford three didn't have then

231
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,050
offer access out

232
00:12:01,050 --> 00:12:04,169
ellie two-thirds high-tech actually
high-tech system running

233
00:12:04,169 --> 00:12:05,819
and want to read

234
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:08,180
uh... critical sonya denies the cell

235
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,329
uh...

236
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:13,609
this is not unusual because political
forgeries usually open of on file also

237
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:18,280
people use it for face a handy because
it's all that such always down

238
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,810
and most of these

239
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:20,839
and on this is self

240
00:12:20,839 --> 00:12:22,339
uh... service

241
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:25,649
are just plain text that you get beat
although we have found a quite a large

242
00:12:25,649 --> 00:12:28,420
number of secure show shell so those

243
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:29,930
there as well

244
00:12:29,930 --> 00:12:33,939
and read raining down into the twenty
two million as sales service

245
00:12:33,939 --> 00:12:36,680
wages then next often though the
certificate names

246
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:40,560
and then compared to them so then wait
we found that uh...

247
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,689
and there's about seven hundred twenty
thousand uh... certificates where the

248
00:12:44,690 --> 00:12:48,260
name snatched and this is that the
biggest sampled it's actually very

249
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,200
useful to us

250
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,790
and that we wanted to keep and using the
second phase of our study

251
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:56,480
doses away i'm comparing things

252
00:12:56,480 --> 00:12:59,870
underwriting the rights of the the are
trapped in the right john dot on the

253
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:00,600
right

254
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,299
is the same analyses of the onyx a stop
one million domain names

255
00:13:05,299 --> 00:13:10,059
so you can see that the bear relatively
speaking uh... almost one-quarter of all

256
00:13:10,059 --> 00:13:13,420
up on new websites actually have

257
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:17,689
access that i have proper certificate or
certificate names that match the

258
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:18,180
maintenance

259
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:20,050
which also makes sense because

260
00:13:20,050 --> 00:13:21,579
in our lives on both

261
00:13:21,579 --> 00:13:25,890
there also a subdomain nice most of
which are probably balked

262
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:28,610
so this only so far

263
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:33,470
tells us a lot about in the state of the
web hosting an official web hosting

264
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:35,759
uh... on on the internet

265
00:13:35,759 --> 00:13:40,569
if you look at the numbers in uh... at
the ballot we look into a hundred twenty

266
00:13:40,569 --> 00:13:42,150
million domain names

267
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:46,110
but uh... they're all really represented
by only five million activities switch

268
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:50,220
on average means that one i could dress
will cost about twenty web sites

269
00:13:50,220 --> 00:13:53,340
and that if we look if you look only

270
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:57,850
uh... bellows cited support s itself
it's about one in ten days there's about

271
00:13:57,850 --> 00:14:02,090
ten s itself sides behind behind in the
main

272
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:07,749
so this is a discrepancy ended the life
if pretty non-responsive till

273
00:14:07,749 --> 00:14:09,610
burning problems less to sell

274
00:14:09,610 --> 00:14:12,770
and one is the virtual as a self hosting
is not possible

275
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:17,670
brito hosting is possible and you can
put as many girls websites a single i

276
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:22,189
paradise and his future is what caused
the explosion the popularity of bilbao

277
00:14:22,190 --> 00:14:23,490
of the work

278
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:26,619
instead fortunate we don't have the same
features wes itself

279
00:14:26,619 --> 00:14:30,149
so today to deploy secure web site you
actually have to fight how do you want

280
00:14:30,149 --> 00:14:31,839
to address

281
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,629
except a parody manually and everything
and do everything else who goes with

282
00:14:35,629 --> 00:14:36,380
that

283
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:40,870
more importantly way that we are locking
it doesn't go featured today to

284
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:44,630
specified for a domain name if it's a
poet says the so it all

285
00:14:44,630 --> 00:14:46,460
and more importantly

286
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:51,670
we don't have a way for website is sick
it it was to support on the esa cell

287
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:55,719
because right now even it were easy if
you have sites without one to help

288
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:58,110
support one hundred percent that's the
cell

289
00:14:58,110 --> 00:15:01,459
there there's not been preventing
browsers for trying to open up

290
00:15:01,459 --> 00:15:03,040
plaintiffs connection to it

291
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,449
and in some cases

292
00:15:04,449 --> 00:15:07,760
even that is enough for the secure
connection to the compromise

293
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:11,840
so we need to look into how result in
the future for their sit down for this

294
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:16,200
d_m_s_ is server echoes which are used
for a price on particles but not

295
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:19,220
guaranteed for quite a defeat

296
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:21,100
anyway when logging on

297
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,500
with some uh... sab

298
00:15:23,500 --> 00:15:30,500
if us p

299
00:15:31,060 --> 00:15:35,029
service from that the other sister
nearly one million domain names and we

300
00:15:35,029 --> 00:15:39,490
have should have stuck extracted quite a
few a domain name sensitive 'cause

301
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:43,450
themselves and by combining although
this information we basically i arrived

302
00:15:43,450 --> 00:15:44,610
at about

303
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,570
eight hundred sixty thousand

304
00:15:46,570 --> 00:15:50,700
ob gyn known as a so-so is that we
wanted to have to look into

305
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:53,270
because we now and it is about

306
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:57,640
this is a of he hired for anywhere from
between one million two two million

307
00:15:57,640 --> 00:15:58,319
commercial

308
00:15:58,319 --> 00:16:02,269
acts as a substitute a piece in the
world is a numbers presumptive ian

309
00:16:02,269 --> 00:16:03,190
burnett got

310
00:16:03,190 --> 00:16:06,770
who's been following there's so much
market for a long time

311
00:16:06,770 --> 00:16:11,170
number so that we're looking at this
hour in the survey is from twenty five

312
00:16:11,170 --> 00:16:12,718
to take fifty percent

313
00:16:12,719 --> 00:16:16,550
of although i guess if certificates i
mean

314
00:16:16,550 --> 00:16:18,300
it's not saying that

315
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:24,790
the dataset is is probably very biased
because we looked mostly at the top

316
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:27,988
level the maintenance and not in the
country specific ones

317
00:16:27,989 --> 00:16:32,529
so as you may know s_t_d_'s ear
certificates will sometimes say

318
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:36,969
uh... could contain information about
the organizations that uh... that owned

319
00:16:36,969 --> 00:16:40,609
them and so we extracted that
information from snow where it where it

320
00:16:40,609 --> 00:16:44,539
was available and you can see that they
have on the job that for more

321
00:16:44,539 --> 00:16:47,030
significance we've given all the origin
was on their own

322
00:16:47,030 --> 00:16:51,510
but you can see that about two more than
two hundred thousand more about the u_s_

323
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:52,180
base

324
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,430
and then followed by aside from the back

325
00:16:54,430 --> 00:17:00,380
and great britain them again and so on
and so forth

326
00:17:00,380 --> 00:17:02,050
anyway and

327
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:04,389
we sought to brings me to do main

328
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,780
feature of the presentation which is
that the results of this is still so

329
00:17:07,780 --> 00:17:08,949
they self

330
00:17:08,949 --> 00:17:10,760
uh...

331
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:14,210
so what happened is that in the second
phase of our survey

332
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:18,510
we actually need more processing power
so india and we have a trended up using

333
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:19,589
three service

334
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:23,399
uh... with two of them performing
assessments in parallel

335
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:26,850
each side of a contributing about two oh
two three

336
00:17:26,849 --> 00:17:28,359
assessments per second

337
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,919
and 'em

338
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:33,980
processes would actually take a quite a
long time we calculated the median value

339
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:35,580
value to be about sixty

340
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:36,879
sixty five seconds

341
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:40,840
the network legacies what impacted

342
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:46,059
processing speed so issue for service
particularly close we could to complete

343
00:17:46,059 --> 00:17:48,299
assessment demanding a couple seconds

344
00:17:48,299 --> 00:17:53,400
but for a service very far away it may
take even thousands of sex

345
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:58,280
andheri uh... works this proved is said
to her however the resources that we use

346
00:17:58,280 --> 00:17:59,940
were pretty modest

347
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,180
and there was about one pair bikes

348
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:07,740
of uh... eh uh... traffic but realistic
omg all these three service over or

349
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:11,450
virtual and quite modest it when it
comes to performance

350
00:18:11,450 --> 00:18:15,929
so by far the biggest resources it three
years whilst i'm sorry i says to make

351
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:20,399
and i spent i never wanted two months
full-time working on the study making

352
00:18:20,399 --> 00:18:24,869
sure that the editing works 'em
everything works well and valuating

353
00:18:24,869 --> 00:18:27,809
results of fixing small issues admitted
making sure that uh... the result that

354
00:18:27,809 --> 00:18:30,379
we get are correct

355
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,990
so without further ado

356
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:36,910
uh... let's let's move on insults if you
recall

357
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:40,029
we had about a hundred sixty thousand

358
00:18:40,029 --> 00:18:43,130
certificates and the first step we
wanted to look as to how many

359
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,920
certificates we trusted

360
00:18:44,920 --> 00:18:50,540
trustee has found someone subjective
term in our study we use the cost basis

361
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:53,080
of five folks at three point six

362
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,909
which means it's firefox will toss a
certain number of rule certificates

363
00:18:56,910 --> 00:18:59,220
which it has become the trustees

364
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:03,670
and there is also here should just be
reasonably accurate and cook compatible

365
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:08,140
to what you would get browsing using
firefox although we gave you saw a

366
00:19:08,140 --> 00:19:12,630
slightly different at the closures so
that there may be some john some

367
00:19:12,630 --> 00:19:16,410
variations and this one thing they also
also that we discovered is with us to

368
00:19:16,410 --> 00:19:17,169
sell

369
00:19:17,169 --> 00:19:21,269
impaired interoperability steel a
problem is as old mentioning a moment to

370
00:19:21,269 --> 00:19:22,110
do it

371
00:19:22,110 --> 00:19:26,979
so my father then regarding the bus
seventy percent

372
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:29,640
almost a ticket to perhaps in the
database

373
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:30,650
ham

374
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:34,880
but there's also a small group of
suspicious looking this car is that they

375
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,500
think they're comparability problem uses
of the job implementation unless a cell

376
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:43,869
has some problem with these certificate
issued basically a certain com

377
00:19:43,869 --> 00:19:45,659
a certificate authority

378
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:49,960
and so we think the overall number of
johnston's certificates is about seventy

379
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,840
two percent

380
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,169
produced as they also david hannay an
independent analyses you helping us to

381
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:56,649
sell

382
00:19:56,649 --> 00:20:00,139
and we arrived to begin at the same
number six about seventy seventy two

383
00:20:00,139 --> 00:20:01,389
percent

384
00:20:01,389 --> 00:20:03,178
atrocity certificates

385
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:07,169
if we look at the causes and why we
couldn't draw certain certificates by

386
00:20:07,169 --> 00:20:10,630
far the biggest problem was expired
certificates

387
00:20:10,630 --> 00:20:14,860
uh... i guess it if this is someone
forgot to renewable or how does it work

388
00:20:14,860 --> 00:20:16,090
that were abundant

389
00:20:16,090 --> 00:20:20,439
the second was uh... quite a large
number of sale signs if your kids are

390
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,509
not net ninety six of six thousand
dollars

391
00:20:23,509 --> 00:20:27,460
clearing updates for public consumption
although they may be purvi perfectly

392
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:31,149
fine for those who all what the service
content

393
00:20:31,149 --> 00:20:35,529
and then the next is a similar problem
which is unknown certificate authorities

394
00:20:35,529 --> 00:20:39,690
and this would be the case of people
creating their own internal perhaps

395
00:20:39,690 --> 00:20:43,210
certificate authorities which they would
then use to sign

396
00:20:43,210 --> 00:20:47,680
of size it if it gets and dennis taking
these have been these group also is not

397
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,300
speak for bubbly weapons option

398
00:20:50,300 --> 00:20:52,740
there was there about twenty thousand

399
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:56,179
as certificates where we had been to
think there'll be at the issues

400
00:20:56,179 --> 00:21:00,710
uh... which we verified and its first by
the sometimes

401
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:04,790
advil besides it would be open as a cell
but will not work with to the dollar has

402
00:21:04,790 --> 00:21:08,658
a cell but well maybe not work also with
the firefox esa celso

403
00:21:08,659 --> 00:21:13,169
that these issues it will want to be
paper and if your job

404
00:21:13,169 --> 00:21:17,400
their there are very there was a very
small number of revolt certificates only

405
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,820
about one thousand

406
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:23,059
and there was a surprisingly a large
number of certificates who subjects were

407
00:21:23,059 --> 00:21:24,080
malformed

408
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,360
because they contain multiple comments

409
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,209
and i suspect these days just to keep
the peace will not be issued a

410
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:31,809
certificate authorities who probably
catch

411
00:21:31,809 --> 00:21:32,770
goods these problems

412
00:21:32,770 --> 00:21:37,450
so these these were promise up self
signed two

413
00:21:37,450 --> 00:21:43,950
looking to hire expiry dates and but
indicate positive because you can see

414
00:21:43,950 --> 00:21:48,120
that most significant survived for a
period of one year and then you can see

415
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:50,039
spikes of two or three forty five

416
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:52,960
uh... five-year ranges

417
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:57,290
and looking just at the end the expired
certificate led by far the largest

418
00:21:57,290 --> 00:21:58,530
number of these

419
00:21:58,530 --> 00:22:03,879
uh... have expired hercules recently is
so within a month or two and then the

420
00:22:03,880 --> 00:22:07,309
number will go down properly and you too

421
00:22:07,309 --> 00:22:08,190
just sound

422
00:22:08,190 --> 00:22:11,380
uh... it is to say that after two or
three

423
00:22:11,380 --> 00:22:15,240
and forty or forty four years is that
uses the excuse and none

424
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:19,200
see the significant number of
certificates that they are

425
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:20,860
still a expired

426
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:24,770
and also compare looking in various
problems most

427
00:22:24,770 --> 00:22:29,320
com certificates had only one problem
which is that the day-to-day expired

428
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:33,330
but there's a number about thirty eight
percent had some other problem too

429
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:37,110
and perhaps they'll sell so i know you
should write novels certificate

430
00:22:37,110 --> 00:22:39,530
authorities on

431
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:41,090
uh...

432
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:45,439
then i will update you with the unknown
isha issue cindy's were issues that we

433
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,950
could have just because

434
00:22:46,950 --> 00:22:50,000
we couldn't binding cannot drive space

435
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:50,890
and

436
00:22:50,890 --> 00:22:55,030
we realized that the great majority of
these there are about forty three

437
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,190
thousand

438
00:22:56,190 --> 00:23:01,490
we saw only once or twice which means if
someone jade hissy opt to see a and use

439
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:04,450
it internally and it's not the proper
c_i_a_

440
00:23:04,450 --> 00:23:08,130
there on the twenty dollar certificate
authorities it with someone who one

441
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,009
hundred times

442
00:23:09,009 --> 00:23:13,460
and i'm anne respected every single one
of them just like to ensure a on their

443
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,580
places

444
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:17,399
i found for legitimate authorities

445
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,309
but they uh... series

446
00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:24,129
how for example first-ever encryption
services hockey sets up right there

447
00:23:24,130 --> 00:23:26,070
subsidy d echo in japan

448
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:31,320
and today it's not just by fire fourteen
is not just about a major browsers to

449
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:32,730
ob

450
00:23:32,730 --> 00:23:36,610
csrs is a certificate at the art it is
also not stocks to build it they make an

451
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:41,219
attempt to ship certificates and they
have a long term goal to be trusted

452
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:44,190
so you can see they have quite a few
certificates two

453
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,409
and they had to illegitimate

454
00:23:46,409 --> 00:23:50,770
certificate authorities that they're not
clustered by five frogs altogether

455
00:23:50,770 --> 00:23:52,709
jostled byob image of gaza

456
00:23:52,709 --> 00:23:53,250
browsers

457
00:23:53,250 --> 00:23:56,920
and for what i configured they're not
just a done because they haven't

458
00:23:56,920 --> 00:24:02,230
completed the procedure where there
would be cool to be our certificate

459
00:24:02,230 --> 00:24:03,570
into into firefox

460
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:08,899
and i don't want to be sexes ice to make
sure that we really etd edta roster only

461
00:24:08,899 --> 00:24:09,469
does

462
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:11,899
uh... certificate was supposed to sauce

463
00:24:11,899 --> 00:24:15,748
and it did did bring up missing a large
number of because i think you'll

464
00:24:15,749 --> 00:24:17,340
internal problems

465
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,699
uh...

466
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:23,529
and then we're looking to trust in this
year's addiction didn't it didn't

467
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:24,530
certificate chains

468
00:24:24,530 --> 00:24:27,010
so normally an

469
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:30,070
the way it works you have package

470
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:32,810
browser or s_l_ client will have a trust
based

471
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:38,620
for example firefox has and iran a la
jolla fifty-five abuse

472
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:43,389
and those trusted does anchors tossed
anchors who hide their assigned

473
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:48,210
webserver certificates directly or
devil's signed into any intimidating to

474
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:48,830
immediate

475
00:24:48,830 --> 00:24:50,820
as certificate authorities

476
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,110
how mean

477
00:24:52,110 --> 00:24:55,590
and listed to attend a trust can be of
any size

478
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:59,639
and that's what we found is that and
amino sizes to saying in the game

479
00:24:59,639 --> 00:25:03,369
building the rights of lower corner you
can see if the number of safety for

480
00:25:03,369 --> 00:25:04,340
gazette had

481
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,139
at ten a particular land

482
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:09,350
so you can see that most of the fix
actually have to

483
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:11,120
generators during three

484
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:16,110
encouraging the chairman took three
activities is recommended and they don't

485
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:19,320
because if you have a trusted

486
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:20,870
uncork there was a ticket

487
00:25:20,870 --> 00:25:24,090
you want to put it off line you don't
want to use it all the time to that

488
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:25,178
basically sign

489
00:25:25,179 --> 00:25:28,990
web certificate so what you do it you
don't i think immediate one

490
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:31,750
and in the end then put that out that
one online

491
00:25:31,750 --> 00:25:34,960
so that can be used up all use all the
time

492
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:38,590
so one interesting point is that
although we saw fourteen four hundred

493
00:25:38,590 --> 00:25:41,580
ninety twenty nine

494
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:46,290
certificate authorities they only lead
to seventy eight

495
00:25:46,290 --> 00:25:49,840
thrust anchors out the one hundred fifty
five it we had

496
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,320
economic talks two days

497
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:54,320
which is about uh... only fifty percent

498
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:59,350
uh... so even with the five posts on the
fifty percent of tough cyprus for years

499
00:25:59,350 --> 00:26:03,580
and then i looked interdicting these
chains issued to see whether they're

500
00:26:03,580 --> 00:26:06,570
correct we found that statistically
speaking

501
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:11,000
uh... day most of them are correct and
that a small number of certificates on

502
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:11,530
chains

503
00:26:11,530 --> 00:26:13,120
at thirteen correct before

504
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,320
for two reasons

505
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:19,760
the though it does often so you can see
about six percent well these are not

506
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:23,550
corrected fun because they're missing in
communities intermediates and

507
00:26:23,550 --> 00:26:24,149
certificates

508
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:26,620
so when you have a high anchor chain of
talks

509
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:30,489
which is supposed to do here are
supposed to could your webservice

510
00:26:30,490 --> 00:26:30,879
significant

511
00:26:30,879 --> 00:26:35,559
but also include all the intermediate
certificates and but not in the final

512
00:26:35,559 --> 00:26:36,879
high certificates

513
00:26:36,879 --> 00:26:38,129
the trust bank

514
00:26:38,130 --> 00:26:39,800
so what's what

515
00:26:39,800 --> 00:26:45,960
we also clowns bed themselves some tends
to be incomplete and helps in some cases

516
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,300
chains will be bringing correct order

517
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,428
mission is it with this is not all that
all is so clients

518
00:26:51,429 --> 00:26:55,139
we'll know how to handle incomplete
chains are changing having complete

519
00:26:55,139 --> 00:26:55,678
orders

520
00:26:55,679 --> 00:26:56,759
so these

521
00:26:56,759 --> 00:27:00,830
size the do not have the sender
implemented correctly can experience

522
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:04,559
into me up i think they meet in probably
a swede excel oxes

523
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:07,210
it will be very difficult to
troubleshoot

524
00:27:07,210 --> 00:27:10,760
but that was one really unusual thing
that we discovered is a forty two

525
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:14,179
percent of both sides actually send more
certificates

526
00:27:14,179 --> 00:27:18,280
that they need to set and then those
excesses typically what i should create

527
00:27:18,280 --> 00:27:20,790
the potential performance issue bandit

528
00:27:20,790 --> 00:27:23,690
for them so if we're if we're looking to
them

529
00:27:23,690 --> 00:27:29,240
how quickly see it certificate is
usually about one kilobytes long

530
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:34,240
so if you sent and that's the city to
get that increases the size of universal

531
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,940
passion but but want to know about

532
00:27:35,940 --> 00:27:39,019
and what's very important about the city
connections

533
00:27:39,019 --> 00:27:44,370
is it indeed initially this type of slow
and a sort of on top speed is a number

534
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:47,139
of packages ec ec exchange

535
00:27:47,139 --> 00:27:50,869
sold in the sooner than that thing in
the bottom line here the sunday publi

536
00:27:50,869 --> 00:27:52,389
d_s_l_ handshake

537
00:27:52,389 --> 00:27:55,178
that this sunday you'll start receiving
actual data

538
00:27:55,179 --> 00:27:56,650
if you have

539
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:59,559
after a handshake dismisses to along

540
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:02,120
bands and that will take model buckets

541
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:07,479
and then the whole had she quebec
actually quite along i thought

542
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:08,279
so

543
00:28:08,279 --> 00:28:14,109
you can see that quite a few of the city
of this service and more on along

544
00:28:14,109 --> 00:28:16,129
uh...

545
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:17,799
certificates in the who showed

546
00:28:17,799 --> 00:28:18,720
and

547
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:24,580
no single so you can see in the cable
underwriters we hire depress causes

548
00:28:24,580 --> 00:28:26,928
great displays the actual number that we
saw

549
00:28:26,929 --> 00:28:30,820
and anderson and they're going to do
right expression used by the number

550
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:33,189
buttttt certificates we should have seen

551
00:28:33,190 --> 00:28:37,400
you can see that no ceremonies at the
same modern five certificates

552
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:41,490
but there was actually quite a large
number of sides this and more

553
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:45,060
and there is even one side the says that
since one hundred sixty

554
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:50,379
so this one sites had probably had to
happen cecil handshake alone or one on

555
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:53,250
one hundred twenty kilobytes of data
which is which is

556
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:57,840
a tremendous timmons number which was
sold on the haitian pension quite up

557
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,840
quite a bit

558
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:04,379
um and this is just a matter of of amis
configuration it did something it can be

559
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:06,289
quick road too quickly

560
00:29:06,289 --> 00:29:09,899
and he does someone is needs to do that

561
00:29:09,899 --> 00:29:13,918
now the reason i'm looking to do it that
they did this problem and the reason why

562
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:17,110
so many sites actually send most
effective if needed

563
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:21,189
is because those are the stocks is a big
yesterday certificate authorities

564
00:29:21,190 --> 00:29:25,450
so i had to have to do to be the values
of some of my websites

565
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:30,889
and i i i saw that i had smite mysite
software business problem because i just

566
00:29:30,889 --> 00:29:35,939
took the change it's good that was given
to me by the c_i_a_ installed in the

567
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:38,129
server without really realizing

568
00:29:38,129 --> 00:29:42,250
that uh... that there's there's one
certificate certificate to rent

569
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:44,929
anywhere this is not going to be a
problem for most sites

570
00:29:44,929 --> 00:29:48,580
preferred all sides who want to risk
ways every single bit of performers

571
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,980
their reading of that need to look into
introduce

572
00:29:51,980 --> 00:29:55,450
the other thing you need to look at the
session resumption

573
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:59,290
i have a good news here which is the
majority web sites to actually implement

574
00:29:59,290 --> 00:30:03,299
sessions optional well and only about
one the about ten percent don't

575
00:30:03,299 --> 00:30:06,918
in there because five-day have this
feature disabled

576
00:30:06,919 --> 00:30:11,049
order for some other reason behind it as
a teacher but they don't actually use it

577
00:30:11,049 --> 00:30:15,250
and this is a problem because if you
don't have sessions i'm sure enabled

578
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:20,149
then you have to establish a full as his
health housing for every single

579
00:30:20,149 --> 00:30:24,289
connections we have cecil server and we
debated the dates makes a long-time and

580
00:30:24,289 --> 00:30:28,500
we'll see a significant to slow down the
performance of of your website and it

581
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:31,430
will worsen that the experience

582
00:30:31,430 --> 00:30:35,230
the diffuser experience

583
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:38,000
and i'm going to back to the process

584
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:41,029
to and chris and now we're going to look
into

585
00:30:41,029 --> 00:30:45,179
uh... which trust anchors actually used
i i think that this is a slight most

586
00:30:45,179 --> 00:30:49,070
people here will interceded now this is
the it's important to make a distinction

587
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:50,980
this is not market share

588
00:30:50,980 --> 00:30:55,740
so although some of these trust and that
i have a lease if you will are fifty

589
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:59,789
three people parts of the issues execute
is directed to end users

590
00:30:59,789 --> 00:31:03,929
some of these may not be an uh...
because there were on the web which

591
00:31:03,929 --> 00:31:08,870
uh... underneath the needed c_i_a_'s
also some companies have not multiple

592
00:31:08,870 --> 00:31:11,928
trust him suck and they will appeal made
by some estimates

593
00:31:11,929 --> 00:31:13,480
but the point of the

594
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:19,250
of this slide b_ section look as to how
many certificate authorities doing to

595
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:19,860
trust

596
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:23,689
because as you may know there's that
dennis koshen india still communicate

597
00:31:23,690 --> 00:31:28,370
because the the size of the tossed
daisies exploding and issue is that

598
00:31:28,370 --> 00:31:32,570
there's no delegation with casa
certificate authorities any c_i_a_

599
00:31:32,570 --> 00:31:34,769
inside pain domain of the funding

600
00:31:34,769 --> 00:31:38,110
so even some obscure issue that you've
never heard about

601
00:31:38,110 --> 00:31:42,229
and that uh... virtually no one uses
consign

602
00:31:42,230 --> 00:31:46,240
adversity target for the largest website
updated so that that that's so to do a

603
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:50,429
good erodes are tossed into ulc sip

604
00:31:50,429 --> 00:31:55,659
so we can see that on this uh... but i
think is that i have a recent the slide

605
00:31:55,659 --> 00:32:00,770
uh... relisted signed nineteen percent
almost sixty-two case that they had

606
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:05,129
so it just as a reminder decide these
about

607
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:09,950
six hundred thousand certificate that we
tossed it so i have a softer light we

608
00:32:09,950 --> 00:32:11,839
identified does it we could trust

609
00:32:11,839 --> 00:32:16,059
we continue to study on the bed that
sample because we know those were bodied

610
00:32:16,059 --> 00:32:20,200
and we know those results will be it
would be meaningful

611
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,230
so this is a set of the interesting
issue if we have four hundred

612
00:32:23,230 --> 00:32:25,070
twenty-nine issues

613
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:28,480
and that we only saw seventy eight
doston persuade there's a relationship

614
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:33,590
and maybe we can not now will be a lot
to raise the eloquence across campus

615
00:32:33,590 --> 00:32:34,590
actually

616
00:32:34,590 --> 00:32:39,039
have sobbed have delegated authority to
generate

617
00:32:39,039 --> 00:32:42,590
certificates and you can see if you had
the graph and you can see then that they

618
00:32:42,590 --> 00:32:46,549
are by far the largest number of state
our insurance

619
00:32:46,549 --> 00:32:47,590
hound from one

620
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:51,280
uh... trust and career which is only
going to go

621
00:32:51,280 --> 00:32:56,000
and we're here we have seen one hundred
sixty nine different certificate

622
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,450
authorities authorities leading back to
just one

623
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:04,080
adept adept at got stung kat and then
you have a couple of others such as

624
00:33:04,080 --> 00:33:04,769
sabotage

625
00:33:04,769 --> 00:33:08,849
and unity and having forty eight and
twenty nine

626
00:33:08,849 --> 00:33:11,299
allison delegated certificates

627
00:33:11,299 --> 00:33:14,100
authorities on

628
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:14,879
front from them

629
00:33:14,879 --> 00:33:19,379
so the thing is this is in the sample to
conduct on the certificates we did see

630
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:23,349
um and i'm guessing that that budget
director will have

631
00:33:23,349 --> 00:33:27,689
eight file lined a number of these
certificate authorities but they are

632
00:33:27,690 --> 00:33:32,650
probably very rarely using the on going
to see them once once you want

633
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:37,020
and the question is itself there are
many people when

634
00:33:37,020 --> 00:33:41,000
many of those who deal with exercise how
many das bankers do we need to

635
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,610
uh...

636
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:47,340
and i'm a bit calculations they can see
here that with having on the eleven th

637
00:33:47,340 --> 00:33:48,490
just anchors

638
00:33:48,490 --> 00:33:51,809
uh... you can cover about ninety percent

639
00:33:51,809 --> 00:33:55,100
on the six hundred thousand to keep is
that we

640
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:59,860
we looked at by having nineteenth the
twenty three dressed up as you go to

641
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:01,740
ninety nine point one percent

642
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:05,010
and the having forty delhi gota ninety
nine point five

643
00:34:05,010 --> 00:34:09,630
now this is of course very subjective
initiate recall our day to safety skewed

644
00:34:09,630 --> 00:34:13,970
towards global domain names so someone
in japan they have a different picture

645
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:16,370
someone in some other country perhaps

646
00:34:16,370 --> 00:34:20,850
people in in different countries will
have different kasagic and authorities

647
00:34:20,850 --> 00:34:23,109
that the u_s_ soldier did exactly

648
00:34:23,109 --> 00:34:28,728
neither usually so i i i went and into
the everyone of us will need to be doing

649
00:34:28,728 --> 00:34:33,649
and twenty eight ticketed authorities
the exact number may mayberry depending

650
00:34:33,649 --> 00:34:37,498
on which sites that site you these

651
00:34:37,498 --> 00:34:41,759
uh... from their here on the way we
start looking into is that the

652
00:34:41,759 --> 00:34:45,269
certification recently looking to the
protocols and the quality of the

653
00:34:45,268 --> 00:34:45,909
connection

654
00:34:45,909 --> 00:34:51,668
so and this is what i would go deeper
into into its as a silly idea last ham

655
00:34:51,668 --> 00:34:57,249
cell and implementing the martyr says
certificate ccs their keys and we're on

656
00:34:57,249 --> 00:35:00,790
the way most of these keys are using our
say

657
00:35:00,790 --> 00:35:02,620
acme and gary said all greet them

658
00:35:02,620 --> 00:35:07,598
and in fact left would have gone on
eatery certificates that uses idea set

659
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:11,469
the good news is that there is a dickey
size is usually good

660
00:35:11,469 --> 00:35:15,959
and my father the awb virtually all
certificates will use a key size of one

661
00:35:15,959 --> 00:35:19,359
hundred one thousand twenty forbids

662
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:21,499
then two thousand forty nbsp

663
00:35:21,499 --> 00:35:26,718
and is a very small number of size that
they actually use any of these alvaro

664
00:35:26,719 --> 00:35:27,789
are the numbers

665
00:35:27,789 --> 00:35:32,859
so we also milk if some of you may
recall in two thousand then seeks was a

666
00:35:32,859 --> 00:35:35,170
problem with the way

667
00:35:35,170 --> 00:35:39,210
certificates were generated in the day
to get debian property system and the

668
00:35:39,210 --> 00:35:43,839
problem was always going to a dozen
eighty which basically made all these

669
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:46,109
doors that lead to peace week

670
00:35:46,109 --> 00:35:51,139
and we have uncommon discover that there
is only about ninety nine of these left

671
00:35:51,139 --> 00:35:52,170
among the cast it

672
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:55,319
uh... size at this also that that

673
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:58,788
numbers is that the problem is pretty
much gone all-day interestingly there's

674
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:02,479
still some size who haven't really
replaced the certificates and they are

675
00:36:02,479 --> 00:36:07,069
still a very vulnerable and visit the
site as a cell doesnt doesn't work for

676
00:36:07,069 --> 00:36:09,459
them

677
00:36:09,459 --> 00:36:13,249
um looking for there is a support for
multiple domain names i'm mentioned

678
00:36:13,249 --> 00:36:15,009
earlier that um...

679
00:36:15,010 --> 00:36:18,549
there isn't a way to have virtual eh
cecil hosting

680
00:36:18,549 --> 00:36:23,380
and sold in the next best thing that is
session make your certificate devalued

681
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:26,919
for multiple domain names and their
multiple ways to do and that's why the

682
00:36:26,919 --> 00:36:29,419
steelers al wildcard cert

683
00:36:29,419 --> 00:36:30,690
ako in which case

684
00:36:30,690 --> 00:36:32,840
you have com

685
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:35,989
certificate its valued for any number
sub domains

686
00:36:35,989 --> 00:36:40,449
but there's also the alternative names
field which can contained any number of

687
00:36:40,449 --> 00:36:41,660
of domain names

688
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:44,749
and they can also be wild price too

689
00:36:44,749 --> 00:36:45,549
this

690
00:36:45,549 --> 00:36:49,210
feature this convicted he's going to be
abused as as you'll see later on

691
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:54,559
but give me a sense of the wildcard cert
only be used for those certificates just

692
00:36:54,559 --> 00:36:59,599
a week in the same or the department of
the same organization with same people

693
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:00,900
controlled the certificates

694
00:37:00,900 --> 00:37:02,729
because if you have

695
00:37:02,729 --> 00:37:05,169
departments using shamisen certificate

696
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:08,960
yahoo one department december the s_l_
connections of the of the otherwise so

697
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,759
you basically showed the trust

698
00:37:10,759 --> 00:37:14,989
which is you know some people are not
dotnet many people realize

699
00:37:14,989 --> 00:37:20,509
so we looked into the certificates most
i'm not only four point forty four

700
00:37:20,509 --> 00:37:24,229
percent obvious it if you're just a
while contact

701
00:37:24,229 --> 00:37:27,680
and most of these a wild card because
they want to be the common name

702
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:31,410
but one point sending two percent also
had the wild card in the alternative

703
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:32,589
names

704
00:37:32,589 --> 00:37:35,449
and most will have just um

705
00:37:35,449 --> 00:37:38,109
zero one or two on aids

706
00:37:38,109 --> 00:37:39,959
demands hound

707
00:37:39,959 --> 00:37:45,058
and there is deserve a small number of
suggestive if you have a ridiculously

708
00:37:45,059 --> 00:37:48,020
large number of alternative names

709
00:37:48,020 --> 00:37:50,009
so they can see on the top of the
earliest

710
00:37:50,009 --> 00:37:52,169
is one that has two hundred fifty two

711
00:37:52,169 --> 00:37:53,299
the maintenance

712
00:37:53,300 --> 00:37:57,549
and then that they're going to have one
hundred ninety one y fifty three

713
00:37:57,549 --> 00:38:01,499
but the problem that occurred in the
thus it is a good has made by the

714
00:38:01,499 --> 00:38:03,990
largest number is one that we've given
to us

715
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:07,459
has three hundred and fifty four
different domains

716
00:38:07,459 --> 00:38:10,678
so this is clearing up and abuse of the
system

717
00:38:10,679 --> 00:38:11,559
this

718
00:38:11,559 --> 00:38:16,369
visually having so many dominance in the
certificate apart in the shed tossed

719
00:38:16,369 --> 00:38:21,379
either the city tribune grows in size
and use your call increases overall size

720
00:38:21,379 --> 00:38:22,469
of the handshake

721
00:38:22,469 --> 00:38:25,039
and this was not slows down

722
00:38:25,039 --> 00:38:26,019
ability

723
00:38:26,019 --> 00:38:27,729
another very important thing

724
00:38:27,730 --> 00:38:32,420
is that on the thirty five boston twelve
percent of all certificates or actually

725
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:37,679
bodied for the domain name with and
without the w_w_w_ prefix

726
00:38:37,679 --> 00:38:40,999
and this is very important because
usually is technical people will like to

727
00:38:40,999 --> 00:38:46,348
say okay the domain name used w_w_w_ at
his own political however in real life

728
00:38:46,349 --> 00:38:49,659
what you get these people just by
putting these domain a swiss sometimes

729
00:38:49,659 --> 00:38:51,050
with sometimes without

730
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:55,439
so if you don't have a certificate is
supposed to bolt

731
00:38:55,439 --> 00:39:01,269
ryan's and your uses sometimes get
confused secession but only one-third

732
00:39:01,269 --> 00:39:04,979
almost like we all want to know the
certificates actually supports

733
00:39:04,979 --> 00:39:06,529
supports dates

734
00:39:06,529 --> 00:39:10,619
so if you are basically my advice in
this area would be furious purchase

735
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:14,219
initiative to get doesn't alter
certificate authorities it automatically

736
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:14,670
make

737
00:39:14,670 --> 00:39:19,719
i did a certificate spiteful for
watergate

738
00:39:19,719 --> 00:39:24,299
uh... on this side of habit of bad news
in this is a very hard to do a most

739
00:39:24,299 --> 00:39:26,430
disappointing a finding of the survey

740
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:31,169
which is that madhuwanti off of all soda
still support essential to

741
00:39:31,170 --> 00:39:36,769
and it's really sad ending because
winona decile to ease

742
00:39:36,769 --> 00:39:41,069
insecure for about fourteen years now
and i you you should think that the

743
00:39:41,069 --> 00:39:44,150
fourteen years is not for people to
realize it did they shouldn't really be

744
00:39:44,150 --> 00:39:46,019
running that's up to a point

745
00:39:46,019 --> 00:39:49,919
inaction on race prime section six and
sixty five percent

746
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,829
because we are also looking still

747
00:39:51,829 --> 00:39:56,039
even if you have as a sub to enable they
support then you get a simple cyprus

748
00:39:56,039 --> 00:39:57,059
where it's because

749
00:39:57,059 --> 00:39:59,780
if you don't support any of the cypress
trees

750
00:39:59,780 --> 00:40:01,700
stands up to connection cannot be

751
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:06,779
made so there's about twelve percent or
service that have absolutely no evil on

752
00:40:06,779 --> 00:40:08,310
the debt they do not

753
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:10,699
and have ended the cycle sweets

754
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:11,309
enabled

755
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:12,819
uh...

756
00:40:12,819 --> 00:40:16,949
the good news is rather with relatively
good news is that most service will

757
00:40:16,949 --> 00:40:21,189
support as a silk three mt less one
which are reasonably secure and not a

758
00:40:21,189 --> 00:40:26,749
bad news is that's off the virtually not
all nala service support keyless one

759
00:40:26,749 --> 00:40:29,859
point one appear d_o_s_ one point two

760
00:40:29,859 --> 00:40:34,098
delis one point one was that visa to the
darlings of two thousand six protocol

761
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:35,500
sonya four years now

762
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:38,450
jealous while going through the
three-year-old protocol and they had

763
00:40:38,450 --> 00:40:43,239
very good reasons why we have this
project was because they corrected

764
00:40:43,239 --> 00:40:46,060
certain problems with the with dealer
swapped

765
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:50,159
in particular keyless one point two is
action designed to solve

766
00:40:50,159 --> 00:40:56,379
the problem although the shops hashing
function being knocked out of it not

767
00:40:56,379 --> 00:41:00,439
being terribly secure and basically
needs to be phased out after after two

768
00:41:00,439 --> 00:41:02,038
thousand

769
00:41:02,039 --> 00:41:05,759
and the dead they're the best way to do
and issues that had to deploy to kill us

770
00:41:05,759 --> 00:41:07,259
one point two

771
00:41:07,259 --> 00:41:09,209
so what we have here he's

772
00:41:09,209 --> 00:41:13,239
you can see that the prodigal slips it
haha support we will depend pretty much

773
00:41:13,239 --> 00:41:15,299
of the principles that they implement
bite

774
00:41:15,299 --> 00:41:19,788
or do whatever issues by various
platforms as example open as a cell

775
00:41:19,789 --> 00:41:21,179
which is what products

776
00:41:21,179 --> 00:41:22,870
and the most popular library

777
00:41:22,870 --> 00:41:27,580
does not support u_s_ one point two and
i and we've done all went quite well

778
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:31,970
so we have the case where the security
of the overall system reiterated relies

779
00:41:31,970 --> 00:41:34,839
on the features open supported by

780
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,349
by uh... open operant itself

781
00:41:37,349 --> 00:41:40,960
should also mention that in determining
whether service supporters as soon as

782
00:41:40,960 --> 00:41:43,089
the support s_l_ too

783
00:41:43,089 --> 00:41:47,749
we also looked at those who were maybe a
cock septa nestled to connection

784
00:41:47,749 --> 00:41:51,448
but i want to use it to deliver user
friendly error message and not and

785
00:41:51,449 --> 00:41:53,130
refused to actually do anything

786
00:41:53,130 --> 00:41:56,380
and we did so those were not glassy
phrases

787
00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:01,189
supporting us up to a new password is
not supporting us

788
00:42:01,189 --> 00:42:05,308
then i don't think you know which side
frustration kitchen jihad crash

789
00:42:05,309 --> 00:42:06,769
functions for u_s_

790
00:42:06,769 --> 00:42:10,750
and you can see the triple bass and i
think for his old is then maybe

791
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:13,960
they still rule and this is going to be
is a good bye

792
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:18,330
are virtually full service on the
internet and down on the afterwards so

793
00:42:18,330 --> 00:42:19,990
the ninety nine percent

794
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:25,229
toll serviceable to people that's ninety
eight percent supported artsy fault and

795
00:42:25,230 --> 00:42:29,459
eddie s is only about stand on the dead
in the fourth place

796
00:42:29,459 --> 00:42:30,940
answer which about sixty

797
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:33,279
eight percent popularity

798
00:42:33,279 --> 00:42:37,119
which means that more than one student
id is running on these

799
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:42,330
holder sandwiches protocols on
algorithms attribute this to a secure

800
00:42:42,330 --> 00:42:47,239
we've got a key exchange i say he's it's
by far the most popular one

801
00:42:47,239 --> 00:42:50,709
but when this is doing to see support
for either artists as well

802
00:42:50,709 --> 00:42:52,009
uh...

803
00:42:52,009 --> 00:42:54,179
when it comes to hash functions

804
00:42:54,179 --> 00:43:00,369
ash size that it is uh... also very
popular and what is really worrying is

805
00:43:00,369 --> 00:43:04,389
we have seen almost no support support
any of the shock to a family

806
00:43:04,389 --> 00:43:08,400
and did the sidewalk and the e_c_'s
essentially deprecated

807
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:14,049
entryway need to move on and and stop
supporting it

808
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:15,200
in essence of service

809
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:18,120
however a dollop tips that will happen
quickly

810
00:43:18,120 --> 00:43:21,569
because from what we've seen so far

811
00:43:21,569 --> 00:43:25,929
uh... five percent is the next year
aspect we're looking to and i have been

812
00:43:25,929 --> 00:43:30,629
a good news here which is the most
servers actually support strong cypress

813
00:43:30,629 --> 00:43:34,219
uh... and most of support one hundred
twenty eight

814
00:43:34,219 --> 00:43:35,739
beating encryption

815
00:43:35,739 --> 00:43:38,259
and that our lives on a local support

816
00:43:38,259 --> 00:43:40,099
too high fifty six

817
00:43:40,099 --> 00:43:45,729
and say if you look under under derived
you can see that ninety nine

818
00:43:45,729 --> 00:43:47,448
actually nine service

819
00:43:47,449 --> 00:43:50,729
id na support behind twenty-eight
because

820
00:43:50,729 --> 00:43:53,859
va sixty-eight supported two hundred
fifty six

821
00:43:53,859 --> 00:43:57,459
and apartheid on the left will tell you
what the best

822
00:43:57,459 --> 00:43:58,439
strength

823
00:43:58,439 --> 00:43:59,839
and the best friend

824
00:43:59,840 --> 00:44:03,680
for the little lodge the largest number
of service sixteen percent restocking

825
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,779
fifty-six pits

826
00:44:04,779 --> 00:44:06,340
which is pretty good

827
00:44:06,340 --> 00:44:08,989
as originally i was supposed to aqua
twenty

828
00:44:08,989 --> 00:44:12,229
but those are does a good nu skin

829
00:44:12,229 --> 00:44:13,749
uh...

830
00:44:13,749 --> 00:44:19,390
mix is also the gun society st support
again we had three guests diplomats and

831
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:21,930
icy for the top of the list

832
00:44:21,930 --> 00:44:25,259
and what looked here is that there's a
there's a future

833
00:44:25,259 --> 00:44:26,270
uh...

834
00:44:26,270 --> 00:44:29,300
of seventy lestat allows

835
00:44:29,300 --> 00:44:33,969
service to take responsibility chillers
which cyprus which will be negotiated

836
00:44:33,969 --> 00:44:38,089
dot however it was disappointing to see
that the only a small number of who are

837
00:44:38,089 --> 00:44:41,549
out of a small number of almost forty
percent of service

838
00:44:41,549 --> 00:44:44,859
at the top of the opportunity to choose
and select

839
00:44:44,859 --> 00:44:46,970
which sockets which will be yours

840
00:44:46,970 --> 00:44:51,620
with the majority or sixty percent
actually would use the first serve

841
00:44:51,620 --> 00:44:55,058
offered to us for a cypress street off
the decline

842
00:44:55,059 --> 00:45:00,130
however more more angry are looking into
all of the big three chose to exercise

843
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:04,819
their choice and this or that they vote
into little explode parties

844
00:45:04,819 --> 00:45:07,300
we can see that they had a talk on the
list to have

845
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:10,620
too icy for cyprus cyprus which is which
are pretty good

846
00:45:10,620 --> 00:45:12,999
we have a triple best which is so-so

847
00:45:12,999 --> 00:45:16,558
and then she asked but was is a warning
that we have

848
00:45:16,559 --> 00:45:18,719
three cypress meets here

849
00:45:18,719 --> 00:45:19,670
that there

850
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:24,800
necmettin two-week you we have one
printer with just a fifty six b

851
00:45:24,800 --> 00:45:25,320
desecration

852
00:45:25,320 --> 00:45:29,630
and we have to look for their cypress
which which is suites which uses

853
00:45:29,630 --> 00:45:32,380
we can exchange and also use

854
00:45:32,380 --> 00:45:36,270
we can skip encryption so what is a
warning here is that this letter is

855
00:45:36,270 --> 00:45:38,989
actually actively choosing

856
00:45:38,989 --> 00:45:40,399
advent socket

857
00:45:40,399 --> 00:45:44,009
so what they need to conclude embed the
current

858
00:45:44,010 --> 00:45:48,460
at the moment it's actually better to
leave sophistry selection to clients

859
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:51,359
because what i've seen in this survey so
far

860
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:53,389
isabel venice actually

861
00:45:53,389 --> 00:45:56,820
five baghdad today choosing which
protocols

862
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:59,699
and which life-history some support

863
00:45:59,699 --> 00:46:06,699
how whereas server besides vendors not
as much bedevil basically support all

864
00:46:06,729 --> 00:46:07,490
particles

865
00:46:07,490 --> 00:46:10,330
because that's the easier for them for
interoperability

866
00:46:10,330 --> 00:46:12,689
because you have your default settings

867
00:46:12,689 --> 00:46:14,379
the support all political scene

868
00:46:14,380 --> 00:46:16,160
and support also i propose

869
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,779
does the death of the best for their
support wise

870
00:46:18,779 --> 00:46:23,149
but he'll best loss secure jewelers

871
00:46:23,149 --> 00:46:28,920
and sometimes and this is it just slide
which pains to sunrise

872
00:46:28,920 --> 00:46:31,470
the survey itself off

873
00:46:31,470 --> 00:46:36,609
and which is where we agreat riga
basically assess the consideration of

874
00:46:36,609 --> 00:46:39,989
this error and that you gave it a great
time

875
00:46:39,989 --> 00:46:44,109
and we discovered it's only about
one-third was less likely what thirty

876
00:46:44,109 --> 00:46:45,540
nine

877
00:46:45,540 --> 00:46:49,439
percent of all serves it will look at
are welcome to get

878
00:46:49,439 --> 00:46:53,598
and i reckon visa this service where
someone u

879
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:58,630
actually optimally looks at how did the
dep configured and make sure they are

880
00:46:58,630 --> 00:47:00,029
pretty good well

881
00:47:00,029 --> 00:47:06,229
and almost two-thirds on the internet we
have pretty badly configured as a sister

882
00:47:06,229 --> 00:47:06,718
this

883
00:47:06,719 --> 00:47:12,429
which are probably just running which
befalto default settings

884
00:47:12,429 --> 00:47:15,629
bridges work which is pretty
disappointed so this is that this is the

885
00:47:15,629 --> 00:47:16,460
point

886
00:47:16,460 --> 00:47:21,260
uh... of this is a service of what we
would like to do is identified these

887
00:47:21,260 --> 00:47:22,230
people to have

888
00:47:22,230 --> 00:47:24,069
that you can figure out a self-service

889
00:47:24,069 --> 00:47:27,110
and get them to to fix this because

890
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:28,969
it can take

891
00:47:28,969 --> 00:47:31,280
excellent though as hoskin allah

892
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:36,839
allosteric you identify a problem to
find a way i cisneros configured and

893
00:47:36,839 --> 00:47:39,069
reconfigured that you're you're
receiving a great

894
00:47:39,069 --> 00:47:43,239
we have actually had cases of people
have been invited to debate

895
00:47:43,239 --> 00:47:46,250
getting a certificate purchasing a
certificate

896
00:47:46,250 --> 00:47:50,100
reconfiguring there is a cell cycle
everything a hockey night getting a very

897
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:52,719
fragrant breakers call

898
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:54,789
i have about com

899
00:47:54,789 --> 00:47:58,919
i wanted to slides left again for
himself process

900
00:47:58,919 --> 00:48:00,190
uh...

901
00:48:00,190 --> 00:48:04,530
they slide in the discusses takes on
specific duties busy the cocking

902
00:48:04,530 --> 00:48:05,229
addresses sell

903
00:48:05,229 --> 00:48:10,229
i mentioned earlier on that the only way
forward sides to be really secure i

904
00:48:10,229 --> 00:48:12,098
still need to support

905
00:48:12,099 --> 00:48:16,609
as self what one hundred percent of the
content that they that they offer

906
00:48:16,609 --> 00:48:20,160
soda mom and at the moment almost the
best thing you can do if someone talk

907
00:48:20,160 --> 00:48:22,149
steel reports eighty eight

908
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:26,950
you'll have to sujatha redirect them to
the secure version of the site

909
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:29,689
and i think there was no single weakest
point

910
00:48:29,689 --> 00:48:31,069
if someone sends

911
00:48:31,069 --> 00:48:34,180
a linked to poisons eighty

912
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:37,100
if there's an active men in the middle

913
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:42,100
attacker their she can take that one
single economic review requests and high

914
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:45,009
jacket and use it to subrident i
connection

915
00:48:45,009 --> 00:48:47,939
and if you know the he can actually
drake

916
00:48:47,939 --> 00:48:49,810
unsuspecting users

917
00:48:49,810 --> 00:48:53,619
internet we're going to secure area
although of a website

918
00:48:53,619 --> 00:48:57,489
so there is this feature which is close
to a trusted security which is basically

919
00:48:57,489 --> 00:49:03,599
a way oklahoma websites saying i want to
want to support this s_l_ ocm dont u

920
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:05,410
inhibited gives instructions

921
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:11,319
filter browsers the never ever content
then i think it could be a besides uh...

922
00:49:11,320 --> 00:49:12,369
echo

923
00:49:12,369 --> 00:49:13,849
so

924
00:49:13,849 --> 00:49:15,469
once we have followed

925
00:49:15,469 --> 00:49:18,479
is that the among the stick six hundred
thousand

926
00:49:18,479 --> 00:49:19,448
city vikas

927
00:49:19,449 --> 00:49:24,089
on the twelve different sides supported
ivc class with security

928
00:49:24,089 --> 00:49:26,869
so went to bed to get out of the disease

929
00:49:26,869 --> 00:49:30,169
uh... how much people care about this
s_l_ today

930
00:49:30,169 --> 00:49:34,828
and that we have a long way to go before
the whole thing is is made executed

931
00:49:34,829 --> 00:49:37,889
my last line sweta survey results

932
00:49:37,889 --> 00:49:41,289
he's about securing a secure
renegotiation

933
00:49:41,289 --> 00:49:45,079
and the problem with security secure
renegotiation use the closest thing that

934
00:49:45,079 --> 00:49:49,779
we have a great weekend discovered this
applauding the in the protocols

935
00:49:49,779 --> 00:49:54,039
and it was the coon discovered taught
made obligate publicly announced a late

936
00:49:54,039 --> 00:49:55,640
last year

937
00:49:55,640 --> 00:49:57,719
and

938
00:49:57,719 --> 00:50:01,119
implementations correcting a bigger
implementations can begin to appear on

939
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:03,560
com about february this year

940
00:50:03,560 --> 00:50:06,839
so what we have discovered a visited
this time

941
00:50:06,839 --> 00:50:08,650
is not one-third

942
00:50:08,650 --> 00:50:13,369
thirty-two two percent of all sides are
still vulnerable three if we want to be

943
00:50:13,369 --> 00:50:19,299
stis particular problem because this is
supporting secure renegotiation

944
00:50:19,299 --> 00:50:23,069
because i'd conducted several studies
have shown a period of couple months i

945
00:50:23,069 --> 00:50:24,659
can't get it

946
00:50:24,659 --> 00:50:29,309
asset is a copy attached at the rate of
about four percent a month

947
00:50:29,309 --> 00:50:33,819
com so if you look at this this charts
is not good but i'm going to be is going

948
00:50:33,819 --> 00:50:37,959
to be at least six months before all
this is a pact will this probably never

949
00:50:37,959 --> 00:50:40,279
also there's a problem that we're going
to be part of it

950
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:44,710
is going to be at least six months maybe
to a year before we arrived to resume

951
00:50:44,710 --> 00:50:46,709
the secure state

952
00:50:46,709 --> 00:50:51,538
so that the other server spider did not
support renegotiation which is also

953
00:50:51,539 --> 00:50:55,799
secure if you can afford to turn it off
paul did not all sides ken

954
00:50:55,799 --> 00:50:58,099
and about twenty percent

955
00:50:58,099 --> 00:51:04,259
uh... twenty percent of sites actually
supports secure renegotiation

956
00:51:04,259 --> 00:51:09,829
so they seem to be ended and those were
the results of online my study i have a

957
00:51:09,829 --> 00:51:11,859
conclusion slide

958
00:51:11,859 --> 00:51:14,859
with a couple toss that i want to leave
you with it

959
00:51:14,859 --> 00:51:19,690
which is basically the good news is that
virtually all deployment support good

960
00:51:19,690 --> 00:51:21,020
case sizes

961
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:22,690
goats particles

962
00:51:22,690 --> 00:51:24,579
and good cypress

963
00:51:24,579 --> 00:51:29,030
the bad news is that most people on a
statue support better articles

964
00:51:29,030 --> 00:51:32,269
becky size is indicated that the
business office was

965
00:51:32,269 --> 00:51:36,618
after fourteen years we still have a
cecil at those deployed

966
00:51:36,619 --> 00:51:40,520
and even more worrying great we
endorsing people adopting new protocols

967
00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:43,079
which means it may be no you've gone

968
00:51:43,079 --> 00:51:44,300
refine the cells

969
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:48,520
using a serious problem and maybe we
said a friend in the sky reasonably

970
00:51:48,520 --> 00:51:50,410
securities maybe into shop

971
00:51:50,410 --> 00:51:54,560
thuggery tum we may find it quite a
large number of but serviceable ballroom

972
00:51:54,560 --> 00:51:56,949
two different difference approx

973
00:51:56,949 --> 00:52:01,010
so in many cases really long time for a
service to be would be better

974
00:52:01,010 --> 00:52:04,410
long term i think i'm biggest boating
with missus owns the lack of support for

975
00:52:04,410 --> 00:52:06,009
a virtual

976
00:52:06,009 --> 00:52:08,099
and virtualized sela hosting

977
00:52:08,099 --> 00:52:11,099
and i think that's that that's great
sahara build-up

978
00:52:11,099 --> 00:52:12,720
it prevents

979
00:52:12,720 --> 00:52:17,439
as a silk test to spread for their own
homes that are not as a web site

980
00:52:17,439 --> 00:52:21,669
and at the same so that i think that
this final conclusion of the studies is

981
00:52:21,669 --> 00:52:22,480
so much

982
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:26,289
on the security configuration depends on
the default

983
00:52:26,289 --> 00:52:29,819
configuration that then those sheep with
and that we have to find ways to

984
00:52:29,819 --> 00:52:34,179
motivate then to shift would better
before concentrations and we had to find

985
00:52:34,179 --> 00:52:35,790
ways to motivate

986
00:52:35,790 --> 00:52:39,120
alli berry implement implement imprint
datas

987
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:43,269
two sheep would better protocols in the
civil debate books

988
00:52:43,269 --> 00:52:44,788
uh...

989
00:52:44,789 --> 00:52:49,739
anyway to sum up this is just the first
step in our study

990
00:52:49,739 --> 00:52:53,369
then we we've covered most of the staff
who wanted to cover but we would be the

991
00:52:53,369 --> 00:52:56,609
best they continued to conduct we
studied

992
00:52:56,609 --> 00:53:00,120
i would say at least one c l_ word on
hold me

993
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:04,740
under and this is one thing that we want
to improve in the future there's one

994
00:53:04,740 --> 00:53:10,430
area where whale won't let which we want
to look at deepa is to see how many

995
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:12,560
sides local regulars

996
00:53:12,560 --> 00:53:14,009
deployed partial s itself

997
00:53:14,009 --> 00:53:17,919
and that is by far the most serious
polyester still today if you have a side

998
00:53:17,919 --> 00:53:19,310
that uses

999
00:53:19,310 --> 00:53:20,999
blank techniques as plain text

1000
00:53:20,999 --> 00:53:26,879
uh... areas with as a cell areas on the
site some sites even in the same page

1001
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:28,970
also the problem in the secure cookies

1002
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:33,080
so for that part of the surveyor will
have to crawl all these websites

1003
00:53:33,080 --> 00:53:37,339
which will probably do on a much smaller
scale but it will take along while

1004
00:53:37,339 --> 00:53:41,689
and the good news is not at all this
research data that we've gathered we

1005
00:53:41,689 --> 00:53:45,868
intend to share and make available to do
research community so he's day want to

1006
00:53:45,869 --> 00:53:48,940
run their own careers again to decide
databases

1007
00:53:48,940 --> 00:53:53,220
big they can actually did that day so
they can go their their own kam

1008
00:53:53,220 --> 00:53:55,419
conclusions

1009
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:58,119
and um... that's about it for me today

1010
00:53:58,119 --> 00:54:05,119
if you have any questions i have about
some five minutes bison

1011
00:54:09,229 --> 00:54:16,229
six thousand eight hundred twenty

1012
00:54:29,289 --> 00:54:33,189
does a certificate so we looked into med
the netscape implement that half of our

1013
00:54:33,189 --> 00:54:34,839
and to microsoft once

1014
00:54:34,839 --> 00:54:38,819
and on a five percent of the city to be
supported it uh... supported it we can't

1015
00:54:38,819 --> 00:54:45,819
guess the actual hombre process

1016
00:54:57,499 --> 00:55:01,428
world in the bed one son and and and and
and that was so bad about the cause of

1017
00:55:01,429 --> 00:55:03,969
dollars of discontent

1018
00:55:03,969 --> 00:55:07,079
then the question was about which party
cause a grueling which but it was a bad

1019
00:55:07,079 --> 00:55:10,799
and the bad ones that have not already
missus and it's time to discover that

1020
00:55:10,799 --> 00:55:14,819
divide ways in which they are very
specific ways and that there were eight

1021
00:55:14,819 --> 00:55:16,270
anyway drink in the summer of two

1022
00:55:16,270 --> 00:55:20,460
so fringes our news article because they
may be weeks is well if we don't know i

1023
00:55:20,460 --> 00:55:23,710
get and as measured in the way i would
suit could affect the political center

1024
00:55:23,710 --> 00:55:27,680
way all particles are are eventually
going to be found to be secure and so we

1025
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:34,680
just have to keep moving on and i'm
going to bed to medical schools

1026
00:55:49,809 --> 00:55:52,239
uh...

1027
00:55:52,239 --> 00:55:55,739
then the question i was about to whether
they were different seating

1028
00:55:55,739 --> 00:55:58,880
configuration between different vendors
we haven't talked into it

1029
00:55:58,880 --> 00:56:02,270
it's very difficult to reliably it's a
minefield first of all

1030
00:56:02,270 --> 00:56:06,830
the second of all is said to come to
rely on late identified which i'm pretty

1031
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:10,299
systems in which libraries in which
servers are actually running because if

1032
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:12,699
you gal configure differently

1033
00:56:12,699 --> 00:56:16,480
so we have collected the identifying
information will prove what the current

1034
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,129
and we also intend to fingerprints

1035
00:56:19,129 --> 00:56:22,839
uh... each of the engines running so we
could have more reliable data

1036
00:56:22,839 --> 00:56:25,990
but honestly i don't have anything in
the moment don't know how would be happy

1037
00:56:25,990 --> 00:56:32,990
to to release

1038
00:56:44,719 --> 00:56:48,919
many but do you have generated apaches
use the open as i said it is very very

1039
00:56:48,919 --> 00:56:51,749
very swept service and possibly in
different ways

1040
00:56:51,749 --> 00:56:55,819
so we could intimidate unfair we do a
lot of our version of pak jim anyways

1041
00:56:55,819 --> 00:56:59,189
distributional project so apache running
a red hats will be could be good for you

1042
00:56:59,189 --> 00:57:03,428
know i work one way are joining the
debbie in another way so then this one

1043
00:57:03,429 --> 00:57:05,880
in the numbers will stop making many
making any sense

1044
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:12,880
so that's why we chose not to going to
get me started to this time

1045
00:57:21,139 --> 00:57:25,819
you add the security redemption shimizu
has a kill us what has been fixed

1046
00:57:25,819 --> 00:57:32,819
said today that the aid that they want
to get issue has been patched

1047
00:57:37,759 --> 00:57:41,289
is it's a patch so the american taxi
robert ng system and then you get over

1048
00:57:41,289 --> 00:57:48,289
the best that argument

1049
00:57:49,139 --> 00:57:53,159
altman has a has been passed for
securing negotiation

1050
00:57:53,159 --> 00:57:55,150
however not all

1051
00:57:55,150 --> 00:57:58,000
the ceilings distributions for example
have

1052
00:57:58,000 --> 00:58:02,520
use the patched sold to the best of my
knowledge in debian your steel he's

1053
00:58:02,520 --> 00:58:04,469
still contest be secure

1054
00:58:04,469 --> 00:58:11,469
i think you can read how clinics and so
on so far

1055
00:58:17,749 --> 00:58:19,488
uh...

1056
00:58:19,489 --> 00:58:23,799
most platforms ended their initial
response because it was six months

1057
00:58:23,799 --> 00:58:24,609
before

1058
00:58:24,609 --> 00:58:25,239
we had

1059
00:58:25,239 --> 00:58:29,029
a solution for this bone because the icy
had to be

1060
00:58:29,029 --> 00:58:34,629
return ended their solution has to be
kasi tho committee had to come up with a

1061
00:58:34,629 --> 00:58:38,569
solution so the first action was to
disable rendition

1062
00:58:38,570 --> 00:58:43,180
however there's a very small numbers of
side-effects rely on renegotiation

1063
00:58:43,180 --> 00:58:48,100
usually they support varying degrees
varying degrees of security and hoping

1064
00:58:48,100 --> 00:58:50,000
to get you in the same sites

1065
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,030
it is a political as a key figures they
do need the negotiations have deferred

1066
00:58:54,030 --> 00:58:57,720
and there's no other way what i think
i'm a large majority of size can just

1067
00:58:57,720 --> 00:58:59,759
disable negotiation said

1068
00:58:59,759 --> 00:59:03,879
eyes should also say that we are only
able to pay for client initiated to

1069
00:59:03,879 --> 00:59:08,819
renegotiate should and is there's also
also members which is not possible to

1070
00:59:08,819 --> 00:59:11,999
test for

1071
00:59:11,999 --> 00:59:14,488
okay thank you very much for being here
i hope you enjoyed it
