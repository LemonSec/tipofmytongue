1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,180
ok so today basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm going to talk</font>

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:07,500
to you guys about things I've seen in

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:09,599
the semiconductor industry over the past

4
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,910
15 years I've reversed engineered

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,099
several hundred different devices over

6
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,619
you know from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the early 90's till today</font>

7
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:18,990
actually it's almost 20 years i<font color="#CCCCCC"> guess</font>

8
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:21,330
but who's counting and so I'm I just

9
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,759
<font color="#CCCCCC">thought I'd</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> sit down and and show</font>

10
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,470
everybody like some some some things

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,630
that I've come<font color="#E5E5E5"> across meshes things like</font>

12
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:29,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">this before the meshes the things the</font>

13
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:32,729
way things used to be into the way

14
00:00:29,340 --> 00:00:34,980
things are today and it's interesting

15
00:00:32,729 --> 00:00:38,669
because things haven't changed that much

16
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:41,099
but they've changed enough that it's it

17
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,110
is different<font color="#E5E5E5"> but yet when if you're if</font>

18
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:44,610
you're involved from it on a daily basis

19
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:47,160
you realize that<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's not</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> much</font>

20
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:50,789
different but it would<font color="#CCCCCC"> look it from the</font>

21
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:53,519
outside you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know for you know</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in it the</font>

22
00:00:50,789 --> 00:00:55,170
introduction<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the analysis so you get</font>

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:56,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">involved in it and then you realize it's</font>

24
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:00,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">not much different</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> than it was but it's</font>

25
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,680
smaller so at the end of the slides I'm

26
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:04,080
going to go through some slides with you

27
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,210
guys and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then when it's all done well I</font>

28
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,400
was told by all you guys last<font color="#E5E5E5"> night that</font>

29
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:12,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">you want to see porn so I have about 100</font>

30
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:15,600
gigs of it and it drives right here so

31
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:18,750
we can you know and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> really porn but</font>

32
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,939
you know chips oh<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay I want to thank</font>

33
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,740
you too for for coming<font color="#E5E5E5"> this late and the</font>

34
00:01:20,939 --> 00:01:26,008
day because it's been<font color="#E5E5E5"> a long day for a</font>

35
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:27,600
lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of us so and at the end of this if</font>

36
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:29,490
you could fill out your feedback card

37
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:32,158
because black hat I never get any

38
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,600
<font color="#E5E5E5">feedback from these talks and so I know</font>

39
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,770
I'll forget to tell you at the end of

40
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,589
this I wanted<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> tell you at the</font>

41
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:40,649
<font color="#CCCCCC">beginning of this so who here works with</font>

42
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:43,350
semiconductors everybody almost<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay</font>

43
00:01:40,650 --> 00:01:46,619
embedded smart card or just like

44
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:51,329
microcontrollers what kind of what kind

45
00:01:46,619 --> 00:01:55,829
somebody you design them you design

46
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:58,850
micro processors<font color="#CCCCCC"> asics nice nice what</font>

47
00:01:55,829 --> 00:01:58,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">process do</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys use</font>

48
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:06,860
no no no not<font color="#CCCCCC"> the fat but what size like</font>

49
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:08,090
90 nanometer nice nice today I'll take

50
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:10,369
you to 90 that's as low as we're going

51
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:11,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">to go we could go to 45 or 32 but I</font>

52
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:13,970
don't I don't I have never seen a smart

53
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:15,230
card that low yet but I'm sure they're

54
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:17,030
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come sooner or later because</font>

55
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:18,560
everybody uses like you said they're

56
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:21,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">fabless a lot of these places</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> today so</font>

57
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,970
they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to TSMC and TMC and and</font>

58
00:02:21,290 --> 00:02:26,569
they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> got the process down pretty pat</font>

59
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:28,700
so in the past there weren't really any

60
00:02:26,569 --> 00:02:32,030
security challenges if you could<font color="#E5E5E5"> put a</font>

61
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:34,579
needle on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bus which was humongous</font>

62
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:37,790
we're<font color="#E5E5E5"> talking over a micron in the 80s</font>

63
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:40,880
things were 3 micron 10 micron and moss

64
00:02:37,790 --> 00:02:43,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">p moss things weren't even CMOS back</font>

65
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:45,140
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so the geometries are so huge</font>

66
00:02:43,489 --> 00:02:47,239
you didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> even need things like like</font>

67
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:48,679
like what I'm discussing here below you

68
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:50,420
know a probe you needed a probe<font color="#E5E5E5"> station</font>

69
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:53,209
yes but you didn't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> need an</font>

70
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:55,069
optical microscope you could use a you

71
00:02:53,209 --> 00:02:57,410
did a good optical microscope you could

72
00:02:55,069 --> 00:02:59,420
use a very cheap dark field type

73
00:02:57,410 --> 00:03:03,230
microscope because everything the wire

74
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:05,720
sizes were<font color="#CCCCCC"> humungous any wire size that</font>

75
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:07,940
was above<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 micron you didn't even</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

76
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,940
a laser cutter laser cutter is going to

77
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:13,069
be good from about a<font color="#CCCCCC"> large scale chip</font>

78
00:03:10,940 --> 00:03:16,160
above a micron down to about 350

79
00:03:13,069 --> 00:03:19,100
nanometers if the wire size has some

80
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,079
space in other words if there's some

81
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:22,970
separation between the track if their

82
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:27,290
tracks are tight your lasers going to

83
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:28,880
probably short two tracks out so back in

84
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:30,888
the 80s in the 90s you could get away

85
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:33,620
with a very cheap probe station who here

86
00:03:30,889 --> 00:03:35,810
saw my DEFCON presentation in 2008 where

87
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:38,450
we probed bus<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay we put a single</font>

88
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:41,209
needle on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the data bus I think it was d0</font>

89
00:03:38,450 --> 00:03:44,328
<font color="#E5E5E5">the least significant bit of an 8051 and</font>

90
00:03:41,209 --> 00:03:48,019
with one glitch we made the loop repeat

91
00:03:44,329 --> 00:03:51,170
256 times to spill<font color="#E5E5E5"> ram or to spill the</font>

92
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:56,959
infineon CMS some some extra data's and

93
00:03:51,170 --> 00:04:00,290
so it's a it that was a makeshift probe

94
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,299
station you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> I used a tape to hold</font>

95
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:05,690
in the micro positioner in place and

96
00:04:02,299 --> 00:04:08,030
then<font color="#E5E5E5"> I used a Velcro for the actual the</font>

97
00:04:05,690 --> 00:04:10,310
landing area to hold<font color="#E5E5E5"> that down so I mean</font>

98
00:04:08,030 --> 00:04:11,600
you you can make<font color="#E5E5E5"> things out of anything</font>

99
00:04:10,310 --> 00:04:15,080
almost<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the</font>

100
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,519
work with the old stuff so anybody did

101
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,130
<font color="#E5E5E5">you know I don't know if you're aware of</font>

102
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:20,329
this but most people out here that read

103
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:24,110
these data sheets they trust the

104
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:26,210
manufacturers so st tells you oh I we

105
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:27,980
run on the internal clock we never come

106
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:32,239
we never begin on the outside clock and

107
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:34,790
we scramble the<font color="#E5E5E5"> buses scrambled fetches</font>

108
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,100
are encrypted from rom or etc etc etc

109
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:38,780
half the time this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is BS at smoke and</font>

110
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:41,780
mirrors and i like to say they're

111
00:04:38,780 --> 00:04:44,570
peddling snake oil and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> STI said st</font>

112
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:45,770
because st is famous for this st today

113
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:47,270
will tell you that they've encrypted

114
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:48,710
their rom and really what they've done

115
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:50,539
is they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> done an</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ex or against a</font>

these chips is usually very simplistic

139
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:55,790
to bypass it studs you know today in the

1978 right there boom 8051 if you didn't

145
00:06:06,830 --> 00:06:12,320
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it was today</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> they run on most</font>

146
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:14,420
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the time pure logic so it's a it's a</font>

147
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:17,390
pure logic implementation of a CPU

148
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:18,330
design and it's good but it still needs

149
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:20,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">improvement</font>

150
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:22,020
and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get into the we'll get into</font>

151
00:06:20,009 --> 00:06:25,379
that a little bit later does anybody

152
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:26,669
have questions so far<font color="#CCCCCC"> no I don't know</font>

153
00:06:25,379 --> 00:06:30,000
why but every time I speak i'm very

154
00:06:26,669 --> 00:06:32,849
nervous so I'm losing my<font color="#E5E5E5"> thought so</font>

155
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:41,310
anyway<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay so what makes a device</font>

156
00:06:32,849 --> 00:06:45,150
secure anybody okay<font color="#E5E5E5"> Master implanted</font>

157
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:47,099
ramen yeah you know contents lack of

158
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:49,289
public documentation half the time they

159

an NDA to get the documents microchip

165
00:07:00,569 --> 00:07:07,289
I'm sorry not microchip Phillips nxp has

166
00:07:04,650 --> 00:07:09,599
these for their little transponder ICS

167
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:10,860
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically try to control the</font>

168
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:13,800
distribution of the documents and

169
00:07:10,860 --> 00:07:15,599
therefore I guess it adds a level of

170
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,849
security and it does to a certain extent

171
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:19,620
<font color="#CCCCCC">but it's not if I can get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

172
00:07:17,849 --> 00:07:22,110
documents when I have no business having

173
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:24,629
these documents then obviously that's

174
00:07:22,110 --> 00:07:29,729
not a direction that they should rely on

175
00:07:24,629 --> 00:07:33,000
they don't typically use a standard

176

<font color="#CCCCCC">bootloader to load these memories for</font>

186
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:56,940
these chips end up on the surplus market

193
00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:19,770
i think like 200 SLE 66 in PE infineon

243 pieces of Anne Thompson

198
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:36,750
TPM device so i think<font color="#E5E5E5"> thompson will be</font>

199
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:38,219
next but<font color="#E5E5E5"> we'll see so so what do you</font>

200
00:08:36,750 --> 00:08:40,650
guys think this is an off-the-shelf

201
00:08:38,219 --> 00:08:42,539
micro is<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's secure because i just want</font>

202
00:08:40,650 --> 00:08:44,699
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> give you guys some examples here like</font>

203
00:08:42,539 --> 00:08:48,839
here's an<font color="#CCCCCC"> ad Mel this is an 18 mega to 2</font>

204
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:52,650
50 60 so 2560 it's got<font color="#CCCCCC"> 10 or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 56k of</font>

205
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:55,350
kilobytes of flash sesame prom and it's

206
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:59,670
it's it's pretty nice<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean but do you</font>

207
00:08:55,350 --> 00:09:04,529
guys think it's secure nobody okay well

208
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:06,180
you have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to wait till the end so in the</font>

209
00:09:04,529 --> 00:09:08,130
really really<font color="#E5E5E5"> old days you could</font>

210
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:10,050
literally see the rom bits on some roms

211
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:11,820
if they were masked it just depends what

212
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,380
metal layer how they designed the rom

213
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:18,240
and what metal layer the rom bits were

214
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:20,339
visible on on so here you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

215
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,190
this picture<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can read this out like</font>

216
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:28,110
like a book in these columns let me let

217
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:31,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">me open this to a larger picture does</font>

218
00:09:28,110 --> 00:09:33,210
this is an okidata 8051 from like 1985

219
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:36,240
but it's just to give you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys like you</font>

220
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:38,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">know some examples here so out of you</font>

221
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:41,310
are the column decoders and basically

222
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:44,010
the all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> d0 bits of this rom come out</font>

223
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:46,380
of the first did come out there's 32

224
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:50,040
across 32 of these small these are these

225
00:09:46,380 --> 00:09:53,130
small tees and so every forties

226
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:55,230
represents one bit wait so so these

227
00:09:53,130 --> 00:09:59,310
forties let me see if i can highlight

228
00:09:55,230 --> 00:10:02,580
this everything he ups all done

229
00:09:59,310 --> 00:10:05,099
everything from here down basically

230
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:06,930
represents d0 depending what address

231
00:10:05,100 --> 00:10:08,850
here at in the rum and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> everything</font>

232
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:11,640
on this next these next four represented

233
00:10:08,850 --> 00:10:13,740
d1 and then so forth across it but as

234
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:16,170
you can see using using a technique

235
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:19,440
called on an optical microscope scope

236
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:20,520
called dark field<font color="#E5E5E5"> i can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> bend the</font>

237
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:23,459
light in such a way that it actually

238
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:25,020
accents the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ROM bits and so you can see</font>

239
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:28,469
clearly I don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> which way it went</font>

240
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:30,209
if it was if a solid was one or solid

241
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:32,700
was<font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 just depends how the ROM was</font>

242
00:10:30,209 --> 00:10:34,619
designed but with today's computers you

243
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:36,120
can you can just translate this table

244
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:37,709
<font color="#CCCCCC">any way</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can play</font>

245
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">with it in software to figure you know</font>

246
00:10:37,709 --> 00:10:42,520
to understand you know it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> in 8051 so</font>

247
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:44,650
your software can can deduce

248
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:46,420
what these bits you know flip them flip

249
00:10:44,650 --> 00:10:49,870
the state<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> write recorded it as</font>

250
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:54,849
or don't and so it's a it's pretty cool

251
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:57,310
good old skies period seven anybody here

252
00:10:54,850 --> 00:10:59,830
from the UK from from England or Europe

253
00:10:57,310 --> 00:11:01,209
anybody here into like satellite

254
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:05,890
television from over there in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> past</font>

255
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:08,080
so in like nineteen ninety-two company

256
00:11:05,890 --> 00:11:10,660
called nds out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> Israel hoist org for</font>

257
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:13,840
produces this chip for Rupert Murdoch's

258
00:11:10,660 --> 00:11:15,280
<font color="#CCCCCC">Sky Broadcasting System and so just this</font>

259
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:18,730
is just<font color="#CCCCCC"> to give you an example of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

260
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:22,270
secure smart card from 1993 1991<font color="#E5E5E5"> maybe</font>

261
00:11:18,730 --> 00:11:23,740
that that uh where's the security<font color="#E5E5E5"> really</font>

262
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:25,390
because the only thing that made this

263
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:27,700
secure was the fact that it had a mask

264
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:29,680
ROM so<font color="#CCCCCC"> that means that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ND has designed</font>

265
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:32,080
the ROM simulated it sent it off for

266
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:35,260
production by motorola this was known as

267
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:40,000
a whoops hold on a second this was known

268
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:41,620
as a 68 HCL 5 SC 24 it's basically any

269
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,600
chip that<font color="#E5E5E5"> they produce that had a mask</font>

270
00:11:41,620 --> 00:11:46,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">ROM and no type of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> boot loader to load</font>

271
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,280
it was called an SC series and they made

272
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:50,020
several different ones so<font color="#CCCCCC"> you had five</font>

273
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:53,560
major pads on this chip let me<font color="#E5E5E5"> open it</font>

274
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:55,120
again large and you<font color="#E5E5E5"> guys are welcome to</font>

275
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,550
<font color="#E5E5E5">all these pictures I'll zip them up and</font>

276
00:11:55,120 --> 00:12:00,100
when I return home<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll throw them throw</font>

277
00:11:57,550 --> 00:12:03,189
them up on fly logic net and if you want

278
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:06,160
if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> want them just I guess email me</font>

279
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:08,290
and I'll I'd be more<font color="#CCCCCC"> than happy so you</font>

280
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,360
can see here clearly the bond pads but

281
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:12,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">there's extra bond pads so I don't</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">the security here you've got this is VCC</font>

00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:18,310
this is reset and this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> your clock now</font>

284
00:12:16,390 --> 00:12:19,720
these pads are abnormal and I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think it's</font>

285
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:22,780
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> they assume that the people that</font>

286
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:25,750
would actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> aluminum wedge bond that</font>

287
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:27,730
this package were retarded or something

288
00:12:25,750 --> 00:12:29,770
because I don't understand why they have

289
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:31,750
make different pads than than the others

290
00:12:29,770 --> 00:12:33,880
but they've brought pretty much the

291
00:12:31,750 --> 00:12:35,740
whole bus of the internal outside right

292
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:38,320
here so all of these pads were

293
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:39,460
technically if Yuri bonded them out you

294
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:40,990
could you could see the whole program

295
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:46,180
memory running in the outside world

296
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:47,920
without a probe station you know so in

297
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:50,290
down down here you have the ground and

298
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:51,729
you've got the<font color="#E5E5E5"> IO line very basic smart</font>

299
00:12:50,290 --> 00:12:53,980
card from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the old</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> days this chip got</font>

300
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:55,640
hacked very fast everybody was watching

301
00:12:53,980 --> 00:12:57,530
sky for free that

302
00:12:55,640 --> 00:13:02,689
and it was there was these were good

303
00:12:57,530 --> 00:13:07,220
times now I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't condemn it but I know</font>

304
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:08,840
it I don't I don't promote it so it<font color="#E5E5E5"> was</font>

305
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:10,220
very it was gray there though is<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

306
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,420
know<font color="#E5E5E5"> couldn't get a subscription but the</font>

307
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:14,270
signal came in their yard kind of like

308
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:16,699
Canada in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> States</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see down</font>

309
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:18,319
here and jumping<font color="#E5E5E5"> around because half of</font>

310
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,480
you guys have<font color="#E5E5E5"> never even seen it chip</font>

311
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,190
possibly so I'm trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go slow and</font>

312
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:24,830
take this from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> beginning</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the to</font>

313
00:13:22,190 --> 00:13:27,050
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> to to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> today the early early days</font>

314
00:13:24,830 --> 00:13:28,700
till today<font color="#E5E5E5"> but you can see here what</font>

315
00:13:27,050 --> 00:13:32,180
you're looking at here basically eight

316
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:36,140
instruction register latches and so

317
00:13:32,180 --> 00:13:38,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">basically these work like a 74 HC 573</font>

318
00:13:36,140 --> 00:13:42,050
anybody work with that type of a TTL

319
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:44,540
logic device yeah so you have a gate

320
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:46,189
that controls the the latch and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

321
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:47,719
transparent when it's high and when it

322
00:13:46,190 --> 00:13:50,000
goes low it holds whatever value was

323
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:54,080
presented so you can see the data bus is

324
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,570
coming in here give it<font color="#CCCCCC"> a second here</font>

325
00:13:54,080 --> 00:13:59,900
good old this is an SSD<font color="#CCCCCC"> Drive and it's</font>

326
00:13:56,570 --> 00:14:01,190
so slow so right<font color="#CCCCCC"> here you've got the</font>

327
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:04,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">data bus coming in and you can see what</font>

328
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:08,060
the vs plugged down you got 0 1 2 3 4<font color="#E5E5E5"> 5</font>

329
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:10,069
6<font color="#E5E5E5"> and 7 8 bits so thin theory if you sit</font>

330
00:14:08,060 --> 00:14:11,900
on this you this is where you know

331
00:14:10,070 --> 00:14:13,640
you'll see the actual opcode being

332
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:15,500
fetched and you'll see<font color="#CCCCCC"> that some of the</font>

333
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:16,430
data bytes to you won't see all of them

334
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,530
though because of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the way the von</font>

335
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:22,280
Neumann architecture was was it was

336
00:14:18,530 --> 00:14:24,980
designed into this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so if you if you</font>

337
00:14:22,280 --> 00:14:27,199
think about it you can use two needles

338
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:33,590
to dump this chip anybody have any ideas

339
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:36,320
how anybody you can use one on the latch

340
00:14:33,590 --> 00:14:38,570
gate clock and you can use one that

341
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:41,240
walks the data bus so you put one needle

342
00:14:38,570 --> 00:14:42,650
down on the latch<font color="#CCCCCC"> and when when the</font>

343
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:46,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">timing is right</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that you see a nun</font>

344
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:47,990
instruction that says like<font color="#E5E5E5"> fetch your op</font>

345
00:14:46,190 --> 00:14:49,670
code and then<font color="#CCCCCC"> the next</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clock cycle it</font>

346
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:51,830
says fetch your next stop code it's

347
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:53,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">perfect so in two clock cycles you get</font>

348
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:55,580
to opcodes fetched now that's not really

349
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:58,069
the case on the old 6805 s because I

350
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:59,840
they had a<font color="#E5E5E5"> divided by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> two and I don't</font>

351
00:14:58,070 --> 00:15:01,640
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> any instructions ran in one or</font>

352
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:03,110
<font color="#CCCCCC">even two clock cycles but you could</font>

353
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:05,030
definitely get an instruction that we're

354
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:06,440
in and say three clock cycles so then

355
00:15:05,030 --> 00:15:07,430
you get this pattern when you spill the

356
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:10,520
beans that

357
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:12,859
basically is up coat up code space up

358
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:15,860
caught up code space in a basically a

359
00:15:12,860 --> 00:15:17,930
linear rip a sequential read out and

360
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:19,130
this technique still works today what

361
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:21,020
I'm talking about<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean there's really</font>

362
00:15:19,130 --> 00:15:22,880
no way<font color="#CCCCCC"> for these guys to prevent someone</font>

363
00:15:21,020 --> 00:15:25,699
like myself from breaking into their

364
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:28,640
chip and hijacking the entire virtually

365
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:31,370
mapped code space let's say 64 bits like

366
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:36,140
a standard architecture and making it

367
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:40,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">just spill itself to me questions okay</font>

368
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:45,890
so we have 58 minutes keep me in check

369
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:48,470
or I'll never get done so go a little

370
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:49,339
little later in time now gsm says well

371
00:15:48,470 --> 00:15:51,589
we want you<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> make some changes</font>

372
00:15:49,339 --> 00:15:54,200
<font color="#E5E5E5">motorola says well we actually made some</font>

373
00:15:51,589 --> 00:15:56,540
changes for nds for the sky period<font color="#CCCCCC"> 9</font>

374
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:58,100
card and I did not<font color="#E5E5E5"> shit I'm not showing</font>

375
00:15:56,540 --> 00:16:00,980
you a picture of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the sky period</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 9 card</font>

376
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:03,140
but but just assume it came out it got

377
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:04,910
hacked and they<font color="#CCCCCC"> had an opcode swapping</font>

378
00:16:03,140 --> 00:16:06,649
going on so it was a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> more tricky</font>

379
00:16:04,910 --> 00:16:08,689
than just some the data bus and

380
00:16:06,649 --> 00:16:11,000
understanded you sat<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the data bus and</font>

381
00:16:08,690 --> 00:16:13,640
you saw you saw for example like a 49

382
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:15,770
instead of an opcode<font color="#E5E5E5"> of a 29 things like</font>

383
00:16:13,640 --> 00:16:18,380
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> I forget the pattern but so you had</font>

384
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:20,959
basically a swapping<font color="#E5E5E5"> of bits and and</font>

385
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:25,430
then an XOR and bit<font color="#E5E5E5"> 7 so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> so I'm sorry an</font>

386
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:26,989
inverse you know of a bit 7 and so if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we</font>

387
00:16:25,430 --> 00:16:28,609
look at this picture they did the<font color="#E5E5E5"> same</font>

388
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:31,820
thing they did the same<font color="#E5E5E5"> thing here but</font>

389
00:16:28,610 --> 00:16:34,339
no XOR on bit 7 so here's the data bus

390
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:38,870
again if<font color="#E5E5E5"> we were to assume am I going</font>

391
00:16:34,339 --> 00:16:40,910
too fast everybody following<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay and</font>

392
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:42,320
there's a<font color="#CCCCCC"> very there's value to what I'm</font>

393
00:16:40,910 --> 00:16:45,140
explaining that you that you'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> find out</font>

394
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:47,720
soon very soon because this is really

395
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:49,910
classic and it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> awesome it's old but</font>

396
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,930
it's cool it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> very cool</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is</font>

397
00:16:49,910 --> 00:16:53,300
<font color="#CCCCCC">something that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you guys if you're trying</font>

398
00:16:50,930 --> 00:16:54,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">to learn can play with at home or in a</font>

399
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:56,959
makeshift lab or even college or

400
00:16:54,680 --> 00:17:00,650
something<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know i play with it at</font>

401
00:16:56,959 --> 00:17:03,349
home so so<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically let's assume that</font>

402
00:17:00,650 --> 00:17:07,760
<font color="#CCCCCC">the bus runs seven down to zero either</font>

403
00:17:03,350 --> 00:17:10,339
way 0 to 7 720 let's 444 haha this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is 0</font>

404
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:13,400
this is seven six five four three two

405
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:14,780
<font color="#CCCCCC">one zero this line is actually the clock</font>

406
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:18,740
line which I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't know why it's there</font>

407
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:19,530
but it is so look where the via is one

408
00:17:18,740 --> 00:17:21,900
second

409
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:23,609
the bus is running you know like i was

410
00:17:21,900 --> 00:17:28,440
saying seven down<font color="#CCCCCC"> 20 now let's assume</font>

411
00:17:23,609 --> 00:17:30,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">that these latches run 720 also so what</font>

412
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:32,070
just happened<font color="#CCCCCC"> here if this is the case</font>

413
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:34,500
then this via should have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> up here</font>

414
00:17:32,070 --> 00:17:36,899
on seven here it's not look what they

415
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:38,460
did they plugged it down<font color="#E5E5E5"> onto bit too so</font>

416
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,320
that means that<font color="#E5E5E5"> in order to understand</font>

417
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,580
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> instruction set on this chip you're</font>

418
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,050
going to get up codes that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you have to</font>

419
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:45,899
deem angle and then you're going to get

420
00:17:43,050 --> 00:17:47,490
operands the second fetch let's say

421
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:48,900
second or third fetch of an instruction

422
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:51,270
that are going<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be in the clear</font>

423
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:52,950
because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the ALU doesn't do this only the</font>

424
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:55,139
opcode does this this is a very

425
00:17:52,950 --> 00:17:57,030
<font color="#CCCCCC">beautiful way of keeping honest people</font>

426
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:59,010
honest back in the day if they didn't if

427
00:17:57,030 --> 00:18:00,840
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> just tried to sit on the bus you</font>

428
00:17:59,010 --> 00:18:02,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">know at the exit point of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ROM let's say</font>

429
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:04,889
they're not given it to von Neumann

430
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,030
architecture this guy would be<font color="#E5E5E5"> smart</font>

431
00:18:04,890 --> 00:18:07,800
enough to know that he's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to see</font>

432
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:10,170
<font color="#CCCCCC">RAM and he's going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to see rom and he</font>

433
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:11,220
prom all on one data bus they didn't

434
00:18:10,170 --> 00:18:14,520
split these up in the old days

435
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:17,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">everything fit in 64</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> K but what he would</font>

436
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:19,440
have seen was basically that every time

437
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:21,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">its bit you know it the opcode is really</font>

438
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:24,570
bit 7<font color="#CCCCCC"> he's going to see that it was it</font>

439
00:18:21,690 --> 00:18:27,210
was bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> too that came on and so in here</font>

440
00:18:24,570 --> 00:18:30,870
and bit 7 was really plugged into bit 6

441
00:18:27,210 --> 00:18:32,430
bit 5 was really plugged into<font color="#E5E5E5"> bits 0</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

442
00:18:30,870 --> 00:18:36,989
it's just you you can kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> see the</font>

443
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:38,250
pattern here and so forth I was<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

444
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:40,140
surprised when I saw this because this

445
00:18:38,250 --> 00:18:44,160
is off the shelf GSM SIM chip from

446
00:18:40,140 --> 00:18:46,440
1996-99 t5 these are very large<font color="#E5E5E5"> chips</font>

447
00:18:44,160 --> 00:18:48,930
also these are at least one micron I

448
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:50,940
don't never measured them but if I was

449
00:18:48,930 --> 00:18:52,530
to measure them based on the on the top

450
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:54,330
metal track I'd say<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they're they're</font>

451
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:57,930
leavin maybe one point two microns are

452
00:18:54,330 --> 00:19:00,030
bigger so another company out there

453
00:18:57,930 --> 00:19:03,690
making smart cards for directv who here

454
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:06,389
has<font color="#CCCCCC"> directv anybody okay so i used</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

455
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:08,670
work for them well<font color="#CCCCCC"> nds but and so we</font>

456
00:19:06,390 --> 00:19:10,440
made this custom<font color="#E5E5E5"> chip here well this one</font>

457
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:13,350
was in custom but it had an ASIC with it

458
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:16,350
so sky<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 anybody know sky 10 in the UK</font>

459
00:19:13,350 --> 00:19:18,240
so sky<font color="#E5E5E5"> 10 gets this chip with an ASIC</font>

460
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:19,889
America's gets his ship with an ASIC

461
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:21,270
South America gets this chip with an

462
00:19:19,890 --> 00:19:23,490
ASIC this chips being used all over the

463
00:19:21,270 --> 00:19:25,290
world they tell basically they tell

464
00:19:23,490 --> 00:19:27,270
siemens we want you<font color="#E5E5E5"> to swap the</font>

465
00:19:25,290 --> 00:19:30,840
instruction table because this chip ran

466
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:31,970
on a micro code and it was more like a

467
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:35,330
risk infrastructure

468
00:19:31,970 --> 00:19:39,110
and it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it simulated the 8051 so you</font>

469
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:41,149
basically you had a had a rom here that

470
00:19:39,110 --> 00:19:43,010
was not visible without staining so in

471
00:19:41,150 --> 00:19:45,200
order to see this the bits the ones in

472
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:46,520
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> zeros here if you could you'd have</font>

473
00:19:45,200 --> 00:19:48,500
to stain it with the dash etching and

474
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:52,340
then you'd see you'd see dots everywhere

475
00:19:48,500 --> 00:19:53,660
there was a p-type doping and so you

476
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:55,040
could do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> that way you could stain it</font>

477
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:57,110
and then if you figure out the ordering

478
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:58,970
of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the addressing scheme you'd have</font>

479
00:19:57,110 --> 00:20:01,189
the entire rom<font color="#E5E5E5"> read out but you still</font>

480
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:03,050
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the eeprom out and so nds</font>

481
00:20:01,190 --> 00:20:05,810
knew that you might sit on the data bus

482
00:20:03,050 --> 00:20:08,419
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> a nice drop and so what they did was</font>

483
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:10,429
they told infineon it was siemens up

484
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:13,250
back in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the day</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> back then we want you to</font>

485
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:15,560
take the take the instructions which are

486
00:20:13,250 --> 00:20:17,390
mapped through this table right here and

487
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:22,490
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> you to switch them around this</font>

488
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:25,130
is a table basically of 256 x 9 bits so

489
00:20:22,490 --> 00:20:27,410
basically it can go from<font color="#CCCCCC"> zero to 512 in</font>

490
00:20:25,130 --> 00:20:30,500
in theory like a tube<font color="#CCCCCC"> like a like a high</font>

491
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:33,110
and a low address and it supports 256<font color="#E5E5E5"> up</font>

492
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:35,900
<font color="#E5E5E5">codes because there's 256 up codes in</font>

493
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:38,149
the 8051 so this tables readable and

494
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:39,860
this table is readable optically they

495
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:42,020
knew you wouldn't understand<font color="#E5E5E5"> it because</font>

496
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:44,389
I don't understand where this points

497
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:46,879
into here you would<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to understand</font>

498
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:49,250
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know all of the logic over here and</font>

499
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:50,750
obviously the easiest way for a hacker

500
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:54,290
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get them would</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> have been to read the</font>

501
00:20:50,750 --> 00:20:56,090
ROM optically but again<font color="#E5E5E5"> why not just sit</font>

502
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:57,620
on the instruction watches freeze them

503
00:20:56,090 --> 00:21:00,110
and make it spill its guts you'll have

504
00:20:57,620 --> 00:21:04,909
everything out in 10 minutes so does

505
00:21:00,110 --> 00:21:06,740
anybody do probing micro probing cool do

506
00:21:04,910 --> 00:21:08,990
you play around with the like freezing

507
00:21:06,740 --> 00:21:11,330
instructions and things like this<font color="#CCCCCC"> no</font>

508
00:21:08,990 --> 00:21:12,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay you can have a lot of fun</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it</font>

509
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:15,230
and<font color="#E5E5E5"> these chips are great to learn on</font>

510
00:21:12,650 --> 00:21:18,740
and you know any any<font color="#CCCCCC"> CPU really you can</font>

511
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:20,360
play this these tricks on so yeah that

512
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:22,550
the ROM up here and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you have the</font>

513
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:24,709
static Ram over here 256 bytes very

514
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:26,540
basic you had the program counter over

515
00:21:24,710 --> 00:21:28,070
here to drive the the drive it the high

516
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:29,210
and the low and you can almost literally

517
00:21:28,070 --> 00:21:32,330
see it too<font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't even think they</font>

518
00:21:29,210 --> 00:21:33,980
scrambled it the low-order bus I it's I

519
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:35,389
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't remember which one it was but it's</font>

520
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:38,180
either<font color="#E5E5E5"> the high side or the low side of</font>

521
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:40,610
this of this this area your picture

522
00:21:38,180 --> 00:21:42,110
looks better than my picture so here's

523
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:43,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">you here's your program counter</font>

524
00:21:42,110 --> 00:21:48,850
basically

525
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:51,940
everything and so here you've got

526
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:53,409
instruction latches on it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not a very</font>

527
00:21:51,940 --> 00:21:55,180
close up picture but this is this is

528
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:56,920
point<font color="#CCCCCC"> eight microns so this is 800</font>

529
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:58,270
nanometers the gentleman back there<font color="#E5E5E5"> i</font>

530
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:59,410
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> i heard him say forty five</font>

531
00:21:58,270 --> 00:22:02,350
nanometers<font color="#E5E5E5"> i believe that's what she</font>

532
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:04,390
said this is 800 so this is night and

533
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:06,399
day<font color="#CCCCCC"> difference we're slowly shrinking in</font>

534
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:09,760
this presentation<font color="#E5E5E5"> just FYI so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we'll be</font>

535
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:13,180
that 90 in about 50 minutes so the

536
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,560
opcodes basically were presented read

537
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:16,780
from the bus came in on these eight

538
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:19,929
latches and presented<font color="#CCCCCC"> their latched here</font>

539
00:22:16,780 --> 00:22:23,440
to be put presented to this table now at

540
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:25,030
DEFCON<font color="#E5E5E5"> I showed you this table in 2008 I</font>

541
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,180
showed it to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you where you could see the</font>

542
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:30,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">Nepali you can see the way the actual</font>

543
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:32,620
ones and zeros of this of this<font color="#E5E5E5"> ROM so</font>

544
00:22:30,340 --> 00:22:35,500
but you've got to strip off this top

545
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:36,820
metal first and so here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> your</font>

546
00:22:35,500 --> 00:22:37,840
instruction launches if you want to dump

547
00:22:36,820 --> 00:22:39,790
the chip you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can just freeze it right</font>

548
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:42,220
here and sit on it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it's ordered 027</font>

549
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:46,659
even the bus was<font color="#CCCCCC"> in order</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> from</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 to 7</font>

550
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:49,750
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 0 1 2 3 4</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> 5</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> 6 & 7 what latches</font>

551
00:22:46,660 --> 00:22:52,840
here is held and friend<font color="#CCCCCC"> driven on this</font>

552
00:22:49,750 --> 00:22:56,080
these lines here up into the row and

553
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:58,179
column drivers took two and then the

554
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">next clock cycle the value is well</font>

555
00:22:58,180 --> 00:23:02,950
actually it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sits it's come to our</font>

556
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:08,680
logic so it's driven immediately anyway

557
00:23:02,950 --> 00:23:10,510
so that's this fun so even even infineon

558
00:23:08,680 --> 00:23:12,100
got a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little smarter but i think it was</font>

559
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:14,980
nds is doing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that did this but I never</font>

560
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:18,280
really got got<font color="#E5E5E5"> the 411 on who did who</font>

561
00:23:14,980 --> 00:23:20,140
told who what to do here but so siemens

562
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:22,030
get smarter and they said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay now</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> what</font>

563
00:23:20,140 --> 00:23:25,720
we're going to do for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the sky 11 ship</font>

564
00:23:22,030 --> 00:23:27,790
anybody here used sky 11<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay never i'm</font>

565
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:30,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to stop</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> asking men so satellite</font>

566
00:23:27,790 --> 00:23:32,230
hackers sky 11<font color="#CCCCCC"> ship comes out this time</font>

567
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:34,419
what they did same type of architecture

568
00:23:32,230 --> 00:23:35,830
<font color="#CCCCCC">i think it's a point seven so they</font>

569
00:23:34,420 --> 00:23:37,960
shrink from point a to point seven

570
00:23:35,830 --> 00:23:40,510
micron so they go from 800 to 700

571
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:42,100
nanometers the bus is still in order<font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

572
00:23:40,510 --> 00:23:44,350
seven six five four three<font color="#E5E5E5"> two one zero</font>

573
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:46,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">no what's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> interesting about this</font>

574
00:23:44,350 --> 00:23:49,209
architecture is that the low address of

575
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,620
the of the fetch or the Pinot the low

576
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:52,810
address of the program counter is on the

577
00:23:50,620 --> 00:23:54,969
bus so you get the low address of the of

578
00:23:52,810 --> 00:23:57,080
the program counter and then on the next

579
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:58,340
clock cycle you see the value that's

580
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,169
being fetched from that memory address

581
00:23:58,340 --> 00:24:03,649
or written<font color="#E5E5E5"> to for that much if it's</font>

582
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:06,560
around so you have the bits coming in

583
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:08,060
765 you know in all<font color="#E5E5E5"> these in order but</font>

584
00:24:06,560 --> 00:24:10,429
look there's some logic added in front

585
00:24:08,060 --> 00:24:12,590
of the latches so if you recall there's

586
00:24:10,430 --> 00:24:16,670
Lodge there's X this is this whole block

587
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:20,360
right here this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> extra and what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

588
00:24:16,670 --> 00:24:23,450
actually is is is<font color="#CCCCCC"> three latched three</font>

589
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:27,320
extra latches to latch seven six and

590
00:24:23,450 --> 00:24:29,930
five of the data bus and then they took

591
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:32,510
and they had a neck they had<font color="#CCCCCC"> 3x</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> oars so</font>

592
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:35,030
what they latch the value of the love

593
00:24:32,510 --> 00:24:36,860
the low addresses bit three bits of the

594
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:39,020
<font color="#E5E5E5">low address got latched and then they</font>

595
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:40,820
got exclusive<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ord against three bits of</font>

596
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:43,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">the opcode it's very</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> clever it's very</font>

597
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:48,139
cool but it's very obvious also and so

598
00:24:43,790 --> 00:24:50,000
this chip also got hacked no at this

599
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:52,010
time<font color="#E5E5E5"> no end yes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> knew they started put in</font>

600
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,720
a<font color="#E5E5E5"> six into the silicon so they were</font>

601
00:24:52,010 --> 00:24:56,510
having heavy duty you know op code

602
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:59,330
changes data the data bus was being

603
00:24:56,510 --> 00:25:03,379
scrambled and they had an ASIC on board

604
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:05,149
at this point now this is still<font color="#E5E5E5"> Siemens</font>

605
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:11,480
it become infineon like a year later or

606
00:25:05,150 --> 00:25:14,660
so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> Europe</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a company called</font>

607
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:17,930
<font color="#CCCCCC">Canal+ anybody know Canal+ technologies</font>

608
00:25:14,660 --> 00:25:20,150
so<font color="#CCCCCC"> Canal+ technologies used to only be</font>

609
00:25:17,930 --> 00:25:21,710
television producing and then at some

610
00:25:20,150 --> 00:25:22,610
point in time they<font color="#E5E5E5"> they started</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> coming</font>

611
00:25:21,710 --> 00:25:26,360
out with their own conditional access

612
00:25:22,610 --> 00:25:29,090
system called<font color="#CCCCCC"> Seca so Seca generation to</font>

613
00:25:26,360 --> 00:25:30,590
used they had this belief<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they</font>

614
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:33,740
could use several different smart card

615
00:25:30,590 --> 00:25:35,629
ships and and and through this several

616
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:37,820
different launches<font color="#CCCCCC"> of smart card ships</font>

617
00:25:35,630 --> 00:25:40,040
they somehow be secure but<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're only</font>

618
00:25:37,820 --> 00:25:42,020
as strong as your weakest link<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> so</font>

619
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:45,830
they they introduced for<font color="#CCCCCC"> seca to this</font>

620
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:49,430
this okidata 8051 type of architecture

621
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:51,530
and it's kind of funny because they<font color="#E5E5E5"> oki</font>

622
00:25:49,430 --> 00:25:54,320
added a bunch of fake tracks to the chip

623
00:25:51,530 --> 00:25:56,690
and the nst it is famous for doing this

624
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:58,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">too they add a complete block of logic</font>

625
00:25:56,690 --> 00:26:01,070
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> fake that has nothing to do with</font>

626
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:02,719
anything and so you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see here here's</font>

627
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:04,100
here's a line this line does nothing

628
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,240
this line is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> sitting here floating</font>

629
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:09,189
it and

630
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,690
I guess they think they're protecting

631
00:26:09,190 --> 00:26:13,150
you from optically reading the ROM out

632
00:26:10,690 --> 00:26:14,350
again but who's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to optically read</font>

633
00:26:13,150 --> 00:26:16,300
out the ROM that's a lot that's

634
00:26:14,350 --> 00:26:18,100
something that I would do today<font color="#E5E5E5"> more</font>

635
00:26:16,300 --> 00:26:19,570
than I would have done in the past just

636
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:22,360
because it's easier for<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to image the</font>

637
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:25,000
roms today that than it is to probe the

638
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:26,770
bus because they've gotten so small so

639
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:28,510
you can see here this is all fake and

640
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:31,660
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> chip wasn't handled very good so it</font>

641
00:26:28,510 --> 00:26:33,280
got scratched here so this this I<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

642
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:34,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't understand why they did it but</font>

643
00:26:33,280 --> 00:26:37,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a technique that they</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> started to</font>

644
00:26:34,660 --> 00:26:40,179
come out with so here this is the<font color="#E5E5E5"> entire</font>

645
00:26:37,330 --> 00:26:42,010
chip and as you can see in the image it

646
00:26:40,179 --> 00:26:46,150
looked pretty cool I don't know

647
00:26:42,010 --> 00:26:51,700
otherwise<font color="#E5E5E5"> what it did though you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know so</font>

648
00:26:46,150 --> 00:26:53,710
I mean you know now today before well

649
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:55,360
actually let me let me slow down here so

650
00:26:53,710 --> 00:26:57,010
here's the core of this chip it's so

651
00:26:55,360 --> 00:26:59,350
obvious in the older technologies where

652
00:26:57,010 --> 00:27:00,940
the core was because the core ran on

653
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:02,800
what they call what I quote I always

654
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:07,360
call it microcode even if it really it

655
00:27:02,800 --> 00:27:08,980
was a PLA does anybody design CP is so

656
00:27:07,360 --> 00:27:12,520
you know<font color="#CCCCCC"> exactly where I'm coming from</font>

657
00:27:08,980 --> 00:27:14,290
this table has to know what opcode

658
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:16,690
you're executing that means the

659
00:27:14,290 --> 00:27:20,080
instruction latches are near so you see

660
00:27:16,690 --> 00:27:22,600
a ROM ROM in the core there's something

661
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,159
important there and so its first this is

662
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:26,709
this this will stick out like a sore

663
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:29,830
thumb to anybody and well anybody that's

664
00:27:26,710 --> 00:27:32,170
got you know the that understands what

665
00:27:29,830 --> 00:27:33,970
they're looking at or tries to and so I

666
00:27:32,170 --> 00:27:35,380
actually don't know where the

667
00:27:33,970 --> 00:27:37,270
instruction registers are but they're

668
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:39,309
over here so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean I never I never</font>

669
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:40,420
actually probed them that's why so and

670
00:27:39,309 --> 00:27:42,250
so what you'd see on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the instruction</font>

671
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:44,020
register I talked about<font color="#CCCCCC"> it earlier you'd</font>

672
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:45,820
see you'd see the live data bus on the

673
00:27:44,020 --> 00:27:47,620
<font color="#E5E5E5">left side and on the right side you'd</font>

674
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:50,710
see the frozen instruction of the opcode

675
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:53,379
it's executing if it really it releases

676
00:27:50,710 --> 00:27:55,780
that drive and becomes transparent that

677
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:57,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">up codes not going to execute if it's in</font>

678
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:58,750
<font color="#E5E5E5">the middle</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of executing something just a</font>

679
00:27:57,400 --> 00:28:02,040
bit<font color="#CCCCCC"> will and this depends on the design</font>

680
00:27:58,750 --> 00:28:02,040
to the architecture

681
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:11,420
so now we're<font color="#CCCCCC"> moving up more and more st</font>

682
00:28:08,270 --> 00:28:13,160
AKA SGS thompson their french company

683
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:14,660
they came out with some pretty<font color="#E5E5E5"> cool</font>

684
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:17,330
chips and i actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> really like these</font>

685
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:20,360
guys so they've<font color="#CCCCCC"> been making 6805 since</font>

686
00:28:17,330 --> 00:28:22,370
early 90s 91 yeah they started<font color="#E5E5E5"> with no</font>

687
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:24,770
mesh and then they went to<font color="#CCCCCC"> a chip with a</font>

688
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:28,250
mesh and the very first mesh was just

689
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:30,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">simply a plane and on the plane you had</font>

690
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:32,510
little holes in it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I didn't take the</font>

691
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:35,629
time to show you<font color="#CCCCCC"> that just because it's</font>

692
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:37,640
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> doesn't really it's too easy it</font>

693
00:28:35,630 --> 00:28:38,960
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really show much it just there</font>

694
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:41,630
was a metal plate over the<font color="#E5E5E5"> whole chip</font>

695
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:43,220
basically with holes in it and so in the

696
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:45,620
wired video did anybody see<font color="#CCCCCC"> my wired</font>

697
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:47,990
video where I like take<font color="#CCCCCC"> the nail polish</font>

698
00:28:45,620 --> 00:28:50,300
and make the mask good so if you<font color="#E5E5E5"> look at</font>

699
00:28:47,990 --> 00:28:52,940
the wired video you can see<font color="#CCCCCC"> clearly that</font>

700
00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:54,950
that type of a mesh and i will show you

701
00:28:52,940 --> 00:28:57,260
some pictures of it<font color="#E5E5E5"> after when we're all</font>

702
00:28:54,950 --> 00:29:01,580
through with the slides and so this chip

703
00:28:57,260 --> 00:29:03,530
really what made it secure<font color="#CCCCCC"> i guess i</font>

704
00:29:01,580 --> 00:29:05,600
didn't link to it what made<font color="#E5E5E5"> this chip</font>

705
00:29:03,530 --> 00:29:09,260
secure was that you had a mesh that had

706
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:12,020
active an active sense line like a snake

707
00:29:09,260 --> 00:29:13,280
and then it had ground which true

708
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:15,350
grounds coming from this side and<font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

709
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:17,600
side but they didn't meet so they got

710
00:29:15,350 --> 00:29:19,939
this at this end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the chip the grounds</font>

711
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:21,350
count you know are all connected on<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

712
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:23,030
corner on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this corner so to speak and</font>

713
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:24,620
then they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> agni across a chip</font>

714
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:26,780
and then from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the opposite edge the same</font>

715
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:29,360
thing and in between this you have this

716
00:29:26,780 --> 00:29:31,490
<font color="#E5E5E5">one wire that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is tied to vdd the you</font>

717
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:33,260
know the VCC line 5 volt<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3 volts</font>

718
00:29:31,490 --> 00:29:35,030
whatever the chips input is and<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

719
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:37,400
weaving through it if<font color="#E5E5E5"> this line is</font>

720
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:39,350
broken the it would it would freeze the

721
00:29:37,400 --> 00:29:43,400
core that was the only punishment on

722
00:29:39,350 --> 00:29:45,709
st16 was that the<font color="#E5E5E5"> cpu stopped running so</font>

723
00:29:43,400 --> 00:29:48,110
it was kind of interesting<font color="#CCCCCC"> because you</font>

724
00:29:45,710 --> 00:29:50,450
<font color="#E5E5E5">knew exactly if you fix the mesh or not</font>

725
00:29:48,110 --> 00:29:52,370
and and when you were all finished you

726
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:53,720
you could simply<font color="#E5E5E5"> do you know the chips</font>

727
00:29:52,370 --> 00:29:56,989
running again once you patched it and

728
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:58,430
that's exactly actually that's not

729
00:29:56,990 --> 00:30:00,770
exactly what i did in the wired video in

730
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:02,810
the wired video the mesh because it was

731
00:30:00,770 --> 00:30:04,460
<font color="#CCCCCC">just a solid</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> plane of ground with with</font>

732
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:06,110
holes in it<font color="#CCCCCC"> i made a big hole in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it and</font>

733
00:30:04,460 --> 00:30:10,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">i was just I was just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> able to probe the</font>

734
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:10,000
bus I didn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> even need to fix the mesh</font>

735
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:16,290
today as we<font color="#CCCCCC"> start to shrink we go lower</font>

736
00:30:13,230 --> 00:30:17,520
that last one was a 1.2 micron jumping

737
00:30:16,290 --> 00:30:18,870
around a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little on the size back there</font>

738
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:22,379
just give you<font color="#CCCCCC"> some ideas of what I've</font>

739
00:30:18,870 --> 00:30:24,928
seen today these chips are being are

740
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:27,690
being they're all there everything I see

741
00:30:24,929 --> 00:30:30,750
today is below 350 it's typically about

742
00:30:27,690 --> 00:30:33,330
220 if I had to average it some are 90

743
00:30:30,750 --> 00:30:37,679
summer 180 some are 140 it just depends

744
00:30:33,330 --> 00:30:39,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">who makes it but the principles that I'm</font>

745
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:40,740
describing about the instruction

746
00:30:39,210 --> 00:30:43,559
register and stuff still applies today

747
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:45,870
even the nail polish attack I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to</font>

748
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:48,840
show you some ships that from Thompson

749
00:30:45,870 --> 00:30:51,030
that are 180 nanometers that I executed

750
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,678
the nail polish attack on and I stopped

751
00:30:51,030 --> 00:30:54,270
early because I ran<font color="#E5E5E5"> into a problem with</font>

752
00:30:52,679 --> 00:30:55,980
the nail polish coding because of the

753
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:59,730
heat the heat cracked it<font color="#CCCCCC"> and it came off</font>

754
00:30:55,980 --> 00:31:02,370
and so before I go too far off topic

755
00:30:59,730 --> 00:31:03,990
though so some of these smart cards and

756
00:31:02,370 --> 00:31:07,080
such come out with filler metal you can

757
00:31:03,990 --> 00:31:09,510
see it here this is TSMC i believe it's

758
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:11,159
<font color="#E5E5E5">like a 215 enemy to process I've never</font>

759
00:31:09,510 --> 00:31:14,190
really measured it but it's smaller than

760
00:31:11,160 --> 00:31:17,700
350 and so actually it may be 350 I'm

761
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:21,750
sorry it may actually be so this chip

762
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:23,580
this is not security you don't you don't

763
00:31:21,750 --> 00:31:26,880
lay filler metal here that does nothing

764
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:29,070
and and call it you know it's obscure TI

765
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:30,990
guess it's obscuring below but it's it's

766
00:31:29,070 --> 00:31:32,730
by no means<font color="#CCCCCC"> a security you know</font>

767
00:31:30,990 --> 00:31:35,100
enhancement to this design and if

768
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:37,440
anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> it helps me because when I'm in</font>

769
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:38,820
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fib I can count so I can count from</font>

770
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,400
the edge and say okay I got to go over

771
00:31:38,820 --> 00:31:44,909
18 of these little<font color="#E5E5E5"> stubs and then drill</font>

772
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:46,410
you know and it gets<font color="#E5E5E5"> even better because</font>

773
00:31:44,910 --> 00:31:48,600
look here they<font color="#CCCCCC"> they have these little</font>

774
00:31:46,410 --> 00:31:50,730
like<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's I don't even know if these are</font>

775
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,080
alive but there's like it came up to the

776
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:54,299
metal three service and then it like

777
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,820
when for a few micrometers and then went

778
00:31:54,299 --> 00:31:58,230
down again to metal<font color="#CCCCCC"> too and I don't know</font>

779
00:31:56,820 --> 00:32:00,030
what these little stubs are doing but

780
00:31:58,230 --> 00:32:02,070
I'm if they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know I'm assuming</font>

781
00:32:00,030 --> 00:32:03,720
they're their life and so I can measure

782
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:06,450
off these stubs and say okay from the

783
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:10,020
stub<font color="#E5E5E5"> count up five go over 20 anyway so</font>

784
00:32:06,450 --> 00:32:12,210
um this is if you use TSMC in your chip

785
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:14,010
and you tell you know they give you this

786
00:32:12,210 --> 00:32:15,750
black box of a<font color="#E5E5E5"> memory this is one of</font>

787
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:17,820
<font color="#E5E5E5">their popular memory sizes that icic</font>

788
00:32:15,750 --> 00:32:20,860
freescale using it this is a some

789
00:32:17,820 --> 00:32:23,678
<font color="#CCCCCC">chinese smart card that use this one</font>

790
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:25,120
and you can see fillers everywhere but

791
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:27,100
there's no mesh these are this is the

792
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:29,439
<font color="#E5E5E5">top metal right here one</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these lines</font>

793
00:32:27,100 --> 00:32:31,000
might even be important so I mean in I

794
00:32:29,440 --> 00:32:33,490
may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not even need to fit it because if</font>

795
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:36,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">this is 350 I believe it is actually 350</font>

796
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:37,960
and even if it's 250 I can still hit

797
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:40,210
this track right here it's by itself and

798
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:42,220
I can still<font color="#E5E5E5"> hit this one right here and</font>

799
00:32:40,210 --> 00:32:44,710
<font color="#E5E5E5">i can probably get to these two because</font>

800
00:32:42,220 --> 00:32:46,090
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm pretty good with the laser if I but</font>

801
00:32:44,710 --> 00:32:48,040
if I'm skeptical I'll just go use the

802
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:49,419
<font color="#CCCCCC">fit and open them these you don't even</font>

803
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:51,460
need to count you can go right to them

804
00:32:49,420 --> 00:32:52,630
take an optical picture go load it in

805
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:55,450
your<font color="#E5E5E5"> chin your fib make sure you're</font>

806
00:32:52,630 --> 00:32:56,860
grounded well<font color="#E5E5E5"> to your stage and then in</font>

807
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:58,780
five minutes<font color="#E5E5E5"> later you're looking for</font>

808
00:32:56,860 --> 00:33:05,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">this wire once you've leveled yourself</font>

809
00:32:58,780 --> 00:33:08,590
so those not so invisible roms here's

810
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:12,429
the case 180 nanometer samsung smart

811
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:13,659
card so<font color="#CCCCCC"> samsung has</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> these smart cards</font>

812
00:33:12,429 --> 00:33:15,309
that they produce I don't believe

813
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:16,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">they're common criteria certified or</font>

814
00:33:15,309 --> 00:33:19,030
anything but what's interesting about

815
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:21,129
these smart cards is that that they give

816
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:23,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">you a bootloader you sound an NDA to get</font>

817
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:24,970
the documents and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then you get they tell</font>

818
00:33:23,350 --> 00:33:26,799
<font color="#E5E5E5">you okay when you buy the cards from us</font>

819
00:33:24,970 --> 00:33:29,860
for whatever<font color="#E5E5E5"> five dollars each or some</font>

820
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:32,110
some price there's a bootloader in rom

821
00:33:29,860 --> 00:33:33,549
and the boot<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> ROM also has you</font>

822
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:35,949
can permanently disable the boot loader

823
00:33:33,549 --> 00:33:38,650
and the bootloader also has rom

824
00:33:35,950 --> 00:33:42,340
functionality for like Triple DES or RSA

825
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:44,440
some type of<font color="#CCCCCC"> pki</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> etc the bad part is the</font>

826
00:33:42,340 --> 00:33:45,639
rum<font color="#E5E5E5"> is visible now this I didn't</font>

827
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,929
actually stay<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this Oliver Coomer</font>

828
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:48,280
laying this was donated from Oliver

829
00:33:46,929 --> 00:33:50,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">Coomer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> legs so when I give him some</font>

830
00:33:48,280 --> 00:33:52,990
credit for this<font color="#E5E5E5"> picture so this pic in</font>

831
00:33:50,770 --> 00:33:55,240
this picture he stained this rom and all

832
00:33:52,990 --> 00:33:57,010
the p-type doping came out now what's

833
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,870
important about this is they didn't even

834
00:33:57,010 --> 00:34:01,299
encrypt the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ROM this is supposed to be a</font>

835
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:04,418
smart card brand new smart card field of

836
00:34:01,299 --> 00:34:09,280
today and yet<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's rom is in the clear</font>

837
00:34:04,419 --> 00:34:11,830
so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't understand that now i linked</font>

838
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:13,149
you to the wrong picture here<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll show</font>

839
00:34:11,830 --> 00:34:14,918
<font color="#CCCCCC">you another picture of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this rom later</font>

840
00:34:13,149 --> 00:34:17,020
and you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see clearly where the where</font>

841
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:19,810
it went where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> wrong bits went to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ffs</font>

842
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:23,379
now this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an ARM arm 9 or an arm 10</font>

843
00:34:19,810 --> 00:34:26,049
processor and so when the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ROM became</font>

844
00:34:23,379 --> 00:34:28,868
empty at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end of the ROM they were</font>

845
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:29,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">just all ones and i believe on this rom</font>

846
00:34:28,869 --> 00:34:33,980
yeah

847
00:34:29,690 --> 00:34:35,990
a white spot is one so and in the in the

848
00:34:33,980 --> 00:34:37,909
sem this is sem image you can clearly

849
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:40,729
it's dark everywhere that it's not that

850
00:34:37,909 --> 00:34:42,139
<font color="#CCCCCC">it's</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> not light so you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> can see it mean</font>

851
00:34:40,730 --> 00:34:46,490
it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very easy to detect the bits on</font>

852
00:34:42,139 --> 00:34:48,679
this rom then we got baseband processors

853
00:34:46,489 --> 00:34:51,078
from<font color="#E5E5E5"> cell phones anybody do like self</font>

854
00:34:48,679 --> 00:34:52,879
mess with cell phone hacking so all you

855
00:34:51,079 --> 00:34:54,109
guys want to always hack the iphone you

856
00:34:52,879 --> 00:34:55,339
always want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to hack you know the</font>

857
00:34:54,109 --> 00:34:58,940
blackberry and<font color="#CCCCCC"> all these other phones</font>

858
00:34:55,339 --> 00:35:01,310
and and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> initial way to get to this</font>

859
00:34:58,940 --> 00:35:03,619
would be to look<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the bootloader rom</font>

860
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:05,240
first because a lot of these guys they

861
00:35:03,619 --> 00:35:07,220
might run encrypted code today but a lot

862
00:35:05,240 --> 00:35:10,009
of<font color="#E5E5E5"> them just had a signature so they you</font>

863
00:35:07,220 --> 00:35:11,720
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> it signed with RSA 120a an md5 hash</font>

864
00:35:10,010 --> 00:35:13,040
well that's great<font color="#CCCCCC"> but what do you do</font>

865
00:35:11,720 --> 00:35:15,500
after the signatures checked you ever

866
00:35:13,040 --> 00:35:16,819
check it again so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I mean 11 wire and you</font>

867
00:35:15,500 --> 00:35:18,500
can or yourself into a higher area of

868
00:35:16,819 --> 00:35:20,180
the flash because the flash has sections

869
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:21,950
that are checked so how do you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know this</font>

870
00:35:20,180 --> 00:35:24,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">you don't have the manuals well you can</font>

871
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:28,399
you can read this rom just like just

872
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:30,290
like if it was textbook but<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean no I</font>

873
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,750
imaged it in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FIB this is done in</font>

874
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:34,790
<font color="#CCCCCC">afib so this</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> FM image but this rom is</font>

875
00:35:32,750 --> 00:35:36,079
not encrypted if I thought it was this

876
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:38,300
gave it<font color="#CCCCCC"> a way that it isn't right here</font>

877
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:41,359
because because<font color="#CCCCCC"> if it was encrypted this</font>

878
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:43,190
wouldn't have been all ones so every bit

879
00:35:41,359 --> 00:35:45,859
here is basically unprogrammed in the

880
00:35:43,190 --> 00:35:47,180
rom they could<font color="#E5E5E5"> have at least and this is</font>

881
00:35:45,859 --> 00:35:51,500
<font color="#CCCCCC">a good</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> advice for all of you if your</font>

882
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:52,910
design<font color="#E5E5E5"> it software or if you design</font>

883
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:54,710
hardware you know it's good to<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

884
00:35:52,910 --> 00:35:56,029
like this this rom should have had junk

885
00:35:54,710 --> 00:35:58,490
put at the end<font color="#E5E5E5"> of it this room should</font>

886
00:35:56,030 --> 00:36:00,680
never have had sus static ones and

887
00:35:58,490 --> 00:36:03,430
because it did it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very obvious that</font>

888
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:03,430
it's not encrypted

889
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:13,030
well you you could do it but because<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

890
00:36:11,170 --> 00:36:15,550
user software and your bootloader

891
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:19,540
technically would never call it do you

892
00:36:15,550 --> 00:36:20,620
follow me<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so that's what this</font>

893
00:36:19,540 --> 00:36:24,670
gentleman answered the question he's

894
00:36:20,620 --> 00:36:25,960
here and that's a good point because I

895
00:36:24,670 --> 00:36:27,580
only see it from one<font color="#CCCCCC"> side of the coin</font>

896
00:36:25,960 --> 00:36:29,290
but this gentleman saying that that the

897
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:32,080
trade-off<font color="#CCCCCC"> is basically that reliability</font>

898
00:36:29,290 --> 00:36:47,050
issues in manufacturing so thank you<font color="#CCCCCC"> for</font>

899
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:48,130
clarifying understood understood now

900
00:36:47,050 --> 00:36:49,450
that that's a very good point so he's

901
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:51,280
saying basically<font color="#E5E5E5"> one one error you might</font>

902
00:36:49,450 --> 00:36:53,919
end up executing from this area and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

903
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:56,050
junk at least this case it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> like an OP</font>

904
00:36:53,920 --> 00:36:57,220
or something in the arm language so but

905
00:36:56,050 --> 00:37:00,040
you can say you can read this rom out

906
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:02,500
like like like it wasn't even like it

907
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:04,840
was nothing to do the problem with this

908
00:37:02,500 --> 00:37:07,180
chip is it so small i think it was<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

909
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:10,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">a hundred</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and thirty nanometers</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

910
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:12,490
maybe had been larger than this I but no

911
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:15,160
it was 130 nanometers the problem with

912
00:37:12,490 --> 00:37:16,839
this optically<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1,500 mag thousand</font>

913
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,160
magnification you can't see it clear

914
00:37:16,840 --> 00:37:20,650
enough to<font color="#E5E5E5"> really make out the ones and</font>

915
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:23,049
<font color="#E5E5E5">zeros you can but it's grainy it's it's</font>

916
00:37:20,650 --> 00:37:26,350
so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I just imaged it in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> FIB this is a</font>

917
00:37:23,050 --> 00:37:28,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">5000 magnification so zoom it in five</font>

918
00:37:26,350 --> 00:37:29,950
thousand times and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is what this is</font>

919
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:32,200
what those bits look like I have no idea

920
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:37,180
<font color="#CCCCCC">the way it's ordered I just visit this</font>

921
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:39,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">is just to show you guys so a lot of</font>

922
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:42,430
companies like atmel are doing meshes do

923
00:37:39,970 --> 00:37:44,259
you do anybody here design like this

924
00:37:42,430 --> 00:37:46,779
type of security product that has like a

925
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:48,490
meshing him over<font color="#E5E5E5"> it the mesh is great</font>

926
00:37:46,780 --> 00:37:53,950
the mesh slows me down for about a day

927
00:37:48,490 --> 00:37:55,779
so once no and I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> this sincerely it</font>

928
00:37:53,950 --> 00:37:57,910
really does it you know when I talked

929
00:37:55,780 --> 00:38:00,430
about<font color="#CCCCCC"> the TPM attack I explained it took</font>

930
00:37:57,910 --> 00:38:03,580
me six months but what everybody didn't

931
00:38:00,430 --> 00:38:04,990
understand was that what took me<font color="#E5E5E5"> six it</font>

932
00:38:03,580 --> 00:38:07,360
took<font color="#CCCCCC"> me two months to actually finish</font>

933
00:38:04,990 --> 00:38:11,350
the TPM chip it took<font color="#E5E5E5"> me four months to</font>

934
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:14,830
make buffers<font color="#E5E5E5"> to to to sit on on a</font>

935
00:38:11,350 --> 00:38:16,630
hundred<font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> eighty I'm sorry 1.8 volt</font>

936
00:38:14,830 --> 00:38:18,610
signal without you know changing its

937
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:20,530
capacitance so much that it that it

938
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:22,060
shuts the chip down you know at 33

939
00:38:20,530 --> 00:38:26,500
megahertz is pretty fast to put<font color="#E5E5E5"> down</font>

940
00:38:22,060 --> 00:38:28,420
bunch of needles and so so basically

941
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:30,130
there were challenges on that and also

942
00:38:28,420 --> 00:38:32,080
finally I had<font color="#E5E5E5"> to come up with a way to</font>

943
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:33,940
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> around the mesh but once I came up</font>

944
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:35,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">with this way to get around the mesh and</font>

945
00:38:33,940 --> 00:38:38,230
as well<font color="#CCCCCC"> as the other the other challenge</font>

946
00:38:35,770 --> 00:38:40,630
that I just described now those apply to

947
00:38:38,230 --> 00:38:42,490
any chip today now this chips not that

948
00:38:40,630 --> 00:38:44,140
small but what's neat here is<font color="#E5E5E5"> that atmel</font>

949
00:38:42,490 --> 00:38:45,819
went out of their way this to this is

950
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:48,279
from a chip called the crypto companion

951
00:38:45,820 --> 00:38:52,180
anybody here to that<font color="#CCCCCC"> AB</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Mel crypto</font>

952
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:55,079
companion<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok it's snake oil so stay</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> away</font>

953
00:38:52,180 --> 00:38:56,729
from it so it's

954
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:58,289
this chip let us do you<font color="#CCCCCC"> the cryptography</font>

955
00:38:56,729 --> 00:39:00,180
for you you know will prove to<font color="#E5E5E5"> you that</font>

956
00:38:58,289 --> 00:39:02,160
they authenticated correctly blah blah

957
00:39:00,180 --> 00:39:06,660
blah blah<font color="#CCCCCC"> blah I say stay away that's my</font>

958
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:08,489
humble advice so anyway but this mesh is

959
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:10,019
cute it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> very cute another company</font>

960
00:39:08,489 --> 00:39:11,999
making meshes like this is rena sauce

961
00:39:10,019 --> 00:39:14,700
anybody use<font color="#E5E5E5"> Renaissance smart cards if</font>

962
00:39:11,999 --> 00:39:16,319
you do there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> a good chance that the</font>

963
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:19,200
mesh looks similar to this several

964
00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:21,089
circuits and like you can see here at

965
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,399
the top of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> screen this this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

966
00:39:21,089 --> 00:39:25,109
several different circuits but what<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

967
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:28,440
engineers didn't understand that design

968
00:39:25,109 --> 00:39:30,209
this mesh is that I can cut one of these

969
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:32,190
lines<font color="#E5E5E5"> at a time and watch them go out</font>

970
00:39:30,209 --> 00:39:34,529
and turn black and this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is called</font>

971
00:39:32,190 --> 00:39:36,269
voltage contrast and so as I cut the

972
00:39:34,529 --> 00:39:38,999
line i can see everywhere aware the line

973
00:39:36,269 --> 00:39:42,779
went now<font color="#CCCCCC"> i may i will</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> actually have to</font>

974
00:39:38,999 --> 00:39:44,669
polish down the the the dye to where the

975
00:39:42,779 --> 00:39:46,739
metal<font color="#E5E5E5"> is exposed otherwise the FIB won't</font>

976
00:39:44,670 --> 00:39:48,930
show me anything but once I've done that

977
00:39:46,739 --> 00:39:50,849
as soon as that line floats over on one

978
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:52,259
end it's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go darker it's because</font>

979
00:39:50,849 --> 00:39:56,819
it's not properly connected up<font color="#CCCCCC"> anymore</font>

980
00:39:52,259 --> 00:40:02,160
and you'll see this<font color="#CCCCCC"> in a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ok</font>

981
00:39:56,819 --> 00:40:03,660
voltage contrast it can kill you if you

982
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,609
think you think you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know these guys</font>

983
00:40:03,660 --> 00:40:07,440
aren't thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> at we've got it no</font>

984
00:40:05,609 --> 00:40:09,359
problem<font color="#E5E5E5"> well they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> don't really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

985
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,509
anything because you can see here this

986
00:40:09,359 --> 00:40:14,279
is from the 66 so here this bit this

987
00:40:12,509 --> 00:40:15,930
line it's out here<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's out here</font>

988
00:40:14,279 --> 00:40:19,559
<font color="#CCCCCC">everywhere I marked it in red the line</font>

989
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:21,509
was out now the 66 mesh I really<font color="#CCCCCC"> liked</font>

990
00:40:19,559 --> 00:40:23,160
it because it<font color="#CCCCCC"> was consistent so they get</font>

991
00:40:21,509 --> 00:40:24,959
an A with me or you know if I had to

992
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:27,479
<font color="#E5E5E5">rate them because even though it's</font>

993
00:40:24,959 --> 00:40:28,469
simple to for me to break now it wasn't

994
00:40:27,479 --> 00:40:30,629
in the beginning<font color="#E5E5E5"> because this mesh</font>

995
00:40:28,469 --> 00:40:33,209
covers the entire substrate except the

996
00:40:30,630 --> 00:40:34,799
bond pad area and in a cook in<font color="#CCCCCC"> there</font>

997
00:40:33,209 --> 00:40:40,919
very<font color="#CCCCCC"> tight line spacing and it's</font>

998
00:40:34,799 --> 00:40:42,329
consistent nxp atmel st st that<font color="#E5E5E5"> can't</font>

999
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:45,599
even<font color="#CCCCCC"> count them and you'll see why soon</font>

1000
00:40:42,329 --> 00:40:49,459
but and nxp and at<font color="#CCCCCC"> mels meshes are are</font>

1001
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:49,459
not as consistent as this is

1002
00:40:51,060 --> 00:40:55,529
so in<font color="#CCCCCC"> conclusion you know like security</font>

1003
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:57,480
<font color="#CCCCCC">is always going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to be constantly</font>

1004
00:40:55,530 --> 00:41:01,260
evolving I took you from the early 80s

1005
00:40:57,480 --> 00:41:03,120
into today and nothing's really secure

1006
00:41:01,260 --> 00:41:04,620
you know I<font color="#E5E5E5"> mean like there's gentlemen</font>

1007
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:06,420
here that like the<font color="#CCCCCC"> gentleman</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of designs</font>

1008
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:07,830

1009
00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:08,910
may<font color="#E5E5E5"> not learn something today I don't</font>

1010
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:11,250
know but<font color="#E5E5E5"> for one thing he'll think twice</font>

1011
00:41:08,910 --> 00:41:13,350
before he does his next layout and so

1012
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:14,760
<font color="#E5E5E5">this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is good because if you're using a</font>

1013
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:18,900
chip from a company you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need to learn</font>

1014
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:20,250
user needs to trust the vendor but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's</font>

1015
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:21,690
kind of hard to trust the vendor when

1016
00:41:20,250 --> 00:41:24,150
you're not really sure what's inside and

1017
00:41:21,690 --> 00:41:25,740
I've made a lot of<font color="#CCCCCC"> people angry in the</font>

1018
00:41:24,150 --> 00:41:28,500
industry but I've also made a lot of

1019
00:41:25,740 --> 00:41:30,359
<font color="#CCCCCC">people happy</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> because the manufacturers</font>

1020
00:41:28,500 --> 00:41:32,460
like in Fenian probably hates<font color="#E5E5E5"> me today</font>

1021
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:34,860
because<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the TPM break and I didn't</font>

1022
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:38,400
<font color="#E5E5E5">mean</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to do it to them in that way but</font>

1023
00:41:34,860 --> 00:41:39,900
but I'm it was important to get that out

1024
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:41,400
to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the public that you know it's not as</font>

1025
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:44,910
secure as you think it is who here uses

1026
00:41:41,400 --> 00:41:47,970
it a lot Andy token nobody<font color="#E5E5E5"> uses an</font>

Aladdin II token pro allowed any token

1028
00:41:47,970 --> 00:41:52,890
pro runs on something called the card OS

1029
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:54,360
anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> here use card OS your</font>

1031
00:41:54,360 --> 00:42:00,600
under the default key you do know so the

1032
00:41:58,050 --> 00:42:03,330
default key so basically it's a 66 that

1033
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:05,460
has<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> possibility of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> having some random</font>

of the eeprom the ROM is encrypted with

advantage of this this nice 64-bit X key

going to bear with me because I mean<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1053
00:42:48,930 --> 00:42:52,649
will get much better pick images this

1054
00:42:50,730 --> 00:42:58,789
way so i'll<font color="#CCCCCC"> start with that Mel I have a</font>

1055
00:42:52,650 --> 00:43:01,039
whole<font color="#E5E5E5"> Drive of images here I mean I've</font>

1056
00:42:58,789 --> 00:43:03,439
I've let everybody I don't you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know even</font>

1057
00:43:01,039 --> 00:43:05,089
know who to start with this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> 100 gigs</font>

1058
00:43:03,439 --> 00:43:08,719
but we'll start with what I planned for

1059
00:43:05,089 --> 00:43:12,589
the for the talk so we'll do atmel first

1060
00:43:08,719 --> 00:43:14,150
these are no<font color="#E5E5E5"> specific order really so</font>

1061
00:43:12,589 --> 00:43:16,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">that I'm mall security are it looks like</font>

1062
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:17,869
this<font color="#E5E5E5"> now this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a mesh that gives the</font>

1063
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:19,729
appearance that it that it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be what</font>

1064
00:43:17,869 --> 00:43:21,529
I call three-dimensional<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so when I</font>

1065
00:43:19,729 --> 00:43:24,649
the reason I call it three-dimensional

1066
00:43:21,529 --> 00:43:26,390
is because the mesh begins on for

1067
00:43:24,650 --> 00:43:28,669
example<font color="#E5E5E5"> hypothetically metal for and</font>

1068
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:29,839
then it goes under<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> middle three and</font>

1069
00:43:28,669 --> 00:43:31,699
then comes back up somewhere else on

1070
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:34,279
metal for again doing kind of a lane

1071
00:43:31,699 --> 00:43:36,380
shift and but then it's static down the

1072
00:43:34,279 --> 00:43:39,349
center so atmel missed something very

1073
00:43:36,380 --> 00:43:41,239
important on this design well one one

1074
00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:43,249
thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> that I should mention is it's not</font>

1075
00:43:41,239 --> 00:43:45,679
a 3d mesh because the mesh actually

1076
00:43:43,249 --> 00:43:47,538
doesn't go up and down it changes the

1077
00:43:45,679 --> 00:43:49,189
size and the<font color="#E5E5E5"> thickness of the track and</font>

1078
00:43:47,539 --> 00:43:51,049
that's why you get this effect over here

1079
00:43:49,189 --> 00:43:53,569
in the corner where it looks like<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's</font>

1080
00:43:51,049 --> 00:43:55,459
it looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like something's changed but</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if</font>

1081
00:43:53,569 --> 00:43:59,660
i zoom in on the on the next image which

1082
00:43:55,459 --> 00:44:02,209
is<font color="#E5E5E5"> just the very top row at a little</font>

1083
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:04,729
higher power you'll see that that really

1084
00:44:02,209 --> 00:44:06,649
this is just these why there's actually

1085
00:44:04,729 --> 00:44:09,078
an error here but these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> these wires</font>

1086
00:44:06,650 --> 00:44:11,299
that just came over<font color="#CCCCCC"> and then came down</font>

1087
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:12,619
and got thicker and they give they give

1088
00:44:11,299 --> 00:44:14,419
the appearance of being some type of<font color="#E5E5E5"> a</font>

1089
00:44:12,619 --> 00:44:16,849
<font color="#E5E5E5">narrow it so gives a really cool look</font>

1090
00:44:14,419 --> 00:44:18,558
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of an obscurity technique</font>

1091
00:44:16,849 --> 00:44:19,999
than anything else because as soon as

1092
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:22,039
you strip this with some hydrofluoric

1093
00:44:19,999 --> 00:44:23,718
acid you strip off the top metal you can

1094
00:44:22,039 --> 00:44:25,549
leave<font color="#E5E5E5"> the trowel we're in the glass and</font>

1095
00:44:23,719 --> 00:44:27,559
oxide and where the metal let where the

1096
00:44:25,549 --> 00:44:28,999
metal lived and so you can fall over

1097
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:31,880
where<font color="#CCCCCC"> the track went anyway with it</font>

1098
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:34,069
missing and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've known and most of these</font>

1099
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:36,589
mesh companies miss this the fact that

1100
00:44:34,069 --> 00:44:38,869
i'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to remove the entire mesh</font>

1101
00:44:36,589 --> 00:44:41,209
<font color="#E5E5E5">i'm going to remove a piece of the mesh</font>

know figure out<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it's 100 microns</font>

1106
00:44:47,869 --> 00:44:53,390
over and it's 140 microns up in the chip

1107
00:44:50,390 --> 00:44:55,368
you go to this location and then you<font color="#E5E5E5"> dig</font>

1108
00:44:53,390 --> 00:44:56,900
right there if you dig out some type of

1109
00:44:55,369 --> 00:44:59,449
a known reference as<font color="#CCCCCC"> I described in</font>

1110
00:44:56,900 --> 00:45:00,739
February and and and then that's the

1111
00:44:59,449 --> 00:45:06,380
only area that you're going to bridge

1112

nice chip it's only flash with<font color="#CCCCCC"> eeprom</font>

1117
00:45:17,850 --> 00:45:22,440
and then it has it has a bootloader that

they load into their flash that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you can</font>

00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:28,020
coprocessor and when<font color="#CCCCCC"> I first looked at</font>

1121
00:45:26,580 --> 00:45:31,140
it I thought<font color="#E5E5E5"> that this was actually some</font>

1122
00:45:28,020 --> 00:45:32,820
type of boot rom and so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I analyzed it</font>

1123
00:45:31,140 --> 00:45:36,359
but it<font color="#E5E5E5"> wasn't they weren't are they were</font>

1124
00:45:32,820 --> 00:45:38,550
not AVR opcodes it's some type of custom

1125
00:45:36,360 --> 00:45:40,980
<font color="#CCCCCC">cpu</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that they've designed for crypto for</font>

1126
00:45:38,550 --> 00:45:43,290
their<font color="#E5E5E5"> pki and so it's just kind of neat</font>

1127
00:45:40,980 --> 00:45:50,760
again it's an image from the from the

1128
00:45:43,290 --> 00:45:52,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">fib so the 64 64 looks like this now</font>

1129
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:54,330
this is wrong these were comments I made

1130
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:56,339
in the very<font color="#CCCCCC"> beginning and this is not a</font>

1131
00:45:54,330 --> 00:45:59,160
bootstrap rom you know or a bootloader

1132
00:45:56,340 --> 00:46:01,020
what this actually is is the crypto rom

1133
00:45:59,160 --> 00:46:02,670
and this is what<font color="#E5E5E5"> it looks like you know</font>

1134
00:46:01,020 --> 00:46:03,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">before</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it's stripped down and then the</font>

1135
00:46:02,670 --> 00:46:05,520
other picture you saw was when it's been

1136
00:46:03,990 --> 00:46:07,560
delayed to the very bottom of the chip

1137
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:10,200
basically the instruction registers

1138
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:13,080
<font color="#E5E5E5">atmel is Miss they've missed the boat</font>

1139
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:14,669
here so atmel things hahaha you know

1140
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:16,830
that we've covered the eeprom in the

1141
00:46:14,670 --> 00:46:18,180
flash because they're under this so if

1142
00:46:16,830 --> 00:46:20,279
you want to you know they're going to

1143
00:46:18,180 --> 00:46:23,040
probe this and they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to tell you</font>

1144
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:25,080
we've encrypted it and we've buried it

1145
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:26,910
under metal so get through it well guess

1146
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:29,580
what<font color="#E5E5E5"> I can get right through it in fact</font>

1147
00:46:26,910 --> 00:46:32,180
<font color="#E5E5E5">while</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this topic here all open</font>

1148
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:32,180
another folder

1149
00:46:35,820 --> 00:46:39,260
give me one second

1150
00:46:43,990 --> 00:46:47,020
I think these are the holes I was

1151
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:50,590
playing around with UV one night a long

1152
00:46:47,020 --> 00:46:52,810
time ago in 2003 and here's an example

1153
00:46:50,590 --> 00:46:54,550
so much for<font color="#E5E5E5"> that ground plane that it</font>

1154
00:46:52,810 --> 00:46:56,650
might it might even be VCC I have no

1155
00:46:54,550 --> 00:46:58,240
idea but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's probably grounded and so</font>

1156
00:46:56,650 --> 00:47:00,070
here you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see this chip still ran</font>

1157
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:02,379
when I was finished so there was there I

1158
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:04,420
you here I used a laser and I used it

1159
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:06,820
with green anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> ever work with</font>

1160
00:47:04,420 --> 00:47:08,950
<font color="#E5E5E5">laser cutters this is where they come in</font>

1161
00:47:06,820 --> 00:47:11,530
useful even if it's like you know

1162
00:47:08,950 --> 00:47:13,180
smaller than 350 you get solid<font color="#CCCCCC"> plains of</font>

1163
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:14,950
metal like this they're perfect and so

1164
00:47:13,180 --> 00:47:16,868
here I used UV but it just it<font color="#CCCCCC"> wasn't</font>

1165
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:18,939
good enough so then I use green but it

1166
00:47:16,869 --> 00:47:21,760
was too low of power so here I used

1167
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:24,369
green and then I used UV to finish the

1168
00:47:21,760 --> 00:47:27,190
<font color="#CCCCCC">job and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> then I actually hit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it hit these</font>

1169
00:47:24,369 --> 00:47:30,340
two power planes be you know vdd or VPP

1170
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:32,260
I guess it's VPP and probably the ground

1171
00:47:30,340 --> 00:47:34,150
or something inside the chip and I put

1172
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:36,970
<font color="#E5E5E5">needle on it and this was just like a</font>

1173
00:47:34,150 --> 00:47:38,590
proof of practice you know so these

1174
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:40,450
techniques are very important<font color="#CCCCCC"> you learn</font>

1175
00:47:38,590 --> 00:47:43,420
you know like I might show you something

1176
00:47:40,450 --> 00:47:44,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">that's on a 1990 chip but if you think</font>

1177
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:49,119
<font color="#CCCCCC">about it it's probably usable still</font>

1178
00:47:44,980 --> 00:47:50,290
today so the<font color="#CCCCCC"> to this chip you look at</font>

1179
00:47:49,119 --> 00:47:52,660
and you're<font color="#E5E5E5"> like where are the</font>

1180
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:55,900
instruction registers so does<font color="#E5E5E5"> anybody</font>

1181
00:47:52,660 --> 00:48:01,529
have any idea how to<font color="#E5E5E5"> find them anybody</font>

1182
00:47:55,900 --> 00:48:01,530
come on somebody<font color="#CCCCCC"> costin know</font>

1183
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:08,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">Yahoo but this is an AVR it has 16</font>

1184
00:48:06,360 --> 00:48:09,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">flip-flops of the comment clock so</font>

1185
00:48:08,190 --> 00:48:11,250
<font color="#E5E5E5">basically we start to strip the chip</font>

1186
00:48:09,750 --> 00:48:13,350
down we strip it layer by layer top

1187
00:48:11,250 --> 00:48:14,640
metal strip it off actually one of them

1188
00:48:13,350 --> 00:48:16,049
you're<font color="#CCCCCC"> going to leave it alone maybe you</font>

1189
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,220
polish it down a little bit you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know to</font>

1190
00:48:16,050 --> 00:48:20,670
get rid of<font color="#E5E5E5"> some of the passivation</font>

1191
00:48:17,220 --> 00:48:22,350
sometimes the dye will look clearer in

1192
00:48:20,670 --> 00:48:23,670
your images if you if you if you mill it

1193
00:48:22,350 --> 00:48:26,430
for a little bit on a lapping machine

1194
00:48:23,670 --> 00:48:28,470
just lap it down a little bit remove a

1195
00:48:26,430 --> 00:48:31,230
few microns of the of the passivation

1196
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:33,089
that very top oxide so you strip this

1197
00:48:31,230 --> 00:48:34,590
down layer by layer and then you do you

1198
00:48:33,090 --> 00:48:36,030
do photo mosaics of the areas where you

1199
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:37,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">think they might</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be and you're looking</font>

1200
00:48:36,030 --> 00:48:38,910
<font color="#E5E5E5">for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you're looking for some flip flops</font>

1201
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:40,800
they're gonna have a common clock now

1202
00:48:38,910 --> 00:48:42,480
you know these flip-flops are not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font>

1203
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:44,010
to be in the middle<font color="#E5E5E5"> of this they could</font>

1204
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:47,070
be but they're probably not going to be

1205
00:48:44,010 --> 00:48:48,900
because what what you've got an

1206
00:48:47,070 --> 00:48:51,030
instruction register here that has to

1207
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:52,680
decode and trickle out into to decode

1208
00:48:51,030 --> 00:48:55,290
every instruction the AVR has and

1209
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:57,629
there's like 133 instructions are 132

1210
00:48:55,290 --> 00:48:58,800
instructions in an AVR so the lack the

1211
00:48:57,630 --> 00:49:00,090
instruction registers are the

1212
00:48:58,800 --> 00:49:01,380
instruction latches depending how

1213
00:49:00,090 --> 00:49:02,730
they've designed it are going to be

1214
00:49:01,380 --> 00:49:05,070
somewhere near the edge typically and

1215
00:49:02,730 --> 00:49:07,560
this is not for sure a hundred percent

1216
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:09,090
but I will almost guarantee<font color="#E5E5E5"> you you'll</font>

1217
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:12,240
find them quickly if you look on<font color="#CCCCCC"> a look</font>

1218
00:49:09,090 --> 00:49:14,610
near<font color="#CCCCCC"> the edge but Admiral brags in their</font>

1219
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:16,770
toes the Common Criteria valuations that

1220
00:49:14,610 --> 00:49:19,950
this is all encrypted so even if you sat

1221
00:49:16,770 --> 00:49:21,390
on on the eeprom or the or the<font color="#E5E5E5"> RAM or</font>

1222
00:49:19,950 --> 00:49:22,470
any of these Rams you're not going to

1223
00:49:21,390 --> 00:49:24,330
understand anything because everything's

1224
00:49:22,470 --> 00:49:26,580
encrypted but what they don't tell you

1225
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:28,740
<font color="#CCCCCC">is encryption to them is a few few bit</font>

1226
00:49:26,580 --> 00:49:30,960
swaps some in verses and the necks or

1227
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:33,450
things like this it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> silly today</font>

1228
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:37,050
I mean no one truly is doing real true

1229
00:49:33,450 --> 00:49:38,609
hardcore you know des decryption and

1230
00:49:37,050 --> 00:49:40,320
really<font color="#E5E5E5"> if you think about it how can</font>

1231
00:49:38,610 --> 00:49:42,900
they because you're dealing with you

1232
00:49:40,320 --> 00:49:44,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">know let's say four byte fetch that's</font>

1233
00:49:42,900 --> 00:49:45,990
the max pretty much you're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to deal</font>

1234
00:49:44,220 --> 00:49:47,939
with<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> it on an 8-bit CPU four bytes</font>

instruction typical instructions one bed

1237
00:49:49,920 --> 00:49:54,600
one bit and also you have<font color="#CCCCCC"> the trade-off</font>

1238
00:49:51,870 --> 00:49:57,180
of time how you know you can trickle

1239
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:59,850
through logic in<font color="#CCCCCC"> it adds propagation</font>

1240
00:49:57,180 --> 00:50:01,799
delay to to the you know to<font color="#E5E5E5"> the circuit</font>

1241
00:49:59,850 --> 00:50:04,589
and that becomes your maximum clock

1242
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:06,810
frequency you can run at but to really

1243
00:50:04,590 --> 00:50:08,940
<font color="#E5E5E5">do like sixteen rounds of des you know</font>

1244
00:50:06,810 --> 00:50:13,110
it's not happening on any of these small

1245
00:50:08,940 --> 00:50:15,690
processors so here if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you look on the</font>

1246
00:50:13,110 --> 00:50:17,190
side ml talks about<font color="#E5E5E5"> 72 lines coming out</font>

1247
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:19,200
of the chip for debug testing

1248
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:20,970
well these 72 lines are right here down

1249
00:50:19,200 --> 00:50:22,589
on<font color="#CCCCCC"> Polly so I'm else it's how you can't</font>

1250
00:50:20,970 --> 00:50:24,598
get too many more than we saw them off

1251
00:50:22,589 --> 00:50:26,279
the wafer after production well they

1252
00:50:24,599 --> 00:50:28,800
<font color="#E5E5E5">sought them off that right here then you</font>

1253
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:30,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">can get</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to them with a fib but if you</font>

1254
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:33,599
follow these they come to what is

1255
00:50:30,900 --> 00:50:35,520
basically a MUX and so at one of<font color="#E5E5E5"> these</font>

1256
00:50:33,599 --> 00:50:37,920
lines<font color="#E5E5E5"> that had a pull up on it actually</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">determined if you were going to run code</font>

1259
00:50:40,770 --> 00:50:45,390
the onboard flashes and this is how

1260
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:47,189

1262
00:50:47,190 --> 00:50:50,430
loader because how else are they going

1263
00:50:48,780 --> 00:50:52,530
to get it in unless they're probing the

1264
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:55,049
die but there's metal the top metal is

1265
00:50:52,530 --> 00:50:56,970
covering the entire surface so they come

1266
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:59,010
up<font color="#E5E5E5"> with this really cool idea but it was</font>

1267
00:50:56,970 --> 00:51:00,779
a really<font color="#E5E5E5"> bad</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> idea because guess what's</font>

00:50:59,010 --> 00:51:04,859
near these lines the instruction

1275
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:23,670
is look how close to the edge you are on

1276
00:51:21,869 --> 00:51:25,140
this chip every chip you're always near

1277
00:51:23,670 --> 00:51:26,550
the edge somewhere and everything on

this side<font color="#CCCCCC"> of it has to do everything</font>

1283
00:51:35,430 --> 00:51:37,759
it's latched

1284
00:51:40,270 --> 00:51:49,570
does anybody have questions can I say

1285
00:51:45,340 --> 00:51:55,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">that please say it show you one where</font>

1286
00:51:49,570 --> 00:52:05,230
I've what I've never failed that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay</font>

1287
00:51:55,750 --> 00:52:08,020
so I would I say again what what hi what

1288
00:52:05,230 --> 00:52:10,090
about des fire and sinew and XP pretend

1289
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:12,340
to be high secure a ship's like the

1290
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:15,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">decks fire eight I've never</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> seen it I</font>

1291
00:52:12,340 --> 00:52:17,200
don't know<font color="#E5E5E5"> but the des des fire chips</font>

1292
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:19,570
from from back in the old Krypton one

1293
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:22,240
era when mr. Noah was dr. Noah was

1294
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:24,790
working<font color="#E5E5E5"> on it and so I have frozen des</font>

1295
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:27,609
fires that are on like to 2 50 nanometer

1296
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:29,920
process but with it with a simmer a fib

1297
00:52:27,610 --> 00:52:32,830
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter how small they go you're</font>

1298
00:52:29,920 --> 00:52:34,480
still only as secure as<font color="#E5E5E5"> middle one so</font>

1299
00:52:32,830 --> 00:52:36,190
you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> I shouldn't say metal one even</font>

1300
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:39,010
I should say that<font color="#CCCCCC"> the side the width of</font>

1301
00:52:36,190 --> 00:52:41,470
the track so the chips you know they can

1302
00:52:39,010 --> 00:52:43,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">go to 10 nanometers I don't care I can</font>

1303
00:52:41,470 --> 00:52:45,069
still see<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and I can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> still touch their</font>

1304
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:46,750
metal there metal tracks will never be

1305
00:52:45,070 --> 00:52:49,900
10 nanometers wide that's sexual gate

1306
00:52:46,750 --> 00:52:54,850
and so the metal tracks typically are

1307
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:57,730
300 nanometers 400 nanometers 500 and

1308
00:52:54,850 --> 00:53:00,130
meters and up any any smaller I haven't

1309
00:52:57,730 --> 00:53:03,520
seen what do you know your track with on

1310
00:53:00,130 --> 00:53:04,960
like a 45 nanometer process no it's

1311
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:06,820
going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be small but I have a feeling</font>

1312
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:10,240
it's going to it's gonna be at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> 100</font>

1313
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:13,030
<font color="#E5E5E5">nanometers I've never seen</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> one to really</font>

1314
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:15,490
compare so so here you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see now these</font>

1315
00:53:13,030 --> 00:53:18,550
these bits were these bits word figured

1316
00:53:15,490 --> 00:53:20,919
out because you know i no see I've been

1317
00:53:18,550 --> 00:53:24,400
in<font color="#CCCCCC"> two I've been in two computers since</font>

1318
00:53:20,920 --> 00:53:27,880
I was like nine years<font color="#E5E5E5"> old so I've had a</font>

1319
00:53:24,400 --> 00:53:30,610
computer since like 78 and basically

1320
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:33,400
I've written in<font color="#E5E5E5"> like every language you</font>

1321
00:53:30,610 --> 00:53:36,190
can think<font color="#E5E5E5"> of except i accept the arm i</font>

1322
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:38,800
rana CLE enough it's so popular<font color="#CCCCCC"> i know</font>

1323
00:53:36,190 --> 00:53:42,400
it only<font color="#E5E5E5"> as much as I need to but I'm so</font>

1324
00:53:38,800 --> 00:53:43,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">I love the AVR I love it a lot and so</font>

1325
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:44,980
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> have to know the languages of these</font>

1326
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:46,330
chips that's something i didn't say

1327
00:53:44,980 --> 00:53:49,930
before us knowing the language of these

1328
00:53:46,330 --> 00:53:51,370
chips I you learn to recognize the way

1329
00:53:49,930 --> 00:53:54,040
the order of the bitch should go now

1330
00:53:51,370 --> 00:53:57,220
this was completely randomly placed

1331
00:53:54,040 --> 00:54:01,570
and you know so bit 6 ended up here bit

1332
00:53:57,220 --> 00:54:03,430
7 bit one bit 5 but 10 20 bit 8 11 and

1333
00:54:01,570 --> 00:54:05,200
it's just the dot you have to deduce it

1334
00:54:03,430 --> 00:54:07,089
you have to you know study<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and look</font>

1335
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:09,310
at it and and take it<font color="#E5E5E5"> out you know take</font>

1336
00:54:07,090 --> 00:54:11,410
a run take a run take a run and honestly

1337
00:54:09,310 --> 00:54:13,779
on a 16-bit proc processor it's a pain

1338
00:54:11,410 --> 00:54:15,100
in the butt it really is and there's

1339
00:54:13,780 --> 00:54:17,200
other challenges to that I'm not even to

1340
00:54:15,100 --> 00:54:18,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">get into like internal clock when they</font>

1341
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:21,430
come out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of resets thing and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> sync things</font>

1342
00:54:18,790 --> 00:54:22,750
like this but what i want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to show you</font>

1343
00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:26,740
about this picture what's the that's

1344
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:28,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">important to me is is I've written all</font>

1345
00:54:26,740 --> 00:54:32,200
over it but you didn't see it yet that's

1346
00:54:28,330 --> 00:54:35,830
why i opened it in photoshop so we got

1347
00:54:32,200 --> 00:54:38,770
an ugly poly layer here so what used ice

1348
00:54:35,830 --> 00:54:40,299
tools like Carson those d gate at things

1349
00:54:38,770 --> 00:54:42,160
like this<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you can you can study the</font>

1350
00:54:40,300 --> 00:54:44,770
<font color="#E5E5E5">flip flops pretty easily or you can find</font>

1351
00:54:42,160 --> 00:54:46,629
<font color="#E5E5E5">them on your own I'm not I try to use</font>

1352
00:54:44,770 --> 00:54:49,509
the gate and I don't have success early

1353
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:51,520
but we're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work on that so um</font>

1354
00:54:49,510 --> 00:54:52,930
you<font color="#CCCCCC"> can see here you've got a bunch of</font>

1355
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:55,000
flip flops but these flip-flops are

1356
00:54:52,930 --> 00:54:57,669
different they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> very unique in the in</font>

1357
00:54:55,000 --> 00:55:00,580
the architecture now finding these took

1358
00:54:57,670 --> 00:55:04,120
a while it probably i would say took

1359
00:55:00,580 --> 00:55:05,920
like a month but this is the first time

1360
00:55:04,120 --> 00:55:10,210
that I went after one something like

1361
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:13,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">this so it's not it's tricky so that's</font>

1362
00:55:10,210 --> 00:55:16,060
<font color="#E5E5E5">Polly you get your</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> metal one now you</font>

1363
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:17,620
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> your metal two and then if you want</font>

1364
00:55:16,060 --> 00:55:19,540
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> have ugly middle three but I won't</font>

1365
00:55:17,620 --> 00:55:21,970
I'm not<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to turn it on so now you</font>

1366
00:55:19,540 --> 00:55:26,230
start to add things now let's add d0

1367
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:28,839
trace there's the d0 trace so d0 on off

1368
00:55:26,230 --> 00:55:32,260
you can see it now if we do turn on

1369
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:33,640
metal three and now you<font color="#E5E5E5"> follow d0 look</font>

1370
00:55:32,260 --> 00:55:36,250
at that it's coming out on top metal

1371
00:55:33,640 --> 00:55:38,620
what if i told you that every one of the

1372
00:55:36,250 --> 00:55:40,360
data bus bits comes to top metal you can

1373
00:55:38,620 --> 00:55:42,040
hit this chip with a laser you do not

1374
00:55:40,360 --> 00:55:44,830
need a fib to attack this any of<font color="#CCCCCC"> those</font>

1375
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:46,240
older at<font color="#CCCCCC"> mels smart cards when I told</font>

1376
00:55:44,830 --> 00:55:47,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">atmel they laughed they said oh that's</font>

1377
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,629
old so it doesn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> matter</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you're as</font>

1378
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:51,970
strong as your weakest<font color="#CCCCCC"> link this gives</font>

1379
00:55:49,630 --> 00:55:55,270
me an indoor to the AVR architecture

1380
00:55:51,970 --> 00:55:58,419
that that that today's that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there that</font>

1381
00:55:55,270 --> 00:56:00,790
<font color="#E5E5E5">today's platform is built upon so they</font>

1382
00:55:58,420 --> 00:56:03,700
don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> just make something from scratch</font>

1383
00:56:00,790 --> 00:56:05,740
yes they do you know in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> very early</font>

1384
00:56:03,700 --> 00:56:06,520
days and then they build and they build

1385
00:56:05,740 --> 00:56:07,600
again and they bill

1386
00:56:06,520 --> 00:56:11,680
again they don't knock the house down

1387
00:56:07,600 --> 00:56:13,330
<font color="#E5E5E5">and start over and so you learn a lot</font>

1388
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:16,029
from the<font color="#CCCCCC"> ole you learn a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> lot by studying</font>

1389
00:56:13,330 --> 00:56:17,920
their older technologies but anyway all

1390
00:56:16,030 --> 00:56:20,110
the traces came up to top metal and you

1391
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:28,480
can turn them<font color="#E5E5E5"> on and it's pretty wild</font>

1392
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:30,430
let me zoom<font color="#E5E5E5"> out so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> as</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you can see so it</font>

1393
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:33,550
really<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really wonder i hear these guys</font>

1394
00:56:30,430 --> 00:56:35,230
all the time that they say you know uh

1395
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:38,110
video site for<font color="#CCCCCC"> two-plus can't be hacked</font>

00:56:43,720 --> 00:56:47,169
enough effort and then someone that's

1400
00:56:45,730 --> 00:56:50,530
motivated and focused and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i'm not saying</font>

1401
00:56:47,170 --> 00:56:52,420
the trek TV or indie or Naga or<font color="#CCCCCC"> anybody</font>

1402
00:56:50,530 --> 00:56:53,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">is going to be hacked you know but but</font>

1403
00:56:52,420 --> 00:56:55,120
they could be<font color="#CCCCCC"> in theory they're not</font>

1404
00:56:53,770 --> 00:56:57,460
they're not as strong as you think they

1405
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:59,020
are they that you think they<font color="#E5E5E5"> are so we</font>

1406
00:56:57,460 --> 00:57:00,850
go back<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this general instruments chip</font>

1407
00:56:59,020 --> 00:57:03,790
anybody familiar with the GI video

1408
00:57:00,850 --> 00:57:06,670
cipher system so it got cracked back in

1409
00:57:03,790 --> 00:57:08,140
i<font color="#CCCCCC"> guess the early 80s and then they came</font>

1410
00:57:06,670 --> 00:57:10,840
out with the two plus never got correct

1411
00:57:08,140 --> 00:57:12,580
at least<font color="#E5E5E5"> not that I'm aware of and I</font>

1412
00:57:10,840 --> 00:57:14,500
<font color="#E5E5E5">don't I don't know why</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I really don't</font>

1413
00:57:12,580 --> 00:57:18,759
the chip might have been custom but it

1414
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:21,130
was some type of a TI MSP<font color="#CCCCCC"> for like a TMS</font>

1415
00:57:18,760 --> 00:57:23,140
370 type ship and so you look at<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and</font>

1416
00:57:21,130 --> 00:57:25,090
you've got you've got some non-volatile

1417
00:57:23,140 --> 00:57:26,859
memory here<font color="#E5E5E5"> you got some static Ram you</font>

1418
00:57:25,090 --> 00:57:28,360
got more static<font color="#E5E5E5"> Ram and then here's the</font>

1419
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:29,890
core and look what we see here what's

1420
00:57:28,360 --> 00:57:35,320
this who can say what this is<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font>

1421
00:57:29,890 --> 00:57:39,490
discussed this before micro or PLA one

1422
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:40,840
of the two so<font color="#E5E5E5"> its instruction registers</font>

1423
00:57:39,490 --> 00:57:42,939
are somewhere<font color="#CCCCCC"> in this area there</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1424
00:57:40,840 --> 00:57:45,010
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're right here so there's your eight</font>

1425
00:57:42,940 --> 00:57:47,500
registers freeze the latch dump the

1426
00:57:45,010 --> 00:57:48,790
whole chip and then and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then there's</font>

1427
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:50,170
other<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think there's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> probably some</font>

1428
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:52,090
other challenges there may be an ASIC in

1429
00:57:50,170 --> 00:57:55,150
here too i don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> know but the chips</font>

1430
00:57:52,090 --> 00:57:57,340
geometry was humongous and the guys were

1431
00:57:55,150 --> 00:58:00,270
cocky too they put a little put a little

1432
00:57:57,340 --> 00:58:03,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">rocket ship on it so it says</font>

1433
00:58:00,270 --> 00:58:05,940
team bonding<font color="#E5E5E5"> I I it's funny some of the</font>

1434
00:58:03,660 --> 00:58:08,040
things you<font color="#E5E5E5"> see you know as st puts frogs</font>

1435
00:58:05,940 --> 00:58:11,430
on all their chips and these guys put

1436
00:58:08,040 --> 00:58:14,400
you know team<font color="#CCCCCC"> bonsai so and if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we zoom</font>

1437
00:58:11,430 --> 00:58:16,230
in a little closer<font color="#CCCCCC"> i just wanted to show</font>

1438
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:18,660
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> the bonsai logo a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> little bit closer</font>

1439
00:58:16,230 --> 00:58:20,640
but what's ironic here is<font color="#CCCCCC"> i can tell</font>

1440
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:23,430
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> this is made</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> by</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> t.i this looks</font>

1441
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:24,870
exactly<font color="#E5E5E5"> like the older TI chips</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and you</font>

1442
00:58:23,430 --> 00:58:26,879
<font color="#CCCCCC">can tell the footprint the way the</font>

1443
00:58:24,870 --> 00:58:30,450
process<font color="#E5E5E5"> is layed who makes the chip like</font>

1444
00:58:26,880 --> 00:58:32,340
<font color="#CCCCCC">i can spot TSMC any day any time on like</font>

1445
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:35,100
the to 50 nanometer process and the 3 50

1446
00:58:32,340 --> 00:58:38,040
nanometer process and it's interesting

1447
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:40,290
because once<font color="#CCCCCC"> i study their flash on one</font>

1448
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:42,360
it's the same<font color="#CCCCCC"> on the others that use</font>

1449
00:58:40,290 --> 00:58:44,730
that same type of flash maybe it's 16

1450
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:46,920
bits though instead of<font color="#E5E5E5"> 8 bits it just it</font>

1451
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:49,350
just depends so here's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> 200 power</font>

1452
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:51,120
resolution image of the of the

1453
00:58:49,350 --> 00:58:52,440
instruction registers so you have eight

1454
00:58:51,120 --> 00:58:54,540
<font color="#CCCCCC">flip flops sitting right here you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1455
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:57,390
one here and there's an output here if

1456
00:58:54,540 --> 00:58:59,640
you can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> it on the screen here's</font>

1457
00:58:57,390 --> 00:59:00,779
<font color="#CCCCCC">another one that is anybody what can</font>

1458
00:58:59,640 --> 00:59:01,980
anybody tell me what they see in this

1459
00:59:00,780 --> 00:59:03,990
image something there's something weird

1460
00:59:01,980 --> 00:59:05,190
about this image anybody recognize you

1461
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:08,189
<font color="#CCCCCC">what</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see what's special about this</font>

1462
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:10,710
there's metal there's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> top layer</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1463
00:59:08,190 --> 00:59:12,900
metal put over this area so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this was</font>

1464
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:14,760
done on purpose these guys knew that

1465
00:59:12,900 --> 00:59:18,870
this was a weakness<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the chip and so</font>

1466
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:20,040
they they covered this on purpose so you

1467
00:59:18,870 --> 00:59:22,410
can't get to it without digging a hole

1468
00:59:20,040 --> 00:59:25,230
through it first so this was this for

1469
00:59:22,410 --> 00:59:27,000
<font color="#CCCCCC">very early methods of protecting what</font>

1470
00:59:25,230 --> 00:59:28,500
they deemed a valuable space you know

1471
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:31,740
area of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that you know of the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> chips</font>

1472
00:59:28,500 --> 00:59:33,630
sacred area and here you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> see this is</font>

1473
00:59:31,740 --> 00:59:36,149
one of these is like set and reset for

1474
00:59:33,630 --> 00:59:37,620
further for the flip-flop and so you

1475
00:59:36,150 --> 00:59:39,930
just check them in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the one that's that's</font>

1476
00:59:37,620 --> 00:59:42,029
that's holding the opcode when it's low

1477
00:59:39,930 --> 00:59:44,399
stable is the one that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want to that</font>

1478
00:59:42,030 --> 00:59:45,690
<font color="#CCCCCC">you want</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to freeze and so there's your</font>

1479
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,730
eight bits there's two more and there's

1480
00:59:45,690 --> 00:59:49,680
two more if you<font color="#CCCCCC"> settle the data bus</font>

1481
00:59:47,730 --> 00:59:51,180
right here you'd see you'd see the

1482
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:53,730
opcode that they're executing for the

1483
00:59:51,180 --> 00:59:56,700
entire cycle of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the amount of cycles</font>

1484
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:58,200
that that instruction took does anybody

1485
00:59:56,700 --> 01:00:01,319
<font color="#E5E5E5">have questions so far am I going to</font>

1486
00:59:58,200 --> 01:00:05,160
faster or not explaining clear enough or

1487
01:00:01,320 --> 01:00:08,220
should I speed up we got a lot more

1488
01:00:05,160 --> 01:00:13,348
stuff this is old stuff<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so</font>

1489
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:15,240
it's a cool chip from from fujitsu

1490
01:00:13,349 --> 01:00:18,930
anybody here with the use fujitsu chips

1491
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:20,669
no so it looked like a mess they did

1492
01:00:18,930 --> 01:00:22,890
some weird<font color="#E5E5E5"> stuff but look again</font>

1493
01:00:20,670 --> 01:00:25,320
microcode right here or PLA whatever

1494
01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:26,879
whichever it is and here's the bus lines

1495
01:00:25,320 --> 01:00:28,530
but what threw me off when I looked<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font>

1496
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,300
this the first time<font color="#E5E5E5"> was the bus lines</font>

1497
01:00:28,530 --> 01:00:32,369
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> nothing came in from the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> bottom</font>

1498
01:00:30,300 --> 01:00:33,750
of the chip right here and then I the

1499
01:00:32,369 --> 01:00:36,450
only place I saw the data bus come in

1500
01:00:33,750 --> 01:00:38,369
was way out of its not in<font color="#E5E5E5"> this image its</font>

1501
01:00:36,450 --> 01:00:40,529
way out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> view on the left the eight</font>

1502
01:00:38,369 --> 01:00:41,910
bits came in but then I looked at a

1503
01:00:40,530 --> 01:00:43,440
little closer<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I only had one of</font>

1504
01:00:41,910 --> 01:00:45,060
these chips to look at I guess I

1505
01:00:43,440 --> 01:00:47,880
couldn't strip it down but what i could

1506
01:00:45,060 --> 01:00:50,430
do is image it high res now and then

1507
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:52,650
rebond it and and power it up and work

1508
01:00:50,430 --> 01:00:54,660
with it<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so i imaged it high res and</font>

1509
01:00:52,650 --> 01:00:57,960
then studied it and what I was able<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1510
01:00:54,660 --> 01:01:00,750
study was that this was<font color="#E5E5E5"> basically late</font>

1511
01:00:57,960 --> 01:01:03,480
as<font color="#CCCCCC"> rose eight rows across the chip in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

1512
01:01:00,750 --> 01:01:05,609
the area of the core and so the you know

1513
01:01:03,480 --> 01:01:08,790
in these rows you each row was a bit

1514
01:01:05,609 --> 01:01:11,430
wait d0 d1 d2 d3 d4 and so forth<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1515
01:01:08,790 --> 01:01:13,740
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually happened was the bus line</font>

1516
01:01:11,430 --> 01:01:16,500
came in went down to<font color="#CCCCCC"> the bottom layer of</font>

1517
01:01:13,740 --> 01:01:18,810
metal and came entirely across the chip

1518
01:01:16,500 --> 01:01:21,630
and popped out here and then popped out

1519
01:01:18,810 --> 01:01:24,119
here and popped out here so all all

1520
01:01:21,630 --> 01:01:26,339
eight bits popped out here and meanwhile

1521
01:01:24,119 --> 01:01:29,700
they interconnected at various points

1522
01:01:26,339 --> 01:01:32,190
what I'll call columns force a data

1523
01:01:29,700 --> 01:01:34,319
point of register program counter you

1524
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:37,440
know register one register to whatever

1525
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:38,700
the architecture is and but but the most

1526
01:01:37,440 --> 01:01:40,230
important thing<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the chip that makes</font>

1527
01:01:38,700 --> 01:01:42,450
this thing tick is they come up here

1528
01:01:40,230 --> 01:01:44,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">they trickle through and then they</font>

1529
01:01:42,450 --> 01:01:47,368
plugged into eight<font color="#CCCCCC"> flip-flops up here</font>

1530
01:01:44,070 --> 01:01:48,599
and then they had then they had a nice

1531
01:01:47,369 --> 01:01:51,240
line here that followed through the

1532
01:01:48,599 --> 01:01:53,430
inverter that basically was was always

1533
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:55,049
driven low so hold it low set and sit<font color="#CCCCCC"> on</font>

1534
01:01:53,430 --> 01:01:56,640
the bus he's<font color="#CCCCCC"> drop</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the bus and you walk</font>

1535
01:01:55,050 --> 01:01:58,290
the bus with one needle so with two

1536
01:01:56,640 --> 01:01:59,580
needles you dump this chip and you've

1537
01:01:58,290 --> 01:02:04,589
dumped every other chip that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've spoke</font>

1538
01:01:59,580 --> 01:02:07,440
about so<font color="#CCCCCC"> far today microtech is this</font>

1539
01:02:04,589 --> 01:02:10,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">Chinese smart card company microchip</font>

1540
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:13,619
<font color="#CCCCCC">microtech used the same exact flash that</font>

1541
01:02:10,830 --> 01:02:15,509
TSA you know from TSMC except TSMC's at

1542
01:02:13,619 --> 01:02:18,210
all now we have filler metal on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1543
01:02:15,510 --> 01:02:19,349
surface so it's more secure something

1544
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:20,430
like this they're going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to probably be</font>

1545
01:02:19,349 --> 01:02:22,080
<font color="#CCCCCC">peddling and</font>

1546
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:23,640
but<font color="#E5E5E5"> I've already studied the flash on</font>

1547
01:02:22,080 --> 01:02:26,130
the older freescale parts that you can

1548
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:27,330
buy the 908 series of<font color="#E5E5E5"> free scale and so</font>

1549
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:29,580
you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see here the ordering of the</font>

1550
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:32,460
flash the chances that the user that

1551
01:02:29,580 --> 01:02:35,160
<font color="#E5E5E5">designed into this TSMC process modified</font>

1552
01:02:32,460 --> 01:02:40,140
these lines is probable is almost zero

1553
01:02:35,160 --> 01:02:42,690
zero possibly 0% possibly so here's that

1554
01:02:40,140 --> 01:02:46,560
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> died and here I've marked exactly</font>

1555
01:02:42,690 --> 01:02:49,860
what to do so I've said<font color="#CCCCCC"> okay it's 25 to</font>

1556
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:52,860
27 spaces over for you know from m3 I

1557
01:02:49,860 --> 01:02:57,030
don't know really what I mean they're

1558
01:02:52,860 --> 01:02:59,010
actually but you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know I think</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I don't</font>

1559
01:02:57,030 --> 01:03:00,870
know anyway so and then right in this

1560
01:02:59,010 --> 01:03:03,390
box is where I want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to dig and what's</font>

1561
01:03:00,870 --> 01:03:05,850
under there is data bus bit 0 and so

1562
01:03:03,390 --> 01:03:06,870
what is I made an assumption here

1563
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:09,900
because when I had stripped it down

1564
01:03:06,870 --> 01:03:11,850
these are this is a stripped-down<font color="#E5E5E5"> ship</font>

1565
01:03:09,900 --> 01:03:13,470
but I didn't polish it so if I polished

1566
01:03:11,850 --> 01:03:14,700
it with a lapping machine I could get

1567
01:03:13,470 --> 01:03:18,629
rid of<font color="#E5E5E5"> all the oxide here and make</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> this</font>

1568
01:03:14,700 --> 01:03:20,040
look smooth as can be just some notes on

1569
01:03:18,630 --> 01:03:22,650
the chip there's that filler again it's

1570
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:24,960
everywhere here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> some dark images of it</font>

1571
01:03:22,650 --> 01:03:26,610
I'm just<font color="#E5E5E5"> looking for the bright image so</font>

1572
01:03:24,960 --> 01:03:29,610
here's a dealer chip and we've got a

1573
01:03:26,610 --> 01:03:32,100
huge flash here 128 kilobytes we got two

1574
01:03:29,610 --> 01:03:33,840
huge aesthetic<font color="#CCCCCC"> grams we've got two small</font>

1575
01:03:32,100 --> 01:03:35,880
static Rams they should be the 256

1576
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:38,340
internal bites and then we have a boot

1577
01:03:35,880 --> 01:03:39,960
<font color="#CCCCCC">ROM so there's a rum right here well</font>

1578
01:03:38,340 --> 01:03:41,730
guess what I'll bet you money that they

1579
01:03:39,960 --> 01:03:43,620
boot from this rom and then they then

1580
01:03:41,730 --> 01:03:47,250
they then they check the flash for like

1581
01:03:43,620 --> 01:03:48,839
ffs or something and if they see FF then

1582
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:50,730
they boot they stay<font color="#CCCCCC"> in the rom and they</font>

1583
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:52,500
let you download or<font color="#E5E5E5"> upload to it you</font>

1584
01:03:50,730 --> 01:03:55,380
know read or write to the flash very

1585
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:57,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">poor very poor instantiation of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1586
01:03:55,380 --> 01:04:00,120
security measure this is supposed to be

1587
01:03:57,120 --> 01:04:01,319
a smart card remember so here's the ATR

1588
01:04:00,120 --> 01:04:03,810
coming out of the chip from what<font color="#E5E5E5"> this</font>

1589
01:04:01,320 --> 01:04:05,520
went to and so a<font color="#CCCCCC"> TRS coming out of the</font>

1590
01:04:03,810 --> 01:04:07,799
chip<font color="#E5E5E5"> and old and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I'm just sitting there</font>

1591
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:09,360
with a needle down on d0 and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm taking</font>

1592
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:12,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">the other end i'm not even using a</font>

1593
01:04:09,360 --> 01:04:16,020
buffer and i'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> taking the the needle of</font>

1594
01:04:12,660 --> 01:04:18,270
the end of a coax that<font color="#E5E5E5"> lion and I'm</font>

1595
01:04:16,020 --> 01:04:20,280
shorting it on ground and so it just

1596
01:04:18,270 --> 01:04:22,950
literally like this as it's resetting

1597
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:26,880
and lo and behold all of a sudden on

1598
01:04:22,950 --> 01:04:28,410
clock on reset<font color="#E5E5E5"> 3b the ATR changed well</font>

1599
01:04:26,880 --> 01:04:30,630
guess what<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was the bootloader h er</font>

1600
01:04:28,410 --> 01:04:33,029
and so i glitched it back into the

1601
01:04:30,630 --> 01:04:35,459
bootloader using a simple you<font color="#CCCCCC"> know my</font>

1602
01:04:33,029 --> 01:04:38,669
my hand with with a window with a probe

1603
01:04:35,459 --> 01:04:40,229
in my hand just it's it's crazy but this

1604
01:04:38,669 --> 01:04:47,279
is a secure smart card from a Chinese

1605
01:04:40,229 --> 01:04:48,749
manufacturer so sorry it is a ski this

1606
01:04:47,279 --> 01:04:51,659
is actually a dream box clone ship for

1607
01:04:48,749 --> 01:04:53,339
the dream box free to<font color="#CCCCCC"> air receivers so</font>

1608
01:04:51,659 --> 01:04:55,140
this was some dream box<font color="#E5E5E5"> smart card ship</font>

1609
01:04:53,339 --> 01:04:56,819
that the chinese / do you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> i had put</font>

1610
01:04:55,140 --> 01:05:01,288
in for the clone of the real dream box

1611
01:04:56,819 --> 01:05:02,999
receiver and so this is just<font color="#E5E5E5"> actually i</font>

1612
01:05:01,289 --> 01:05:04,589
did this in about five minutes after<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1613
01:05:02,999 --> 01:05:06,328
was playing you know once i exposed to

1614
01:05:04,589 --> 01:05:07,979
<font color="#E5E5E5">zero and five minutes or so I you know</font>

1615
01:05:06,329 --> 01:05:09,689
just I got it I couldn't<font color="#CCCCCC"> believe it i</font>

1616
01:05:07,979 --> 01:05:10,769
was laughing because<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was in the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> middle</font>

1617
01:05:09,689 --> 01:05:13,618
of another job<font color="#E5E5E5"> and this is just like</font>

1618
01:05:10,769 --> 01:05:15,209
plant<font color="#E5E5E5"> i was just playing</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> around um you</font>

1619
01:05:13,619 --> 01:05:16,439
could see here like those<font color="#E5E5E5"> the older</font>

1620
01:05:15,209 --> 01:05:17,819
smart hardship<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to speed up</font>

1621
01:05:16,439 --> 01:05:20,098
<font color="#CCCCCC">guys because i've only got two have got</font>

1622
01:05:17,819 --> 01:05:22,739
like eight minutes<font color="#CCCCCC"> and so i'm going</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1623
01:05:20,099 --> 01:05:24,299
actually skip a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> things before we</font>

1624
01:05:22,739 --> 01:05:26,640
<font color="#E5E5E5">spoke about dark field here's the corner</font>

1625
01:05:24,299 --> 01:05:29,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">of that boot rom and that 8051 from 1983</font>

1626
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:30,779
thats dark field here's bright field on

1627
01:05:29,130 --> 01:05:32,159
<font color="#CCCCCC">the same microscope so just flick a</font>

1628
01:05:30,779 --> 01:05:34,469
switch and it switches this in the mode

1629
01:05:32,159 --> 01:05:35,699
so bright field you can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really read</font>

1630
01:05:34,469 --> 01:05:38,279
<font color="#CCCCCC">the rom you can't really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> see</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the bits</font>

1631
01:05:35,699 --> 01:05:40,499
switch to dark field boom now you<font color="#E5E5E5"> can</font>

1632
01:05:38,279 --> 01:05:42,989
see in clear as day it's just it's

1633
01:05:40,499 --> 01:05:44,368
things have a purpose sometimes when I

1634
01:05:42,989 --> 01:05:46,890
<font color="#CCCCCC">build</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> up a</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> lot of junk and I always</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

1635
01:05:44,369 --> 01:05:48,929
a use for it so<font color="#E5E5E5"> because the optical</font>

1636
01:05:46,890 --> 01:05:50,669
microscope today is not not that not

1637
01:05:48,929 --> 01:05:54,179
that good<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use a fib today like crazy</font>

1638
01:05:50,669 --> 01:05:55,650
and so like the 66 PE I'll polish them

1639
01:05:54,179 --> 01:05:57,869
down using a lapping machine so I'll

1640
01:05:55,650 --> 01:05:59,909
strip off a layer I get all that oxide

1641
01:05:57,869 --> 01:06:03,449
residue left the metal floated away it's

1642
01:05:59,909 --> 01:06:05,309
gone and and i get i make these images

1643
01:06:03,449 --> 01:06:06,869
on the FIB after I polished it so I

1644
01:06:05,309 --> 01:06:08,999
polished them down until the actual

1645
01:06:06,869 --> 01:06:11,309
metal is exposed to the to the air to

1646
01:06:08,999 --> 01:06:12,390
atmosphere now this was copper which it

1647
01:06:11,309 --> 01:06:14,880
would be if<font color="#E5E5E5"> you're at forty five</font>

1648
01:06:12,390 --> 01:06:17,339
nanometers or below 130 130 below your

1649
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:18,809
me copper this would oxidize within time

1650
01:06:17,339 --> 01:06:21,449
unless it's in like a vacuum chamber

1651
01:06:18,809 --> 01:06:24,119
which it wouldn't be permanently so

1652
01:06:21,449 --> 01:06:26,999
here's like here's the actual court of

1653
01:06:24,119 --> 01:06:28,829
the 66 PE that<font color="#E5E5E5"> I was</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> after to study now</font>

1654
01:06:26,999 --> 01:06:30,448
what's interesting in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> FIB if this</font>

1655
01:06:28,829 --> 01:06:31,679
had been in a sem these lines would all

1656
01:06:30,449 --> 01:06:33,359
have been white they would have<font color="#E5E5E5"> been</font>

1657
01:06:31,679 --> 01:06:35,400
white but the fibs giving me voltage

1658
01:06:33,359 --> 01:06:36,900
contrast so this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is telling</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> me that</font>

1659
01:06:35,400 --> 01:06:38,609
these lines have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> disconnected and</font>

1660
01:06:36,900 --> 01:06:40,619
they<font color="#E5E5E5"> came from the surface they came</font>

1661
01:06:38,609 --> 01:06:42,719
<font color="#E5E5E5">from up above on the</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> upper metal air and</font>

1662
01:06:40,619 --> 01:06:44,159
so I polish<font color="#E5E5E5"> this thing so smooth that</font>

1663
01:06:42,719 --> 01:06:44,480
you can still see these are<font color="#E5E5E5"> the vias</font>

1664
01:06:44,159 --> 01:06:47,510
where

1665
01:06:44,480 --> 01:06:49,190
made a connection before does anybody do

1666
01:06:47,510 --> 01:06:50,540
this kind of stuff like polishing chips

1667
01:06:49,190 --> 01:06:54,650
I know you do<font color="#CCCCCC"> Carsten but does anybody</font>

1668
01:06:50,540 --> 01:06:56,840
else know this is a process that it's

1669
01:06:54,650 --> 01:06:57,890
<font color="#E5E5E5">pretty fun but you just you take a bunch</font>

1670
01:06:56,840 --> 01:07:01,670
of chips you strip them all the same

1671
01:06:57,890 --> 01:07:02,960
<font color="#E5E5E5">level and then you practice you could</font>

1672
01:07:01,670 --> 01:07:04,520
build your<font color="#E5E5E5"> own polish or two if you</font>

1673
01:07:02,960 --> 01:07:05,780
really tried you just the liquid is

1674
01:07:04,520 --> 01:07:07,460
really what<font color="#CCCCCC"> you need to get which is</font>

1675
01:07:05,780 --> 01:07:10,010
<font color="#CCCCCC">about a hundred</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> dollars for a gallon of</font>

changes to the 66<font color="#E5E5E5"> PE I would have seen</font>

discussed when I did the TPM attack runs

1681
01:07:17,480 --> 01:07:23,359
on microcode and so it's kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> their</font>

1682
01:07:20,869 --> 01:07:25,340
doom you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> now the bus scrambling I</font>

1683
01:07:23,359 --> 01:07:26,960
spoke<font color="#CCCCCC"> about earlier nobody's doing that</font>

1684
01:07:25,340 --> 01:07:28,520
anymore they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> doing it may be outside</font>

01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:30,410
<font color="#CCCCCC">the core but in the actual central</font>

1687
01:07:30,410 --> 01:07:34,490
is almost never scrambled and I don't

1688
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:36,980
know why here's<font color="#CCCCCC"> the metal to layer of</font>

1689
01:07:34,490 --> 01:07:38,930
that same area<font color="#E5E5E5"> so so now in Photoshop I</font>

1690
01:07:36,980 --> 01:07:40,160
can stack these images and I'm running

1691
01:07:38,930 --> 01:07:46,129
<font color="#CCCCCC">out of time so I'm going to try to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> find</font>

1692
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:47,509
that fast I'll find that<font color="#E5E5E5"> last so another</font>

1693
01:07:46,130 --> 01:07:49,460
cool thing in the<font color="#CCCCCC"> fib you get a chip</font>

1694
01:07:47,510 --> 01:07:51,950
like an ST with a mesh I can drill down

1695
01:07:49,460 --> 01:07:53,570
a hole I<font color="#E5E5E5"> could so I this is all tungsten</font>

1696
01:07:51,950 --> 01:07:56,990
residue right here platinum residue I

1697
01:07:53,570 --> 01:07:58,430
have both metals in my fib so I drilled

1698
01:07:56,990 --> 01:08:01,129
eight holes and touched the bustline the

1699
01:07:58,430 --> 01:08:02,569
bustline is running exactly north and

1700
01:08:01,130 --> 01:08:04,520
south on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this picture so from the top to</font>

1701
01:08:02,570 --> 01:08:06,140
the bottom it's running down<font color="#E5E5E5"> the chip so</font>

1702
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:08,060
I<font color="#E5E5E5"> found isolated where the bus line was</font>

1703
01:08:06,140 --> 01:08:09,980
with a reference right<font color="#E5E5E5"> here but it's out</font>

1704
01:08:08,060 --> 01:08:11,930
of you kind of but right in here that's

1705
01:08:09,980 --> 01:08:13,670
a hole that I dug to see where are the

1706
01:08:11,930 --> 01:08:15,200
lines down on metal three<font color="#E5E5E5"> I use a</font>

1707
01:08:13,670 --> 01:08:17,450
chemical called xenon difluoride and the

1708
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:20,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">FIB to do this without hurting the metal</font>

1709
01:08:17,450 --> 01:08:23,210
made so drilled eight vias down touched

1710
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:24,890
metal one and then then filled the via

1711
01:08:23,210 --> 01:08:26,569
to the surface with platinum and then

1712
01:08:24,890 --> 01:08:29,060
made little<font color="#CCCCCC"> donut rings in platinum as</font>

1713
01:08:26,569 --> 01:08:30,410
well and so then I had to isolate them

1714
01:08:29,060 --> 01:08:32,299
because these would have been shorted

1715
01:08:30,410 --> 01:08:34,639
out so then I used that<font color="#E5E5E5"> same xenon</font>

1716
01:08:32,299 --> 01:08:36,229
difluoride gas and I and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> very</font>

1717
01:08:34,640 --> 01:08:38,150
carefully milled just milled you know

1718
01:08:36,229 --> 01:08:39,979
just milled boxes around them and and

1719
01:08:38,149 --> 01:08:41,929
it's black because it's an insulator

1720
01:08:39,979 --> 01:08:44,479
again the tungsten has been removed and

1721
01:08:41,930 --> 01:08:46,130
this is the oxide we're here that this

1722
01:08:44,479 --> 01:08:50,238
is like a spray can when i'm using the

1723
01:08:46,130 --> 01:08:53,239
the tungsten it'sit's there's overspray

1724
01:08:50,238 --> 01:08:56,778
always so<font color="#E5E5E5"> that was called the cleanup</font>

1725
01:08:53,238 --> 01:08:57,740
here's some some some some random chip

1726
01:08:56,779 --> 01:09:00,260
that what didn't have a good ground

1727

nagravision people around the world GSM

1733
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:23,330
SIM cards not secure but people have to

1734
01:09:20,479 --> 01:09:25,009
focus to break it this is again<font color="#E5E5E5"> polished</font>

1735
01:09:23,330 --> 01:09:26,930
not perfect but good enough for what I

1736
01:09:25,010 --> 01:09:28,190
<font color="#E5E5E5">was after so you can see like an overall</font>

1737
01:09:26,930 --> 01:09:32,480
mosaic I was starting to make of the

1738
01:09:28,189 --> 01:09:33,649
chip so these are<font color="#CCCCCC"> 1 2 3 4 5 5</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> across so</font>

1739
01:09:32,479 --> 01:09:35,149
this would have been five<font color="#E5E5E5"> across by</font>

1740

somebody down just to give me an overall

<font color="#E5E5E5">actually stitch him yet just no time and</font>

1744
01:09:41,990 --> 01:09:49,490
so I was going to discuss<font color="#CCCCCC"> this stuff</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> but</font>

1745
01:09:47,960 --> 01:09:52,399
I just there's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not enough time to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really</font>

just<font color="#CCCCCC"> did this last week with carsten all</font>

1750
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:03,860
gone the chips alive if I prepare the

<font color="#CCCCCC">match if</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I jump it here I'm focusing on</font>

the mesh the actual top metal itself to

1753

show you and here<font color="#E5E5E5"> I'm focusing on the</font>

actual lines down below there 726 meshes

1755
01:10:10,100 --> 01:10:13,160
out of the way and hit it<font color="#E5E5E5"> with a laser</font>

1756
01:10:11,150 --> 01:10:18,139
and touch the bus and and it's no

1757
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:19,940
problem get into newer chips 180

1758
01:10:18,140 --> 01:10:22,100
nanometer chip same technique nail

1759
01:10:19,940 --> 01:10:23,870
polish attack boom I just did<font color="#CCCCCC"> it did it</font>

1760
01:10:22,100 --> 01:10:28,760
with Carson the other day the problem

1761
01:10:23,870 --> 01:10:31,099
was that that that the nail polish like

1762
01:10:28,760 --> 01:10:32,810
it flaked off or something from from too

1763
01:10:31,100 --> 01:10:34,970
many rinses and edges these are very

1764
01:10:32,810 --> 01:10:37,460
select these are very small time Duchess

1765
01:10:34,970 --> 01:10:40,040
like 10 seconds 15 seconds dip it<font color="#E5E5E5"> in you</font>

01:10:42,110 --> 01:10:46,880
15 seconds rinse it check it do it<font color="#CCCCCC"> again</font>

1769
01:10:44,840 --> 01:10:49,340
rinse it check<font color="#CCCCCC"> it and the hot plates you</font>

polish along<font color="#CCCCCC"> with the HF to but you can</font>

1772
01:10:51,650 --> 01:10:55,099
see here the lines below and<font color="#E5E5E5"> this ship</font>

1773
01:10:53,510 --> 01:10:57,260
will work if I jump the bus there's no

1774
01:10:55,100 --> 01:10:58,850
reason it wouldn't run still with the

1775
01:10:57,260 --> 01:11:02,150
Thompson remember i only have the bridge

1776
01:10:58,850 --> 01:11:04,250
one line so here's and here's a<font color="#E5E5E5"> thompson</font>

1779
01:11:05,930 --> 01:11:09,650
understand why it's never been broken

1780
01:11:07,100 --> 01:11:10,050
except that<font color="#E5E5E5"> the hackers are lazy maybe i</font>

don't know

01:11:10,050 --> 01:11:16,469
or the Canadians are I don't know maybe

1783
01:11:14,579 --> 01:11:18,630
the laws changed in Canada so here you

1784

can see<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> dropped tungsten across here</font>

this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is connecting the mesh line from</font>

01:11:27,360 --> 01:11:30,659
here to here I went way over wait this

1790
01:11:29,429 --> 01:11:33,150
is overkill I didn't have to do it like

1791
01:11:30,659 --> 01:11:34,530
<font color="#E5E5E5">that and it gets even better I can</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">really just go to the end of this mesh</font>

fake oscillation but it's clocked by a

1800

digital circuit and that digital circuit

1801
01:11:52,110 --> 01:11:57,000
samples that waveform when it's high and

1802
01:11:54,030 --> 01:11:59,849
here after I've did this bridge as a

1803
01:11:57,000 --> 01:12:01,469
test I I ate through the mesh these are

1804
01:11:59,849 --> 01:12:02,760
eight random liens that are not the data

if you want to<font color="#CCCCCC"> know how small that</font>

1808
01:12:06,030 --> 01:12:13,590
really was it's here so you can see I'm

1809
01:12:12,090 --> 01:12:14,969
sorry it's here it's here it looks<font color="#CCCCCC"> like</font>

a speck of dirt it's so small and so

1811
01:12:14,969 --> 01:12:18,929
here's the bridge and here this is

01:12:18,929 --> 01:12:22,920
power and here's the hole I made it's so

1814
01:12:20,940 --> 01:12:25,199
tiny and then here's the edge of the

1815
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:27,719
chip that says k7 something that seven

1816
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:29,610
means it's a hundred whoa no it doesn't

1817
01:12:27,719 --> 01:12:32,309
i'm sorry if you reference this coat

1818
01:12:29,610 --> 01:12:33,210
back to the chip it's a it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> an st w so</font>

1819
01:12:32,309 --> 01:12:38,520
this is actually a hundred<font color="#E5E5E5"> and eighty</font>

1820
01:12:33,210 --> 01:12:44,040
nanometer<font color="#CCCCCC"> stn is 150 or so does any</font>

1821
01:12:38,520 --> 01:12:45,329
anybody have any any questions yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I do</font>

1822
01:12:44,040 --> 01:12:51,989
need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> show you one thing though before</font>

1823
01:12:45,329 --> 01:12:53,460
<font color="#E5E5E5">you go okay one question you have any</font>

1824
01:12:51,989 --> 01:12:56,339
software that you're using to automate

1825
01:12:53,460 --> 01:12:57,510
the analysis<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the imagery I it's</font>

1826
01:12:56,340 --> 01:13:00,179
something I'm working on but I<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't</font>

1827
01:12:57,510 --> 01:13:02,579
actually<font color="#E5E5E5"> do this all by hand which is</font>

1828
01:13:00,179 --> 01:13:05,070
<font color="#CCCCCC">crazy but i'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> working with carsten up</font>

1829
01:13:02,579 --> 01:13:06,449
here in the front row and<font color="#E5E5E5"> he's got a</font>

1830
01:13:05,070 --> 01:13:07,469
nice set of tools out there that that

1831
01:13:06,449 --> 01:13:08,489
can help<font color="#E5E5E5"> me to automate it and there's</font>

1832
01:13:07,469 --> 01:13:10,889
other there's various other programs

1833
01:13:08,489 --> 01:13:13,079
<font color="#E5E5E5">that can help automate it too I didn't</font>

1834
01:13:10,889 --> 01:13:14,880
<font color="#CCCCCC">even that like se23 s90 nanometers</font>

1835
01:13:13,079 --> 01:13:16,949
here's the<font color="#E5E5E5"> ROM of one you can see the</font>

1836
01:13:14,880 --> 01:13:19,440
ROM bits<font color="#CCCCCC"> they're clear as day but I</font>

1837
01:13:16,949 --> 01:13:21,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">literally will typically do this by hand</font>

1838
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:21,980
<font color="#E5E5E5">but if I'm going to image a run like</font>

1839
01:13:21,150 --> 01:13:23,929
this

1840
01:13:21,980 --> 01:13:25,489
I need to do it automated there's no way

1841
01:13:23,930 --> 01:13:27,110
I can sit there and I'm also going to

1842
01:13:25,489 --> 01:13:28,400
assume that the rum is encrypted so I

1843
01:13:27,110 --> 01:13:31,009
want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to get an image of it and then I</font>

1844
01:13:28,400 --> 01:13:32,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">want to study that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the how it drives the</font>

1845
01:13:31,010 --> 01:13:34,700
the addressing scheme and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> where</font>

1846
01:13:32,780 --> 01:13:35,750
where the<font color="#E5E5E5"> bus goes into the as soon as</font>

1847
01:13:34,700 --> 01:13:37,610
it gets into the<font color="#E5E5E5"> core where's it going</font>

1848
01:13:35,750 --> 01:13:42,260
to go here's here's<font color="#E5E5E5"> another picture that</font>

1849
01:13:37,610 --> 01:13:43,820
90 90 90 nanometer part 90 nanometers is

1850
01:13:42,260 --> 01:13:46,340
a pain in the butt so I don't even want

1851
01:13:43,820 --> 01:13:48,110
<font color="#E5E5E5">to know for what 45 is like and this</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

a another again a mesh that they're

impression of does anybody<font color="#E5E5E5"> else have a</font>

1855
01:13:50,870 --> 01:13:57,160
question can you come to the mic

1856
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:08,639
I was late so apologies if you already

1857
01:14:06,210 --> 01:14:09,780
addresses but what about the SLE 78 is

1858
01:14:08,640 --> 01:14:11,610
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> something you're working on I</font>

1859
01:14:09,780 --> 01:14:12,900
haven't seen<font color="#E5E5E5"> any if I saw something I'd</font>

1860
01:14:11,610 --> 01:14:14,190
love to see some samples because I have

1861
01:14:12,900 --> 01:14:16,139
a feeling it's<font color="#CCCCCC"> not as secure as they're</font>

1862
01:14:14,190 --> 01:14:17,669
claiming it things never are even the 88

1863
01:14:16,140 --> 01:14:19,260
I can't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really work on the 88 though</font>

1864
01:14:17,670 --> 01:14:20,520
because i had an NDA with them and like

1865
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:22,620
four years ago<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's the only reason</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

1866
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:24,060
<font color="#CCCCCC">don't talk</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> about the 88 but I'm the</font>

1867
01:14:22,620 --> 01:14:25,409
seventy seventy eight is<font color="#E5E5E5"> going to be</font>

1868
01:14:24,060 --> 01:14:27,239
<font color="#E5E5E5">something like the 88 which is like a</font>

1869
01:14:25,409 --> 01:14:29,099
dual rail pipe and infrastructure and

1870
01:14:27,239 --> 01:14:30,599
but what happens<font color="#CCCCCC"> after the checksum I</font>

1871
01:14:29,100 --> 01:14:32,219
mean you know<font color="#E5E5E5"> like it's so funny</font>

1872
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:34,199
infineon came with a<font color="#E5E5E5"> come back up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1873
01:14:32,219 --> 01:14:36,060
about me and they were like oh the

1874
01:14:34,199 --> 01:14:38,428
opcode is never in the clear well that's

1875
01:14:36,060 --> 01:14:40,170
BS anybody the designs<font color="#E5E5E5"> CPUs knows that</font>

1876
01:14:38,429 --> 01:14:42,090
somewhere in the core that instructions

1877
01:14:40,170 --> 01:14:43,800
in the clear so what's going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to stop</font>

1878
01:14:42,090 --> 01:14:46,140
whatwhat's going to need to<font color="#E5E5E5"> happen on an</font>

1879
01:14:43,800 --> 01:14:48,179
S at least 78 his first I got to produce

1880
01:14:46,140 --> 01:14:50,159
them and if they're being produced I

1881
01:14:48,179 --> 01:14:51,420
haven't<font color="#E5E5E5"> seen any used yet again the GSM</font>

1882
01:14:50,159 --> 01:14:54,570
SIM card market would be the market to

1883
01:14:51,420 --> 01:14:58,140
take it and so I have seen the SN least

1884
01:14:54,570 --> 01:15:02,519
76 but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's not an it's not it's not</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1885
01:14:58,140 --> 01:15:03,480
66 type processor base so the 78 you'd

1886
01:15:02,520 --> 01:15:05,670
have to strip it down you'd have to

1887
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:07,019
identify the two these two blocks and

1888
01:15:05,670 --> 01:15:10,679
then you'd have to base you'd want to

1889
01:15:07,020 --> 01:15:12,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">disconnect the the check of did the to</font>

1890
01:15:10,679 --> 01:15:13,980
compare said you know disconnect the

1891
01:15:12,510 --> 01:15:15,449
comparator and find the clear data bus I

1892
01:15:13,980 --> 01:15:18,690
mean the opcode has to be in the clear

1893
01:15:15,449 --> 01:15:20,969
at some point another thing that's

1894
01:15:18,690 --> 01:15:23,099
interesting is the 66 PE they claim it's

1895
01:15:20,969 --> 01:15:26,159
out of the field but yet I found<font color="#E5E5E5"> pease</font>

1896
01:15:23,100 --> 01:15:29,040
that are newer than the PE that the TPM

1897
01:15:26,159 --> 01:15:30,659
used<font color="#CCCCCC"> and the Xbox</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> used and they actually</font>

1898
01:15:29,040 --> 01:15:33,030
have done a complete redesign and

1899
01:15:30,659 --> 01:15:35,940
they've put the power plant<font color="#E5E5E5"> on top metal</font>

1900
01:15:33,030 --> 01:15:37,980
and for the GSM SIM card market there's

1901
01:15:35,940 --> 01:15:40,320
no active mesh on the surface so any

1902
01:15:37,980 --> 01:15:42,178
tests I need to do on it<font color="#E5E5E5"> on a PE I would</font>

1903
01:15:40,320 --> 01:15:45,150
do them on<font color="#E5E5E5"> this one now but it just</font>

1904
01:15:42,179 --> 01:15:46,890
happened way later in the game<font color="#CCCCCC"> now if</font>

1905
01:15:45,150 --> 01:15:49,259
you have samples and you can give me one

1906
01:15:46,890 --> 01:15:53,010
I'd love to see one but of<font color="#E5E5E5"> course you</font>

1907
01:15:49,260 --> 01:15:57,780
<font color="#E5E5E5">probably can't exactly so you you have</font>

1908
01:15:53,010 --> 01:15:59,790
no<font color="#E5E5E5"> problem so here's the money shot for</font>

1909
01:15:57,780 --> 01:16:02,159
that 2560 chip here's a free beta

1910
01:15:59,790 --> 01:16:06,570
anybody that wants to hack it because at

1911
01:16:02,159 --> 01:16:10,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">mella is it not in</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> my good graces so so</font>

1912
01:16:06,570 --> 01:16:13,290
you want to dump an atmel 2560 18 mega

1913
01:16:10,290 --> 01:16:15,929
you just these two lines hold them low

1914
01:16:13,290 --> 01:16:17,469
take to probe tips put them on the link

1915
01:16:15,929 --> 01:16:19,300
on the line capacitance

1916
01:16:17,469 --> 01:16:21,249
makes no issue because these signals

1917
01:16:19,300 --> 01:16:23,829
don't they don't oscillate they just

1918
01:16:21,249 --> 01:16:25,478
simply stay power up static these these

1919
01:16:23,829 --> 01:16:28,329
these are being<font color="#E5E5E5"> driven by single cells</font>

1920
01:16:25,479 --> 01:16:29,979
of<font color="#CCCCCC"> EE prom you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> know and these are that</font>

1921
01:16:28,329 --> 01:16:41,978
<font color="#E5E5E5">these are the so these are basically</font>

1922
01:16:29,979 --> 01:16:46,420
locked at 0-0 you know so anyway anybody

1923
01:16:41,979 --> 01:16:49,289
else well thank<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> for taking the you</font>

1924
01:16:46,420 --> 01:16:49,289
know sticking around for this
