1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,210
I want to<font color="#E5E5E5"> thank you for coming we know</font>

2
00:00:01,949 --> 00:00:04,890
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there's a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good talks out</font>

3
00:00:03,210 --> 00:00:06,750
there so we'll try<font color="#E5E5E5"> and rip through this</font>

4
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:09,450
as fast as<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have 20 minutes</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and</font>

5
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,040
significant amount of material to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font>

6
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:18,210
through in a quick demo to show you can

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:20,279
of what we've been up to you so so quick

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:21,720
rundown<font color="#E5E5E5"> will do brief introduction so</font>

9
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:24,060
you get to know who we are talk a little

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,979
bit about our pcap attack library the

11
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:29,820
PAL which is the focus of our research

12
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:33,270
here give you a brief overview of<font color="#CCCCCC"> how we</font>

13
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:35,340
built the PAL out right now we built our

14
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:38,370
PK attack library out what that means<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

15
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:40,559
you talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about a tool that you can use</font>

16
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,640
we know there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of replay tools</font>

17
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,320
out there but we'll talk<font color="#CCCCCC"> about the tool</font>

18
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,530
that we use kind of why it's a little

19
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:47,670
bit different that Kyle actually is one

20
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,480
that wrote that and then we'll talk

21
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:50,250
about if you're interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> getting</font>

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,739
<font color="#E5E5E5">involved what you can do right how we</font>

23
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,910
built it lessons we've learned and<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

24
00:00:52,739 --> 00:00:55,980
kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of where</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we're going in the future</font>

25
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:58,949
if you're interested in helping<font color="#E5E5E5"> that out</font>

26
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:01,800
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then lastly we'll do do our demo so</font>

27
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:03,539
I just kind of get it started here my

28
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,350
name is<font color="#E5E5E5"> Pat Inga</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> Benson I teach at</font>

degrees<font color="#CCCCCC"> I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> focus mainly on the network</font>

32
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:18,840
side of things so<font color="#E5E5E5"> offensive networking</font>

33
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:20,670
penetration testing side of things I'm

Kyle Cronin I'm a doctorate student at

35
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:26,310
DSU I do a little bit of teaching

36
00:01:23,369 --> 00:01:29,310
instructor and sis it men in our

37
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:31,350
virtualized hacker lab so to speak so

38
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:34,470
something of a jack-of-all-trades at DSU

39
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,809
good afternoon<font color="#CCCCCC"> everybody my name is Josh</font>

40
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:39,030
Paul I I also teach it Dakota State so

41
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:41,130
everybody from South Dakota I know

42
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:43,530
there's a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> of you so thanks for</font>

43
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:48,270
coming and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> started with that</font>

44
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:51,390
<font color="#CCCCCC">ok so ultimately</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this tool started out</font>

45
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:54,240
as a response to a need we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> at the</font>

46
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,579
educational level this project and so a

47
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,289
couple years<font color="#CCCCCC"> back we were at a workshop</font>

48
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:00,719
and we are trying<font color="#CCCCCC"> to come up with a</font>

49
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,820
better way to teach our<font color="#E5E5E5"> students how to</font>

50
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,699
write<font color="#E5E5E5"> a CLS right in particular we're</font>

51
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,919
talking about snort at our in our degree

52
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,259
we're very hands-on so we do about fifty

53
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,330
percent much for fifty percent lab so we

54
00:02:10,258 --> 00:02:16,959
needed a way to talk about in demo IDs

55
00:02:13,330 --> 00:02:19,570
technologies snort and then let our kids

56
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:21,580
kind of<font color="#E5E5E5"> get get used to writing those</font>

57
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:23,890
snort rules and somebody at<font color="#CCCCCC"> the workshop</font>

58
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:25,900
had actually created a fairly useful

59
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:28,510
program it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> sea program and they</font>

60
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:32,170
went out and captured a you know

61
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:33,549
significantly large pcap file<font color="#E5E5E5"> and that</font>

62
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:35,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">particular pcap file had a lot of</font>

63
00:02:33,550 --> 00:02:37,570
malicious packets in it<font color="#E5E5E5"> right and so</font>

64
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:40,060
there was maybe four or five<font color="#E5E5E5"> different</font>

65
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:42,940
rules you could you could write based

66
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:46,360
off of this kind of one tool that just

67
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:49,240
replayed this continuous continuous loop

68
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:51,459
of this traffic<font color="#E5E5E5"> so great way for us to</font>

69
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:53,140
start out but in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> end didn't work</font>

70
00:02:51,459 --> 00:02:54,910
very well for us because obviously not

71
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:56,859
very flexible we couldn't add additional

72
00:02:54,910 --> 00:02:58,660
<font color="#CCCCCC">attacks to it wasn't very portable</font>

73
00:02:56,860 --> 00:03:00,010
didn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> have a lot of additional</font>

74
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:02,170
functionality had no additional

75
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:04,959
functionality so it was kind of the

76
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:06,700
first first wave of we got the idea the

77
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,459
great idea we just wanted<font color="#E5E5E5"> to add</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

78
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:11,440
know add to that for<font color="#CCCCCC"> us and we have a</font>

79
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:15,310
class at Dakota State we actually have a

80
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:17,320
one full class that's all IDs so becomes

81
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:18,850
a big deal for us and the other<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

82
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:20,739
other issue with the the<font color="#E5E5E5"> can traffic</font>

83
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:23,500
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we had is it had a lot of non</font>

84
00:03:20,739 --> 00:03:26,080
attack traffic so it had a lot of in

85
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">this case a lot of junk in it so we</font>

86
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,920
couldn't parse that out really and then

87
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,450
it had a lot of a lot of packets that

88
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,970
were of no value when you<font color="#E5E5E5"> would and</font>

89
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:36,488
we're learning on attack so if a student

90
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:38,890
missed a rule or mistyped a rule they

91
00:03:36,489 --> 00:03:40,330
might alert on a normal on normal

92
00:03:38,890 --> 00:03:42,609
traffic and they think<font color="#E5E5E5"> they</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> actually</font>

93
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:46,540
caught it attack so way to clean it up

94
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:48,280
yeah so the other thing that we do dr.

95
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:50,950
<font color="#CCCCCC">Paulo and myself we also serve as</font>

96
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:54,340
consultants or we do penetration testing

97
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:57,220
for a for a small company in the Midwest

98
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:59,890
and it's not uncommon for us to get a

99
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:01,209
call from financial institution that we

100
00:03:59,890 --> 00:04:03,130
do pen test for and they'll say you know

101
00:04:01,209 --> 00:04:06,250
the wire is real quiet today I'm just

102
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:08,410
<font color="#E5E5E5">interested and you</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> know if you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> can can</font>

103
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:10,120
you set my set my alarms off to you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know</font>

104
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:12,310
we're good at breaking stuff so make

105
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,320
sure they're actually ready yeah so you

106
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:15,489
know my response is always no problem

107
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:17,529
let<font color="#E5E5E5"> me fire up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> metasploit and then they</font>

108
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:19,390
get freaked out you know don't run

109
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:21,519
hacker tools on my network so what we

110
00:04:19,390 --> 00:04:23,740
decided to do was kind of tackle this

111
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,150
from two ways than<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so the pcap</font>

112
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,900
attack library from an educational

113
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:30,710
standpoint very important but then

114
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:32,210
you know from<font color="#E5E5E5"> a client side as well so</font>

115
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:33,830
you don't really<font color="#E5E5E5"> have to the goal here</font>

116
00:04:32,210 --> 00:04:35,570
is you<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't have to know how to perform</font>

117
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:38,990
a particular attack just say<font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

118
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:41,599
I'm looking for a pcap attack file for

119
00:04:38,990 --> 00:04:43,280
port scan or for sequel injection or

120
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,030
whatever the<font color="#CCCCCC"> case may be that you're</font>

121
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:50,150
that you're looking<font color="#E5E5E5"> at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> okay so if you're</font>

122
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:51,440
<font color="#CCCCCC">interested</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in security at all i think</font>

123
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:53,179
you should<font color="#CCCCCC"> probably and you're not</font>

124
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,340
familiar with<font color="#E5E5E5"> capek</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> I think you should</font>

125
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:58,729
go<font color="#CCCCCC"> out and take a look</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> at it it's DHS</font>

126
00:04:55,340 --> 00:05:01,849
sponsored dictionary classification of

127
00:04:58,729 --> 00:05:03,740
attacks very well kept<font color="#E5E5E5"> up to date</font>

128
00:05:01,850 --> 00:05:06,169
provides a lot<font color="#E5E5E5"> of information about</font>

129
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:08,479
attacks right the goal is to<font color="#E5E5E5"> classify</font>

130
00:05:06,169 --> 00:05:11,060
attacks you can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> out</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and find</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that at</font>

131
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:14,750
might or not k<font color="#E5E5E5"> picked org think is the</font>

132
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:16,550
website so what we decided to do I've

133
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:18,680
had<font color="#CCCCCC"> a I've done a significant amount</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

134
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:22,550
research with capek over the past

135
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:24,470
probably three or four<font color="#E5E5E5"> years and so what</font>

136
00:05:22,550 --> 00:05:26,270
we want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do is add to the comment body</font>

137
00:05:24,470 --> 00:05:28,729
<font color="#E5E5E5">knowledge right and so what we thought</font>

138
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:31,219
would be cool is if we took<font color="#E5E5E5"> these the</font>

139
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:34,490
standard this capex tan dUrd and we

140
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:35,960
started attaching actual pcap files to

141
00:05:34,490 --> 00:05:37,099
the standard right so instead of just

142
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:39,560
going and reading about a particular

143
00:05:37,099 --> 00:05:41,990
description of a particular attack you

144
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:45,470
could actually also go grab the pcap

145
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:48,440
file you know and replay it for you<font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

146
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:50,720
<font color="#E5E5E5">yourself right so that was kind of the</font>

147
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:53,090
<font color="#CCCCCC">the direction that we took so when we</font>

148
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:54,320
build these the pcap attack library

149
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:56,840
there's a number of<font color="#E5E5E5"> different ways you</font>

150
00:05:54,320 --> 00:06:01,099
can you can go<font color="#E5E5E5"> about doing this we found</font>

151
00:05:56,840 --> 00:06:02,659
probably the easiest way to do this<font color="#E5E5E5"> very</font>

152
00:06:01,099 --> 00:06:05,570
simple<font color="#CCCCCC"> network right one of the issues</font>

153
00:06:02,659 --> 00:06:08,300
that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> ran into with that first a pcap</font>

154
00:06:05,570 --> 00:06:10,520
file or the replay the traffic replay

155
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:12,260
tool that we we looked at was there's so

156
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,330
much extra junk in there so we try to

157
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:17,000
streamline the the attack to make it as

158
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:18,919
small and as clean as possible right so

159
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:22,520
in this particular example you see here

160
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:24,289
very simple we take an attacker box you

161
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,930
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> 99 percent of time</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> this is going to</font>

162
00:06:24,289 --> 00:06:30,349
be you know backtrack with whatever tool

163
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:31,970
you need to run the attack then the hard

164
00:06:30,349 --> 00:06:34,310
part obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> you have to set up your</font>

165
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:36,050
victim in the appropriate way so you

166
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:37,610
know you need software packages or

167
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:40,510
whatever you need<font color="#CCCCCC"> to get installed to</font>

168
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:42,610
make your victim vulnerable and then

169
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:45,340
dropped a snort box so we could test our

170
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:47,080
rules right so just<font color="#E5E5E5"> a number of</font>

171
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:49,960
different<font color="#E5E5E5"> pieces there it also</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> works</font>

172
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:53,380
well if you in many<font color="#E5E5E5"> cases if you just</font>

173
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:55,599
run 11 machine and have multiple VMs on

174
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:56,830
it obviously<font color="#CCCCCC"> very quiet as you'll see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in</font>

175
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:58,510
the demo that's kind of how I do it so

176
00:06:56,830 --> 00:07:02,590
that that works as well you don't get a

177
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:04,780
lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of extra traffic right out of here</font>

178
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:06,640
so in<font color="#E5E5E5"> our particular case</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you know how</font>

179
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:09,400
to be<font color="#CCCCCC"> build</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> out the pcap attack library</font>

180
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:10,930
<font color="#E5E5E5">simple enough you know go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to the</font>

181
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,789
dictionary that<font color="#CCCCCC"> k pick dictionary</font>

182
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:16,720
identify an attack that you want to

183
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:17,560
<font color="#E5E5E5">catalog set up</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> your machines that's two</font>

184
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">and three are probably your most</font>

185
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,940
labor-intensive pieces then you have to

186
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:24,789
test<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so there's a significant</font>

187
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:27,430
amount of testing we try to reuse and

188
00:07:24,790 --> 00:07:30,280
give credit to the snort rules that are

189
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:32,500
already out there<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously very a very</font>

190
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,809
supportive<font color="#E5E5E5"> community and a lot</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of good</font>

191
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:36,370
<font color="#E5E5E5">rules out there so we try</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and reuse</font>

192
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:40,480
those rules when possible if not we'll

193
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:43,270
we'll write up a rule for it check<font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

194
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:44,980
make sure that<font color="#CCCCCC"> everything's running once</font>

195
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:47,590
your rule gets fired it's just a<font color="#E5E5E5"> matter</font>

196
00:07:44,980 --> 00:07:49,090
of starting Wireshark running the attack

197
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:56,890
stopping we're sure<font color="#CCCCCC"> alright then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

198
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:59,710
have a nice pcap attack file so when we

199
00:07:56,890 --> 00:08:03,159
started doing<font color="#CCCCCC"> this when we started kind</font>

200
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:04,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">of running running these exercises we</font>

201
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:08,050
were talking to Kyle sysadmin

202
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:10,870
extraordinaire and said you know there's

203
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:13,000
there's a need out there for this

204
00:08:10,870 --> 00:08:14,950
ability<font color="#E5E5E5"> to replay the traffic and again</font>

205
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:16,270
the focus of the I want to really

206
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:18,490
emphasize this right the focus of the

207
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:20,349
research is not the the tool here that

208
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:24,190
we're going to that we're giving<font color="#CCCCCC"> away</font>

209
00:08:20,350 --> 00:08:25,480
but it's really<font color="#E5E5E5"> more on the pcap attack</font>

210
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:27,610
library because you can take our pcap

211
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:30,010
files and run them through your favorite

212
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:31,690
you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know whatever your favorite tool is</font>

213
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:33,130
but what we wanted to do since it

214
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:35,590
started as an educational piece it was

215
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:39,070
important to<font color="#CCCCCC"> us to provide a very easy</font>

216
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:41,050
GUI driven interface for replaying this

217
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:43,270
particular traffic right so if you have

218
00:08:41,049 --> 00:08:47,290
<font color="#CCCCCC">a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> if you're an educator and you have a</font>

219
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:49,150
<font color="#CCCCCC">you're teaching ids class or maybe just</font>

220
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:52,689
an idea lecture or something and you

221
00:08:49,150 --> 00:08:54,340
<font color="#E5E5E5">want your students to be able to write</font>

222
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:56,110
particular snort rules<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's labor</font>

223
00:08:54,340 --> 00:08:58,300
tensive for the educator for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the for the</font>

224
00:08:56,110 --> 00:09:00,610
instructor to you know have to play

225
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:01,719
traffic or play malicious traffic on the

226
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:04,510
network for<font color="#CCCCCC"> the students to pick up</font>

227
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:06,610
right so when we went to Kyle Kyle said

228
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:07,810
yeah<font color="#CCCCCC"> I can i can write something you</font>

229
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:11,230
know that's pretty<font color="#CCCCCC"> simple pretty</font>

230
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:12,939
straightforward and so spray pal is the

231
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:15,100
<font color="#E5E5E5">the tool that we use to play it but</font>

232
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:18,010
again it plays on many different levels

233
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:19,690
<font color="#E5E5E5">there right you can use any any tool you</font>

234
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:23,590
want so he's added a<font color="#E5E5E5"> lot of different</font>

235
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:26,020
features due to the tool right you can

236
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:28,240
you can use one victim you can we when

237
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:29,530
you spraying the traffic alrighties one

238
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:32,740
victim you can spray it you can

239
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:35,020
broadcast it out you can use one attack

240
00:09:32,740 --> 00:09:36,220
multiple attacks right<font color="#E5E5E5"> take all the pcap</font>

241
00:09:35,020 --> 00:09:38,110
library tax that<font color="#E5E5E5"> you want just</font>

242
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:41,680
continuously loop them and replay them

243
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:45,460
and I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think no did</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you get the have we</font>

244
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:47,050
dropped the return traffic yet we're

245
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:49,660
just ignoring any return graphics it

246
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:51,310
doesn't<font color="#E5E5E5"> really have any value to us so</font>

247
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:52,630
yeah we don't I mean<font color="#CCCCCC"> we don't want</font>

248
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:54,640
shells back right we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to</font>

249
00:09:52,630 --> 00:09:57,880
replay or we don't<font color="#E5E5E5"> want to we just want</font>

250
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:00,939
to you know nail it so when we talk

251
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:03,580
<font color="#E5E5E5">about getting involved right steps are</font>

252
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:07,030
very<font color="#E5E5E5"> similar to the way that we've done</font>

253
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:09,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">our stuff take a look at</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> k pick we've</font>

254
00:10:07,030 --> 00:10:11,709
worked<font color="#CCCCCC"> with DHS or</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> k pick in the past of</font>

255
00:10:09,670 --> 00:10:14,589
based off of some of our research so

256
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:16,900
maybe maybe we can<font color="#E5E5E5"> get the research</font>

257
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:18,610
we've done folded in there otherwise you

258
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:20,380
know just contact us if you're

259
00:10:18,610 --> 00:10:22,120
interested in in cataloging or if you

260
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:24,760
have an<font color="#E5E5E5"> example of an attack pcap file</font>

261
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,530
you know find the ID the appropriate

262
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:28,810
idea all the<font color="#E5E5E5"> K pick attacks are ID'd by</font>

263
00:10:26,530 --> 00:10:31,810
number and then we<font color="#E5E5E5"> try to keep that</font>

264
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:34,479
again as clean as small as possible when

265
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:37,479
we get<font color="#E5E5E5"> that for our particular tool we</font>

266
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,680
have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to save it with a pcap extension so</font>

267
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:41,140
that's just a matter of adding on<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

268
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,459
pcap extension and then<font color="#E5E5E5"> obviously you</font>

269
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,689
know send it off to me and we'll<font color="#E5E5E5"> get it</font>

270
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:46,720
folded into our work and then we'll

271
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:49,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">we'll republish it out there for</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

272
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:53,290
<font color="#E5E5E5">get it so at this point I think we have</font>

273
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:55,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">about</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I'll probably 15 pcap attack files</font>

274
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:58,569
out there ready to be grabbed with

275
00:10:55,840 --> 00:11:01,840
corresponding snort rules so what we try

276
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:03,910
and do when we when we catalog an attack

277
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:06,340
as we actually<font color="#CCCCCC"> get the pcap</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> right the</font>

278
00:11:03,910 --> 00:11:07,410
snort rule test it put all those into

279
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:10,290
one folder

280
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:13,079
with the corresponding<font color="#E5E5E5"> K pic ID and then</font>

281
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:15,480
make that folder available as part of

282
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:17,459
the library<font color="#E5E5E5"> right so you can you can use</font>

283
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:19,680
the link here to go out<font color="#E5E5E5"> and grab both</font>

284
00:11:17,459 --> 00:11:22,410
the tool that that will show you<font color="#E5E5E5"> here in</font>

285
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,060
a minute as well as the as well as the

286
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:27,540
the library itself<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the attacks and</font>

287
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:29,699
we're adding to those on a on an almost

288
00:11:27,540 --> 00:11:32,069
daily basis we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> a grad student who's</font>

289
00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:38,699
kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of taken a interest in this as well</font>

290
00:11:32,069 --> 00:11:41,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">so these get please get updated so what</font>

291
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:43,979
we're going to do is show you just a

292
00:11:41,009 --> 00:11:46,019
quick demo right so<font color="#E5E5E5"> this is</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a spray pal</font>

293
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:47,490
this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is the tool that Kyle road and</font>

294
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:49,079
there's a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of functionality</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I know we</font>

295
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:51,720
don't<font color="#CCCCCC"> see</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> char because he's a sysadmin</font>

296
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:53,729
yeah I'm<font color="#E5E5E5"> not hard core developer by any</font>

297
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,649
means yeah it's actually good point we

298
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:59,009
<font color="#E5E5E5">actually have a Linux version coming or</font>

299
00:11:55,649 --> 00:12:00,209
or or already there so if you're

300
00:11:59,009 --> 00:12:01,889
<font color="#E5E5E5">interested</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you want to run it in Linux</font>

301
00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:03,750
you can do that as well and not<font color="#E5E5E5"> only my</font>

302
00:12:01,889 --> 00:12:08,129
bad developer i'm a lazy once or just

303
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:09,269
using a wind pcap wrapper so there's a

304
00:12:08,129 --> 00:12:10,500
in there again there's a lot of

305
00:12:09,269 --> 00:12:13,319
functionality in here you can go and

306
00:12:10,500 --> 00:12:16,350
manipulate MAC addresses IP addresses

307
00:12:13,319 --> 00:12:18,089
source and destination and you can

308
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:19,740
replay<font color="#E5E5E5"> your traffic and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> loops so if you</font>

309
00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:22,829
<font color="#E5E5E5">just want to you know continuously run</font>

310
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:24,750
one port scan or one brute force attempt

311
00:12:22,829 --> 00:12:28,138
or one foot printing attempt or whatever

312
00:12:24,750 --> 00:12:29,670
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> Cape attack the pcap file is you can</font>

313
00:12:28,139 --> 00:12:32,699
replay that over and over and over again

314
00:12:29,670 --> 00:12:35,279
so in this case what I'm going to do<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

315
00:12:32,699 --> 00:12:39,060
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> have snort running down here and</font>

316
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:41,279
I'm apologize orrible view I realize

317
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:42,508
it's probably going to be near

318
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:43,829
impossible for you to see so you're just

319
00:12:42,509 --> 00:12:45,990
gonna have to take my word on it because

320
00:12:43,829 --> 00:12:50,579
<font color="#CCCCCC">I'm as an honest guy from South Dakota</font>

321
00:12:45,990 --> 00:12:53,130
<font color="#CCCCCC">okay so down here I</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have just to have</font>

322
00:12:50,579 --> 00:12:56,189
snort running in the background again to

323
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:59,009
VMS set up here up top is the local

324
00:12:56,189 --> 00:13:01,170
rules file so in this case<font color="#CCCCCC"> i'll</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just</font>

325
00:12:59,009 --> 00:13:02,970
take the<font color="#E5E5E5"> the first example there k</font>

326
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:05,040
<font color="#E5E5E5">packet act pattern 49 which is brute</font>

327
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:06,959
force it's a brute force attack and in

328
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:09,990
this this particular rule fires on a on

329
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:12,930
a snort or on a ssh brute force attempt

330
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:16,019
so you know standard standard rule so

331
00:13:12,930 --> 00:13:19,229
down here<font color="#E5E5E5"> in this window i have snort</font>

332
00:13:16,019 --> 00:13:21,000
running with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the local rule set we just</font>

333
00:13:19,230 --> 00:13:28,320
go out

334
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:29,910
find the appropriate library and<font color="#CCCCCC"> I'll</font>

335
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:34,020
just grab 49<font color="#CCCCCC"> that was the one that I</font>

336
00:13:29,910 --> 00:13:36,360
have uncommented there say<font color="#E5E5E5"> okay it just</font>

337
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:40,050
tells<font color="#E5E5E5"> us you know name</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of the name of</font>

338
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:44,730
the cubic attack and then we should be

339
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:47,729
able to send the packets and then here

340
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:49,290
we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have our rule fired shrines in this</font>

341
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:52,590
in a little<font color="#E5E5E5"> bit i'm sure it's going to</font>

342
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:54,150
blow up but yeah that's horrible but you

343
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:56,790
can see you can<font color="#E5E5E5"> see a little bit right</font>

344
00:13:54,150 --> 00:14:00,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">capac attack pattern 49 brute force</font>

345
00:13:56,790 --> 00:14:02,400
password attempted so it's really the

346
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,430
the<font color="#CCCCCC"> purpose</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the point you know for</font>

347
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:09,240
us as educators is to help our students

348
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:10,469
learn how to write rules and<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to kind</font>

349
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:14,220
<font color="#CCCCCC">of think for themselves have been</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> for</font>

350
00:14:10,470 --> 00:14:16,980
themselves and inside<font color="#CCCCCC"> of inside of snort</font>

351
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:19,320
but this<font color="#E5E5E5"> can also be extended I know dr.</font>

352
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:21,030
Paul I'd teaches a<font color="#E5E5E5"> webapp class as well</font>

353
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:22,650
right and<font color="#E5E5E5"> so anything with an ACL really</font>

354
00:14:21,030 --> 00:14:24,030
could<font color="#CCCCCC"> be could be useful for web</font>

355
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:26,370
application firewalls or whatever your

356
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:31,680
particular flavors we're just attaching

357
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:36,450
on to snort so so with that we're

358
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:39,420
actually just want to say a quick thanks

359
00:14:36,450 --> 00:14:41,280
to a couple<font color="#E5E5E5"> people of</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> our families for</font>

360
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:44,069
letting us come to<font color="#E5E5E5"> Vegas surrendering us</font>

361
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:46,890
for a week to convey<font color="#CCCCCC"> ghus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and then also</font>

362
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:49,890
to the University the the Dean<font color="#E5E5E5"> leading</font>

363
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:51,720
<font color="#CCCCCC">Halverson is very supportive and as well</font>

364
00:14:49,890 --> 00:14:54,750
<font color="#CCCCCC">as the university right for for our time</font>

365
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,830
to work on us so that's all<font color="#E5E5E5"> we have if</font>

366
00:14:54,750 --> 00:14:57,390
you have questions would be happy to

367
00:14:55,830 --> 00:14:58,320
answer and Kyle can talk a little bit

368
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:00,120
<font color="#E5E5E5">more</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> about the tool if you have</font>

369
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:09,140
particular questions about the tool or

370
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:09,140
the functionality as well yeah

371
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:20,190
yeah that's so that's a really<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

372
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,060
question so<font color="#CCCCCC"> I mean I'll be</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> really honest</font>

373
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:23,490
at this point we're really taking

374
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:25,469
<font color="#E5E5E5">low-hanging fruit right so we're trying</font>

375
00:15:23,490 --> 00:15:28,290
to match up something that's easy to

376
00:15:25,470 --> 00:15:30,570
grab and easy to capture and then as

377
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:32,339
well as there is an existing rule but

378
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,959
yeah hundred percent will will

379
00:15:32,339 --> 00:15:35,640
definitely be feeding those rules back

380
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:38,189
in I mean anything<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> we have without</font>

381
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:47,790
a doubt<font color="#CCCCCC"> goes back that's a</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> good question</font>

382
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:52,820
cool just like the classroom perfect<font color="#CCCCCC"> all</font>

383
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:52,819
<font color="#CCCCCC">right all right thanks guys</font>
