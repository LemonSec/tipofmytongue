most part yes I do agree with<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

national research agenda that was

articulated came out of the bush white

house in 2003 and we have been<font color="#CCCCCC"> working</font>

00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:57,650
<font color="#CCCCCC">on some of the things there that were in</font>

the rd agenda of 2003 but just as deputy

have been developed<font color="#E5E5E5"> at DHS S&T in fact</font>

89
00:04:14,989 --> 00:04:19,190
put its own agenda out there earlier

00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:22,040
this year

91
00:04:19,190 --> 00:04:26,630
but it's<font color="#E5E5E5"> not necessarily</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a national</font>

92
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:29,330
agenda so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> on Howard Schmidt's</font>

93
00:04:26,630 --> 00:04:30,980
plate is in<font color="#E5E5E5"> fact to do national agenda</font>

94
00:04:29,330 --> 00:04:34,250
and that agenda is also supposed to

95
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:39,830
include the rd pieces of it as for the

96
00:04:34,250 --> 00:04:41,540
<font color="#E5E5E5">tracking that is the case agencies do rd</font>

97
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:44,659
and some agencies are better at

98
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:47,420
publishing their results than others and

99
00:04:44,660 --> 00:04:49,850
<font color="#CCCCCC">we also</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> have the issue of classified</font>

100
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:54,380
research versus unclassified research

101
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:57,230
but i<font color="#E5E5E5"> think the GAO was very critical of</font>

102
00:04:54,380 --> 00:04:59,270
the government i co-chair an interagency

103
00:04:57,230 --> 00:05:03,440
working group and we are in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> having</font>

104
00:04:59,270 --> 00:05:05,719
those discussions about tracking and

105
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,910
making information more openly available

106
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,880
there's also the issue you have to ask

107
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:12,530
yourself which<font color="#CCCCCC"> is if we tell you know if</font>

108
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,830
we publish everything we're doing is

109
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:18,799
that also a good thing as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well so that</font>

110

toward the internet and what are the

you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> improve this the statistic</font>

I'm lucky to live in a good neighborhood

the world excellent universities with

fine research and good innovative ideas

00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:09,959
that can be commercialized as well from

a university<font color="#E5E5E5"> standpoint there is a gap</font>

00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:14,729
between what's funded as basic

enable innovation we need a research

206
00:09:19,649 --> 00:09:26,670
culture that values new ideas that have

207
00:09:23,250 --> 00:09:28,829
some application or potential impact in

208
00:09:26,670 --> 00:09:31,199

research<font color="#CCCCCC"> community to about to value</font>

00:09:31,199 --> 00:09:36,810
evaluation of ideas that reflects either

current or future deployment criteria

212
00:09:36,810 --> 00:09:41,790
sometimes these things are just absent

213
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:44,100
from the review process the research

214
00:09:41,790 --> 00:09:46,589
culture is more oriented towards or in

215
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,570
many cases oriented towards easily

there's a difference<font color="#E5E5E5"> between useful and</font>

00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:05,430
scientifically interesting the reason

223
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:07,140
why the core basic problems are poor

224
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:08,699
basic problems is every time you scratch

225
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:12,689
a practical problems you reach something

<font color="#E5E5E5">fundamental underneath but you know</font>

00:10:17,250 --> 00:10:23,250
some universities<font color="#CCCCCC"> are more creative</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

230
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:25,680
take the longer view whereas others are

231
00:10:23,250 --> 00:10:27,870
somewhat short-sighted I think in<font color="#E5E5E5"> order</font>

to bring<font color="#E5E5E5"> a university developed idea</font>

236
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:41,939
some universities

237
00:10:38,819 --> 00:10:45,899
university of some state let's call it

238
00:10:41,939 --> 00:10:48,660
that have asked for cash from startups

239
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:50,729
before they have a product before they

240
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:53,219
have any revenue stream I think that

241
00:10:50,729 --> 00:10:55,319
<font color="#CCCCCC">really just it inhibits the success of</font>

242
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:57,809
that that startup if the<font color="#E5E5E5"> university</font>

243
00:10:55,319 --> 00:11:00,478
really wants to make money it needs<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

244
00:10:57,809 --> 00:11:02,759
help the entrepreneurs get started do

245
00:11:00,479 --> 00:11:04,410
whatever<font color="#CCCCCC"> it can give</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> them free licensing</font>

246
00:11:02,759 --> 00:11:06,959
<font color="#E5E5E5">giving a chance to build their company</font>

247
00:11:04,410 --> 00:11:08,399
and then if people are successful<font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

248
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:11,309

00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,619
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> many successful entrepreneurs then</font>

252
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:19,649
little bit short-sighted on that looking

253
00:11:18,449 --> 00:11:22,378
<font color="#CCCCCC">back at some of the more successful</font>

254
00:11:19,649 --> 00:11:25,859
startups from our<font color="#CCCCCC"> University and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> others</font>

255
00:11:22,379 --> 00:11:29,100
I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that students are really often</font>

256
00:11:25,859 --> 00:11:30,389
the key factor there are few startups

257
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,819
that are successful that have been

258
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:35,129
started<font color="#CCCCCC"> by faculty taking a leave and</font>

259
00:11:32,819 --> 00:11:37,289
being the technology leader but for the

260
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:39,689
most part its students who come in who

261
00:11:37,289 --> 00:11:41,639
pick up ideas from<font color="#CCCCCC"> the research project</font>

262
00:11:39,689 --> 00:11:43,379
and<font color="#CCCCCC"> then</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are willing to go</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> out and leave</font>

263
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:46,919
and devote several years at their time

264
00:11:43,379 --> 00:11:48,479
to building a company so there's a

265
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:52,139
little bit of a culture supporting

266
00:11:48,479 --> 00:11:55,019
students to do that and some places seem

267
00:11:52,139 --> 00:11:57,239
to have a better ability to do that but

268
00:11:55,019 --> 00:11:59,549
<font color="#E5E5E5">if you can get students energized and</font>

269
00:11:57,239 --> 00:12:01,949
give them<font color="#CCCCCC"> the material to go forward and</font>

270
00:11:59,549 --> 00:12:04,108
<font color="#E5E5E5">then work with them as as they go start</font>

271
00:12:01,949 --> 00:12:06,508
their companies I think that's a you

272
00:12:04,109 --> 00:12:08,699
know been a successful model thank you

273
00:12:06,509 --> 00:12:12,209
John same<font color="#E5E5E5"> question to you dog what can</font>

274
00:12:08,699 --> 00:12:14,669
we do to improve this this challenge why

do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you think some succeed most fail and</font>

276
00:12:14,669 --> 00:12:19,559
you've got some case studies<font color="#E5E5E5"> ironkey and</font>

277
00:12:17,429 --> 00:12:25,228
other companies or<font color="#CCCCCC"> starves</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> you</font>

278
00:12:19,559 --> 00:12:28,618
funded so<font color="#E5E5E5"> I think the first thing to</font>

279
00:12:25,229 --> 00:12:31,739
note is that your statistic of point<font color="#E5E5E5"> one</font>

280
00:12:28,619 --> 00:12:34,919
percent of basic research the makes it

281
00:12:31,739 --> 00:12:36,659
into commercialization you have to<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

282
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:38,609
at<font color="#E5E5E5"> the full spectrum of research which</font>

283
00:12:36,659 --> 00:12:41,009
is not just basic but then applied

284
00:12:38,609 --> 00:12:44,759
research into test and evaluation

285
00:12:41,009 --> 00:12:46,229
transition we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> successful at DHS</font>

286
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:49,499
largely because we do the<font color="#CCCCCC"> full spectrum</font>

287
00:12:46,229 --> 00:12:51,420
so while I can take John's basic

288
00:12:49,499 --> 00:12:55,050
research that he might do at Stanford

289
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:56,729
help them develop it into a further

290
00:12:55,050 --> 00:12:59,699
product if they don't want<font color="#E5E5E5"> to productize</font>

291
00:12:56,730 --> 00:13:02,310
it we the government have opportunities

292
00:12:59,700 --> 00:13:06,120
to productize it to help them partner

293
00:13:02,310 --> 00:13:08,910
<font color="#CCCCCC">with industry etc so</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I think some of the</font>

294
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:11,880
things<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> are important one is looking</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">at the different models for funding so</font>

296
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:16,860
if I'm an academic I can I can go get

297
00:13:15,270 --> 00:13:18,689
research funding from a<font color="#E5E5E5"> government</font>

capital etc and so there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are some</font>

300
00:13:21,270 --> 00:13:25,560
different decisions there if I'm a small

304
00:13:28,170 --> 00:13:34,829
program or SBIR program we've had very

305
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:36,540
successful companies that have been

306
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:39,210
acquired over the last couple of years

307
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:43,110
where they got their start as an SBIR

308
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:47,730
it's only<font color="#CCCCCC"> available for companies of 500</font>

309
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:49,500

00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:54,840
bought by mcafee both of which are all

312
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:58,199
three of which have been folded into the

313
00:13:54,840 --> 00:14:00,720
core products of the<font color="#E5E5E5"> companies right so</font>

314
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:04,560
it's really a matter of helping those

315
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,940
those academics and small businesses and

316
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:08,939
even large businesses figure out how to

317
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:12,660
commercialize I think one of the other

318
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:16,950
key pieces for us has been<font color="#E5E5E5"> test and</font>

323
00:14:25,470 --> 00:14:29,310
research in four years and watching very

324
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:32,550
little of it actually make it in the

325
00:14:29,310 --> 00:14:35,430
commercial marketplace one of the ones

326
00:14:32,550 --> 00:14:37,260
that did came out of Stanford but so we

327
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:40,079
changed the model when we went to DHS

328
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:42,689
and the model now includes a test and

329
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:47,670
evaluation process so the research

330
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:49,800
programs and projects have to go through

331
00:14:47,670 --> 00:14:51,660
a test<font color="#E5E5E5"> and evaluation process so</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we put</font>

339

down the transition path I believe that

340

00:19:47,250 --> 00:19:51,419
government to rely<font color="#CCCCCC"> on private sector</font>

expertise for about anything<font color="#E5E5E5"> or at least</font>

447
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:54,450
the burden of proof has to be on the

448
00:19:53,340 --> 00:19:56,850
government when they're not<font color="#CCCCCC"> using the</font>

kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of cross current that makes it more</font>

452
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:06,510
difficult and there are also cross

00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:09,720
currents in academia that make this more

454
00:20:06,510 --> 00:20:11,940
challenging let me stick in the analytic

455
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:17,880
lane for for one or two<font color="#CCCCCC"> more</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> verses here</font>

00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:21,120
and then go<font color="#CCCCCC"> on to technology think of</font>

457
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:23,850
what American academia is has done since

00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:27,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">nine eleven and compare it to</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

it was a<font color="#E5E5E5"> half century ago now let me</font>

485
00:21:51,180 --> 00:21:55,560
drive the point home and be a bit unfair

of it and it's an exceptional example

487
00:21:55,560 --> 00:22:01,139
but it's not an untrue one right we

513
00:22:55,110 --> 00:23:00,240
a moral question of the first order for

the american anthropological society as

on balance they say no that's the

524
00:23:24,410 --> 00:23:28,370
been a real challenge i'll call the

525
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:29,600
<font color="#CCCCCC">board side of the equation frankly I</font>

526
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:31,699
think we've been<font color="#E5E5E5"> more successful in the</font>

527
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:33,290
technology<font color="#CCCCCC"> side of the equation I think</font>

00:23:31,700 --> 00:23:35,300
governor's<font color="#CCCCCC"> made it</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> would have a richer</font>

529

dialogue it's been able to toss more

530
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:40,879
problems into your inboxes I think then

531
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:43,250
we've been able to do on the softer side

532
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:46,970
side and we've bettered if it benefited

533
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:52,370
from it I'll stop there Melissa same

534
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:56,120
question well I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we have</font>

535
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:58,550
established how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we incentivize or get</font>

536
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:01,790
the venture capital mindset into the US

537
00:23:58,550 --> 00:24:05,060
government and create almost a safe cut

538
00:24:01,790 --> 00:24:08,899
out and with the<font color="#CCCCCC"> establishment of</font>

539
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:10,700
in-q-tel in the 1990s that's how the

540
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:14,630
intelligence community would feed

541
00:24:10,700 --> 00:24:16,790
requirements into a venture capital

542
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:19,190
group with venture capital from the

543
00:24:16,790 --> 00:24:20,930
government<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look for the innovation</font>

544
00:24:19,190 --> 00:24:23,150
<font color="#E5E5E5">and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the small businesses or communities</font>

545
00:24:20,930 --> 00:24:24,890
and say well that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> an</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> interesting idea</font>

546
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:27,260
but here's how you might want to tailor

547
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:29,690
it to a customer<font color="#CCCCCC"> that I might have and</font>

548
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:32,330
it's a unique<font color="#E5E5E5"> way that at least the</font>

549
00:24:29,690 --> 00:24:34,370
intelligence community has used a

550
00:24:32,330 --> 00:24:35,960
neutral third party to do the hunting

551
00:24:34,370 --> 00:24:37,790
and gathering of interesting

552
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,650
technologies so I agree with general

553
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:41,300
Hayden that that's something<font color="#CCCCCC"> that</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

that the community has done a very<font color="#CCCCCC"> good</font>

555

job at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> Department of Defense</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is a</font>

556
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:49,550
similar concept<font color="#E5E5E5"> that they launched and</font>

557
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:53,840
<font color="#CCCCCC">the less than a decade ago called da</font>

558
00:24:49,550 --> 00:24:55,879
Vinci that I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> is not experiencing</font>

559
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:58,010
as much success as the inc util model

560
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:02,450
has and I couldn't necessarily diagnose

561
00:24:58,010 --> 00:25:06,890
that as you look at what the OSS had as

562
00:25:02,450 --> 00:25:10,340
a unique focus area the period of you

563
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:13,220
know 49 259 was a very unique era of

564
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:17,290
where we're faced on looking at just a

565

bipolar world and one particular area

of you<font color="#E5E5E5"> know really space and and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> an</font>

567
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:25,570
<font color="#CCCCCC">aerospace areas and I think now there</font>

568
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:27,820
are so many<font color="#E5E5E5"> different priorities it's</font>

569
00:25:25,570 --> 00:25:30,760
hard to keep<font color="#E5E5E5"> a focus on but what I think</font>

570
00:25:27,820 --> 00:25:32,770
<font color="#CCCCCC">would be interesting is if we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> looked</font>

beyond just the<font color="#E5E5E5"> United States and we</font>

572
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:36,970

00:27:24,809 --> 00:27:30,149
the question to you<font color="#CCCCCC"> Steve is new</font>

618
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:33,209
technologies in the<font color="#E5E5E5"> industry can</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> be</font>

implemented quickly the<font color="#E5E5E5"> counterbalance</font>

620
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:39,480
is the agility of where the government

621
00:27:37,499 --> 00:27:40,980
has oversight so you have agility and

622
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:44,249
then they have oversight needs

623
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:46,230
requirements common criteria etc that

624
00:27:44,249 --> 00:27:49,860
inherently slow down the process to

625
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:52,230
integrate so wipe this industry move

626
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:53,580
quicker and what lessons can the

627
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:55,620
government learned from being more

628
00:27:53,580 --> 00:28:00,389
innovative while balancing a risk

629
00:27:55,620 --> 00:28:03,658
adverse culture Robert I think what yeah

630
00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:06,658
we've learned is that we have<font color="#CCCCCC"> to be</font>

631

proactive rather than reactive and we

really have to out think I think the

00:28:23,549 --> 00:28:26,549
ultimately the government's fighting the

same same people whether they're going

Obama administration melissa<font color="#E5E5E5"> has way</font>

735
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:41,130
chaired a 60-day review of appropriate

736
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:43,860
technology and problems and it's a

737
00:32:41,130 --> 00:32:45,510
priority setting exercise and in

738
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:48,689
connection with that there were several

739
00:32:45,510 --> 00:32:51,360
groups that tried to provide input one

740
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:54,360
of them was<font color="#E5E5E5"> an NSF orient organized</font>

741
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:56,729
group and I was involved<font color="#E5E5E5"> in that among</font>

742
00:32:54,360 --> 00:33:00,179
others and in preparing<font color="#CCCCCC"> for a</font>

743
00:32:56,730 --> 00:33:03,660
teleconference some of us suggested that

we academics<font color="#E5E5E5"> organized by the National</font>

00:33:05,340 --> 00:33:12,449
together a<font color="#E5E5E5"> little bit</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> before we have an</font>

748
00:33:12,450 --> 00:33:18,180
listeners and what surprised me I

749
00:33:16,620 --> 00:33:19,590
thought that all the academics were on

750
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:21,060
them on the call we're going to get up

751
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:22,230
<font color="#E5E5E5">and say well really what the government</font>

752
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:24,870
has to fund is<font color="#CCCCCC"> the thing I'm most</font>

753
00:33:22,230 --> 00:33:27,150
interested in<font color="#E5E5E5"> and so I was prepared for</font>

00:33:24,870 --> 00:33:28,979
that<font color="#E5E5E5"> but in fact as we went through 20</font>

755
00:33:27,150 --> 00:33:30,810
or 25 people saying what they thought

756
00:33:28,980 --> 00:33:32,130
was most interesting I was really

757
00:33:30,810 --> 00:33:34,740
surprised that<font color="#E5E5E5"> there was general</font>

758
00:33:32,130 --> 00:33:37,350
interest in the community in dropping

other at research and trying to work

761
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:43,050
together on a common goal so I<font color="#CCCCCC"> think</font>

762
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:45,030
there really<font color="#CCCCCC"> is an interest in the</font>

763
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:48,750
research community<font color="#E5E5E5"> in working together</font>

764
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:51,420
on a common goal the current structure

765
00:33:48,750 --> 00:33:53,190
of our<font color="#E5E5E5"> endeavor doesn't really support</font>

766
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:54,029
that but I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> people would be very</font>

767
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:57,029
receptive

768
00:33:54,029 --> 00:33:58,499
and if there was a framework provided we

769
00:33:57,029 --> 00:34:00,840
would be successful<font color="#CCCCCC"> at it so let me just</font>

770
00:33:58,499 --> 00:34:04,409
gives<font color="#E5E5E5"> very briefly one example that's</font>

771
00:34:00,840 --> 00:34:06,418
close to my interests if you talk to

banks and financial institutions one of

00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:12,510

00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:25,529
and I think<font color="#CCCCCC"> that we have the solution</font>

778
00:34:22,770 --> 00:34:27,960
the banking industry wants we just don't

<font color="#E5E5E5">need in order to really make progress</font>

783
00:34:33,389 --> 00:34:38,549

stated the following the United States

885
00:38:48,210 --> 00:38:51,569
happened in Texas and I think that

886
00:38:49,829 --> 00:38:54,359
that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> going</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to be the beginning of a</font>

moving target and moving target you<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font>

890
00:39:00,359 --> 00:39:04,288
to think<font color="#CCCCCC"> about is dynamic defense in a</font>

891
00:39:02,220 --> 00:39:07,379
degraded environment and how do you

892
00:39:04,289 --> 00:39:10,019
<font color="#E5E5E5">continue to have an updated dynamic</font>

893
00:39:07,380 --> 00:39:12,359
defense and or changing RSA key for

894
00:39:10,019 --> 00:39:14,339
let's just<font color="#E5E5E5"> say the federal space the</font>

895
00:39:12,359 --> 00:39:16,140
federal space doesn't have a dynamic RSA

896
00:39:14,339 --> 00:39:19,170
key as<font color="#CCCCCC"> you're as you're calling in and</font>

897
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:21,239
so it's pretty static defense situation

898
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:23,039
than a degraded environment so how do

899
00:39:21,239 --> 00:39:25,319
you continue to<font color="#E5E5E5"> be a moving target and</font>

900
00:39:23,039 --> 00:39:28,920
hard to<font color="#CCCCCC"> find and hard to break into</font>

901
00:39:25,319 --> 00:39:30,509
overtime the third area is<font color="#E5E5E5"> needs</font>

902
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:33,930
probably the most research and<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

903
00:39:30,509 --> 00:39:36,180
the economic incentives and we don't

00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:38,578
<font color="#E5E5E5">have the appropriate economic incentives</font>

905
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:40,440
to solve this problem toward a national

906
00:39:38,579 --> 00:39:44,369
infrastructure that needs to be upgraded

907
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:46,200
with security<font color="#CCCCCC"> built-in up front the</font>

914
00:39:57,180 --> 00:40:01,469

915
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:03,059
needs to be done and with that work<font color="#CCCCCC"> i</font>

916
00:40:01,469 --> 00:40:04,799
think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that we need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to start to look at</font>

917
00:40:03,059 --> 00:40:07,200
how we architected the system to begin

918
00:40:04,799 --> 00:40:09,509
with was about availability first

919
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:11,669
confidentiality second and integrity

920
00:40:09,509 --> 00:40:13,440
last and we have<font color="#E5E5E5"> to architecture the</font>

921
00:40:11,670 --> 00:40:16,979
future system about<font color="#E5E5E5"> integrity first</font>

922
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:19,140
confidentiality second and availability

923
00:40:16,979 --> 00:40:20,899
last because if my<font color="#CCCCCC"> email gets to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> Steve</font>

924
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:22,730
at the speed of light

925
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:24,470
and it could still be authenticated it

926
00:40:22,730 --> 00:40:27,170
may not have maintained its integrity

927
00:40:24,470 --> 00:40:29,000
along the way and therefore<font color="#CCCCCC"> i don't care</font>

928
00:40:27,170 --> 00:40:31,160
if it gets there if it was not the

929
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:34,190
integrity was it maintained so we need

availability upside down<font color="#E5E5E5"> and start</font>

933
00:40:37,820 --> 00:40:41,000
thinking<font color="#CCCCCC"> about how we're going to move</font>

<font color="#CCCCCC">forward on a common research agenda</font>

935
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:47,750
excellent points thank you Doug same

936
00:40:45,920 --> 00:40:53,810
<font color="#E5E5E5">question what do you feel we're making</font>

937
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:57,500
progress while we're behind I certainly

938
00:40:53,810 --> 00:41:00,890
think the the dialogue on R&D has been

939
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:05,930
improved over the last 18 to 24 months

940
00:41:00,890 --> 00:41:08,480
in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the past largely the government was</font>

941
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:10,879
over in its corner and an industry was

942
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:14,330
in its corner and we seldom talked about

943
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:15,830
what<font color="#CCCCCC"> rd was important the only way it</font>

944
00:41:14,330 --> 00:41:18,290
worked was the government would put<font color="#CCCCCC"> out</font>

945
00:41:15,830 --> 00:41:19,940
a solicitation sometimes industry<font color="#CCCCCC"> would</font>

946
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:21,980
respond certainly the academics would

947
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:24,860
respond there have been<font color="#E5E5E5"> dialogue</font>

948
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:27,560
opportunities over the last 12 to 18

949
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:30,260
months where I<font color="#E5E5E5"> think that has</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> improved I</font>

950
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:31,970
still<font color="#E5E5E5"> think there's plenty</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> things for</font>

951

us to do especially<font color="#CCCCCC"> coming back to the</font>

discussion of<font color="#E5E5E5"> this morning which</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is what</font>

953
00:41:34,190 --> 00:41:39,050
are the national priorities and how do

954
00:41:35,810 --> 00:41:42,890
both we the<font color="#CCCCCC"> government and</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the private</font>

955
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:45,770
sector kind of step away as John pointed

00:41:42,890 --> 00:41:48,109
out the NSF guys all<font color="#CCCCCC"> of them rather than</font>

957
00:41:45,770 --> 00:41:50,750
having a food fight for who gets what

958
00:41:48,110 --> 00:41:53,150
dollars<font color="#CCCCCC"> it's how do I step away and look</font>

959
00:41:50,750 --> 00:41:56,240
at a national priority even if it

960
00:41:53,150 --> 00:41:59,690
doesn't help<font color="#E5E5E5"> me as a company and</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> may</font>

961
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:02,359
actually go against my business plans as

962
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:03,800
a company but<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's in the nation's most</font>

963
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:06,230
important need and we haven't had those

964
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:09,200
dialogues as as secretary lute mentioned

965
00:42:06,230 --> 00:42:12,500
this morning I think one of the other

966
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:16,040
areas<font color="#E5E5E5"> that probably we haven't seen</font>

967
00:42:12,500 --> 00:42:19,670
progress in this in the White House

968
00:42:16,040 --> 00:42:22,220
policy review with respect to innovation

969
00:42:19,670 --> 00:42:24,230
talked about improving the interactions

970
00:42:22,220 --> 00:42:27,919
between the academics and some of the

971
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:30,650
labs both government and industry labs

972
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:32,630
and at<font color="#E5E5E5"> least from what I've seen</font>

973
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:38,270
haven't improved that we still have a

974
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:40,910
significant problem of transitioning

975
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:41,990
technology not only out of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the academic</font>

976
00:42:40,910 --> 00:42:46,730
world but even out of<font color="#CCCCCC"> the government</font>

977
00:42:41,990 --> 00:42:49,430
<font color="#E5E5E5">labs they suffer from the same</font>

978
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:52,430
commercialization<font color="#CCCCCC"> in transitions as as</font>

979
00:42:49,430 --> 00:42:54,680
universities and even small businesses

980
00:42:52,430 --> 00:42:56,870
and I don't believe<font color="#E5E5E5"> we've we've really</font>

981
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:58,730
improved anything there or made any

progress since the release of<font color="#E5E5E5"> the review</font>

983
00:42:58,730 --> 00:43:07,460
and in the last 15 months thank you Doug

985

approximately 5,000 attendees these

white hats but still brilliant minds

989
00:43:20,750 --> 00:43:25,400
what can<font color="#E5E5E5"> we do to harness their</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">that's on the fence and Jeff now is on</font>

the advisory council for Homeland

998
00:43:44,360 --> 00:43:53,870
Security Robert I suggest maybe a

999
00:43:50,930 --> 00:43:56,419
two-phase approach this the first at the

1000
00:43:53,870 --> 00:43:59,120
macro level and that's good broad

1001
00:43:56,420 --> 00:44:02,270
national consensus that these are the

1002
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:04,220
<font color="#E5E5E5">things we want to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> now I not only you</font>

1003
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:06,740
know<font color="#CCCCCC"> that the</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of the overly macro</font>

1004
00:44:04,220 --> 00:44:09,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">and us make the internet safer it's more</font>

1005
00:44:06,740 --> 00:44:12,439
specific steps to be done which<font color="#E5E5E5"> require</font>

1006
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:15,410
trade-offs trade-offs between Commerce

1007
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:18,770
and security trade-offs between security

1008
00:44:15,410 --> 00:44:21,470
and privacy and as we go forward I don't

1009
00:44:18,770 --> 00:44:24,050
think<font color="#CCCCCC"> we can</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do that first step without</font>

1010
00:44:21,470 --> 00:44:25,118
a richer dialogue and I think Melissa

1011
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:27,430
others

1012
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:29,710
folks have mentioned this afternoon we

1013
00:44:27,430 --> 00:44:32,740
can't get to the<font color="#CCCCCC"> richer dialogue without</font>

1014
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:34,900
more transparency in terms of what's

happening out there and in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

either out of liability concerns or for

1020

the protection of intellectual property

1021

00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:58,629
conversation we<font color="#E5E5E5"> don't have the adult</font>

1025
00:44:56,559 --> 00:45:01,390
conversation we don't arrive at the

1026
00:44:58,630 --> 00:45:03,579
kinds of consensus that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> need</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to kind</font>

1027
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:06,009
of hard us a unified national effort

1028
00:45:03,579 --> 00:45:09,400
that that's the first step the second is

1029
00:45:06,009 --> 00:45:12,579
then how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you bring young folks with</font>

1030
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:18,069
these kinds of talent<font color="#E5E5E5"> into this space</font>

1031
00:45:12,579 --> 00:45:19,779
that that may be more difficult<font color="#CCCCCC"> given</font>

1032
00:45:18,069 --> 00:45:22,089
the distractions that that kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1033
00:45:19,779 --> 00:45:24,099
talent is going to have in terms of

1034
00:45:22,089 --> 00:45:26,259
opportunities the broader national

1035
00:45:24,099 --> 00:45:29,650
consensus I think is a good step

1036
00:45:26,259 --> 00:45:32,470
continued emphasis on this by national

1037
00:45:29,650 --> 00:45:34,150
leaders respected national leaders that

1038
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:37,689
they call people to service and then

1039
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:40,749
finally I do think we need<font color="#E5E5E5"> to use the</font>

1040
00:45:37,690 --> 00:45:43,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">same kinds of tools that</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> we use to get</font>

1041
00:45:40,749 --> 00:45:46,419
people to sacrifice how to put this in

1042
00:45:43,779 --> 00:45:49,480
the<font color="#E5E5E5"> physical space called a service code</font>

1043
00:45:46,420 --> 00:45:52,150
of patriotism we need to be funded<font color="#E5E5E5"> ways</font>

1044
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:54,819
to translate that to that<font color="#E5E5E5"> particular</font>

1045
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:58,690
population group that has the most offer

1046
00:45:54,819 --> 00:46:00,609
in this kind of space thank you last

1047
00:45:58,690 --> 00:46:02,289
question will<font color="#CCCCCC"> be the same question over</font>

1048
00:46:00,609 --> 00:46:08,470
to you John you have some brilliant

1049
00:46:02,289 --> 00:46:11,019
students well there<font color="#E5E5E5"> are a couple of</font>

1050
00:46:08,470 --> 00:46:12,999
issues here I think they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> there the</font>

1051
00:46:11,019 --> 00:46:15,038
<font color="#E5E5E5">success of black have really is evidence</font>

1052
00:46:12,999 --> 00:46:17,680
that this<font color="#CCCCCC"> is a very attractive topic</font>

1053
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:21,940
area and it is attracting you know

1054
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:24,009
creative clever and committed

1055
00:46:21,940 --> 00:46:26,559
individuals so I think see that as a

1056
00:46:24,009 --> 00:46:28,869
great<font color="#CCCCCC"> opportunity one thing that strikes</font>

<font color="#E5E5E5">me coming here</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> and looking at some of</font>

1058
00:46:28,869 --> 00:46:33,489
<font color="#E5E5E5">the work here is that something that I</font>

1059
00:46:31,269 --> 00:46:34,988
<font color="#E5E5E5">also experience in teaching it's much</font>

1060
00:46:33,489 --> 00:46:36,170
easier to<font color="#E5E5E5"> get people interested in</font>

1061
00:46:34,989 --> 00:46:38,299
attacking systems

1062
00:46:36,170 --> 00:46:40,609
in defending and so that's one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of our</font>

1063
00:46:38,299 --> 00:46:43,369
basic challenges is how do<font color="#E5E5E5"> we bring the</font>

1064
00:46:40,609 --> 00:46:45,920
same excitement to defending systems

1065
00:46:43,369 --> 00:46:47,569
that's easily generated by a talking and

1066
00:46:45,920 --> 00:46:49,069
I don't have the solution<font color="#CCCCCC"> to that we</font>

1067
00:46:47,569 --> 00:46:51,259
<font color="#CCCCCC">have think experiments that we're trying</font>

1068
00:46:49,069 --> 00:46:52,790
in our teaching program if somebody else

1069
00:46:51,260 --> 00:46:55,190
has a great idea please let me know

1070
00:46:52,790 --> 00:46:59,029
because I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> really one of</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the</font>

1071
00:46:55,190 --> 00:47:02,210
problems in this area is turning all

1072
00:46:59,030 --> 00:47:04,040
this creative energy into systems that

1073
00:47:02,210 --> 00:47:07,849
will help defend us against<font color="#E5E5E5"> the tax</font>

1074
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:09,380
rather than<font color="#E5E5E5"> fine thank you your honor</font>

1075
00:47:07,849 --> 00:47:10,760
can I can<font color="#E5E5E5"> I point out one other thing</font>

1076
00:47:09,380 --> 00:47:13,040
that I think is important and that is

1077
00:47:10,760 --> 00:47:15,859
there's at least the beginnings of a

1078
00:47:13,040 --> 00:47:19,040
national program initiative in

1079
00:47:15,859 --> 00:47:22,009
<font color="#CCCCCC">cybersecurity education so what has been</font>

1080
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:26,029
in the past<font color="#E5E5E5"> kind of left to each</font>

1081
00:47:22,010 --> 00:47:28,099
<font color="#CCCCCC">University or each school's own strategy</font>

1082
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:29,809
I think we're at least starting to have

1083
00:47:28,099 --> 00:47:32,780
the discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> at a national level</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1084
00:47:29,809 --> 00:47:34,609
what is the investment we need to make

1085
00:47:32,780 --> 00:47:37,099
for<font color="#E5E5E5"> the next generation with respect to</font>

1086
00:47:34,609 --> 00:47:39,619
education it's just in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the early stages</font>

1087
00:47:37,099 --> 00:47:43,099
<font color="#E5E5E5">but I think that's a plus with respect</font>

1088
00:47:39,619 --> 00:47:46,490
to general Hades comments of trying to

1089
00:47:43,099 --> 00:47:48,619
bring in the young minds and to bring

1090
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:52,069
<font color="#CCCCCC">these you know the guys that come to</font>

1091
00:47:48,619 --> 00:47:55,220
black hat on to keep them on our side of

1092
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:57,200
the fence and and help them in their

1093
00:47:55,220 --> 00:47:59,029
education process and then you know that

1094
00:47:57,200 --> 00:48:00,980
translates into jobs and other things as

1095
00:47:59,030 --> 00:48:03,170
well so I think<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's another good step</font>

1096
00:48:00,980 --> 00:48:06,260
at the<font color="#E5E5E5"> administration which came out of</font>

1097
00:48:03,170 --> 00:48:08,569
<font color="#CCCCCC">the policy review was to create this</font>

1098
00:48:06,260 --> 00:48:09,799
national level program and I believe

1099
00:48:08,569 --> 00:48:11,329
there's a document out off of the White

1100
00:48:09,799 --> 00:48:13,670
House website where you can kind<font color="#CCCCCC"> of see</font>

1101
00:48:11,329 --> 00:48:16,250
<font color="#CCCCCC">the early the early beginnings of that</font>

1102
00:48:13,670 --> 00:48:19,520
program Melissa would you speak to that

1103
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:21,290
I can speak to the importance of the

1104
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:24,200
cyber challenges that have been kicked

1105
00:48:21,290 --> 00:48:27,799
off but there's cyber challenges that

1106
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:30,348
have been initiated once called the

1107
00:48:27,799 --> 00:48:32,450
Patriot cyber<font color="#E5E5E5"> Patriot which is led by</font>

1108
00:48:30,349 --> 00:48:35,359
the Arab United States Air<font color="#CCCCCC"> Force and</font>

1109
00:48:32,450 --> 00:48:38,029
that's<font color="#CCCCCC"> actually doing</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber challenges</font>

1110
00:48:35,359 --> 00:48:40,490
at the high school level where they're

1111
00:48:38,030 --> 00:48:42,589
putting out key challenges in forensics

1112
00:48:40,490 --> 00:48:44,479
and intrusion detection

1113
00:48:42,589 --> 00:48:46,038
and network security at the high school

1114
00:48:44,479 --> 00:48:48,979
level and<font color="#E5E5E5"> it's a mentor-protege program</font>

1115
00:48:46,039 --> 00:48:52,099
so that you have to have somebody who's

1116
00:48:48,979 --> 00:48:53,868
working with<font color="#E5E5E5"> the high school that on a</font>

1117
00:48:52,099 --> 00:48:56,869
particular program<font color="#E5E5E5"> and I thought</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> it was</font>

1118
00:48:53,869 --> 00:48:59,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">interesting that the National winner was</font>

1119
00:48:56,869 --> 00:49:01,729
a high<font color="#CCCCCC"> school and idaho falls so idaho</font>

1120
00:48:59,660 --> 00:49:04,368
<font color="#CCCCCC">national lab was their actual was the</font>

1121
00:49:01,729 --> 00:49:06,468
mentor for that particular program there

1122
00:49:04,369 --> 00:49:09,380
are other challenges that are<font color="#CCCCCC"> under way</font>

1123
00:49:06,469 --> 00:49:11,569
that at the university level and the

1124
00:49:09,380 --> 00:49:14,269
university program there were three

1125
00:49:11,569 --> 00:49:17,479
<font color="#CCCCCC">winners and one was a small University</font>

1126
00:49:14,269 --> 00:49:21,379
in Delaware and another one was actually

1127
00:49:17,479 --> 00:49:23,718
international was from Taiwan and I

1128
00:49:21,380 --> 00:49:26,119
think that it's important that we<font color="#E5E5E5"> look</font>

1129
00:49:23,719 --> 00:49:28,940
at these cyber challenges and how they

1130
00:49:26,119 --> 00:49:31,099
can advance a cadre I have two other

1131
00:49:28,940 --> 00:49:32,630
<font color="#E5E5E5">points this has been modeled now and</font>

1132
00:49:31,099 --> 00:49:34,009
adopted in<font color="#CCCCCC"> the United Kingdom and</font>

1133
00:49:32,630 --> 00:49:36,680
<font color="#E5E5E5">they're having their first cyber</font>

1134
00:49:34,009 --> 00:49:41,029
challenge this week and it's going

1135
00:49:36,680 --> 00:49:43,700
university-wide and the UK<font color="#E5E5E5"> and with</font>

1136
00:49:41,029 --> 00:49:45,140
cross government sponsorship and<font color="#E5E5E5"> Italy</font>

1137
00:49:43,700 --> 00:49:48,468
is looking at something similar to

1138
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:51,379
develop their cadre at the University in

1139
00:49:48,469 --> 00:49:55,249
high school level there was a newspaper

1140
00:49:51,380 --> 00:49:57,079
article on<font color="#E5E5E5"> Mike's hometown just about a</font>

1141
00:49:55,249 --> 00:49:59,689
month and a half and ago and it was a

1142
00:49:57,079 --> 00:50:02,509
third grader had hacked into the

1143
00:49:59,690 --> 00:50:06,140
whiteboard to change their homework

1144
00:50:02,509 --> 00:50:07,160
assignments<font color="#CCCCCC"> ok so I have</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> a my kids are</font>

1145
00:50:06,140 --> 00:50:10,038
getting<font color="#E5E5E5"> ready to go into fourth and</font>

1146
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:12,319
fifth grade and we have conversations

1147
00:50:10,039 --> 00:50:13,969
pretty all the time about you know how

1148
00:50:12,319 --> 00:50:16,219
they are mommy's computer the home

1149
00:50:13,969 --> 00:50:18,529
computer can't be we<font color="#CCCCCC"> don't really</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> want</font>

1150
00:50:16,219 --> 00:50:21,019
it<font color="#E5E5E5"> to be a botnet that takes down bank</font>

1151

of america or or god forbid one of our

1152
00:50:21,019 --> 00:50:26,749
government<font color="#E5E5E5"> agencies and and I I think</font>

1153
00:50:24,859 --> 00:50:29,359
about what is it that<font color="#CCCCCC"> would get my kids</font>

1154
00:50:26,749 --> 00:50:31,640
going on understanding of why we don't

1155
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:32,690
want to hack you know hack the wolf you

1156
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,859
know the whiteboard and change our

1157
00:50:32,690 --> 00:50:37,600
homework assignments and how we could

1158
00:50:33,859 --> 00:50:39,370
channel that interesting energy and and

1159
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:41,560
no they're that of the wii and nintendo

1160
00:50:39,370 --> 00:50:43,480
and all of these<font color="#E5E5E5"> different generations</font>

1161
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:45,549
and there's a interesting<font color="#E5E5E5"> program that</font>

1162
00:50:43,480 --> 00:50:47,590
was just released its online gaming in

1163
00:50:45,550 --> 00:50:50,050
<font color="#E5E5E5">it won the South by Southwest gaming</font>

1164
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:53,260
award just a few months<font color="#E5E5E5"> ago and it was</font>

1165
00:50:50,050 --> 00:50:55,600
called projects or smoke screen and it's

1166
00:50:53,260 --> 00:50:57,610

too much information out and there are

1188
00:51:42,730 --> 00:51:46,330
you do you know do you call mom do<font color="#E5E5E5"> you</font>

call the<font color="#CCCCCC"> police do you try to cancel the</font>

1190
00:51:46,330 --> 00:51:49,779

1191
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:51,279
<font color="#E5E5E5">situations and I thought that that was</font>

1192
00:51:49,780 --> 00:51:54,160
something that my kids would adopt

1193
00:51:51,280 --> 00:51:55,690
immediately because they would play<font color="#E5E5E5"> it</font>

1194
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:58,180
and they would learn the lessons because

1195
00:51:55,690 --> 00:51:59,260
they're not gonna listen to mom and you

1196
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:01,419
know they're definitely not going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to</font>

1197
00:51:59,260 --> 00:52:03,880
listen<font color="#E5E5E5"> to their teacher and so how do</font>

1198
00:52:01,420 --> 00:52:05,770
you start to think about unique ways to

1199
00:52:03,880 --> 00:52:07,660
<font color="#E5E5E5">communicate to the generation who's</font>

1200
00:52:05,770 --> 00:52:10,300
grown up on more technology than my

1201
00:52:07,660 --> 00:52:12,160
generation has and teach them the

1202
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:13,780
lessons in<font color="#E5E5E5"> an environment that they</font>

1203
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:15,700
would it's like we it's like<font color="#CCCCCC"> mario</font>

1204
00:52:13,780 --> 00:52:19,240
<font color="#CCCCCC">brothers for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> cyber security so how do we</font>

1205
00:52:15,700 --> 00:52:23,350
<font color="#E5E5E5">move that forward great points are there</font>

1206
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:25,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">any questions before we wrap up yes</font>

1207
00:52:23,350 --> 00:52:25,650
please

1208
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:44,850
I've got a my questions kind<font color="#E5E5E5"> of maybe a</font>

1209
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:47,400
little bit abroad but I'm hearing a<font color="#CCCCCC"> lot</font>

1210
00:52:44,850 --> 00:52:49,140
of discussion about how you get you know

1211
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:52,830
<font color="#E5E5E5">coordination between the government</font>

1212
00:52:49,140 --> 00:52:54,960
research than the<font color="#E5E5E5"> industry itself and</font>

1213
00:52:52,830 --> 00:52:57,960
I've always found that historically one

1214
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:59,940
of the biggest demoralized demoralizing

1215
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:02,700
aspects of any project I've ever worked

1216
00:52:59,940 --> 00:53:04,020
on is ambiguity and at the same time I

1217
00:53:02,700 --> 00:53:06,210
always<font color="#E5E5E5"> found that working within the</font>

1218
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:07,800
government industry that I find one of

1219
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:09,210
<font color="#E5E5E5">the hardest things to work with with any</font>

1220
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:12,450
of the agencies I've dealt<font color="#CCCCCC"> with is</font>

1221
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:13,560
getting them to hammer down actually

1222
00:53:12,450 --> 00:53:16,049
what the requirement is of what they

1223
00:53:13,560 --> 00:53:17,370
<font color="#CCCCCC">want accomplished so my</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> question is is</font>

1224
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:19,680
in these activities that<font color="#E5E5E5"> we're working</font>

1225
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:21,450
<font color="#CCCCCC">are there any real initiatives going on</font>

1226
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:23,129
as to<font color="#E5E5E5"> how to really define the problems</font>

1227
00:53:21,450 --> 00:53:25,500
that need to be solved or are<font color="#CCCCCC"> we taking</font>

1228
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:28,290
more of an approach of a broad technical

1229
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:32,100
aspect vs I think I'm<font color="#CCCCCC"> more just</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> you know</font>

1230
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:33,840
definitive we need to do this this this

1231
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:37,080
this this which then creates the

1232
00:53:33,840 --> 00:53:40,050
criteria<font color="#CCCCCC"> for success so I'm</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> just give</font>

1233
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:41,850
you at least from<font color="#E5E5E5"> the DHS perspective on</font>

1234
00:53:40,050 --> 00:53:44,220
the science and technology side so you

1235
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:47,610
<font color="#CCCCCC">know we start with the research and a</font>

1236
00:53:44,220 --> 00:53:49,500
fairly broad funnel right and then you

1237
00:53:47,610 --> 00:53:51,150
know you make some choices about what

1238
00:53:49,500 --> 00:53:53,280
research looks like it has some promise

1239
00:53:51,150 --> 00:53:55,440
based on interactions with a customer

1240
00:53:53,280 --> 00:53:57,930
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> that customers in</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the government</font>

1241
00:53:55,440 --> 00:54:00,450
or in the federal space or in the

1242
00:53:57,930 --> 00:54:02,460
private sector we have some projects

1243
00:54:00,450 --> 00:54:04,169
with some state users as well but<font color="#E5E5E5"> then</font>

1244
00:54:02,460 --> 00:54:07,110
you you<font color="#E5E5E5"> funnel that down into</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> a</font>

1245
00:54:04,170 --> 00:54:08,880
development process that you know you're

1246
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:10,500
targeting a certain set of users and

1247
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:12,480
then you put it<font color="#CCCCCC"> into the test</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> and</font>

1248
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:13,800
evaluation put it in<font color="#E5E5E5"> the operational</font>

1249
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,900
environment and you let that user

1250
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:18,330
provide feedback to the to the

1251
00:54:15,900 --> 00:54:21,240
researcher whether their academic or

1252
00:54:18,330 --> 00:54:23,759
company and then what<font color="#E5E5E5"> you end up with</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> is</font>

1253
00:54:21,240 --> 00:54:26,129
a user at the end of<font color="#E5E5E5"> that funnel who's</font>

1254
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:28,650
<font color="#E5E5E5">ready to take the product when they're</font>

1255
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:31,830
done and that's<font color="#E5E5E5"> the model we've tried</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1256
00:54:28,650 --> 00:54:33,360
build within DHS is to ensure<font color="#CCCCCC"> that when</font>

1257
00:54:31,830 --> 00:54:35,640
we get done it's not just going<font color="#E5E5E5"> to go on</font>

1258
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:38,490
the shelf that it has commercial

1259
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:40,799
potential and we've even in some<font color="#CCCCCC"> cases</font>

1260
00:54:38,490 --> 00:54:42,629
helped build the partnership<font color="#CCCCCC"> between</font>

1261
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:44,670
whether they're<font color="#CCCCCC"> an academic or a small</font>

1262
00:54:42,630 --> 00:54:46,090
business with<font color="#E5E5E5"> someone who can help them</font>

1263
00:54:44,670 --> 00:54:47,740
commercialize it

1264
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:51,910
whether<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's a system integrator or</font>

1265
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:54,339
even so one<font color="#CCCCCC"> of the small businesses that</font>

1266
00:54:51,910 --> 00:54:56,830
was bought by mcafee we actually did the

1267
00:54:54,340 --> 00:55:00,910
introduction between mcafee and and the

1268
00:54:56,830 --> 00:55:03,250
company at one of our events that's

1269
00:55:00,910 --> 00:55:05,620
where they<font color="#E5E5E5"> first met so you know part of</font>

1270
00:55:03,250 --> 00:55:07,300
our job we believe is in fact being the

1271
00:55:05,620 --> 00:55:09,670
marriage broker but it's all about

1272
00:55:07,300 --> 00:55:12,430
<font color="#CCCCCC">taking</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> the technology from a fairly</font>

1273
00:55:09,670 --> 00:55:14,230
broad<font color="#E5E5E5"> idea to start with and putting it</font>

1274
00:55:12,430 --> 00:55:17,470
through a process that actually ends up

1275
00:55:14,230 --> 00:55:19,240
with real stuff coming out the back end

1276
00:55:17,470 --> 00:55:22,029
that can be deployed and commercialized

1277
00:55:19,240 --> 00:55:24,370
I any just from the government side of

1278
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:26,440
the ball associate myself with your your

1279
00:55:24,370 --> 00:55:28,330
first comments I was a director of a

1280
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:31,450
national agency for about 10 years NSA

1281
00:55:28,330 --> 00:55:34,180
deputy DNI and then and then CIA and I

1282
00:55:31,450 --> 00:55:38,049
learned very painfully very expensively

1283
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:40,509
that<font color="#CCCCCC"> moonshots never worked we have one</font>

1284
00:55:38,050 --> 00:55:42,310
transformational program at at NSA that

1285
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:44,470
spent hundreds of billions<font color="#CCCCCC"> of dollars</font>

1286
00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:47,890
for and end up<font color="#CCCCCC"> with a really good stack</font>

1287
00:55:44,470 --> 00:55:50,200
of view graphs and not much more and and

1288
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:53,080
a significant portion of the problem was

1289
00:55:50,200 --> 00:55:56,200
the in discipline within government of

1290
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:58,960
defining and sticking to discrete

1291
00:55:56,200 --> 00:56:01,750
requirements rather than to allow the

1292
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:03,970
requirements to grow over time in the

1293
00:56:01,750 --> 00:56:08,260
<font color="#CCCCCC">dialogue so that you are always 18</font>

1294
00:56:03,970 --> 00:56:09,339
<font color="#E5E5E5">months away from from any IOC by the</font>

1295
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:13,420
time I'd<font color="#CCCCCC"> live through that experience</font>

1296
00:56:09,340 --> 00:56:16,510
you got the CIA no<font color="#CCCCCC"> moonshots low-hanging</font>

1297
00:56:13,420 --> 00:56:22,510
fruit was great incremental improvement

1298
00:56:16,510 --> 00:56:28,000
get stuff on the desktop and the fort hi

1299
00:56:22,510 --> 00:56:32,260
<font color="#E5E5E5">I'm a academic from Canada and I have</font>

00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:36,100
question about how to as an academic how

1301
00:56:32,260 --> 00:56:38,290
do we encourage government to to work

with<font color="#CCCCCC"> us I come from a different culture</font>

or climate I suppose having taught in

the US for three years<font color="#CCCCCC"> and just</font>

00:56:44,050 --> 00:56:49,640
relocated back to Simon Fraser to start

a cybercrime program

have a research institute so I've been

00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:59,390
trying to<font color="#CCCCCC"> foster relationships with the</font>

1310
00:56:57,680 --> 00:57:01,279
Canadian<font color="#CCCCCC"> government and the Royal</font>

1311
00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:05,660
Canadian Mounted Police the RCMP and

1312
00:57:01,279 --> 00:57:08,930
it's been extremely difficult because I

1313
00:57:05,660 --> 00:57:10,549
travelled to Ottawa and was told in no

1314
00:57:08,930 --> 00:57:15,470
uncertain terms that they wanted to

1315
00:57:10,549 --> 00:57:17,779
<font color="#E5E5E5">handle the research internally and the</font>

1316
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:21,649
<font color="#E5E5E5">Canadian government in fact is is has</font>

1317
00:57:17,779 --> 00:57:23,630
lagged very far behind both Europe and

1318
00:57:21,650 --> 00:57:26,299
the US and enacting legislation we only

1319
00:57:23,630 --> 00:57:29,390
just<font color="#E5E5E5"> enacted identity theft legislation</font>

1320
00:57:26,299 --> 00:57:32,329
in october two thousand nine we have no

1321
00:57:29,390 --> 00:57:35,900
laws combating spam or viruses and and

1322
00:57:32,329 --> 00:57:37,819
so on and<font color="#E5E5E5"> i guess as an academic</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> i I'm</font>

1323
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:40,640
finding you know that there are two

1324
00:57:37,819 --> 00:57:43,819
major obstacles one is in terms of

1325
00:57:40,640 --> 00:57:46,009
generating reliable statistics having to

1326
00:57:43,819 --> 00:57:47,690
rely largely on anecdote and a lot<font color="#CCCCCC"> of</font>

1327
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:52,579
the research that's coming out<font color="#E5E5E5"> of the</font>

1328
00:57:47,690 --> 00:57:54,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">u.s. part of my work has been with child</font>

1329
00:57:52,579 --> 00:57:57,140
pornography and most of our statistics

1330
00:57:54,920 --> 00:58:02,150
are coming from the US and other

1331
00:57:57,140 --> 00:58:04,490
research outfits and so for the sort of

1332
00:58:02,150 --> 00:58:06,259
the naysayers the cyber libertarians i

1333
00:58:04,490 --> 00:58:07,939
like to call them who<font color="#CCCCCC"> are very adverse</font>

1334
00:58:06,259 --> 00:58:11,900
<font color="#CCCCCC">to any kind</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of regulation on</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> the</font>

1335
00:58:07,940 --> 00:58:13,759
internet and and so on that the reliance

1336
00:58:11,900 --> 00:58:15,259
on those on those outside sources and

1337
00:58:13,759 --> 00:58:16,819
statistics allows them to say oh it's

1338
00:58:15,259 --> 00:58:18,829
<font color="#CCCCCC">not really a problem here we</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> don't</font>

1339
00:58:16,819 --> 00:58:21,288
really need to address it so that

1340
00:58:18,829 --> 00:58:23,390
further you know sort<font color="#E5E5E5"> of fans the flames</font>

1341
00:58:21,289 --> 00:58:26,089
of doing nothing to combat<font color="#CCCCCC"> these</font>

1342
00:58:23,390 --> 00:58:30,650
problems so that's problem number one

1343
00:58:26,089 --> 00:58:31,940
and problem number two is if we can't

1344
00:58:30,650 --> 00:58:35,720
work with the government we can't get

1345
00:58:31,940 --> 00:58:37,490
statistics and we can't really conduct

1346
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:40,609
<font color="#E5E5E5">our research in any effective sort of</font>

1347
00:58:37,490 --> 00:58:42,828
way so I<font color="#E5E5E5"> guess I'm sort of wondering</font>

1348
00:58:40,609 --> 00:58:45,920
<font color="#CCCCCC">what your thoughts are in terms of how</font>

1349
00:58:42,829 --> 00:58:49,369
do you start from from<font color="#CCCCCC"> Ground Zero</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font>

1350
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:53,329
mean we're the first cybercrime<font color="#CCCCCC"> studies</font>

program cybercrime<font color="#E5E5E5"> Institute in Canada</font>

1352
00:58:53,329 --> 00:58:57,019
and you know without this collaboration

1353
00:58:55,190 --> 00:59:02,180
I just I can find it<font color="#E5E5E5"> very very difficult</font>

1354
00:58:57,019 --> 00:59:07,459
I have<font color="#E5E5E5"> two quick thoughts one find one</font>

1355
00:59:02,180 --> 00:59:09,589
<font color="#CCCCCC">person and to focus</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> on one thing I may</font>

1356
00:59:07,459 --> 00:59:12,259
just turn a question back if you went<font color="#CCCCCC"> to</font>

1357
00:59:09,589 --> 00:59:15,109
<font color="#E5E5E5">the RCMP did have you begun any dialogue</font>

1358
00:59:12,259 --> 00:59:16,999
with with<font color="#CCCCCC"> CSEC because the natural</font>

1359
00:59:15,109 --> 00:59:19,759
academic partner in the United<font color="#CCCCCC"> States is</font>

1360
00:59:16,999 --> 00:59:21,919
NSA and centers of academic excellence

1361
00:59:19,759 --> 00:59:25,130
I'm just curious whether the NSA

1362
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:26,930
equivalent is part of your<font color="#E5E5E5"> game plan no</font>

1363
00:59:25,130 --> 00:59:30,200
we haven't we haven't targeted them as

1364
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:31,578
of yet but I mean as i said<font color="#CCCCCC"> i've only</font>

1365
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:34,038
been there a year i just joined in

1366
00:59:31,579 --> 00:59:37,219
September so we've been really trying to

1367
00:59:34,039 --> 00:59:40,190
get<font color="#E5E5E5"> things off the ground but my number</font>

1368
00:59:37,219 --> 00:59:42,769
one obstacle that I faced thus far has

1369
00:59:40,190 --> 00:59:44,900
been this real reluctance and resistance

1370
00:59:42,769 --> 00:59:47,118
from the government to to partner with

1371
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:49,459
us and in fact<font color="#E5E5E5"> the RCMP has expressed</font>

1372
00:59:47,119 --> 00:59:51,920
some interest but they're<font color="#E5E5E5"> just moving so</font>

1373
00:59:49,459 --> 00:59:53,719
so slowly and<font color="#E5E5E5"> they have all their</font>

1374
00:59:51,920 --> 00:59:55,819
security clearances and this and that

1375
00:59:53,719 --> 01:00:00,680
and which I can understand what it seems

1376
00:59:55,819 --> 01:00:05,269
<font color="#E5E5E5">like it's it's just very very very slow</font>

1377
01:00:00,680 --> 01:00:07,819
and you know as<font color="#E5E5E5"> well in my research even</font>

1378
01:00:05,269 --> 01:00:10,279
as a grad student<font color="#CCCCCC"> and doing my PhD in in</font>

1379
01:00:07,819 --> 01:00:11,900
in in law I wrote<font color="#CCCCCC"> on my thesis on child</font>

1380
01:00:10,279 --> 01:00:14,180
pornography and it was virtually

1381
01:00:11,900 --> 01:00:17,239
impossible to<font color="#CCCCCC"> get any kind of reliable</font>

1382
01:00:14,180 --> 01:00:18,499
statistics because nobody is is working

1383
01:00:17,239 --> 01:00:20,869
in that area and there's very little

1384
01:00:18,499 --> 01:00:24,439
interest in the part of government to to

1385
01:00:20,869 --> 01:00:26,180
do<font color="#E5E5E5"> anything about it so so taking a</font>

1386
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:28,459
building on John's point Public Safety

1387
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:31,308
is the lead for all cyber security in

1388
01:00:28,459 --> 01:00:33,499
Canada and as in the United<font color="#CCCCCC"> States</font>

1389
01:00:31,309 --> 01:00:36,170
they're responsible<font color="#CCCCCC"> for the all</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1390
01:00:33,499 --> 01:00:39,019
government strategy and pure person of

01:00:36,170 --> 01:00:40,640
interest is is Bob Gordon because<font color="#E5E5E5"> that's</font>

1392

the<font color="#E5E5E5"> person</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> who's responsible for</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> leading</font>

1393
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:44,989
the entire strategy there are a number

1394
01:00:42,890 --> 01:00:45,910
of research partnerships between the

1395
01:00:44,989 --> 01:00:48,640
United States and

1396
01:00:45,910 --> 01:00:52,270
<font color="#CCCCCC">Canada on cybercrime and on child</font>

1397
01:00:48,640 --> 01:00:54,578
pornography but as you start<font color="#E5E5E5"> to look at</font>

1398
01:00:52,270 --> 01:00:56,859
the different partnerships you could

01:00:54,579 --> 01:00:58,599
<font color="#E5E5E5">forge from a university level you might</font>

1400
01:00:56,859 --> 01:01:00,670
want to look at who's the university

1401
01:00:58,599 --> 01:01:02,740
partners to those programs in the United

01:01:05,829 --> 01:01:12,069
into the Canadian national strategy and

doug is working with<font color="#E5E5E5"> Harvard and MIT and</font>

interesting of how do you get<font color="#E5E5E5"> to the</font>

1408
01:01:15,339 --> 01:01:18,730
data because we're having a very

1409
01:01:17,170 --> 01:01:20,589
difficult time getting to the data to

1410
01:01:18,730 --> 01:01:22,089
enable the research community this<font color="#E5E5E5"> is</font>

1411
01:01:20,589 --> 01:01:24,670
<font color="#E5E5E5">something that we highlighted in the</font>

cyberspace policy review and<font color="#CCCCCC"> doug's had</font>

01:01:24,670 --> 01:01:27,579
the most success in it and<font color="#E5E5E5"> I</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> think that</font>

1414
01:01:26,530 --> 01:01:29,440
it would<font color="#E5E5E5"> be good if you talked a little</font>

1415
01:01:27,579 --> 01:01:31,539
bit about<font color="#E5E5E5"> that so actually</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> there's a</font>

1416
01:01:29,440 --> 01:01:34,780

1417
01:01:31,539 --> 01:01:38,020
as<font color="#E5E5E5"> Melissa mentioned the public safety</font>

1418
01:01:34,780 --> 01:01:39,490
is the canadian centre point but we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have</font>

1419
01:01:38,020 --> 01:01:42,910
been having dialogues with the law

01:01:39,490 --> 01:01:44,649
enforcement<font color="#CCCCCC"> community</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> in the US DHS is</font>

1421
01:01:42,910 --> 01:01:47,348
now the largest law enforcement agency

1422
01:01:44,650 --> 01:01:48,910
in the US with Secret Service and others

1423
01:01:47,349 --> 01:01:52,240
<font color="#E5E5E5">and it's probably worth having the</font>

1424
01:01:48,910 --> 01:01:54,220
discussion<font color="#CCCCCC"> about we've had you know even</font>

1425
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:58,000
dialogues where the Secret Service and

1426
01:01:54,220 --> 01:01:59,919
the FBI are talking I know that's not

1427
01:01:58,000 --> 01:02:02,020
supposed<font color="#E5E5E5"> to do</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> that Robert but no</font>

1428
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:04,660
seriously it's been great to have this

1429
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:05,829
you know everybody's getting along and

1430
01:02:04,660 --> 01:02:08,440
so it might<font color="#CCCCCC"> be useful to have that</font>

1431
01:02:05,829 --> 01:02:09,520
<font color="#E5E5E5">discussion about the communications</font>

1432
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:10,750
they're having<font color="#E5E5E5"> with their Canadian</font>

1433
01:02:09,520 --> 01:02:13,029
counterparts and see if there<font color="#CCCCCC"> isn't some</font>

1434
01:02:10,750 --> 01:02:16,510
<font color="#E5E5E5">way to help you connect with people</font>

1435
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:17,559
there the data problem is a an issue and

1436
01:02:16,510 --> 01:02:20,680
we're trying<font color="#E5E5E5"> to work some</font><font color="#CCCCCC"> of those data</font>

1437
01:02:17,559 --> 01:02:22,510
issues we have not stepped into the the

1438
01:02:20,680 --> 01:02:24,970
what i would call much more

1439
01:02:22,510 --> 01:02:27,010
controversial data that associated with

1440
01:02:24,970 --> 01:02:29,589
child pornography we've largely stayed

1441
01:02:27,010 --> 01:02:31,000
on the doable side so far with respect

1442
01:02:29,589 --> 01:02:34,210
to network traffic and other kinds<font color="#E5E5E5"> of</font>

1443
01:02:31,000 --> 01:02:38,980
things the last thing I would<font color="#CCCCCC"> point out</font>

1444
01:02:34,210 --> 01:02:42,099
is there are various agencies within the

1445
01:02:38,980 --> 01:02:46,990
<font color="#CCCCCC">u.s. that have an ability to</font><font color="#E5E5E5"> do a</font>

1446
01:02:42,099 --> 01:02:49,450
collaborative R&D partnerships with non

1447
01:02:46,990 --> 01:02:52,660
US universities so NSF is one of them

1448
01:02:49,450 --> 01:02:54,788
DHS is as well we<font color="#E5E5E5"> have funded a</font>
