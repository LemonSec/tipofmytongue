all my colleague on him and then and
myself whipsawed kalter right off

10
00:00:28,479 --> 00:00:29,880
alone

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,050
subhuman park

12
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:37,690
noticed that my name was not on the
agenda but it was there any other manoff

13
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:41,220
unfortunately i don't have the into the

17
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:55,470
of good art

18
00:00:55,470 --> 00:01:01,450
wherein along rio psalm metre p_x_
security researchers working for

19
00:01:01,450 --> 00:01:04,870
our company called urine w dead space in
germany

20
00:01:04,870 --> 00:01:05,840
uh...

21
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,670
the company's mainly during penetration
testing security researching security

22
00:01:10,670 --> 00:01:11,670
analyzing

23
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,040
developing concepts like that

24
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,360
and sorrow

25
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,030
there is a treadmill fiddling around
with nobody was so so i'm trying to do

26
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,050
some nasty stuff done

27
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,240
devise a system

28
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:25,119
protocols and that's

29
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,350
pretty much making the majority of
holidays and ur

30
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,780
so

31
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:33,540
the convoy hanlon one was larger
companies based in germany heidelberg

32
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,170
for some of you may know that

33
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:36,890
i want to

34
00:01:36,890 --> 00:01:38,590
well-intended too much about that

35
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:39,920
uh...

36
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,380
it's slow one hundred sar main

37
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,640
understanding is that being said call
appropriate

38
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:47,720
they fear of google

39
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,590
mitigated controls saw

40
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:51,370
home

41
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:54,910
telling companies want to do real
licensing about their business attitudes

42
00:01:54,910 --> 00:01:58,119
uh... soderberg

43
00:01:58,119 --> 00:02:02,439
out of the also ever been all along
maybe also some of you know this already

44
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:04,550
it's called insinuated on that

45
00:02:04,550 --> 00:02:06,270
and elsewhere for

46
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:10,609
but compared with the black eyed by the
room small conference which is also also

47
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,069
germany the source you

48
00:02:12,069 --> 00:02:14,399
uh... i also saw them

49
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,400
zope

50
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,579
they're going to put a dent uh...

51
00:02:17,579 --> 00:02:20,669
why don't you want to start your can you
do a visual cues

52
00:02:20,669 --> 00:02:22,879
and why does the world need

53
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:24,168
another tool

54
00:02:24,169 --> 00:02:26,239
doing nasty sings in an advert

55
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:29,019
uh... next find would be the tool itself

56
00:02:29,019 --> 00:02:31,739
uh... for that that then you will

57
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:33,849
tell you some

58
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:37,869
architect just all forms of how it was
coded because he wants the main code

59
00:02:37,869 --> 00:02:39,259
after two

60
00:02:39,259 --> 00:02:40,819
so you can

61
00:02:40,819 --> 00:02:44,629
tell you they control staffer

62
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:46,910
and the last part of that they're not

63
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:50,700
highest some aggressive facts which are
also implemented these are the school

64
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:53,578
but uh... you'll see it

65
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:55,219
but what they see here

66
00:02:55,219 --> 00:02:56,499
arm

67
00:02:56,499 --> 00:02:57,379
alpha

68
00:02:57,379 --> 00:03:00,499
most guys if you should recognize this

69
00:03:00,499 --> 00:03:01,329
screenshot

70
00:03:01,329 --> 00:03:04,199
it's pretty much on your last chart

71
00:03:04,199 --> 00:03:06,499
last time so i need to really

72
00:03:06,499 --> 00:03:11,418
manure and company and that hurts our
customer care networks

73
00:03:11,419 --> 00:03:16,289
undi fire up a sniffer it's also the
kind that by paul bc stuff like that

74
00:03:16,289 --> 00:03:17,978
so it's nothing special

75
00:03:17,979 --> 00:03:22,439
vodka one special we see here is a
little arbonne infrastructure talking

76
00:03:22,439 --> 00:03:24,060
proper cults

77
00:03:24,060 --> 00:03:25,999
on the talk

78
00:03:25,999 --> 00:03:30,739
pretty messy this lots of graduates solo
rogers talking infrastructure

79
00:03:30,739 --> 00:03:32,939
infrastructure protocols in the wrong
networks

80
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:35,630
so most guys no reason for example to
talk

81
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:40,209
was gash in the kind that bird but uh...
you still see this stuff

82
00:03:40,209 --> 00:03:44,349
aural this was that's very often and
some

83
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:45,888
our scenario

84
00:03:45,889 --> 00:03:47,190
this kind of like that

85
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:51,760
if it ever reported by the security
assessment i would tell our custom into

86
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,450
kenya

87
00:03:52,450 --> 00:03:56,299
got some problems if you're in some sort
of protocol seconded easily been settled

88
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:57,260
our

89
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:03,409
security concerns about that turns out
this can cause serious haunted network

90
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,790
form this and soft

91
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:10,478
to customers telling us a case just
erratically

92
00:04:10,479 --> 00:04:11,519
soviet ek

93
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:14,000
uh... some you know your realtor

94
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,659
all traffic in the matter

95
00:04:15,659 --> 00:04:19,298
and then it's that's where the problem
comes up because they're pretty much

96
00:04:19,298 --> 00:04:21,858
though not that much tools

97
00:04:21,858 --> 00:04:25,109
you can use to show them the stuff

98
00:04:25,110 --> 00:04:26,349
so

99
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:30,870
most likely it is security incidents
dimensions our customers

100
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:31,990
their rules

101
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:36,039
going to be kurds in any way that just
ignore it because it's trust theoretical

102
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:41,938
stuff

103
00:04:41,939 --> 00:04:45,610
that was so idea reacted tools always
thought about okay

104
00:04:45,610 --> 00:04:49,429
softer techs are nothing new with their
own widely known that those somewhat

105
00:04:49,429 --> 00:04:52,409
uncomfortable protocols can be attacked
very easily

106
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:56,639
but i will be will try to do is soooo
close the gap between between a tear

107
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:57,639
ethical

108
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:01,720
attacks and uh... provide the preppy
practical tools for that so you can

109
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,789
perform these attacks in the news ebay

110
00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:08,699
so you can show this to customers okay
here's the problem model one two three

111
00:05:08,699 --> 00:05:11,209
mosque legs or arms or some commands

112
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:12,169
and i'm not

113
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:15,799
i can redirect traffic project some

114
00:05:15,799 --> 00:05:17,659
awesome rogers one hour

115
00:05:17,659 --> 00:05:21,180
so that's the reason why we part

116
00:05:21,180 --> 00:05:23,490
providing new tool for that attacked

117
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:26,370
to close the gap between the theoretical
attacks

118
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:33,370
many basic research attacks aren't a
practical stuff make them

119
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:40,710
and respect us this is a tax we're not
just a radical if you can show them

120
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:44,388
today i'm so in one or two minutes can
perform an attack you'll just expendable

121
00:05:44,389 --> 00:05:47,029
grade that's your problem

122
00:05:47,029 --> 00:05:49,940
most likely james to staff

123
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:54,010
there are some tools at the same in the
pasta one very popular too

124
00:05:54,010 --> 00:05:56,469
la many from a few

125
00:05:56,469 --> 00:06:00,520
i'm sure some of whom notice will go to
cocaine a novel

126
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:03,020
and the pretty much change today

127
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,258
poem

128
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:08,110
people look at some special effects
because so since the release of

129
00:06:08,110 --> 00:06:09,970
that kind of towards that x

130
00:06:09,970 --> 00:06:12,350
can easily be performed everybody

131
00:06:12,350 --> 00:06:16,009
you don't even have to know a pic

132
00:06:16,009 --> 00:06:19,860
breaks in the background because it just
test so and to some information press a

133
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,490
button and then

134
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:24,989
that they caused by the don't ask even
to understand what's going on

135
00:06:24,989 --> 00:06:27,229
on in the background

136
00:06:27,229 --> 00:06:30,359
so relief that this works

137
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:32,709
changed lot of things fall

138
00:06:32,709 --> 00:06:37,379
of people or custom marsala people are
looking on

139
00:06:37,379 --> 00:06:37,930
are

140
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,919
on one of images if they'll practicality

141
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:42,280
doable if they're very

142
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:45,599
well it's just too radical stuff
somebody's telling your canada is a

143
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:46,729
problem but

144
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:51,938
just not to listen away no easy way to
exploit these were abilities

145
00:06:51,939 --> 00:06:56,460
travel there so there are two incomes in
two places home

146
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,120
because of the loki

147
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:00,650
and i will tell you some

148
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,709
saying about this will not

149
00:07:02,709 --> 00:07:07,699
so chest to complete his assigned us a
small home a few of

150
00:07:07,699 --> 00:07:09,889
tools are only exist in the wild

151
00:07:09,889 --> 00:07:12,629
that can do similar things but most of
them

152
00:07:12,629 --> 00:07:14,460
huh

153
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:18,680
already complicated to use and as such
we called you a process for the old

154
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,190
already

155
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:21,389
um... which can

156
00:07:21,389 --> 00:07:25,990
and the sun routing protocols also about
mostly only in discovery mode so

157
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:28,710
it shows is some information on what

158
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,770
throttle protocol implemented and i've
met burt

159
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:36,049
for the crimes act if she's quite
something

160
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:39,879
and i don't really great tool this study
is in young it's mainly

161
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:44,419
uh... ridgeway led to expats on i'm sure

162
00:07:44,419 --> 00:07:47,429
at least some of you alls modus tools

163
00:07:47,429 --> 00:07:50,299
that's also one of the tools that pretty
much the

164
00:07:50,299 --> 00:07:54,258
changed lots of saying so close the gap
between juridical attacks and uh...

165
00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:55,300
practical effects

166
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:59,160
because made use of the fire about
before the mowing deep details are

167
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,909
writing complicated scripts whatever

168
00:08:01,909 --> 00:08:06,270
uh... some other told songs like
educating nemesis escapee

169
00:08:06,270 --> 00:08:09,258
they don't know if you noticed was fired

170
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:13,089
may want to answer where youth scape
into pretty much all for cool you can

171
00:08:13,089 --> 00:08:15,969
use a lot of raja protocols also with
that thought

172
00:08:15,969 --> 00:08:19,780
it doesn't hurt him in any state machine
so it is still have to write

173
00:08:19,780 --> 00:08:21,109
complicated scripts

174
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,490
all maternal specialized attacks

175
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,730
an f_ immersed jeff in

176
00:08:25,730 --> 00:08:29,449
good afternoon miss much time to make
them

177
00:08:29,449 --> 00:08:30,770
some integrity

178
00:08:30,770 --> 00:08:33,699
you can do it with that but it's pretty
complicated you have to write scripts

179
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,550
and all that stuff

180
00:08:34,549 --> 00:08:38,809
but it's not easy to use

181
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:42,729
uh... better tower belonging

182
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,680
legislation provides only provides some

183
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:46,160
on

184
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,360
and we are

185
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:50,520
also you can easily use it you don't
have to use our common in the face at

186
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:52,550
all

187
00:08:52,550 --> 00:08:57,229
the initial idea you might know he was
subsequent by and some of our own

188
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,040
written

189
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:59,379
kamon trend towards

190
00:08:59,379 --> 00:09:02,300
mature already released in the past for
example

191
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:05,790
of one woman two years ago then you and
then released a

192
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:10,180
who had to talk about their kid has to
be gpc puritan also raised some audience

193
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:12,050
look month rent will spot

194
00:09:12,050 --> 00:09:16,290
still not just say they're not u_s_
pretty much because may be too

195
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,920
complicated to use them

196
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,060
it's not easy to trust so

197
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,449
revenues fell over

198
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:24,610
clicked some buttons and perform a text

199
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:28,320
so the initial idea was to just combine
these tools in them

200
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,690
and then

201
00:09:29,690 --> 00:09:35,260
let's call it the infrastructure proper
contexts weeds uh... home

202
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:39,550
combined is seven easy glued to was
small band makes who's more usable so

203
00:09:39,550 --> 00:09:42,329
the people also use it because uh...

204
00:09:42,330 --> 00:09:46,490
driving school nobody also want the
people to use the tool

205
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:49,160
miles with your spent lots of time

206
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:49,980
collectibles

207
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:54,340
in the meantime it's not just a
collection of other tools

208
00:09:54,340 --> 00:09:56,560
implemented again in the street

209
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,170
edsel

210
00:09:58,170 --> 00:10:01,860
lots of a lot of more in the meantime
could soar as a model architect to

211
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:05,580
daniel does something about the modern
architecture major

212
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:09,500
so you can easily implemented new
attacks that you're out and protocols

213
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:12,520
uh... are able to use

214
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,689
some low-key modules mission on the
modules

215
00:10:15,689 --> 00:10:16,990
for example

216
00:10:16,990 --> 00:10:21,690
use some ninety-five trek module to are
correct your invoice bear fronting for

217
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:25,130
the court indication passed on to
something like that

218
00:10:25,130 --> 00:10:28,150
so we can combine different modules on
that stuff

219
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:31,360
there's also a lot of protocols
implemented already they are already

220
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,000
working really find will see that some
slides later

221
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,680
for because they are

222
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,510
nearly every part of collison
infrastructure comical on some of them

223
00:10:40,510 --> 00:10:42,400
hard

224
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:46,170
alexei laying there on market was
extended warranty but we still estimate

225
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:47,939
that more deals because starr

226
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,619
the other motives depend on that

227
00:10:49,619 --> 00:10:51,700
so you don't have to fire up a

228
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:55,100
command-line and love spoofing the
background before you can actually

229
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:56,560
perform another check

230
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:00,589
so the ones edsel low-keyed tour

231
00:11:00,590 --> 00:11:03,350
be able to

232
00:11:03,350 --> 00:11:07,310
perform the whole attack of itself don't
need any other tools and mark

233
00:11:07,310 --> 00:11:09,839
at least for that kind of attack

234
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:14,260
uh... lagi also includes a new russian
office will call them p last when it was

235
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,830
also really is better

236
00:11:15,830 --> 00:11:20,730
lekha talk in the past coloring appear
less uh... security

237
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,700
misunderstanding to different that's not
that's the only problem of implemented

238
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:24,570
this uh...

239
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,950
as module if they're not true

240
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:28,070
on

241
00:11:28,070 --> 00:11:31,440
poses a special reason though that i
will tell you about that later but if

242
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,059
you install the low-key you also have
four

243
00:11:34,059 --> 00:11:39,290
this requirement is so awesome

244
00:11:39,290 --> 00:11:41,790
part of a democrat

245
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,269
dom

246
00:11:42,269 --> 00:11:44,420
so first of all hello

247
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,479
home

248
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,750
so i would be a first shot all of you
and introduction into though main

249
00:11:49,750 --> 00:11:50,219
program

250
00:11:50,219 --> 00:11:54,469
so personal level effect the
architecture than i will tell something

251
00:11:54,469 --> 00:12:00,049
about all the modules that are there and
off the wall to have a look and uh...

252
00:12:00,049 --> 00:12:04,189
and gory and the house it's know how
it's

253
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,570
okay so first the architecture alum

254
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:09,300
loki

255
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:15,849
mainly those main program which which is
called low-key at government may re-open

256
00:12:15,850 --> 00:12:19,390
module a p_i_ so every module

257
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:23,890
just meets don't need to deal with any
networking stopped on the to deal with

258
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:27,199
farm lot of graphical stuff is all
handled by domain program

259
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:31,930
it just focus on your protocol you want
to implement

260
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,719
so

261
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,950
first i have made some library
extensions to mo

262
00:12:36,950 --> 00:12:41,920
for example gets i could to boost
firewall in working with

263
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,139
with the united bottom get away from
this again because i am notice tickets

264
00:12:47,139 --> 00:12:51,690
not possible to rolled all patches to
some him

265
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,480
system libraries

266
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:58,230
or in the meantime you don't need any
library extensions and more just need

267
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:03,140
until ivory dependencies and the main
program

268
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:07,530
okay so they rock a lot of hockey
protocols already implemented

269
00:13:07,530 --> 00:13:09,620
uh...

270
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:14,930
nancy the whole bunch of lists and let's
begin with bach akhioc isn't

271
00:13:14,930 --> 00:13:15,870
anything you

272
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:21,280
there are more a bunch of tools cleanup
spoofing bypass renny mentioned on

273
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:25,800
implemented it as well just to give
uh... the sweet and which would fit and

274
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:29,430
perform the whole attack from the salt
to the beginning beginning

275
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:32,930
and if you need to be in some kind of
man the mill position too

276
00:13:32,930 --> 00:13:37,800
performed some attack on the rotting
further called you can use of this well

277
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:43,359
so i mean there are two modules the the
edgy api and the w house if you want

278
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:46,690
which are not released yet because there
are some

279
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:50,360
legal issues with from cisco on that
proper calls

280
00:13:50,360 --> 00:13:56,760
because of the idea p and w c_p_r_ pple
cisco proprietary on don't get ccp there

281
00:13:56,760 --> 00:14:01,280
is also a page and application from
cisco so we don't get into any legal

282
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:06,270
trouble the swine we won't release that
modules now

283
00:14:06,270 --> 00:14:07,480
meant

284
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:12,590
orchid com i'll give you shot all of you
of all the attacks norwich nokia is able

285
00:14:12,590 --> 00:14:18,890
to do so first terrace diablo guild as
you can alan they'd offered can drop

286
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:22,860
spoofing the can-do op standing and are
implemented also

287
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,540
an offline mechanism

288
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,860
has sold there is some

289
00:14:27,860 --> 00:14:33,250
module for p if the which is a brand-new
protocol the r_c_ just showed up

290
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:36,430
uh... begin offering june

291
00:14:36,430 --> 00:14:38,319
uh... which is

292
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,590
someone

293
00:14:39,590 --> 00:14:42,050
and from a call for doing that aren't

294
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:46,199
hot standby arun failover mechanism
renny will tell you something more about

295
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:48,640
that for holy crap

296
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:52,309
uh... ok are also implementa the

297
00:14:52,309 --> 00:14:57,899
bcp impart of mile tool the beach pcl
iight david's crack graphical user

298
00:14:57,899 --> 00:14:58,459
interface

299
00:14:58,459 --> 00:15:00,569
so you can do

300
00:15:00,570 --> 00:15:05,200
and ella rejection with a truly can
inject routing information into

301
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,560
and pgp domain

302
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,430
there is also module four

303
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:14,449
the aged piano which has a set will not
be released now

304
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:17,470
made in the future not quite sure yet

305
00:15:17,470 --> 00:15:20,020
bottom without madhu you can

306
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:23,449
also inject ah... near g_o_p_

307
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:28,230
kaplan's values which are in fact
routing information and i also

308
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:29,650
implemented stew

309
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:34,740
older attacks against their g_o_p_ which
are at the enough indicate the parent on

310
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,710
authenticated denial of service

311
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:42,560
and then there are two more guilty for a
just sake and

312
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:44,209
matches up you're going to

313
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,930
which is on

314
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:51,339
just hot sent by protocol forearm
quietly address us bound with uh...

315
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:56,570
looking tools week europe able to take
over one of the psychiatrists

316
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,290
so i'll name

317
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,599
there is another module for the leap you

318
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,459
bussell called lady distribution
protocol which is used with

319
00:16:04,459 --> 00:16:07,689
in big until aspect on that works

320
00:16:07,690 --> 00:16:10,580
you can hook into the l_d_p_ at

321
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,370
process and can inject

322
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,610
label napping messages

323
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:17,000
also able to

324
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,980
attacks some hollow

325
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:21,319
layer two or one p elapsed time
goldstein

326
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:23,040
and establish your own time uh...

327
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,360
and all the time to stop that they'll
l_d_p_'s able to

328
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,070
from

329
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:31,710
if you want to go deeper into all the
l_d_p_ nicholas stop i recommend you

330
00:16:31,710 --> 00:16:36,000
to take a look at all last year black
had talked

331
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,270
exactly that from

332
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:41,319
that

333
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:45,370
dot topic which covers l_d_p_ pgp and
p_m_s_

334
00:16:45,370 --> 00:16:49,170
so there is an anti last month in a
swell which can

335
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:54,219
rewrite the uh... makiel s labels which
also can't discover different and p_l_o_

336
00:16:54,220 --> 00:16:56,410
s

337
00:16:56,410 --> 00:16:58,480
traffic possible

338
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,910
and uh...

339
00:16:59,910 --> 00:17:04,329
jerry there's also like the rain is that
the uh... activists on program

340
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:06,560
which gives you

341
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:08,109
partner of machine

342
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:11,030
some kind of again as you can enable
networks

343
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,178
so you just pop up and

344
00:17:13,179 --> 00:17:14,680
virtual tunnel interface

345
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:19,560
more and more traffic that do put into
the tunnel interfaces will be

346
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:23,919
u_s_ labeled and thrown onto the network

347
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,290
okay that resembles p_f_ module

348
00:17:27,290 --> 00:17:32,220
refusals p_f_ module you can't hook up
into an arose p_f_ rotting process you

349
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:37,610
can inject post p_f_ routing information
and uh... also implemented and i was

350
00:17:37,610 --> 00:17:40,389
given the five authentication tracker

351
00:17:40,390 --> 00:17:43,309
so even if you're roberto you will see
you later

352
00:17:43,309 --> 00:17:45,730
we will have denies them on this one

353
00:17:45,730 --> 00:17:47,030
uh...

354
00:17:47,030 --> 00:17:48,730
are older and report your

355
00:17:48,730 --> 00:17:51,429
this will small like

356
00:17:51,429 --> 00:17:53,550
some kind of ocm

357
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:57,639
typing lesson on the part where it was a
real easy protocol

358
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:00,930
you can do right interact with diverse
world you don't have to do any handshake

359
00:18:00,930 --> 00:18:03,870
though so just thrown rocks on the cable
param

360
00:18:03,870 --> 00:18:06,719
that we would get into the rafting trip

361
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:12,030
but if there is a tis the indy five
madhu with which you can correct the

362
00:18:12,030 --> 00:18:16,350
piracy com twenty three found

363
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:17,590
pigeon forge

364
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,580
to c_p_r_ vindication option

365
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:23,020
so which is mainly used by the gpm belly
p

366
00:18:23,020 --> 00:18:26,690
for authentication pair for
authenticating the neighbors

367
00:18:26,690 --> 00:18:30,010
so i'm going to see one of these
packages you can also do

368
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:34,730
i work with some fruit for striking on
the passport

369
00:18:34,730 --> 00:18:37,740
there are fremont yields which is the

370
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:40,450
the rpm european b_-three

371
00:18:40,450 --> 00:18:46,030
which are also for our kids wrestled
standby and fast handover

372
00:18:46,030 --> 00:18:48,710
so you can't just take it over one of
these

373
00:18:48,710 --> 00:18:51,260
hot standby i_q_ dresses as well

374
00:18:51,260 --> 00:18:54,060
and there is the w_s_o_c_ ki

375
00:18:54,060 --> 00:18:55,940
on module which most

376
00:18:55,940 --> 00:18:59,039
the main part of our last like a talk
then

377
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,090
europe this year

378
00:19:00,090 --> 00:19:02,990
uh... which is that

379
00:19:02,990 --> 00:19:06,800
wireless lan context control protocol
which is also arm

380
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:11,040
the cisco proprietary protocol for a
building opp

381
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:13,940
wide distribution system alan

382
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:16,360
we take log

383
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:21,030
work into hannah's is this protocol and
do some tripped analysis on the

384
00:19:21,030 --> 00:19:23,379
authentication mechanism hand

385
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,510
and

386
00:19:24,510 --> 00:19:29,809
it came all the it's all based on lead
authentication and as we all should know

387
00:19:29,809 --> 00:19:31,840
elite isn't really secure

388
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,129
so

389
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:35,230
the and if you still small doable

390
00:19:35,230 --> 00:19:36,559
you will get the

391
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:39,000
palace masak he off

392
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:42,430
wireless clients

393
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,200
bomb

394
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,120
mo he also has the graphical user
interface

395
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:50,320
it's faced auckalnd jija kate

396
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,590
i'm using party to kate

397
00:19:52,590 --> 00:19:57,810
because it's a really easy into two
program and parkland

398
00:19:57,810 --> 00:20:02,649
i don't like should you can see into
place it's a pain in the ass

399
00:20:02,650 --> 00:20:03,770
wrong

400
00:20:03,770 --> 00:20:05,110
student program

401
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,010
passed some popular vote

402
00:20:07,010 --> 00:20:10,280
jiji kidhu tu k of window routines which
are

403
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:13,389
and the main window there is a
configuration we know there's a lot

404
00:20:13,390 --> 00:20:14,840
window and stuff like that

405
00:20:14,840 --> 00:20:17,050
but the modules themself

406
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:20,270
uh... i decided to use late for the task

407
00:20:20,270 --> 00:20:23,770
because with late you can use the
designer in the face and click a button

408
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:25,070
here iclicker

409
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:28,790
some input line they ran off the water
will get a nice xml file and that will

410
00:20:28,790 --> 00:20:29,759
be

411
00:20:29,759 --> 00:20:30,940
possum runtime

412
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:35,580
but that means also that you can change
yumaed you would do it on the run time

413
00:20:35,580 --> 00:20:36,699
patent

414
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:40,000
yeah let's say under on time off the
main program you always have to agree

415
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:40,670
loads

416
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:45,860
the whole module to get the new perfetti
isn't the place but its really easy to

417
00:20:45,860 --> 00:20:50,500
and wolf all new modules as they can be
real ordered on runtime

418
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:53,650
and so it's really easy to

419
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:56,610
fix sandbox or do some testing arms

420
00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:01,879
prudence in your coat

421
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:05,990
must streams of low-key but you will see
it in on the

422
00:21:05,990 --> 00:21:08,430
action intersect

423
00:21:08,430 --> 00:21:14,500
apollo handlebar to ready again

424
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:19,000
for aside then you know that as you can
see there are lots of part except amend

425
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:21,049
it already in different modules

426
00:21:21,049 --> 00:21:28,049
along with some of them to come in today
that the

427
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:32,130
listed what color because there are
already colin and i will talk scientists

428
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:33,870
up just in to credit

429
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:36,949
clever more usable to

430
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:40,670
we told you lots of riff that model if
that were on the left at what about the

431
00:21:40,670 --> 00:21:41,289
uh...

432
00:21:41,289 --> 00:21:45,440
okay what can we do what kind of but
extended to moved further thought who

433
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,520
also wants

434
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:52,030
for some reason why soups and warm the
technological call a benefit that

435
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:54,360
dresser someone cannot afford

436
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:56,330
attacking raj protocol

437
00:21:56,330 --> 00:22:01,169
so to give you an idea about that let's
do not official discussion of some after

438
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:03,930
some of that excite implemented in
located

439
00:22:03,930 --> 00:22:04,990
uh...

440
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:05,999
that's s

441
00:22:05,999 --> 00:22:09,210
just a possible to call them

442
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:11,700
and circumstantial

443
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:16,850
so arm i don't know how deep are you are
in school network protocols project

444
00:22:16,850 --> 00:22:18,428
protocols so whatever

445
00:22:18,429 --> 00:22:18,859
solo

446
00:22:18,859 --> 00:22:21,320
i will give you a solo if you about that

447
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:23,539
roger prodding particles in general

448
00:22:23,539 --> 00:22:28,500
i'll use between never brought us to
exchange information about the connected

449
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:29,830
met her it's about

450
00:22:29,830 --> 00:22:32,389
how they can reach other net birds

451
00:22:32,390 --> 00:22:37,360
of father magnets are way for example if
it's a conduction forum for another

452
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:39,120
ought to use this one too

453
00:22:39,120 --> 00:22:40,149
reach on that

454
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:45,090
so brought improbable as do this dynamic
early so they can ek baar baar link

455
00:22:45,090 --> 00:22:49,449
facial if an interface based on a lot
lines broken contests which over to

456
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:55,240
another one so the network still
reachable

457
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:59,070
two kinds of fraud saying that you can
use this monitor if you can use steady

458
00:22:59,070 --> 00:23:03,279
growth by the large networks of several
hundred several sultans of notes of

459
00:23:03,279 --> 00:23:04,510
progress of metrics

460
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:07,280
the kind you assist eddy crawled so it
would be

461
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:12,000
really pains that you know if you need
some protocol are handling urology

462
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:14,140
information that that information

463
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,880
that's suffering

464
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:20,070
unfortunately the internet with not the
american refund russian articles

465
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:25,050
so their defense flavors of rotting
protocols for style the interrogated

466
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:27,899
project proposal interrogated protocols

467
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:29,910
also decided pm

468
00:23:29,910 --> 00:23:32,930
they're mainly used in zags

469
00:23:32,930 --> 00:23:35,080
so-called onto mama systems

470
00:23:35,080 --> 00:23:39,750
on so you would find protocols like this
inside a corporate network for example

471
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,670
mountain

472
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:41,340
any

473
00:23:41,340 --> 00:23:43,490
scada frederick and usa

474
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:47,620
this whether it's one of the most famous
of these kinds of protocol sealaska

475
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:48,229
module

476
00:23:48,230 --> 00:23:49,320
if u

477
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:54,020
go to a website ten different uh... big
mavericks who find that at least five

478
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,510
six seven times

479
00:23:56,510 --> 00:23:58,280
using those pictures emotional

480
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,350

481
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:02,168
corporate networks inside

482
00:24:02,169 --> 00:24:04,710
those metrics

483
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:08,450
we don't communicate this interrogated

jessup mainly want to take a protocol
it's called pgp

488
00:24:22,149 --> 00:24:24,178
the internet users uses

489
00:24:24,179 --> 00:24:26,690
use it to exchange so

490
00:24:26,690 --> 00:24:30,670
information about the connecting that
hurts so they can be reached really okay

491
00:24:30,670 --> 00:24:34,890
that's all talk with senator serologist
texas forming fails

492
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,929
well that's the wrong you will find that
the internet

493
00:24:37,929 --> 00:24:40,490
ventana dropping stuff is handled by the
cheeky

494
00:24:40,490 --> 00:24:44,570
and some really loves corporate networks
you can also find be cheap eats some

495
00:24:44,570 --> 00:24:45,779
guys uh...

496
00:24:45,779 --> 00:24:49,869
implement this also lol using this kind
of interrogated protocol in his speech

516
00:25:44,750 --> 00:25:48,410
uh... so if you don't have to buy the
pastor last night's bette midler justice

517
00:25:48,410 --> 00:25:50,159
mister archer level

518
00:25:50,159 --> 00:25:51,870
managed to get the traffic dept

519
00:25:51,870 --> 00:25:53,879
as a deadly apec itself

520
00:25:53,880 --> 00:25:55,650
uh...

521
00:25:55,650 --> 00:25:56,520
services

522
00:25:56,520 --> 00:25:59,360
yeah pretty much distance vector

523
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:01,879
red snapper it can be reached

524
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:08,610
with that's just what this is how far is
the debate

525
00:26:08,610 --> 00:26:13,770
uh... the other one stealing state
protocols of software stayed in newborns

526
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:16,080
by going to get five scientists

527
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:19,080
on the don't exchange information
bombard

528
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:21,409
all the networks they know

529
00:26:21,410 --> 00:26:22,870
they just

530
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:28,049
exchange information about the dialect
directly connected networks

531
00:26:28,049 --> 00:26:30,240
not reached using another auto

532
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,890
so the total immigrant

533
00:26:31,890 --> 00:26:34,170
all at once we links

534
00:26:34,170 --> 00:26:35,550
on

535
00:26:35,550 --> 00:26:38,340
therapies remembers and this is all my
neighbors

536
00:26:38,340 --> 00:26:43,220
so often initialization of links that
protocol harry

537
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:46,040
parts of a new simplified butlers

538
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:47,629
expanded on a smaller direct

539
00:26:47,630 --> 00:26:52,360
every participating ross perot knows to
complete medved a lot

540
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:55,809
they don't relay a on distance
information but they know

541
00:26:55,809 --> 00:26:59,889
uh... by their own if the slings broker
i can reach that never grow up

542
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,870
the other way also

543
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:05,550
won't start come with a different kind
of fraud and protocol

544
00:27:05,550 --> 00:27:09,980
but exchange lake state information
former neighbors

545
00:27:09,980 --> 00:27:12,659
what my purse i have gone back to
connect the total

546
00:27:12,659 --> 00:27:15,430
and distance vector protocols exchanged

547
00:27:15,430 --> 00:27:19,720
informational which never do annoying
although original for is at the rate

548
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:22,300
different kind of information of six
changed

549
00:27:22,300 --> 00:27:26,909
uh... september surpass ekta protocol
that's used by the gpm

550
00:27:26,910 --> 00:27:30,720
all my dog collar to see here in detail
because of the talked of color of each

551
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,010
of you today

552
00:27:32,010 --> 00:27:35,540
so it's not necessary but it's a little
bit similar to that this inspector

553
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:36,290
critical

554
00:27:36,290 --> 00:27:40,639
well tested on exchange information
about metrics but the information about

555
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,780
alton on assistance with

556
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:45,879
many networks

557
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:49,450
so that i have a kind of fraud and
protocols and the purpose of fraud and

558
00:27:49,450 --> 00:27:53,179
protocols in general

559
00:27:53,179 --> 00:27:55,340
by severe doable

560
00:27:55,340 --> 00:27:58,389
technological because of what has
already begun

561
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:00,330
alone

562
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:03,419
on the top in attacking a secure your
product protocols

563
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:04,200
that pain

564
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:09,620
uh... talk at therefore in two thousand
eight so by a cappella bimodal

565
00:28:09,620 --> 00:28:13,408
are more support the black it was always
my mental told me just mention it was a

566
00:28:13,409 --> 00:28:15,640
father who has to be to create a

567
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,760
arm

568
00:28:16,760 --> 00:28:20,490
the ross perot some that's a incidents

569
00:28:20,490 --> 00:28:23,610
on when something bad happened so
routing protocol

570
00:28:23,610 --> 00:28:26,339
but said a youtube pakistan incidents a

571
00:28:26,339 --> 00:28:27,980
some of you know

572
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:30,590
remember that parks and tried to

573
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:32,300
like you to buy

574
00:28:32,300 --> 00:28:33,260
absurd to sing

575
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,990
though you'd you'd never inside the run

576
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:39,860
armband edit some heroin was introduced
in the colin some that uh... nobody

577
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,918
could reach into many more

578
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:46,260
on and are also some other incidents
than something get wrong referral to

579
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:51,470
public almost like they are human errors
what's happened there

580
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:55,130
almost a does not too much discussing
about your brother protocol security in

581
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,039
general

582
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:57,300
there are some

583
00:28:57,300 --> 00:29:02,220
there are some morrissey all it's called
generic trips of portraits of fraud and

584
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,320
protocols

585
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:07,840
which color so can't book and but that
can happen but that's a second happened

586
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,959
project protocols

587
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:15,210
on this and i'd carefully craft almost
perfect original ability on one of those

588
00:29:15,210 --> 00:29:20,490
there are small so presentation balter
the support of proof of concepts on

589
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:23,860
attacking always get metrics also
injecting roland was

590
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:27,530
possess more proof of concept program

591
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:31,629
which uh... was hard to use and realty
expressed chesterton some special

592
00:29:31,630 --> 00:29:33,419
scenarios

593
00:29:33,419 --> 00:29:37,129
and there's also i'm mighty if american
troops there was some magic

594
00:29:37,129 --> 00:29:40,080
i_d_f_ lurking group up

595
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:44,449
my handling rotting protocol security
but they're concluded a miracle

596
00:29:44,450 --> 00:29:48,660
i think it was uh... last year beginning
last year

597
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:52,750
that's pretty much so the things that's
already happened about against logic

598
00:29:52,750 --> 00:29:55,610
protocols

599
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:59,800
so what's all it's a look at the
definition i've worn off though one part

600
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:04,610
of this error seether covering genetic
substructure protocols

601
00:30:04,610 --> 00:30:07,529
i could not just three darn but

602
00:30:07,529 --> 00:30:10,650
well everybody kind neighboring salford

603
00:30:10,650 --> 00:30:13,460
at and sop in total

604
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,210
attacks

605
00:30:14,210 --> 00:30:15,970
pads

606
00:30:15,970 --> 00:30:18,740
kind of a dagger server traffic
redirection

607
00:30:18,740 --> 00:30:22,159
but in the larger scale a typical
low-fat website

608
00:30:22,159 --> 00:30:25,690
for example amount spoofing attack greer
x traffic between two opposed to maybe

609
00:30:25,690 --> 00:30:27,950
between the sop meta-analysis

610
00:30:27,950 --> 00:30:32,650
of if you take rotting protocols who can
redirect all networks

611
00:30:32,650 --> 00:30:37,650
and not only a traffic for singer
analysts and minedu necessary massive

612
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:40,660
fraud protocols of course you can uh...

613
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:43,340
performed an out of service attacks so
if you

614
00:30:43,340 --> 00:30:44,570
'em

615
00:30:44,570 --> 00:30:46,460
manipulate the rotting information

616
00:30:46,460 --> 00:30:48,210
so it can't hurt anymore

617
00:30:48,210 --> 00:30:52,149
and so that's the kind of denial of
service and uh...

618
00:30:52,149 --> 00:30:58,658
dot what he can do is routing protocols
asin jacket

619
00:30:58,659 --> 00:31:00,020
incorrect brawls

620
00:31:00,020 --> 00:31:04,210
soul which will happen then the traffic
being directed to the wrong raucous not

621
00:31:04,210 --> 00:31:08,500
so they're all just a should go to so
maybe could be a laptop

622
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,829
and you forwarded to a

623
00:31:09,829 --> 00:31:13,658
the real world and so you can now
eavesdropped attracted to men in the

624
00:31:13,659 --> 00:31:15,250
middle of tech actively

625
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:19,640
all that stuff that needs so traffic
redirection issah

626
00:31:19,640 --> 00:31:23,520
answer

627
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:27,990
blow that up mainly the bad things that
can happen dressing reaction

628
00:31:27,990 --> 00:31:31,799
the throw eavesdropping or men in the
middle attacks

629
00:31:31,799 --> 00:31:35,280
and analysis attacks

630
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:37,139
level

631
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:41,260
well let's go to the first tropical and
the first sar demonstration the

632
00:31:41,260 --> 00:31:42,649
afternoon

633
00:31:42,649 --> 00:31:43,299
arm

634
00:31:43,299 --> 00:31:48,500
always bad stands for ropes or the
spouse first class are the toilet itself

635
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:52,420
one of the most widely used to them

636
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:55,760
sprouting from a cold since its
corporate address

637
00:31:55,760 --> 00:32:00,039
it also belongs to the uh... cut here
filling said protocols of already told

638
00:32:00,039 --> 00:32:02,690
you this this also

639
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:07,419
if there are taking injections on what
we will try to do is inject

640
00:32:07,419 --> 00:32:10,920
a redirect are all cheeky

641
00:32:10,920 --> 00:32:14,390
the beckett's for that for a metric
should end up with a special rogers

642
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:15,260
redirect to go up

643
00:32:15,260 --> 00:32:18,010
a laptop so we are able to

644
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:21,930
use of the traffic problem in the middle
of tax stuff like that

645
00:32:21,930 --> 00:32:25,170
businessman turned actually analyst p_f_
mentored upon

646
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:28,300
due to the into your sketchy right now
but

647
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:32,169
alm if you have fun bose p_f_ management
verdicts

648
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:35,960
medford the different matter it's not
only in zaidi less care frederick can

649
00:32:35,960 --> 00:32:40,779
have different types so and there are
some types of metrics for example the

650
00:32:40,779 --> 00:32:43,220
socal totally stop in that spirit

651
00:32:43,220 --> 00:32:48,110
bitches metric which only can have one
roger so all systems on this matter

652
00:32:48,110 --> 00:32:49,520
again

653
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:51,100
only half of the photographs

654
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,849
this is a possible boom

655
00:32:52,849 --> 00:32:57,829
to inject ah... other also those petro
but won't accept this in general but

656
00:32:57,829 --> 00:33:01,120
that's fine if i am so you contact us

657
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,719
proforma takes

658
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,780
within such than that

659
00:33:04,780 --> 00:33:08,020
but nearly every other type of my broker
lugar

660
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,809
they also some

661
00:33:09,809 --> 00:33:12,639
protection mechanisms servitude prevents
though

662
00:33:12,639 --> 00:33:17,320
false ross will be detected one to serve
the so-called those p_f_ aipac mechanism

663
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:19,970
this many years so if you sir

664
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:21,480
deferments air

665
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:25,580
are for most definitely grotto called
roger i a m

666
00:33:25,580 --> 00:33:30,678
they perceive some some routing
information telling the raw today

667
00:33:30,679 --> 00:33:35,160
i can reach disavowed not dark but this
road closed slow

668
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:38,490
responsible himself followed that
virtually no say there's something wrong

669
00:33:38,490 --> 00:33:42,539
uh... so he will reject the wrong time
self and prevent the redirection

670
00:33:42,539 --> 00:33:44,410
um but thats

671
00:33:44,410 --> 00:33:49,690
in most cases that that's not really
protect against up false large objects

672
00:33:49,690 --> 00:33:53,200
so it's mainly against miss configured
rajasthan are

673
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:56,650
uh... added to that

674
00:33:56,650 --> 00:34:00,720
that's the part of the first day we will
take place we have some network setup

675
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:03,630
it's pretty simple it's up to rogers

676
00:34:03,630 --> 00:34:07,390
connected with one advert in the middle
of a out that says that that bomb at

677
00:34:07,390 --> 00:34:07,959
bird

678
00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:11,918
and if an attacker this laptop sitting
in the middle

679
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:13,109
and so

680
00:34:13,109 --> 00:34:17,469
fiddling around logical to call to
redirect traffic but uh... daniel telusu

681
00:34:17,469 --> 00:34:19,139
details about the pictures

682
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:20,579
arquette arm

683
00:34:20,579 --> 00:34:22,679
what you see here now is the

684
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:26,139
kamon final one of the two routers
hissing the front here

685
00:34:26,139 --> 00:34:26,909
and what it will

686
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:28,879
do first this show you

687
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:31,449
revered rotting table

688
00:34:31,449 --> 00:34:32,839
which looks like that

689
00:34:32,839 --> 00:34:36,018
okay we we got some rocks into the

690
00:34:36,018 --> 00:34:39,248
one or ninety two one-armed sixty-eight
nap weed out some

691
00:34:39,248 --> 00:34:43,168
involved one or it's a new to dot
sixteen routes

692
00:34:43,168 --> 00:34:46,049
but don't mention all the different
routes that

693
00:34:46,049 --> 00:34:47,639
dung

694
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,419
important thing is that too

695
00:34:49,418 --> 00:34:53,518
don't see any let's say around ten dash
zero network

696
00:34:53,518 --> 00:34:55,938
so if there were default drawl it all

697
00:34:55,938 --> 00:35:01,348
he traffic going to the still in that
book will fall over at the photo

698
00:35:01,349 --> 00:35:03,489
orchid sold there is no route into

699
00:35:03,489 --> 00:35:04,899
trendnet

700
00:35:04,899 --> 00:35:07,669
i think we should change this because

701
00:35:07,669 --> 00:35:08,949
along to be

702
00:35:08,949 --> 00:35:11,579
the tendency or network myself

703
00:35:11,579 --> 00:35:14,329
so what it'll do this

704
00:35:14,329 --> 00:35:15,619
just lunch up

705
00:35:15,619 --> 00:35:17,650
bulky

706
00:35:17,650 --> 00:35:19,589
which is this nice too

707
00:35:19,589 --> 00:35:22,069
so and novel will

708
00:35:22,069 --> 00:35:25,308
just selected interface a listen to

709
00:35:25,309 --> 00:35:29,319
prepare different animals on the same
setup so you will see some

710
00:35:29,319 --> 00:35:33,788
uh... beyond politics here and i kept
different elected rep so so far for that

711
00:35:33,789 --> 00:35:35,489
the mall i need

712
00:35:35,489 --> 00:35:39,670
mind real you get zero interface and

713
00:35:39,670 --> 00:35:43,339
when i click on ok of those who will
just start listening for packages on

714
00:35:43,339 --> 00:35:44,969
that interface

715
00:35:44,969 --> 00:35:49,249
so i just see that there are some off
these taps blinking so

716
00:35:49,249 --> 00:35:51,419
it also disputed

717
00:35:51,420 --> 00:35:54,339
discover some routing protocols

718
00:35:54,339 --> 00:35:55,930
which in this case this

719
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:56,890
os p_f_

720
00:35:56,890 --> 00:36:00,288
because this deals gap thi mot obvious

721
00:36:00,289 --> 00:36:02,400
archit hum so we get to

722
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,710
hall speaking i was p_f_ in that work

723
00:36:06,710 --> 00:36:08,699
okay let's just hooked up to them

724
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:12,369
i won't just change people indication to
mail on this there are

725
00:36:12,369 --> 00:36:15,509
using non-profit vacation

726
00:36:15,509 --> 00:36:17,289
after what's called

727
00:36:17,289 --> 00:36:19,609
starts participating into the

728
00:36:19,609 --> 00:36:22,009
post p_f_ process

729
00:36:22,009 --> 00:36:25,309
i'm just starting to send out hello
packages

730
00:36:25,309 --> 00:36:29,160
and when one of these rather see it
might help a packages coming in

731
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:33,749
they will perform deals deft hand shake
with

732
00:36:33,749 --> 00:36:35,779
and once i'm in the state full

733
00:36:35,779 --> 00:36:39,779
i got albeit routing information from
the proper still about y all

734
00:36:39,779 --> 00:36:41,029
a list yet

735
00:36:41,029 --> 00:36:45,930
so you see that out all the routes those
two uh... relatives exchange

736
00:36:45,930 --> 00:36:47,379
between each other

737
00:36:47,379 --> 00:36:51,279
their own some different kind offer

738
00:36:51,279 --> 00:36:52,339
brought status

739
00:36:52,339 --> 00:36:56,469
uh... renny mentioned there are some
stop networks there are trying to

740
00:36:56,469 --> 00:37:00,589
networks are upon two point links but
there is no totally stop network so

741
00:37:00,589 --> 00:37:04,549
it looks like we are and quite a good
position to perform and

742
00:37:04,549 --> 00:37:06,630
injection attack

743
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,579
what to do next this just

744
00:37:08,579 --> 00:37:10,870
go through the injection tap and

745
00:37:10,870 --> 00:37:12,388
chapin asset

746
00:37:12,389 --> 00:37:14,079
i wanted to show up

747
00:37:14,079 --> 00:37:15,740
the ten network

748
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:18,089
let's say it's uh...

749
00:37:18,089 --> 00:37:20,699
square sixteen

750
00:37:20,699 --> 00:37:25,319
and its own rock link so it's directly
connected to my

751
00:37:25,319 --> 00:37:26,900
morality or

752
00:37:26,900 --> 00:37:28,950
i'm not really a router but i a m

753
00:37:28,950 --> 00:37:34,038
telling all the uh... most fear from
target by coming into the network

754
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:35,489
ones that these dropped

755
00:37:35,489 --> 00:37:38,240
the ming said update gat

756
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:40,788
thrown alter the oscar protest

757
00:37:40,789 --> 00:37:43,139
hands-on

758
00:37:43,139 --> 00:37:43,400
batman

759
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:46,609
in a second or two you will see right
there is

760
00:37:46,609 --> 00:37:48,080
meyer are showing up

761
00:37:48,080 --> 00:37:49,609
sold the relatives just

762
00:37:49,609 --> 00:37:50,930
uh...

763
00:37:50,930 --> 00:37:54,210
repeating that information to me saying
okay i understand you know there is a

764
00:37:54,210 --> 00:37:58,170
route into the temple square sixteen at
work

765
00:37:58,170 --> 00:38:01,589
when we laid-back and to the their
office

766
00:38:01,589 --> 00:38:04,788
command-line who first you will mention
there is

767
00:38:04,789 --> 00:38:08,299
okay some new post p_f_ neighbor showing
up

768
00:38:08,299 --> 00:38:12,989
which means i successfully perform piano
locals p_f_ handshake i'm not part of

769
00:38:12,989 --> 00:38:14,869
the os p_f_ network

770
00:38:14,869 --> 00:38:16,829
and if we take a look at the

771
00:38:16,829 --> 00:38:18,609
vaulting table off the waltz

772
00:38:18,609 --> 00:38:22,299
you will see there is a neural tube
showing up

773
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:24,999
forgot tents for sixteen network

774
00:38:24,999 --> 00:38:28,368
which points to my local

775
00:38:28,369 --> 00:38:31,130
so every packet

776
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:35,269
which should be relevant to the ten
square sixteen network is now redirected

777
00:38:35,269 --> 00:38:36,279
to my notebook

778
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,860
and i can't do with that

779
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,229
traffic whatever law

780
00:38:39,229 --> 00:38:44,230
eichenbaum sniff it they can perform an
animal attack second just

781
00:38:44,230 --> 00:38:46,289
redirected to some other routes open

782
00:38:46,289 --> 00:38:47,240
arm too

783
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:52,678
keep the traffic in-flow to look at the
traffic to its final destination

784
00:38:52,679 --> 00:38:59,679
the important point is i would get all
the traffic

785
00:39:00,979 --> 00:39:02,908
the first part

786
00:39:02,909 --> 00:39:07,059
reading it will not continue with

787
00:39:07,059 --> 00:39:07,920
next part of

788
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,390
says israeli cabinet has to check the
baron urologic garages in the south

789
00:39:12,390 --> 00:39:13,299
africa

790
00:39:13,299 --> 00:39:15,160
anticipating rogers uh...

791
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:19,029
rich if you do it in both directions
madrid is a neurotic dust into the

792
00:39:19,029 --> 00:39:20,710
brothel rental

793
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:23,040
overall gpa anat bird

794
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,500
originally based behind that brought her
into the other direction so every

795
00:39:26,500 --> 00:39:30,659
traffic between these two networks to
the redirected over

796
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:33,999
taking system in this case outside
notebook

797
00:39:33,999 --> 00:39:37,229
so you can do with the traffic but
everyone

798
00:39:37,229 --> 00:39:42,819
log racing is some sensing almost an
on-site she appeared protocol

799
00:39:42,819 --> 00:39:45,889
top priority targets of this inspector
protocol

800
00:39:45,889 --> 00:39:49,689
altered so still used in some locations
so

801
00:39:49,689 --> 00:39:53,489
according to his chin so much sexist
assault so companies so realistic into

802
00:39:53,489 --> 00:39:57,519
cisco by mister to several steps
irecruitment there so that

803
00:39:57,519 --> 00:40:01,950
uh... that's a good chance they're using
an on-site g_o_p_ as a routing protocol

804
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:05,678
while you can do that only if there is
no need for

805
00:40:05,679 --> 00:40:08,029
install parade signify the manufacturers

806
00:40:08,029 --> 00:40:10,809
so costs are the men effect rooms one
speak

807
00:40:10,809 --> 00:40:12,579
and i thank you

808
00:40:12,579 --> 00:40:16,989
c_f_o_ mixed in moment you can just a
political by then plans is goin moments

809
00:40:16,989 --> 00:40:23,989
you of those finds missus feinstein has
such a kit that you can critical

810
00:40:25,569 --> 00:40:29,849
they are also some security discussions
back in two thousand five about the

811
00:40:29,849 --> 00:40:35,499
security in hindsight chippy matched
metrics by a person standing mylist i

812
00:40:35,499 --> 00:40:39,578
don't notice anything more happening on
the topping there was no

813
00:40:39,579 --> 00:40:43,979
the tools being able to attacked the
perform these attacks which are

814
00:40:43,979 --> 00:40:45,218
discussed at

815
00:40:45,219 --> 00:40:47,129
arms so

816
00:40:47,129 --> 00:40:50,900
that's also another reason why we
implement that they're not

817
00:40:50,900 --> 00:40:53,910
amended and implemented to soften and
located

818
00:40:53,910 --> 00:40:58,899
and small who label ceo similar
demonstration to the lisbeth

819
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:03,999
demonstration but the just using a rod
kal

820
00:41:03,999 --> 00:41:06,109
the poem extend

821
00:41:06,109 --> 00:41:08,569
let's switch over to my notes would-be
gun

822
00:41:08,569 --> 00:41:10,808
so i mean that's still the same

823
00:41:10,809 --> 00:41:13,859
river rock last month on the face

824
00:41:13,859 --> 00:41:16,200
want to take a look at the rotting table
again

825
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:20,370
you will see there is no route to the
tends were sixteen amp with any more

826
00:41:20,370 --> 00:41:23,388
because i disconnected my own

827
00:41:23,389 --> 00:41:24,970
rule and the

828
00:41:24,970 --> 00:41:26,769
or spirit

829
00:41:26,769 --> 00:41:29,788
state just chuck volunteer altered iraq
at the pit

830
00:41:29,789 --> 00:41:34,619
and this letter indicates red rock star
from connected to a spare frank nicholas

831
00:41:34,619 --> 00:41:35,410
a day

832
00:41:35,410 --> 00:41:38,949
northside chippy

833
00:41:38,949 --> 00:41:43,349
silva let slums of looking again

834
00:41:43,349 --> 00:41:43,719
and

835
00:41:43,719 --> 00:41:48,459
this time al-mal start sniffing on that
defendant the face which is just uh...

836
00:41:48,459 --> 00:41:51,098
another be long on the setup

837
00:41:51,099 --> 00:41:54,370
and in this deal on the wrist no laws
have spoken

838
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:58,259
want to see if they're just discovered
some brought into the cold which is the

839
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,229
enhanced idea pete

840
00:42:00,229 --> 00:42:05,299
okay we see there are two whole speaking
and on-site g_o_p_ they're both in the

841
00:42:05,299 --> 00:42:12,299
autonomous system one so they're part of
one rotting infrastructure

842
00:42:12,709 --> 00:42:14,359
the first thing on

843
00:42:14,359 --> 00:42:16,538
i have to do is

844
00:42:16,539 --> 00:42:21,229
participate in this for months i g_o_p_
optimum system so i have to send out

845
00:42:21,229 --> 00:42:23,799
hello packages again

846
00:42:23,799 --> 00:42:25,538
both rather will perform

847
00:42:25,539 --> 00:42:26,709
some kind of handshake

848
00:42:26,709 --> 00:42:28,408
with my program

849
00:42:28,409 --> 00:42:31,799
you see in the background ok verison u

850
00:42:31,799 --> 00:42:33,489
consulate if universal went up

851
00:42:33,489 --> 00:42:35,029
which is my notebook

852
00:42:35,029 --> 00:42:36,979
and you also see there are

853
00:42:36,979 --> 00:42:41,709
routing information delivered by the two
routers

854
00:42:41,709 --> 00:42:45,499
not have to joyce and april one two
inject them in some rollup all want to

855
00:42:45,499 --> 00:42:46,388
check

856
00:42:46,389 --> 00:42:48,029
and eckstein rock

857
00:42:48,029 --> 00:42:49,709
i'll just do the same

858
00:42:49,709 --> 00:42:52,118
past the demo reform

859
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:53,670
all along

860
00:42:53,670 --> 00:42:58,969
configure and internal rolled which just
points to my notebook

861
00:42:58,969 --> 00:43:00,919
i p address

862
00:43:00,919 --> 00:43:02,929
but also

863
00:43:02,929 --> 00:43:07,589
decide to take slash sixteen network at
my destination again mr

864
00:43:07,589 --> 00:43:10,660
handled c romantic

865
00:43:10,660 --> 00:43:12,739
pollen jacked this route

866
00:43:12,739 --> 00:43:14,630
both routers

867
00:43:14,630 --> 00:43:17,009
just a mock downtown after watts

868
00:43:17,009 --> 00:43:18,939
sending out those updates

869
00:43:18,939 --> 00:43:23,209
so uh... you see one of the relatives
instantly repeat that brought

870
00:43:23,209 --> 00:43:24,428
information

871
00:43:24,429 --> 00:43:27,749
to my system

872
00:43:27,749 --> 00:43:29,689
parent

873
00:43:29,689 --> 00:43:30,989
look on the

874
00:43:30,989 --> 00:43:32,300
rocking to google

875
00:43:32,300 --> 00:43:39,300
zero one story

876
00:43:43,579 --> 00:43:45,239
slow if we had

877
00:43:45,239 --> 00:43:47,959
take a look on the rotting table

878
00:43:47,959 --> 00:43:50,469
whom you see there is a new route
showing up

879
00:43:50,469 --> 00:43:53,939
to the ten dots year-old slash sixteen
edward

880
00:43:53,939 --> 00:43:58,499
so we also successfully injected

881
00:43:58,499 --> 00:44:01,419
faves routing information into the
browsing process

882
00:44:01,419 --> 00:44:06,529
so again all traffic to the ten slash
sixteen network will be redirected off

883
00:44:06,529 --> 00:44:13,529
relative to my host and i can do
whatever along with that traffic

884
00:44:14,169 --> 00:44:16,129
specter any and

885
00:44:16,129 --> 00:44:19,629
the next time a description

886
00:44:19,629 --> 00:44:21,959
sorry i just saw a cashier stressed out

887
00:44:21,959 --> 00:44:22,839
uh...

888
00:44:22,839 --> 00:44:24,259
they're a sovereign

889
00:44:24,259 --> 00:44:28,459
routing protocols like well as pap tests
of each like that that's so because some

890
00:44:28,459 --> 00:44:31,279
going to tell you about the future here

891
00:44:31,279 --> 00:44:33,939
armpits are some routing protocols

892
00:44:33,939 --> 00:44:36,729
might have some authentication features
so

893
00:44:36,729 --> 00:44:43,078
daaru like borrows after some cherokee
password you have to know

894
00:44:43,079 --> 00:44:46,879
um... still be able to inject drugs
because they are

895
00:44:46,879 --> 00:44:49,229
raj information will be authenticated

896
00:44:49,229 --> 00:44:50,609
not uh...

897
00:44:50,609 --> 00:44:54,160
logoff metrics are really using bad then
if they are using that

898
00:44:54,160 --> 00:44:56,649
they are most likely stuff like that

899
00:44:56,649 --> 00:44:59,399
i secure cisco

900
00:44:59,399 --> 00:45:00,660
whatever because

901
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:01,229
even

902
00:45:01,229 --> 00:45:05,589
and all that i'm going to change because
of parents they are trying to broadcast

903
00:45:05,589 --> 00:45:08,319
communicating i'll definitely definitely
each other

904
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:09,339
uh...

905
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:11,940
ads would be difficult judge to kiev
ruidoso

906
00:45:11,940 --> 00:45:16,380
if they use erotic authentication that's
most likely to be a

907
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:21,469
read password i'm pretty much amazed
what kind of roads people in bedford

908
00:45:21,469 --> 00:45:24,999
password sometimes sheet of its
community string pre ship k pass

909
00:45:24,999 --> 00:45:25,770
whatever

910
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:29,199
on at the same problems that uh...
repair easily correctable

911
00:45:29,199 --> 00:45:29,910
arm

912
00:45:29,910 --> 00:45:33,509
mother that's a

913
00:45:33,509 --> 00:45:37,549
really new saying they had to be able to
breaker that seventy five fax or

914
00:45:37,549 --> 00:45:38,400
something like that

915
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,330
but as i told you at the beginning we
want to stop to it

916
00:45:41,330 --> 00:45:46,339
i want to be able to combine different
modules so you can't trust the

917
00:45:46,339 --> 00:45:49,000
open-ended authentication future in low
key and lou

918
00:45:49,000 --> 00:45:53,609
take the packages truck crack password
basement liston

919
00:45:53,609 --> 00:45:55,790
again be able to inject broads

920
00:45:55,790 --> 00:45:59,308
it's pretty much so similar for this
regarding protocols

921
00:45:59,309 --> 00:46:02,390
i'd say it was preface widely deployed
to

922
00:46:02,390 --> 00:46:06,089
some also useful if indications are next
in the show is sir

923
00:46:06,089 --> 00:46:07,690
on demonstration

924
00:46:07,690 --> 00:46:10,380
coldecon inject the whole can't crack

925
00:46:10,380 --> 00:46:10,909
on

926
00:46:10,909 --> 00:46:14,349
the passwords or other those baffled
indication ki

927
00:46:14,349 --> 00:46:18,209
enough to extract it's the same
procedure in two thousand first those

928
00:46:18,209 --> 00:46:24,149
cash payment to inject erotica ask
that's no problem so

929
00:46:24,149 --> 00:46:26,249
at his cock home

930
00:46:26,249 --> 00:46:27,709
so

931
00:46:27,709 --> 00:46:29,419
the same rough again

932
00:46:29,420 --> 00:46:30,219
combo left

933
00:46:30,219 --> 00:46:33,229
a look at the configuration first

934
00:46:33,229 --> 00:46:34,308
soul

935
00:46:34,309 --> 00:46:36,910
now will show you the company recent
poll

936
00:46:36,910 --> 00:46:40,549
the interface i'm going to tach in a
second

937
00:46:40,549 --> 00:46:42,538
which is

938
00:46:42,539 --> 00:46:43,880
before our sympathy

939
00:46:43,880 --> 00:46:46,239
person from its hero on them

940
00:46:46,239 --> 00:46:50,489
beeline twenty and you see off
configured

941
00:46:50,489 --> 00:46:55,069
post p_f_ message started authentication
on this interface

942
00:46:55,069 --> 00:46:56,879
solon every os p_f_

943
00:46:56,879 --> 00:46:59,660
packets and album this in the face this

944
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:01,519
authenticate that

945
00:47:01,519 --> 00:47:04,319
the secret string secret

946
00:47:04,319 --> 00:47:06,239
so

947
00:47:06,239 --> 00:47:08,329
went to try to hook up

948
00:47:08,329 --> 00:47:09,959
low key to that

949
00:47:09,959 --> 00:47:12,549
post p_f_ rotting domain

950
00:47:12,549 --> 00:47:17,390
with all the indication my package will
my packages will just get dropped

951
00:47:17,390 --> 00:47:18,328
soul

952
00:47:18,329 --> 00:47:21,239
of people holed up into that nothing can

953
00:47:21,239 --> 00:47:24,299
a lunch low-key hand

954
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:26,969
the first preprint network

955
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:28,950
from after start listening

956
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:31,428
more powerful some seconds

957
00:47:31,429 --> 00:47:34,349
double show up son

958
00:47:34,349 --> 00:47:37,339
you're looking for the call which is the
os p_f_

959
00:47:37,339 --> 00:47:40,328
and this time you see both hosts use

960
00:47:40,329 --> 00:47:43,539
the cryptographic authentication

961
00:47:43,539 --> 00:47:45,929
i need a password to

962
00:47:45,929 --> 00:47:50,509
and to perform deals gap handshake with
these two holes

963
00:47:50,509 --> 00:47:51,680
so well

964
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:53,578
www trying office

965
00:47:53,579 --> 00:47:56,049
just to select

966
00:47:56,049 --> 00:47:59,949
somewhat list

967
00:47:59,949 --> 00:48:01,809
use this one

968
00:48:01,809 --> 00:48:03,109
you can easily gas

969
00:48:03,109 --> 00:48:07,229
the password is in there because it's
just a demonstration

970
00:48:07,229 --> 00:48:11,979
is i used to brute force year earlier
will sit here until next week so

971
00:48:11,979 --> 00:48:14,700
hold true to their motion or put the

972
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:17,149
right past winter worked fine

973
00:48:17,149 --> 00:48:20,868
but just to show you how it works will
select one of these holes

974
00:48:20,869 --> 00:48:22,819
and with my world file

975
00:48:22,819 --> 00:48:24,439
but just tried to

976
00:48:24,439 --> 00:48:26,308
yeah let's say

977
00:48:26,309 --> 00:48:27,169
brute force

978
00:48:27,169 --> 00:48:29,469
the and if i a secret

979
00:48:29,469 --> 00:48:32,359
and after a few seconds barabar

980
00:48:32,359 --> 00:48:33,890
for thousands

981
00:48:33,890 --> 00:48:36,109
arm passwords and that was filed

982
00:48:36,110 --> 00:48:38,019
so after a few seconds

983
00:48:38,019 --> 00:48:39,928
martin not even a few seconds

984
00:48:39,929 --> 00:48:42,709
the tools fines deride secret

985
00:48:42,709 --> 00:48:48,910
so you see it a prom it secret like you
we can see in the configurations well

986
00:48:48,910 --> 00:48:51,390
with that information

987
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:53,058
are easy

988
00:48:53,059 --> 00:48:56,479
and enter it here

989
00:48:56,479 --> 00:49:02,959
performed deals p_f_ handshake again

990
00:49:02,959 --> 00:49:05,589
you'll see ok the status changing

991
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:07,369
deals p_f_ handshake is

992
00:49:07,369 --> 00:49:09,769
uh... on its way and

993
00:49:09,769 --> 00:49:11,819
after a few seconds

994
00:49:11,819 --> 00:49:13,340
colby in stateful

995
00:49:13,340 --> 00:49:15,069
get all the routing information

996
00:49:15,069 --> 00:49:17,579
i will show up as an

997
00:49:17,579 --> 00:49:19,370
mural time disrupting domain

998
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:22,868
and also i can easily inject whatever
uttam information uil

999
00:49:22,869 --> 00:49:27,549
want inject

1000
00:49:27,549 --> 00:49:28,879
prevent wassup

1001
00:49:28,879 --> 00:49:33,149
one of two features ah... implemented
multiplied for performance reasons

1002
00:49:33,149 --> 00:49:37,959
uh... enzo visited there are dollop
mitigating controls provided by the

1003
00:49:37,959 --> 00:49:39,709
roger critical itself

1004
00:49:39,709 --> 00:49:43,310
use authentication to be sooner more
figaro it's whatever

1005
00:49:43,310 --> 00:49:47,509
by associated with in the in the typical
in my amendment

1006
00:49:47,509 --> 00:49:49,860
if there is uh... multiplication

1007
00:49:49,860 --> 00:49:53,940
it has a big password and then it's just
a mod a matter of time

1008
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:57,849
from forces and again be able to

1009
00:49:57,849 --> 00:50:02,459
there on the fraud commission perform
some protection yet these

1010
00:50:02,459 --> 00:50:05,348
attacks can also be parfum performed
offline

1011
00:50:05,349 --> 00:50:08,449
so just need to sniff one alum

1012
00:50:08,449 --> 00:50:12,859
authenticated packets all authenticated
os p_f_ packet and with good one

1013
00:50:12,859 --> 00:50:15,379
single pack attic and perform this
attack of

1014
00:50:15,379 --> 00:50:19,118
i told them you don't need to stay
connected to the network it just me that

1015
00:50:19,119 --> 00:50:24,089
single pakistan after what bruce forcing
against the password and

1016
00:50:24,089 --> 00:50:29,429
after some time uh... you will find the
right passwd

1017
00:50:29,429 --> 00:50:34,049
the amount that's contributed so his
charges from some attacks of arkansas

1018
00:50:34,049 --> 00:50:38,129
for a commonly used so in carrier did
very wrong protocols

1019
00:50:38,129 --> 00:50:41,808
uh... manning those patent on such a p
din

1020
00:50:41,809 --> 00:50:45,019
along with those also hope so

1021
00:50:45,019 --> 00:50:48,428
circumvent several implemented
publication message for that

1022
00:50:48,429 --> 00:50:50,920
so arm

1023
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:55,150
depart in the process much less than we
pray king stuff so

1024
00:50:55,150 --> 00:50:58,830
assume told you the idea behind look
you've also

1025
00:50:58,830 --> 00:51:02,500
close the gap between ten a radical
stuff and protocols practical stuff but

1026
00:51:02,500 --> 00:51:04,909
no longer for the reasons i again

1027
00:51:04,909 --> 00:51:08,659
breaking records but only also for
reasons of make them more secure

1028
00:51:08,659 --> 00:51:12,299
disbelieve major customers so other
people believed that's that's a problem

1029
00:51:12,299 --> 00:51:15,419
so they fix the stuff

1030
00:51:15,419 --> 00:51:19,679
let's also have a look at what actually
can be done against that kind of attacks

1031
00:51:19,679 --> 00:51:20,419
saw

1032
00:51:20,419 --> 00:51:24,069
does not on the program also should be a
solution

1033
00:51:24,069 --> 00:51:25,160
all-male

1034
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:29,040
and if you select the solution for
problem arsenault

1035
00:51:29,040 --> 00:51:30,509
always uh...

1036
00:51:30,509 --> 00:51:34,149
mention about the operational impact the
cats so if it gets

1037
00:51:34,149 --> 00:51:39,118
if it's just improves his security a
little bit but operational

1038
00:51:39,119 --> 00:51:40,549
impact so

1039
00:51:40,549 --> 00:51:43,720
who lost office gets really complicated
whatever

1040
00:51:43,720 --> 00:51:48,509
balance maybe that's a good idea to go
to implement such and such a feature

1041
00:51:48,509 --> 00:51:50,180
summit seven out of the south

1042
00:51:50,180 --> 00:51:55,888
all they can be at usdoj indication of
just saw extractable bob's

1043
00:51:55,889 --> 00:51:58,960
amount of time it takes high depends on
the quality of the

1044
00:51:58,960 --> 00:52:02,830
what indication keeps calling two
password so if you use authentication

1045
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:05,919
trevor particles body month indication
and u_s_ authentication

1046
00:52:05,919 --> 00:52:07,219
uh... and have

1047
00:52:07,219 --> 00:52:09,380
some root password

1048
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:13,519
and also road don't forget about the use
of seeing some friends in paris with

1049
00:52:13,519 --> 00:52:16,609
some pride to the move somewhere else at
your office

1050
00:52:16,609 --> 00:52:20,880
will still bezel configure motherland
felim before that but it can be a pretty

1051
00:52:20,880 --> 00:52:22,959
pretty secure saying

1052
00:52:22,959 --> 00:52:26,169
just have to think about how to
implement that and it's not

1053
00:52:26,170 --> 00:52:29,599
that's part of implementa not an
occasional cabbage for anyone

1054
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:30,990
configuration alumnae children

1055
00:52:30,990 --> 00:52:34,049
to set the kind of pressure

1056
00:52:34,049 --> 00:52:34,869
arnold

1057
00:52:34,869 --> 00:52:38,839
whereas in the category of texas
controls the canal soulless from rotting

1058
00:52:38,839 --> 00:52:42,078
protocols have been also configure
spectacle static peers

1059
00:52:42,079 --> 00:52:44,799
so that's based on a mac address

1060
00:52:44,799 --> 00:52:47,630
so i manually set my neighbor autos

1061
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:52,059
and i will not accept any rules any
rollins and roads

1062
00:52:52,059 --> 00:52:54,150
from i'd get this

1063
00:52:54,150 --> 00:52:58,319
system and you know like kind of texas
lista que these routers camps and

1064
00:52:58,319 --> 00:52:59,300
routing information

1065
00:52:59,300 --> 00:53:01,309
i live here this is still on so

1066
00:53:01,309 --> 00:53:05,099
he would not be able to of abroad and
would not accept watching information

1067
00:53:05,099 --> 00:53:06,509
from his laptop

1068
00:53:06,509 --> 00:53:09,379
find such a scenario that so

1069
00:53:09,379 --> 00:53:14,429
dos one wrong turn away so we can use it
on campus that may be considerate

1070
00:53:14,429 --> 00:53:16,329
office i'm watching it

1071
00:53:16,329 --> 00:53:19,319
protocol cesa mechanism called pasok
interfaces

1072
00:53:19,319 --> 00:53:23,190
if you configure most p_f_ charging
process on the cisco router

1073
00:53:23,190 --> 00:53:25,429
you had your interfaces

1074
00:53:25,429 --> 00:53:28,770
to the routing process and raja process
all

1075
00:53:28,770 --> 00:53:31,980
automatically take stocky addresses from
the interface

1076
00:53:31,980 --> 00:53:36,410
okay i noted that eric idle propagated
to my neighbors

1077
00:53:36,410 --> 00:53:38,649
if it's a client medgar

1078
00:53:38,650 --> 00:53:40,339
dost menino needs

1079
00:53:40,339 --> 00:53:41,489
so

1080
00:53:41,489 --> 00:53:45,380
uh... speak both spanish actively on
that interface but they're still need to

1081
00:53:45,380 --> 00:53:47,769
activate it because i was so

1082
00:53:47,769 --> 00:53:49,899
medved won't be propagated to the
neighbors

1083
00:53:49,899 --> 00:53:54,170
and that also one configuration command
analysis co-author

1084
00:53:54,170 --> 00:53:57,369
say okay this is a passive interface

1085
00:53:57,369 --> 00:53:58,499
travelgate inadvertence

1086
00:53:58,499 --> 00:54:01,749
altogether rogers but those p always
careful

1087
00:54:01,749 --> 00:54:03,910
there on top of the column that network
so

1088
00:54:03,910 --> 00:54:07,939
if someone tries to send raji
information though this in the face

1089
00:54:07,939 --> 00:54:12,390
but just discovered on accepted so
that's also a good sir

1090
00:54:12,390 --> 00:54:16,519
madam and to prevent signs i control
swirls

1091
00:54:16,519 --> 00:54:20,408
of course you can use as a nation
mechanisms like using different

1092
00:54:20,409 --> 00:54:22,959
broadbrick also left one px

1093
00:54:22,959 --> 00:54:25,828
rock injected it doesn't affect the
whole network

1094
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:29,929
about that so i want to features ah...
that certain it's a beautiful

1095
00:54:29,929 --> 00:54:31,230
reoperation issue

1096
00:54:31,230 --> 00:54:32,569
phones have two men

1097
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:36,599
this estimation brought her to call it
swanson bed of cerca aliens are not such

1098
00:54:36,599 --> 00:54:38,379
a pianist

1099
00:54:38,379 --> 00:54:42,549
although you something else in this part
then it gets really complicated

1100
00:54:42,549 --> 00:54:43,619
thereafter

1101
00:54:43,619 --> 00:54:48,609
redness retro so after knowledge from he
trotted because of its many hundreds

1102
00:54:48,609 --> 00:54:49,509
appoint

1103
00:54:49,509 --> 00:54:52,969
or span of a little better

1104
00:54:52,969 --> 00:54:58,009
what's also along with that as uh...
hockey best pure filtering and put some

1105
00:54:58,009 --> 00:54:59,629
other excess list

1106
00:54:59,629 --> 00:55:03,339
uh... not based on the rogers protocol

1107
00:55:03,339 --> 00:55:05,119
but based on sun

1108
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:09,299
firewall rules uh... access list
subinterfaces stuff like that

1109
00:55:09,299 --> 00:55:10,650
and secure and so

1110
00:55:10,650 --> 00:55:13,829
calls coming in from wrong hosts

1111
00:55:13,829 --> 00:55:17,849
more i can just as i a m not furthering
om i'm

1112
00:55:17,849 --> 00:55:20,940
accepting out there so this would have
met for about not halt like he just did

1113
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:22,449
it though

1114
00:55:22,449 --> 00:55:25,799
introducing a new medford or something
like that

1115
00:55:25,799 --> 00:55:27,790
licenses and of course includes a

1116
00:55:27,790 --> 00:55:31,849
a trip to stop using ipsec between roger
spot

1117
00:55:31,849 --> 00:55:34,619
assume ten

1118
00:55:34,619 --> 00:55:37,969
imagine that with the increase
operational

1119
00:55:37,969 --> 00:55:40,259
stuff made it to operate such an attack

1120
00:55:40,259 --> 00:55:44,109
the and it's more likely to have some
availability problems because of some of

1121
00:55:44,109 --> 00:55:47,069
my basic number two probably

1122
00:55:47,069 --> 00:55:48,538
stuff going wrong

1123
00:55:48,539 --> 00:55:50,579
and interfering

1124
00:55:50,579 --> 00:55:55,199
more impact on your america but ability
in you met with adult

1125
00:55:55,199 --> 00:55:58,799
on our part of this was a bit of the
exhaust lauck stuff like that

1126
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:01,359
on so you see if somebody's injecting

1127
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:03,170
routing information but

1128
00:56:03,170 --> 00:56:05,230
uh... as everybody knows

1129
00:56:05,230 --> 00:56:09,910
logging and taken moments ago there may
be is logging but does anybody look at

1130
00:56:09,910 --> 00:56:11,149
log soul

1131
00:56:11,149 --> 00:56:12,269
last time

1132
00:56:12,269 --> 00:56:14,328
probably not

1133
00:56:14,329 --> 00:56:15,619
low

1134
00:56:15,619 --> 00:56:22,349
there's some other stuff more of us off
really also implemented unloaded alm

1135
00:56:22,349 --> 00:56:27,329
that same some additional protocols not
only raji protocols

1136
00:56:27,329 --> 00:56:31,039
unlikely to be our p it's be a feel of
the peak

1137
00:56:31,039 --> 00:56:35,959
uh... will tell you something about
chris too

1138
00:56:35,959 --> 00:56:38,598
so if you are appearing on

1139
00:56:38,599 --> 00:56:42,229
maybe some of you know that's that's
just some kind of first hall program

1140
00:56:42,229 --> 00:56:43,700
route

1141
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:48,259
redundancy protocol so you can have
would say f climb advert that's are

1142
00:56:48,259 --> 00:56:49,479
altered

1143
00:56:49,479 --> 00:56:53,408
this let's say i have martha nike so it
has wrought fails to

1144
00:56:53,409 --> 00:56:57,289
of another country anything to be out of
the anymore bathroom a safer product

1145
00:56:57,289 --> 00:56:59,659
lawyer just put it to rochester

1146
00:56:59,659 --> 00:57:00,729
alm

1147
00:57:00,729 --> 00:57:04,229
having their own mike addresses sharing
one russia lucky address and if the one

1148
00:57:04,229 --> 00:57:06,578
rafael seattle takes over

1149
00:57:06,579 --> 00:57:07,549
on

1150
00:57:07,549 --> 00:57:09,169
and uh... yet

1151
00:57:09,169 --> 00:57:11,368
thus assistance to communicate

1152
00:57:11,369 --> 00:57:16,599
on what it will go dear also has trash a
great action

1153
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:20,099
soviet also participate in that we are p

1154
00:57:20,099 --> 00:57:21,049
process

1155
00:57:21,049 --> 00:57:25,309
between the rajas and get the massive
uh... at all the traffic from maybe

1156
00:57:25,309 --> 00:57:26,419
declines and

1157
00:57:26,419 --> 00:57:28,400
forwarded to the real

1158
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:33,069
two-year-olds are to intercepts traffic
again so it's another possibility too

1159
00:57:33,069 --> 00:57:35,099
alone

1160
00:57:35,099 --> 00:57:37,179
redirect traffic in an advert

1161
00:57:37,179 --> 00:57:40,169
armpits really similar to cisco stage

1162
00:57:40,169 --> 00:57:44,699
has our people to call but this one the
seminars and smarter

1163
00:57:44,699 --> 00:57:45,639
proper terry

1164
00:57:45,639 --> 00:57:49,559
there are so many seed most some some
final one

1165
00:57:49,559 --> 00:57:50,519
based

1166
00:57:50,519 --> 00:57:53,238
file also uh... on market platforms

1167
00:57:53,239 --> 00:57:58,609
on the u_s_ we are p four items and see

1168
00:57:58,609 --> 00:58:01,150
pretty much looks like that you have
fought

1169
00:58:01,150 --> 00:58:04,269
some kind of toronto stifle their own

1170
00:58:04,269 --> 00:58:07,008
appeared restless their blood pattern of
the tragic

1171
00:58:07,009 --> 00:58:09,999
and their share of russell appear dress

1172
00:58:09,999 --> 00:58:14,799
alan alda clients use that dose like
address es let's add default-gateway

1173
00:58:14,799 --> 00:58:18,469
but said this brought us this i give s
as a certain there it's a bit slow p

1174
00:58:18,469 --> 00:58:21,589
address and it failed to gether won the
takeover

1175
00:58:21,589 --> 00:58:23,729
and the cat scans to communicate

1176
00:58:23,729 --> 00:58:28,390
that for that to her capsized exchanging
some analyst on my arm still there are

1177
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:29,279
still there

1178
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:32,770
and this general rather offered on seed
packets like that

1179
00:58:32,770 --> 00:58:39,140
after sometime in just a look at it but
you look at best

1180
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:40,719
yeah their son

1181
00:58:40,719 --> 00:58:46,459
uh... this also game on this so i will
just sick of that uh... they mow

1182
00:58:46,459 --> 00:58:47,319
radios

1183
00:58:47,319 --> 00:58:52,439
some kind of priority to figure out
who's a master who is that if roger

1184
00:58:52,439 --> 00:58:57,638
and the highest the baddest priority is
to tools by five

1185
00:58:57,639 --> 00:59:01,019
and unfortunately conquered figure this
explicitly the highest number on system

1186
00:59:01,019 --> 00:59:03,078
it was two five four

1187
00:59:03,079 --> 00:59:04,880
onto fifi phone against

1188
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:08,679
in a special set up off the r_p_a_ use
automatically

1189
00:59:08,679 --> 00:59:09,839
for months

1190
00:59:09,839 --> 00:59:12,859
and the next day we will see the phone

1191
00:59:12,859 --> 00:59:14,199
triggered our action using

1192
00:59:14,199 --> 00:59:17,769
the rpm outside like that

1193
00:59:17,769 --> 00:59:21,749
used to rogers with his ugly addresses
that's all i don't know if so

1194
00:59:21,749 --> 00:59:23,058
looks like here

1195
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:26,129
now this never attached palm

1196
00:59:26,129 --> 00:59:31,538
and overseeing all as to how they became
the master office we are p construction

1197
00:59:31,539 --> 00:59:36,799
and redirect check

1198
00:59:36,799 --> 00:59:40,119
so home this is still the same brothels

1199
00:59:40,119 --> 00:59:41,410
and i got

1200
00:59:41,410 --> 00:59:42,629
some

1201
00:59:42,629 --> 00:59:45,770
beer appear at the configured on this
device

1202
00:59:45,770 --> 00:59:49,279
bogart five years their one hundred to
dot too

1203
00:59:49,279 --> 00:59:54,079
and as you see the device and actually
connected to this in the state back up

1204
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:56,039
the masa relative is

1205
00:59:56,039 --> 00:59:59,299
the second problem from which is the

1206
00:59:59,299 --> 01:00:02,089
and one hundred thoughts twenty

1207
01:00:02,089 --> 01:00:05,440
so it got and high priority configured

1208
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,940
bart we don't care about this

1209
01:00:07,940 --> 01:00:09,199
priority

1210
01:00:09,199 --> 01:00:10,359
soul

1211
01:00:10,359 --> 01:00:13,139
launched its rule out the plan

1212
01:00:13,139 --> 01:00:14,709
and

1213
01:00:14,709 --> 01:00:17,069
connected arrived at work

1214
01:00:17,069 --> 01:00:21,459
you would see their response sent by
blinking and there are some

1215
01:00:21,459 --> 01:00:25,678
the r_p_a_ connections there's a bill to
the two

1216
01:00:25,679 --> 01:00:29,359
so in this actually is the connection
didn't

1217
01:00:29,359 --> 01:00:33,538
it's handled by the one hundred book
twenty and but lucky is the year one

1218
01:00:33,539 --> 01:00:35,679
hundred book too

1219
01:00:35,679 --> 01:00:39,170
they've got the priority two hundred
fifty four

1220
01:00:39,170 --> 01:00:41,499
so what i will do next this

1221
01:00:41,499 --> 01:00:42,419
doing

1222
01:00:42,419 --> 01:00:46,479
uh... a lot of peace from the one
relative to the bush like pete

1223
01:00:46,479 --> 01:00:49,879
one of these things are unable to take
over that i can trust

1224
01:00:49,880 --> 01:00:53,859
and you will see they respond we want
paying missing and all the other

1225
01:00:53,859 --> 01:01:00,859
packages got directly for what it to my

1226
01:01:01,469 --> 01:01:06,219
tamu to paying on the boastful cokie
address which is steep one hundred book

1227
01:01:06,219 --> 01:01:07,799
too

1228
01:01:07,799 --> 01:01:09,939
are worried people and

1229
01:01:09,939 --> 01:01:11,979
sometimes

1230
01:01:11,979 --> 01:01:15,019
soul and one of those things are running

1231
01:01:15,019 --> 01:01:17,468
i'll just take over the i_q_ address

1232
01:01:17,469 --> 01:01:22,219
so now you see there is one thing makes
missing parent after waltz all those

1233
01:01:22,219 --> 01:01:25,549
allies simpy packages are now on so far
my local host

1234
01:01:25,549 --> 01:01:29,269
not by the second trial tool which the
people ma city bus

1235
01:01:29,269 --> 01:01:31,238
we can easily prove dust

1236
01:01:31,239 --> 01:01:33,269
we take another look on the

1237
01:01:33,269 --> 01:01:35,968
i'll put a few shobhit r_p_a_

1238
01:01:35,969 --> 01:01:39,309
and you see the masa rolta naal isn't

1239
01:01:39,309 --> 01:01:40,420
the second

1240
01:01:40,420 --> 01:01:43,739
rockton front but this my notebook

1241
01:01:43,739 --> 01:01:47,719
which got the i_p_o_ dress one hundred
both one hundred

1242
01:01:47,719 --> 01:01:52,739
also look priority race up to the
maximum value which is to two hundred

1243
01:01:52,739 --> 01:01:54,209
fifty five

1244
01:01:54,209 --> 01:01:56,229
so uh...

1245
01:01:56,229 --> 01:01:57,149
associates

1246
01:01:57,149 --> 01:02:00,279
than the previous the to overtake them

1247
01:02:00,279 --> 01:02:01,779
hum

1248
01:02:01,779 --> 01:02:04,950
hi available archaea dress if you see
those

1249
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:11,950
the repeat traffic in your client
network

1250
01:02:13,139 --> 01:02:14,419
though uh...

1251
01:02:14,419 --> 01:02:18,219
for the arcade there are also like the
somewhat to propose them they are

1252
01:02:18,219 --> 01:02:21,039
somewhat in the case mechanisms but
they're very moved in a

1253
01:02:21,039 --> 01:02:23,369
new version of standard

1254
01:02:23,369 --> 01:02:28,139
bacall slow downtown last fall some
areas and they mentioned okay

1255
01:02:28,139 --> 01:02:32,300
issues that seem all that you have to
not a service by your own by

1256
01:02:32,300 --> 01:02:35,430
authentication averting properly or
something like that so both of the

1257
01:02:35,430 --> 01:02:37,000
rockies think they're the master

1258
01:02:37,000 --> 01:02:39,479
have to say my paragraphs and unknown

1259
01:02:39,479 --> 01:02:41,799
that's atmospheric on occasion that
matter

1260
01:02:41,799 --> 01:02:44,759
but just removed it plan does not

1261
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:47,119
not really authentication

1262
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:49,679
tropical anymore

1263
01:02:49,679 --> 01:02:51,189
europe along

1264
01:02:51,189 --> 01:02:54,149
last probably a study of the on

1265
01:02:54,150 --> 01:02:56,849
have to speed up a little bit subtle

1266
01:02:56,849 --> 01:03:01,429
scraps from babbitt also don't make a
beam on that but unfortunate implemented

1267
01:03:01,429 --> 01:03:05,509
if they're that's called by their action
of forwarding detection

1268
01:03:05,509 --> 01:03:11,159
on it's now let's say an add on to the
russian critical because to me the photo

1269
01:03:11,159 --> 01:03:12,779
foster

1270
01:03:12,779 --> 01:03:16,599
hold on

1271
01:03:16,599 --> 01:03:18,709
missing earnings route

1272
01:03:18,709 --> 01:03:22,058
also that's a repair time for network
protocols

1273
01:03:22,059 --> 01:03:26,029
so if the link co-starring and that was
erected for withdrawal certain

1274
01:03:26,029 --> 01:03:29,639
destination it takes some time until the
relatives sar

1275
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:32,969
noticing that the link a stalin if it's
a director different much limoges

1276
01:03:32,969 --> 01:03:35,989
because it will depend of the lead us to
link in email but it's been if it's

1277
01:03:35,989 --> 01:03:39,919
behind another road to the don't get
their information it entirely uh... take

1278
01:03:39,919 --> 01:03:41,348
some uh... some

1279
01:03:41,349 --> 01:03:44,879
based on the depends on the
configuration can take some seconds can

1280
01:03:44,879 --> 01:03:46,379
take some minutes

1281
01:03:46,379 --> 01:03:48,049
armed but there are

1282
01:03:48,049 --> 01:03:52,519
and some of my once they are
requirements to do the sell-off faster

1283
01:03:52,519 --> 01:03:55,249
and actually there are two critical some
support that

1284
01:03:55,249 --> 01:03:58,788
so there was some kind of had on you can
use a different bargain protocols

1285
01:03:58,789 --> 01:04:01,140
they can sense

1286
01:04:01,140 --> 01:04:06,719
similar them uh... hello packets s uh...
roger sent to each other they can send

1287
01:04:06,719 --> 01:04:10,449
like something like a little packages
averaged fifty milliseconds

1288
01:04:10,449 --> 01:04:11,100
alm

1289
01:04:11,100 --> 01:04:12,769
so they can

1290
01:04:12,769 --> 01:04:17,198
repaired a mattress i think i can stick
and really detected really fast that's

1291
01:04:17,199 --> 01:04:19,109
eight hundred milliseconds

1292
01:04:19,109 --> 01:04:22,169
and uh... special for months on the
fraud

1293
01:04:22,169 --> 01:04:23,629
so you can

1294
01:04:23,630 --> 01:04:24,909
realize sir

1295
01:04:24,909 --> 01:04:28,969
repair time seniornet represent hundred
milliseconds architect wanted

1296
01:04:28,969 --> 01:04:32,529
milliseconds depends on how foster
artists are speaking a protocol

1297
01:04:32,529 --> 01:04:36,549
uh... was normally also implemented in
hardware because softer still not that

1298
01:04:36,549 --> 01:04:41,129
fast we can also speak that's because he
brought the speaks never wants to give

1299
01:04:41,129 --> 01:04:45,139
the name of the affluent as big a
default also subrata

1300
01:04:45,139 --> 01:04:47,309
i want to be good for us

1301
01:04:47,309 --> 01:04:48,359
arm

1302
01:04:48,359 --> 01:04:50,150
yes on nafta real

1303
01:04:50,150 --> 01:04:53,369
cast philip texan lifted is kind of
political

1304
01:04:53,369 --> 01:04:54,850
read something like that

1305
01:04:54,850 --> 01:04:58,710
and they sent every fifty milliseconds
cess mpeg adjusted a neighbor us both of

1306
01:04:58,710 --> 01:05:00,189
them do that

1307
01:05:00,189 --> 01:05:00,680
arm

1308
01:05:00,680 --> 01:05:06,328
and if there are no pegasus packages
coming in for a configurable

1309
01:05:06,329 --> 01:05:09,369
but says three packages missing who can
configure that

1310
01:05:09,369 --> 01:05:13,519
baton rogue throughout the southern link
is considered their fate rocket special

1311
01:05:13,519 --> 01:05:14,879
thomas approach

1312
01:05:14,879 --> 01:05:16,449
on and that's also

1313
01:05:16,449 --> 01:05:18,099
or it's

1314
01:05:18,099 --> 01:05:23,079
time because they've got some garcia
stand that it's just two months ago

1315
01:05:23,079 --> 01:05:23,860
but uh...

1316
01:05:23,860 --> 01:05:27,660
then you're just retro somber sunblock
and so i guess in your new protocol you

1317
01:05:27,660 --> 01:05:29,288
haven't heard

1318
01:05:29,289 --> 01:05:32,519
dropping for the calls in just a looked
at the packet former dollars easy and

1319
01:05:32,519 --> 01:05:33,508
uh...

1320
01:05:33,509 --> 01:05:35,340
book three or four hours later

1321
01:05:35,340 --> 01:05:36,869
it was implemented

1322
01:05:36,869 --> 01:05:40,439
thought we were probably not find it in
the white already because it's a

1323
01:05:40,439 --> 01:05:41,558
previous stand that

1324
01:05:41,559 --> 01:05:44,749
by the bristol shows will show up in
some

1325
01:05:44,749 --> 01:05:47,198
arm environments having

1326
01:05:47,199 --> 01:05:49,440
hi requirements if a law

1327
01:05:49,440 --> 01:05:55,279
times which cannot tolerate uh... duncan
from a minute dot something like that

1328
01:05:55,279 --> 01:05:58,199
most likely this tropical show up there

1329
01:05:58,199 --> 01:06:04,289
low-key kind of the syntax to it

1330
01:06:04,289 --> 01:06:08,889
so what's going on with locate locate
this uh... still broken program so they

1331
01:06:08,889 --> 01:06:09,999
are

1332
01:06:09,999 --> 01:06:14,519
although there are lots of protocols
already implemented though

1333
01:06:14,519 --> 01:06:17,799
the upcoming features which many are new
protocols

1334
01:06:17,799 --> 01:06:19,419
uh...

1335
01:06:19,419 --> 01:06:24,749
already have a to-do list of stuff like
ayaz ayaz are cheer d_p_s_ olympiad

1336
01:06:24,749 --> 01:06:25,578
tumne

1337
01:06:25,579 --> 01:06:30,239
given command has to complete a sweet
though maybe a dual also had trouble

1338
01:06:30,239 --> 01:06:32,889
calls already sapporo disappointed by
other

1339
01:06:32,889 --> 01:06:34,200
uh...

1340
01:06:34,200 --> 01:06:39,448
programs like me to be empty g_p_ a
texas friend entry etc excuses p

1341
01:06:39,449 --> 01:06:43,140
aren't there are several tools already
supporting that but

1342
01:06:43,140 --> 01:06:46,939
death to complete the state to reform
sweet tech infrastructure protocols who

1343
01:06:46,939 --> 01:06:49,428
met them also

1344
01:06:49,429 --> 01:06:51,169
and

1345
01:06:51,169 --> 01:06:54,709
whatever infrastructure public roles we
need to her

1346
01:06:54,709 --> 01:06:58,098
support of techno level maybe and
implemented

1347
01:06:58,099 --> 01:07:01,899
their sons observers of just since many
of the assignment research a protocol

1348
01:07:01,899 --> 01:07:03,618
nobody can detect this note to let it

1349
01:07:03,619 --> 01:07:04,900
should be possible

1350
01:07:04,900 --> 01:07:06,670
first troublesome him out and then maybe

1351
01:07:06,670 --> 01:07:10,059
oh who implements the hostel

1352
01:07:10,059 --> 01:07:16,799
yeah and of course italy but fixes
wall-to-wall arm asturias today mall are

1353
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:18,680
for the first time in the wild

1354
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:20,049
except for men since

1355
01:07:20,050 --> 01:07:21,460
tool or modules

1356
01:07:21,460 --> 01:07:24,329
lipset somali delicious of the companies
and yet

1357
01:07:24,329 --> 01:07:28,599
maybe a little may two month conversion
this zero two four

1358
01:07:28,599 --> 01:07:30,319
and then something very compelling about

1359
01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:34,038
the source codes palm and we also build
some

1360
01:07:34,039 --> 01:07:37,149
went to and somebody into pegasus on

1361
01:07:37,149 --> 01:07:39,739
to be easily unstoppable

1362
01:07:39,739 --> 01:07:44,259
so if you want to there are just uh...
trust science also mobutu leftist

1363
01:07:44,259 --> 01:07:45,239
revolution

1364
01:07:45,239 --> 01:07:49,229
greta pegasus and saw them in a
committed compare artist

1365
01:07:49,229 --> 01:07:52,379
merited will also be uh...

1366
01:07:52,379 --> 01:07:56,019
ministers normac resumed on the job of
that yet

1367
01:07:56,019 --> 01:07:59,948
but maybe we'll do that too

1368
01:07:59,949 --> 01:08:01,059
concludes

1369
01:08:01,059 --> 01:08:02,649
arnold

1370
01:08:02,649 --> 01:08:06,489
road let's let's call it in your
children infrastructure technology throw

1371
01:08:06,489 --> 01:08:07,029
up

1372
01:08:07,029 --> 01:08:11,319
and you truly closing another gap
between juridical attacks make

1373
01:08:11,319 --> 01:08:14,269
intractable usable

1374
01:08:14,269 --> 01:08:17,509
i don't know attacks on the list
catherine how touchy appeared less most

1375
01:08:17,509 --> 01:08:20,839
secret that that is potentially a
technical but now you can use it

1376
01:08:20,839 --> 01:08:21,959
therefore

1377
01:08:21,959 --> 01:08:24,429
some ostriches in easy tool

1378
01:08:24,429 --> 01:08:26,170
on

1379
01:08:26,170 --> 01:08:30,880
and another thing we want to say okay
knowledge positive effect is critical so

1380
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:34,449
protection infrastructure but they're
always think about the operational

1381
01:08:34,448 --> 01:08:35,388
impact

1382
01:08:35,389 --> 01:08:39,109
housing department does it mean for the
guys operating and that like a few

1383
01:08:39,109 --> 01:08:41,239
implementing a secured future sent on

1384
01:08:41,238 --> 01:08:45,089
susteren command area sing some small
black and white papers tell u recommend

1385
01:08:45,089 --> 01:08:46,109
you to do

1386
01:08:46,109 --> 01:08:47,699
uh...

1387
01:08:47,698 --> 01:08:49,839
so let's get a good mixture of

1388
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:51,259
improving your security

1389
01:08:51,259 --> 01:08:54,019
but though in sfo

1390
01:08:54,019 --> 01:08:57,219
are high enough european operational

1391
01:08:57,219 --> 01:08:59,080
successes

1392
01:08:59,080 --> 01:09:03,370
and although baltimore cause
infrastructure module

1393
01:09:03,370 --> 01:09:04,469
wanderlust infrastructure

1394
01:09:04,469 --> 01:09:08,630
go often write their own loca models who
can write them in python

1395
01:09:08,630 --> 01:09:12,330
but difficult to freshly effluent
tropical but

1396
01:09:12,330 --> 01:09:16,049
who can implement other modules may be
an attractive for other

1397
01:09:16,049 --> 01:09:19,609
hashes sort of whatever you need

1398
01:09:19,609 --> 01:09:20,719
and of course not

1399
01:09:20,719 --> 01:09:24,020
have fun in the black cat

1400
01:09:24,020 --> 01:09:31,020
thanks to todd thanks for coming around
hope you enjoy the book

1401
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:41,288
oil uh... thankfully for contributing to
be a fifty pm verdict was part of his

1402
01:09:41,288 --> 01:09:42,738
diploma to use

1403
01:09:42,738 --> 01:09:46,858
arm to figure out that stuff and flow
called all summer i came here to talk

1404
01:09:46,859 --> 01:09:52,149
technical presentation depicted a little
bit duvall has pictures and stuff for

1405
01:09:52,149 --> 01:09:56,710
the s quiet conclude this week with
samples the sex of the skies

1406
01:09:56,710 --> 01:09:57,680
who contributed did stuff
